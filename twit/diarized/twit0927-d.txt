Transcript:  It's time for Twit This Week in Tech.  This is a very special show because we have two people who saw the AI revolution coming  and have some very deep insights into it.  Amy Webb, our futurist, is here from the Future Today Institute, the author of The Genesis  Machine and The Big Nine.  She's joined by Phil Libbon.  He started Evernote and is now running an incubator for AI and AI-based companies, knows  all about this stuff.  We've got a very smart, very interesting show coming up for you.

It's time for Twit This Week in Tech.  We're going to cover the week's tech news and you know when we have a panel of three  that it's two very good people.  I always I always cut the panel down when I have people who have lots of good things  to say.  Phil Libbon is here.  Old friend, founder of Evernote, co-founder and CEO of a new, if Kurt couldn't be better  timing, a new startup incubator called all-turtles.com and you specialize kind of in AI stuff, right  Phil?  Yeah, yeah.  This was a couple of years ago.  You were ahead of the curve.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah, six, seven years ago back before back before AI was cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now it might be a little too cool.  Way too cool.  Yeah, too cool.  And he also does, of course, a wonderful app, which he's using right now to impress people  over video.  It's the best name to MMHMM.app.  Also with us, too cool for school, the wonderful Amy Webb, author of the Genesis Machine, CEO  of Future Today Institute.  Hi Amy.  Hey.  Great to see you.  How are you?  I, of course, we had you on when the Genesis Machine came out last year and did a great  interview and then I had George Church on a few months ago on triangulation and you  talk about him, the father of modern genomics in here.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a good guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Genomics is fascinating.  That's what this is all about.  Our question.  That one is.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  You have a new one?  No, next year.  I was going to say the last book on AI was suddenly, it went into another printing.  It was already a bestseller, but it went into like two more printings because apparently  on Fox News, I didn't know this, but apparently like Janine Pirro, I don't watch it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Janine Pirro?  She mentioned you?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Somebody on the show, they were talking about like a couple of weeks ago, Generative AI  in China and I don't know what else and somebody turned her and was like, how have you not  read this book?  Wow.  Was it the big nine?  Yep, the big nine.  That whatever, 30 seconds of airtime led to multiple thousands of copies of that book.  Holy cow.  Completely sold out.  They had to go into more printings.  So for those of you who think you might want to write books, don't write off Fox News  as a vehicle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  Janine Pirro probably, yeah.  She probably could sell a few books.  This was the one about, and it's still completely relevant about the big tech companies.  What was great about it, it wasn't just the US, Google and Microsoft and Facebook and  Amazon, but it's Baidu and Tencent and Alibaba as well.  And I thought that made it very, very interesting.  Of course, AI is a big part of what the Chinese companies especially are up to.  It's kind of a black box.  We don't know really.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, no, that's the whole, I mean, Google, I guess we'll talk about I.O. at some point,  but no, it's become incredibly opaque.  And some of what I, I don't really make predictions, but some of the scenarios that I wrote about,  that book is like, I wrote that book six, seven years ago, is now happening pretty close  to what I said might happen.  So there's that.  What was?  Just the massive consolidation and a lot of like Amazon trading your privacy for data,  subsidizing what should be provided, subsidizing what used to be government services or offering  them for free in exchange for data.  Some of the early signs of artists, you know, AGI kind of already happening and happening  in a conversational way.  So just all that stuff.  And of course, nobody took any action.  Now everybody's collectively freaking out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We should have paid attention to Amy.  The description on the Hachette, it's from the Hachette Book Group website is, a call  to arms about the broken nature of artificial intelligence and the powerful corporations  that are turning the human machine relationship on its head.  Yeah, that sounds pretty timely.  Yeah.  Actually.  And maybe the genomics thing next year.  You got it made.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah, it's super great.  I tell people like, here's all the bad stuff that's coming and everybody clearly.  You're a futurist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and then they all paid attention.  Very effective.  So Google I.O. was really kind of Google's attempt to catch up a little bit, not because  they're behind.  This is what's interesting to me.  And I would like to, I know you also know a lot about China having spent time there  and you've been thinking about it for a long time.  But you know, Microsoft kind of, well, I guess it started really with OpenAI, which Microsoft  was a heavy investor in and became an even heavier investor in, and chat GPT.  But even before that, Dolly and Dolly 2 and stable diffusion and mid journey, there was  just a sudden Cambrian explosion of consumer facing AI tools.  And of course, the company that we thought would be the leader in all this, Google, found  itself playing catch up this week at Google I.O.  Are they, were they behind Amy or were they just quieter?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well I think it's worth noting that the language, the large language models that have made their  way into consumer use were in development for quite a while.  And even OpenAI, what was founded 2013?  Is that right?  Something like that?  Yeah.  So my point is-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was founded because Elon and Microsoft and a few others, but I think chiefly Elon,  who put in a billion, I believe, said we can't let the big tech companies own AI development.  We've got to have an open AI, you know, where people can have input into it.  And of course, as soon as OpenAI put out chat GPT, they kind of closed it down and  said, yeah, I mean, we're going to try to make some money on this.  Elon had left a few years before, it is said, because he didn't agree with that strategy,  that plan.  None of this is new.  More recently, Elon and many others have signed a kind of silly letter saying, let's just  wait a while.  Let's just wait six months, put a pause on this, which many interpreted as his attempt  to say, let me catch up.  Can you just give me a chance?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Right.  Listen, he also launched his own truth, maximum truth seeking guided missile GPT.  He didn't launch anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He said something, got all the attention.  I intentionally didn't cover it because I thought that's just Elon mouthing off as usual.  But the real question is, where are we really in AI?  And where is China in AI?  Where is Google in AI?  Where is Facebook in AI?  And where is Apple in AI?  Because it's, it's, was it Neil Stevenson who said the future is here, it's just not  distributed evenly?  Evenly distributed, yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, so again, I think it's worth noting that we're, AI is a huge umbrella.  And so we're talking about a pretty narrow.  Let's talk about large language model then, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what's.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Right.  So this is, it's not new.  What is new, and I think you actually said it right when you mentioned the Camry and  explosion is that there's now.  There's a commercial application and the moment that you get a commercial application,  that there's this sort of flywheel that gets created with a lot of fast followers.  So Google was absolutely, Google's been working on this as and I should note Microsoft is  one of our clients. So Microsoft for many, many years pre open AI, all of this has been  in the works.  Many people have forgotten, but in February of 2020, to be fair, there was a virus going  around that had us all a little bit distracted.  The February 2020 open AI put out a press release about GPT two, which was the second  gen of their language model.  The first was trained on BookNet.  I think it was like 7,000 corpus of like 7,000 books.  The second version was that plus a sense of, I'm assuming red.  I mean, we don't know, but I'm assuming Reddit and Wikipedia and whatever else.  The press release, you may remember, said this is too dangerous for us to release.  Yes, that was three years ago.  And it's not like we have an AI police force roaming around or any.  So open AI has has sort of gone inverse since then.  And it's incredibly opaque, as is Google's language models and systems, because there's  like a consolidation happening again, and everybody's concerned about figuring out the  way it's consumer applications are one thing.  The real money is enterprise.  So what's really happening is everybody's trying to figure out how to scale enterprise  applications, and that requires cloud.  So that's partially why you're seeing Azure and open AI getting together and AWS and hugging  face and Google making a lot of these announcements a little late to the party on the  announcements. But they've certainly had the tech there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels like everybody's scrambling, right?  They see this exploding.  Phil, you what is it?  Six years ago started all turtles.  And I remember when you started it, it was a kind of an incubator for AI companies, right?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah. And if we even longer than that, I mean, you remember I've been on a crusade for like  10 years to get people to refer to Google I.O. as Google.  It's just obviously Google.  And no one calls it Google.  You were way ahead of the game.  I know. I think I think I've had it.  We're just waiting for people to start calling.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you started all of this, what did you think?  Where did you think the sweet spot was for AI and for investment?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Well, so I was super optimistic about six years ago on conversational AI in particular.  I think Amy's right. AI is such a giant topic.  But let's talk about specifically like conversational AI.  I wrote a Medium article that's still up there somewhere about why I think that bots were going to be a big thing.  And I was excited about it primarily as a user interface paradigm, thinking that this could make  this can make technology just much more accessible because, you know, humans already developed a way to talk in a language like that was the way.  Yeah, exactly. Humans already developed a way to talk.  And computers require us to learn a different way to communicate with computers.  And I thought, well, you know, once we have good natural language interfaces, it would make computing much more accessible.  So I was very bullish about it as a as a as a UI paradigm.  I'm less optimistic about it now than I was six years ago.  I mean, I think it's come true. I think it is like totally possible to do this stuff.  And I think in the article even said like we're five years out and I was off by a year.  But, you know, COVID. So I consider it to be pretty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is actually a precedent article. I'm just scanning through it now.  You wrote it in April 2016 and you point out that Evernote came about because you bought an iPhone and you realized, hey, people are going to have this computing power in their hands.  They're going to need a way to kind of keep track of everything.  Evernote was a huge success. And then you said it's happening again.  The enable technology, enabling technologies in 2016 are AI, NLP, neural linguistic programming.  Or natural language.  Natural language program. OK.  ML, machine learning, ubiquitous messaging, computer vision, speech and serverless computing.  All of these just recently crossed the good enough line and the resulting products are about to improve exponentially.  So I got two futurists on with me because you both saw this coming.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah. But I'm not I'm much less sanguine about it right now.  I think like I think this is I think we're largely the hype right now, I think it feels like a mirage to me.  I think we've confused the ability to talk with the ability to think.  I think what we're seeing from the LLMs is that they're very glib.  They're very good at talking. And we're just so used to associating talking with thinking that we're now ascribing all sorts of like superpowers and miracles to these things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If somebody's confident, even though they're confidently wrong, we go, wow, that's great.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Confidently wrong is sort of my move.  I mean, that is the CEO playbook.  That's what they teach us at CEO school.  So, you know, our jobs are the first to be threatened by these things.  But, yeah, I think I think we are as an industry confusing the ability of these things to talk with the ability for them to actually do anything else.  And are you disappointed?  I'm worried about it.  I am disappointed. Plus, no one says Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so you failed twice.  Amy, is that fair?  Is that accurate?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I think that's a great synopsis of what's happening that I would say leaders versus industry, but leaders have confused the ability to talk with the ability to think.  My observation is that those in tech know exactly what's happening.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Leaders and the media, by the way.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Right. So here's the thing.  There's this. So I was at TED a couple of weeks ago, and I would say about half of that week in some form or another was devoted to absolute doomsday, apocalyptic hellscape, discussions, conversations, whatever, about generative AI.  Greg Brockman was there.  Sal Khan was there.  Former vice president, a bunch of hedge fund guys.  Like everybody is just it reminded me a little bit of flossing your teeth too hard.  Do you ever do a thing where you floss your teeth slightly too hard and it like it like hurts, but you keep doing it because you kind of like it?  Yeah.  Is that is that just me?  Everybody now knows me much better than they did before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's another analogy that's similar.  OK.  When you have a loose tooth, you can't keep your tongue off of it or you keep playing with it.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a certain amount of self-flatulation that everybody was really into.  Right. How like how deep down this rabbit hole of of absolute horror can we all get to?  And it was like, none of this matters.  I mean, it doesn't matter in the way that everybody's making it matter.  And the issue is that the more of a focus we put on.  Robots that are going to come and kill us in our sleep, you know, that that's a that's a nice distraction, because what's actually happening is in the meantime.  So there's a land grab that's happening right now.  And every one of the companies that we deal with, I'm mostly advising.  You know, C suites of enormous, enormous companies all around the world.  And suddenly people who have no background on this are having to make this is a very complex operating environment for for executives.  Suddenly, they're supposed to be able to make decisions about AI.  They're all torqued up about it.  There's this just collective like we're going to miss the boat.  Let's give whatever company all of our all of our data.  Magically, this will solve our problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of what Facebook did with the metaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I don't think so at all.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I think. OK. I mean, were you being sarcastic?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I was being serious. I was serious.  I know it's it's kind of the M.O. for a lot of the tech industry.  What's the next big thing?  And let's jump on it before anybody else.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Siri. Sorry, I just said the F word I shouldn't have this.  Here's here's a here's an AI problem.  This so I everybody's been at me.  I finally switched back over to an iPhone.  And this she's a more conversational system will not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's a moron. Stop. No, she's horrible.  By the way, Google did not at Google, Leo did not mention Google Assistant at all.  Right. It's like a duplex thing.  No, you know, the thing on your phone that you talk to,  that is what most people consider a conversational AI.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Because I think search is all that matters for them.  I mean, I think it's a given.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it sounds like you're saying that tech industry is running around  like a chicken with a head with its head.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  No, I'm saying the tech industry may may look a little unfocused.  But what's happening, I think, behind the scenes is there is a  enormous gold rush right now.  And the gold is not the AI.  The gold are all of the enterprise.  It's the enterprise. It's the businesses.  You're trying to like gobble them up.  Or maybe it's hungry, hungry hippos.  And you're like pushing your, you know, the game from the.  So I think that's what's happening.  I think that there's this mad dash right now because there is this perceived  we're all behind the curve and we all need to start using these tools  as soon as possible is what I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Phil, most of your investments look like they're consumer focused.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  We have we have quite a mix of consumer.  We have we have enterprise. But I think  look, I think just like the original gold rush.  So I agree there's a gold rush.  And what happens in the gold rush back to the, you know,  the actual gold rush is very few people make money on gold  because turns out there's not that much gold.  People make money, right.  Picks and shovels. They make money selling stuff to the gold rush.  Which is why Microsoft loves this, because they have Azure.  Yeah. And that's what's happening now.  And like, there's really not like it's very unclear to me  what the actual transformation is.  Again, when you when you when I talk to very smart people,  it to me, it's almost a replay of some of the Web three conversations  that were said a few years ago.  People were like very smart people who have a lot of respect for  were telling me about how Web 3 is going to change everything.  And I was like, I don't understand what you're saying.  I like I see your face.  And I understand the words that are coming out of it,  but they don't form a coherent thought for me. Yeah.  And I'm getting a similar sense.  I'm not as confident in in that A.I. is quite as empty as Web 3.  I am still confident that Web 3 is a nothing.  A.I. obviously, there's stuff there.  And I'm still very bullish about the ability of A.I.  in the larger sense to completely transform everything.  I just think that the current LLM phase, I can't help but think that  it's vastly overhyped.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is the problem it's counterfactual?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think I think, again, the best way I can think about the problem.  And it's always possible that I'm wrong about this.  I want to preface it with that.  It is entirely possible that I'm just wrong about this.  And I hope I'm wrong about this. I really do.  I really hope that like the thing is about to.  I'm not sure I hope all of our problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not sure I hope you're wrong because it's scary. But OK.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But I don't I I'm kind of seeing this like again,  I think we've confused the ability to make it glib, to make a talk with it,  to do something like when I was a kid, I remember  I remember Gary Kasparov, right, said that a human  a computer will never be a human grandmaster at chess.  I was like 10 years old when he said that he was the world champion at the time.  Brilliant, brilliant person still is.  And I remember thinking at the time, you don't understand what computers are  and you don't understand what chess is.  Yeah, I think that because obviously, unlike within a couple of years,  you know, he had lost and now no one would expect humans to be competitive with chess.  But also, like back then, we thought that playing chess was like  you really had to think and it was like a deep strategy involved.  And now we understand that you just do that mechanically.  And the same thing happened with Go and a bunch of other things.  Well, it turns out and this is really kind of to me, very surprising  and kind of delightful. It turns out that talking is the same thing.  It turns out that you can like auto generate kind of in George  Orwell, 1984 style, you can just like pull a crank  and very compelling words stream out of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As long as you don't care if they're accurate or factual.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And a bunch of other things.  But it turns out that just talking, just like just playing chess doesn't mean  that that's actually a thinking about anything.  It's not that special.  And now it's like we love the fact we're like we're infatuated  with the fact that these things can talk and draw and do stuff like that.  And we're we're assigning to them all sorts of other superpowers,  which I see no reason to think that they have.  They're not actually super smart.  They're just super good artists.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, I would like to push back a touch, because I think if we're just talking  about consumer applications, that's one thing.  But on on Gen A is doing really interesting things in science.  There's a company called Abseye that figured out how to  use a zero shot generative system to create, I think, something like  three million novel combinations of molecules per week  trying to find new therapeutic antibodies.  And the reason that this is significant is because it would take  I don't know how many scientists.  So it would be it would be impossible for a team of scientists  to do this on their own without that type of assistive tech.  So I actually do think it's the infrastructure that matters right now.  But the thing that we're all talking about and quite frankly,  I'm exhausted listening to us talk about is not us.  Phil, you're awesome, obviously.  But just generally, you know, is is is the same conversations that I heard at TED.  It's the same. It's the same conversations I'm hearing everywhere.  There's actually really interesting, really compelling opportunities here.  But there's not in the spaces where people are used to looking.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Well, and they're not they're not chat, GPT based.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, I'm not talking about chat, GPT.  I'm talking about a generative AI system, which is a, you know,  different different things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's related to the chess problem, though, in a constrained environment.  You can do amazing things, right?  If you're saying I want to do gene folding, I can do it much faster with AI.  And Google showed that at Google I.O.  than we've ever done before. That's a huge breakthrough.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  At some point, it's a meaningless label, right?  Like AI. Yeah. At some point, it's just it's like clock chain.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like Web 3. It's like it's a buzzword.  Well, no, those are those are just nonsense.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But yeah, but AI covers a range of technologies that are, to Amy's point,  very useful and very useful for very many things.  They're just like, but they've always been there.  It's not like there's been this.  The thing that's had a sharp recent breakthrough, right, is large language models.  It is chat, GPT. It is things like mid-journey.  It's specifically the thing that shocked all of us in the past six months is there is there is how glib they've become.  That's taken a massive leap forward.  And that's caused all this attention and all the investment.  But that leap forward, the look forward in glibness does not actually correspond to like a significant advance in anything else.  I think all the other stuff has been interesting progress for, you know, for the past decade and will continue.  And I'm very optimistic about where algorithms are going to go in the next 10 years.  I'm not super optimistic that large language models are anything but a kind of a diversion from that.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Didn't Demis Hassabis recently talk about the next generation of all of this is not needing the large language model?  Hopefully. Yeah, I think that's a very good point.  Is that like something that they're like some basic research they're working on?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Hopefully. So there's a...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's the CEO of DeepMind, we should explain.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Is it it's DeepMind, DeepMind...  They merge DeepMind with Brain.  They merge the two together.  DeepMind kept their branding, right?  That's right.  That's the name of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  There's a, you know, there's this book that came out a few years ago, not about this, but it's called Bullshit Jobs.  I'm trying to remember the author.  It's a great name.  It's a great name.  It's kind of a serious economics book.  There's a Bullshit Jobs theory.  It doesn't have much to do with AI.  It basically says that there's many, many, many, many, many, many people, entire industries worth, that have jobs that are bullshitted jobs.  Like actually the job is just like, it's just sort of self fulfilling.  It doesn't actually do very much.  It's kind of middle management.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a lot of jobs.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And middle and upper and lots of industries.  Yeah.  And they don't actually like produce very much.  And these tend to be pretty high paying jobs.  This is by the way, the brilliant David Graeber, who's passed away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, he wrote Dead and The Dawn of Everything.  Quite an amazing fellow.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a really good book.  And it, most of these are white collar, pretty well paid jobs.  There's very few like bullshitted jobs, you know, in construction.  Like we tend not to pay people to like dig holes and fill them up again.  But we, but we pay a lot of people to like fill out forms and like write summaries of other forms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he says the HR consultants, communication coordinators, telemarketing researchers, corporate lawyers, and I'd add Douglas, Douglas Adams, phone sanitizers.  That's right.  Yeah.  The people we put on that ship.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there is that danger that we all die of a infection spread by dirty telephones.  That's right.  As Douglas Adams predicted.  But what the generative large language models are doing is they're proving to be really good at jobs that don't need to be done in the first place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At the BS jobs.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.  And like, and, and, and I think, I think, I think it would be wonderful if we said this is a temporary thing to getting rid of the BS jobs, not automating them.  Because I don't need a computer doing them either.  I just don't need them to be done.  Yeah.  But there's a great danger that in fact, instead of doing that, they actually just make it much worse.  The example to that is, for example, DocuSign.  Right.  I think DocuSign, not AI, this is a pre-AI company, but DocuSign, which I use multiple times a day, every day.  Right.  So in some sense, it's a great product.  On the other sense, it's horrendous.  Because what does DocuSign do?  Right.  DocuSign makes it easy for people to not read contracts, not read what they're signing.  And so it's like, oh, there used to be this giant bureaucratic thing of, you know, sending contracts around that it was a giant pain in the ass.  And DocuSign made it easy to just skip over that stuff.  But it hasn't eliminated all the nonsense.  It's just made it easier.  And so I'm kind of afraid that a lot of these, especially enterprise focused LLM applications are just going to be like the super-sized DocuSign of everything where we entrench the idiocy and just say, oh, the computers can handle it.  But that just, that gets us even further away from understanding what's happening.  We're going to automate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just making us dumber faster.  Yeah.  Automate bureaucracy, not get rid of it.  Yeah.  Just make it faster.  Right.  We should just get rid of it.  Yes.  That would be the right thing, the smart thing to do.  Let me add this.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And then we won't need the AI for the large language models.  Right.  Like, if someone is going to send me some bullet points, if someone writes a few bullet points, but they want to send me an email, but they want to make it like add more words to it.  So they ask, you know, Chad GPT to just like convert those bullet points into an email that they send me.  I don't want that.  Right.  Dear God, I don't want that.  I don't just send me your bullet points.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you can't be bothered, Google, I think came this close to demonstrating the notion that you would have an AI write your email.  He would have an AI respond to your email.  And pretty soon you're out of the whole picture and the AI is just talking to one another.  So they practically demonstrated that.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Right.  So we should just get rid of, we should just cut, right?  Cut that all out.  Two decision points and that whole thing is just gone, not automated.  Right.  But it's fascinating.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So, but there is something Walmart, I was just trying to pull up the article.  Walmart is using a company to do vendor negotiations.  So it is in this case using an AI system and they're only using it.  It was a pilot.  They're using it for shopping carts.  Packed them.  But, yep, that's it.  So, and what's fascinating is, you know, it doesn't mean that that humans or procurement officers are bad.  It's just that we have to go to meetings.  We have to go to the bathroom.  You know, we're pulled away from different things.  We get sick.  And it takes us time to read.  If you have an AI system negotiating on your behalf instead, it just goes much, much, much faster.  And it turns out on the other end, something like 75% of the humans, the human negotiators preferred working with the AI over other humans.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This reminds me of what we've done to the stock markets.  Right.  I mean, we've basically done that in stock markets.  With ETFs, electronic?  Yeah, just, I mean, it's like Flash, Michael Lewis's book, Flash Boys, or Flash, what was it?  Where all of this stuff is happening at the speed of light.  No human interaction.  Arbitrage is happening.  It's just, it's all doing it automatically.  It's not like it's intelligent.  It doesn't have to be intelligent.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I think again, like, this is where I think we all get trapped, which is where we go from abstraction and ambiguity to suddenly.  Like, look, you know, a calculator, a calculator is a super effective tool that I remember when I was in elementary school, we weren't supposed to use.  There's a calculator, calculators are ubiquitous now.  They're in our phones.  You don't know basic math.  A calculator is going to not be super, you're going to come up with an infinite number of other types of uses that probably don't have to do with math, but it's not going to be useful for that purpose.  It's made math faster for most people.  So I think that there are plenty of cases where, like if it's contract negotiation or I saw a very, very interesting AI tool out of the Emirates that does some very clever.  It looks through like your team and your company and their skills and then figures out where they're, what percentage of them are deficient for the type of job that they have and then recommends how they would need to be up skilled.  It's a really, really clever tool that would just, again, a human could do it, but it's just faster and better for enough to use an assistive tool.  Right.  Which also I would just really quickly put in a plug for the Middle East.  There's actually a lot of interesting stuff happening with AI there, including large language models in Arabic that are launching in UAE and KSA.  And there are supposedly enormous language models in China that are much bigger than what we've got here with OpenAI and supposedly took fewer, required less power.  But of course they haven't shown anybody what's in them or how they actually work.  So who knows?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it sounds like though we're kind of saying large language models are not the way to go.  Is that what you're saying, Phil?  That they're not really the important thing in AI?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  That's my strong suspicion.  Yes.  You agree, Amy?  My strong suspicion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  LLMs are kind of a dead end.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I don't think it's a dead end as much as it's just the shiny.  It's distracted.  It's a distraction.  It's the next stepping stone on the path.  Yeah.  Right.  But I think the idea is to get us to a point where we don't need those models anymore.  Instead, you may be feeding in new data, which might be your company data, for example.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem with LLMs right now.  They're frozen in time.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it requires such power to be real time and keep up that nobody's doing that as far as I know.  Although chat GPT is apparently going to this week, they're adding a bunch of plugins and real time web search, which sounds to me like they are in fact going to start putting in real time data.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So that's, I think this is a platform play.  I think what's coming is, it's like a platform layer.  I saw a demo of Instacart.  So like you asked chat GPT to write you a recipe.  You put in your parameters, right?  So vegetarian, I like spicy food.  I've got a whatever allergy, spits out a recipe with the instructions.  And then you could say, great, go buy me all of that stuff on, you know, buy all of it for me.  And it will go to Instacart and populate your shopping cart with all of those things, you know, and you, you know, say, deliver it by whatever window, right?  Deliver it to my house by four o'clock today.  So this is really interesting.  But if I was a brand, if I was a CPG, I did I tested this.  And the problem is that there's not a big variety in the brands that come up, like what auto populates the shopping cart.  So the search problem that news organizations and brands have had and as a result, to Phil's point, a job of SEO with apologies to anybody who works in search engine optimization, that that is coming for like this, this next  iteration of invisible computing.  How do I get my brand to pop up first?  Because when I did it, I basically got the exact same brand over and over again for all the stuff that showed up in my cart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's no good.  I think but that's early days.  Maybe it'd get better.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think there's kind of two.  We have this rubric at All Turtles at our studio.  There's like sort of broadly speaking, there's two types of start.  There's like two types of of ideas of tech products of companies.  There's stuff that solves problems and then there's stuff that doesn't.  And there's stuff that's just like creates something innovative that's artistic, but it wasn't a problem.  And I don't know very much about that type.  I really like I focus on the things that solve problems.  There's nothing wrong with things that don't solve problems.  There's just like beautiful and artistic and unexpectedly delightful.  There's many of those things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, mid journeys.  Cool.  Whether it's valuable or not, it's still fun to play with.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Well, and so it's like Instagram, like arguably like in China didn't solve a problem, but it's still created plenty.  But it's all sorts of all sorts of things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ruined travel for the most of us.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But OK, I think it's important to to not like I think there's a lot of a lot of ideas masquerade as solving a problem when they're not.  And the way you know that is you just have to ask like, is this a real problem?  And usually problems that are real have been around for a while.  Right.  There's a reason.  Solutions could be new, but the problems have been around for a while.  So if you say like is like if you were to if you were to take, you know, every human being on the planet and you like wrote down the top 20 problems or the top 100 problems for every single human being on the planet.  In what percentage of those would it's too difficult for me to find a recipe that I want and then buy it from Instacart.  Like, where would that rank as a problem?  And I would say no one in the history of the universe has ever said, you know what I wish were better.  Looking at recipes on the Internet and then and then automating buying it in Instacart.  Like, no one has ever expressed that as a problem.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  It is actually a problem for me.  So I'm on the road a bunch.  I tend to cook dinner often for my family.  And I got to tell you, like on a Tuesday after I've been in 16 hours of meetings, the last thing I want to do is deal with dinner.  Right.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  So, yeah, I have been around for I got a solution.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Our sponsor HelloFresh.  Happy Mother's Day, by the way, Amy.  I should have said that right away.  And this would be a great gift for Mother's Day.  It's not too late. Our sponsor HelloFresh will come back and talk more about AI in just a second.  But you gave me such a good opening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can go with it. I cannot ignore it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we got our first HelloFresh box, I think it was a couple of weeks ago.  And I made this. This was really good.  Pork sausage and bell pepper risotto.  HelloFresh delivered all the ingredients I needed in exactly the right proportion and then walked me through the preparation.  And it was a great lesson in how to make risotto was fantastic.  And now I've got a whole new thing in my repertoire.  Flavor is in full bloom at HelloFresh because they have added some really wonderful new tastes.  Chef crafted recipes with ripe seasonal ingredients delivered right to your door.  By the way, the peppers in this were I've never seen such perfect peppers.  The sausage was flavorful and delicious.  It was incredible. The lemons, the garlic, everything in here.  This May, HelloFresh is celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.  With some limited time authentic recipes created in partnership with Sir B. Sunny.  He's the chef at Tagmo in New York City.  Enjoy a cultural taste tour right in your own kitchen.  Some really mouthwatering, amazing things.  Now, you know, we were trained during the pandemic to call for takeout.  And I think it's time to step back a little bit and get HelloFresh instead and start feeding your family  without the high price tag, without all the, you know, bad stuff that restaurant food puts in there.  These are quick and easy meals that are fresh, fast and delicious.  Their new fast and fresh options are ready in 15 minutes or less.  And the quality is superb. HelloFresh cares about quality.  That's why their seasonal ingredients are picked at peak ripeness and travel from the farm to your home in less than seven days.  So you know they're fresh and I will vouch for that. I'm blown away by the quality.  They do more than just delicious dinners.  You can not only take your pick from 40 weekly recipes, which change all the time,  you could choose from more than 100 items to round out your order.  Snacks, lunches, desserts, pantry necessities.  All of a sudden, everything you need is coming in one box on the delivery day you choose.  You don't have to scour the grocery store for that ingredient or to complete your recipe,  because you know everything you need for this recipe is in the box.  Fresh, pre-proportioned ingredients.  So you have just what you need.  Plus that cuts down on food waste.  Also, if you're hosting a get together, HelloFresh and HelloFresh Market make dinner time a snap  with deliciously easy options that will please everyone at your table.  From fit and wholesome to pescatarian to veggie, they've got a meal plan that suits every lifestyle.  You can swap out proteins and sides to your liking.  That's one of the things that's great on these address on these recipe cards is they say,  Oh, you want to try it? You know, you want to try a custom recipe?  You can modify it with chicken cutlets instead of the pork, that kind of thing.  It's really this is really fun and great.  Save money on your growing to do list with the help of HelloFresh.  It's cheaper than grocery shopping and a lot cheaper than takeout.  You can take my word for that. We could stop that bad habit we all got into during the pandemic.  HelloFresh, it's America's number one meal kit.  And if you go right now to HelloFresh.com slash twit16,  twit16, use the offer code twit16, you'll get 16 free meals.  Wow. Plus free shipping.  Okay, that's pretty good.  HelloFresh.com slash twit16, the offer code twit16,  to get 16 free meals plus free shipping.  And there is no AI in this recipe card.  It's it's all human intelligence chef designed.  HelloFresh.com slash twit16.  I couldn't resist, Amy, you gave me such a good opening.  It was I had to do it.  Let me ask. This is this is probably a dumb question.  But you you made me think of this when you talked about Gary Kasparov.  I remember interviewing Ray Kurzweil, and, you know, he's been promoting this idea  that the singularity is this singularity, first of all, he says,  he said it would be here by now. Is this the singularity? No.  No. Singularity is when machines become as smart as humans,  start designing their own stuff. It's a hockey stick. And all of a sudden,  it's, you know, it's exponential growth.  So this is not the singularity. But I asked, well,  is there something different about the way we think the way a machine thinks?  And he says, well, if you can't tell the difference, who cares?  But but I think Gary Kasparov had, as many humans do, this notion,  there's something about the thinking I do in chess that is not mechanistic.  It's not deterministic. It's not something a machine could do.  He was proven wrong. You've just said conversation turns out  a machine can do exactly as well as a human, maybe better than most.  But do you think that there's something that we do in our brains that is  ineffable, that is that a machine cannot capture?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  So a couple of things.  I think Gary Kasparov went on from from that early prediction.  He changed his tune, of course.  Well, he really invented, he called it Centaur chess,  which because he's bad at branding, but it was kind of a brilliant thing.  The idea was that a computer plus a person was going to be much better  chess player, much more interesting. He was right, by the way.  All modern chess masters play this way, right?  Yeah, for a while. But but but he really invented was what we really,  and we believe this at Evernote a lot.  We said AI really ought to be the A or a cent for augmented.  It's augmented intelligence, artificial.  It's not about making a computer that's smarter than a person.  We don't want that.  It's about making the person much smarter.  It's about the person and the computer being much smarter than either  could be by themselves.  That's the augmented intelligence vision.  And that, by the way, is the is why the singularity probably won't happen  because it's not that the machines are going to leave us behind.  It's that the machines are going to take us with them.  It's going to be the people plus computers kind of together.  Well, that's a great race.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Way of putting that was, well, no, they'll they'll appreciate us  because we are their creators.  So they'll treat us like their parents,

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  hopefully better than a true couple.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  We need to stop anthropomorphizing.  I agree. I hate to be the like, thank you.  The pragmatist in the room.  But listen, there's too much woo woo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I agree. And it's not there is.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But there's also plenty of examples of learned helplessness.  So there are plenty of ways in which the machines have.  We are no longer truly in in charge of what's happening  because we don't choose to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, for instance, if I now that I use Google Maps whenever I drive,  I can't I couldn't drive somewhere without Google Maps.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So that's a good example.  That's a learned lot of people.  A lot of people can't spell because, you know, in Japan.  So I think a lot of people who listen know that I lived in Japan  for a really long time.  They used to when you applied for a job, you had to hand write  a particular type of resume because you were being graded on your hand.  Your handwriting and your knowledge of the character set.  You know, that is sort of less important right now.  And even down to something called a hunko, which was a huge bureaucratic mess.  But it was a stamp that had your name on it.  And you did it in a red ink.  Like that is largely not totally obsolete.  But a lot of that has gone away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was a recent news story that they were going to stop using hunkos in the government.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Actually, I know the guy.  I'm friends with the government official who made that.  Yeah, that was a big deal.  My my point is that we've already in some ways given in.  But there are plenty of other cases where the question that you asked is like,  I think you were asking about agency.  Yeah, you know, I'm I'm I'm an endurance cyclist.  And I have my my bike is outfitted with a computer and sensors everywhere,  which which could theoretically allow me to check out when I'm doing a really long,  hard ride. But it causes me to focus and check in more because I'm  I'm like neurotically focused on my output and my my cadence and my speed.  So if anything, it's made me much more present.  And this is a powered technology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say for those metrics, yes,  but maybe you're not hearing the birds singing in the end.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I'm totally not. I've got I've got jawbone earphones right here.  OK, wearing Soundgarden and Metallica very loudly.  OK, there you go.  So but but but my point is like we.  It's hard for us to have the the the infrastructure conversations.  Phil said this earlier, and it's worth, I think, double clicking on,  you know, in as much as all of this is a gold rush  for for oxygen in the room, for like  having the thought leadership or the conversations or the attention or whatever.  The the large language models, the chat GPT, you know, this is kind of like  the thing that we're interested in right now collectively,  but it's not what matters.  The stuff that matters is the infrastructure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But let me point out that if it weren't for the gold miners,  we wouldn't have Levi's, right?  We kind of needed that.  To, yeah, to create these infrastructure.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, this is a lot of this is about generating.  So, right. So this is about how  the conversation is about creating value, but it's really about creating revenue  because because there's an enormous amount of investment needed  to push a lot of this forward.  I mean, a conventional search on Google is what one fifth the cost  or one tenth the cost right now, according to Sam Almond, one tenth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, so it's a big difference.  I remember it being said, I don't know if this is true, that  all of after the crash of the dot com crash of 2000,  people said, you know what?  It wasn't so bad because of the infrastructure created.  We were able to do what we've done in the intervening 20 years.  They've said the same thing about the railroads, you know,  in the early days of the railroads, almost all the railroad businesses  that created the Transcontinental Railway failed.  They went bankrupt, but we got the infrastructure.  Maybe we're in that same situation.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  It is. And that's what we ought to be talking about,  because that's what concerns me.  These the it's not like I have 10,000 GPUs  sitting behind me in the in like the room behind me.  So Microsoft and Google do.  That's my point.  So you need you need a backbone in order to make a lot of this work.  And therefore, the future of the cloud is to some degree being determined  by decisions. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's clear Microsoft knows that.  Why else would they put 10 billion dollars?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  No, but that's why.  That's that's the conversation I wish we were having.  Not the anthropomorphized race.  You know, I agree as well.  The whole hallucination thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I apologize for bringing it up, but I just thought I'd ask the question.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Obviously. No, no.  I mean, listen, I know it's kind of boring, but I feel like this crowd.  I feel like this crowd, if anybody is willing to listen and to talk about it,  because that that it's like it's that heart,  that technology that really does matter going forward.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we've been saying that in all our shows for some time that stop  the anthropomorphization that, you know, it's not hallucinating.  There's you know, it didn't.  Kevin Roos, chat, you did not fall in love with you.  That is a that is a mistake to apply that those human.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  No, but it may. But it's good for clicks.  And so all the journalists having all these experiments where they tricked  and air quoting, you know, tricked AI into into falling.  And then they they sort of exhibited, you know, human like language  around love and sex or racism or whatever else. It's.  It's like silly. It's a way to get clicks.  I'm so tired of it.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think there are I think there's a couple of real issues.  One is just to like because I hate leaving a big question like this open ended.  But you ask the other something ineffable.  I think you use the word ineffable. Yes. I remember it's a good word.  I'm going to say enough about three more times today.  It's better than Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just want to I just want to say, you know, I'm saying Google.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Thank you, Amy.  Whether there's something ineffable about the way humans think  that can be produced by computer and I very, very, very, very strongly  don't think there is.  I don't think there's anything magical that's happening in the we think  that couldn't be done by a computer.  I don't think that LLMs do get anywhere near that.  So I so I think there is absolutely the stuff that's going on when people think  that is not anywhere near what's happening right now with large language  models and with AI. But at some point in the future, sure, I don't  I don't believe there's a magical thing that you couldn't get  fair enough to do. Is this a stepping stone to that right now?  Isn't this a step?  I don't I in some sense, but I'm not sure, as Amy said, whether it's  it may be a stepping stone or it actually may be it may be a wrong turn.  And I don't know. We'll figure it out.  It's OK. We can think science can take all sorts of long term wrong turns and correct.  And, you know, we'll we'll we'll get there sooner or later.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does all the time.  Somebody in terms of made a wonderful it was on Reddit  model of what the Earth what the  solar system would have to look like if Ptolemy was right  and everything was revolving around the earth.  And there are all sorts of little spinny.  It was a very complicated model  compared to the very simple model if if if we rotate around the sun.  Yeah, but I think Amy turns all the time.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  That's right. And we shouldn't discourage that, right?  We give ourselves the freedom to do it.  Process. Yeah.  I think Amy's talking about the infrastructure is deeply interesting.  And I agree that that's actually a really interesting topic.  I think if you look at like things like the gold rush, things like the dot com burst,  things where they created a bunch of infrastructure, they really do two things  that are useful in the future.  And the question is, are either of those two things happening now?  And I don't think they are.  The two things that they typically do is they create infrastructure  that is usable by by other things in the future.  So the gold rush created railroads.  And it turns out that you can use railroads for all sorts of things  other than trying to get to San Francisco to mine for gold.  They were generally useful dot com.  Bust a bubble, which I was a very happy part of those.  My first sort of my first company  created a bunch of Internet infrastructure, a bunch of backbone,  a bunch of stuff like that that was very useful for all sorts of stuff.  I'm not sure that that the current infrastructure being created by AI  is actually generally useful because infrastructure has gotten more and more  specific. Like you can't really take a lot of the GPUs that were used  for like crypto mining, for example, and repurpose them.  Yeah, that's right. I'm not sure.  I'm not sure that the infrastructure being created is actually going to be useful.  But the other thing that these things did, which was just as important  as they concentrated wealth.  And in the past,  you needed concentrated wealth to actually fund massive new leaps forward.  So the gold rush in San Francisco gave us James Lick.  If anyone like once like a fascinating story, Google James Lick  and the Lick Observatory, you know, on this mountain in San Jose.  And it's just a guy who made a lot of money selling pianos and then chocolates,  you know, co-founded the Girodeli Chocolate and then bought a bunch of real estate  and then went on to fund all sorts of amazing stuff.  And previous to that, you know, we had the Rockefellers and the Morgans  and Walmart and like things that concentrate wealth.  It tended to be in the past that it was these sort of dynasties that had,  you know, more money than you would do with.  They would then massively invest in other things and move forward.  Where as opposed to if you just had this wealth, those kind of spread out evenly,  wouldn't have enough of a, you know, of a center of gravity to invest.  You just made an argument for billionaires.  Well, billionaires and and a lot of the companies  that kind of came out of the original dotcom bubble like Google,  you know, like Yahoo, like Facebook, like these companies made a bunch of money.  And maybe the thing that they were working on back then kind of imploded,  but they had a bunch of money. They funded a bunch of research.  There was a lot of fiber buried.  That I'm not sure.  I'm not sure to what extent that's happening right now,  because to Amy's point of the big nine, if it's really the same companies  right now that are doing it, right.  I don't know that we're going to get that much new wealth accumulated  and that many new interest hands. Maybe, maybe we might.  And I'm not sure if the infrastructure is that reusable.  So I'm I'm over.  This is a very, very interesting.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I haven't thought about this before. You're right.  This is an interesting argument you're making.  That's a novel argument, because as you're right, some of the TPU,  some of the new like at Google, I'll say that there was a new  there was like a new chip, right.  And everybody's working on new.  Yeah, they put the tensor chip into their phones and it's particular.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And Microsoft's working on NPUs as well for for their.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I mean, I don't I don't think we go backwards.  I don't think there's a world without AI.  And I think that's totally bullshit, like these moratoriums on development.  This is a great again.  It's it's a huge distraction.  But more attorney is not on development, right?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  The moratorium that they asked for.  And I actually I take it in good faith.  I don't know about, you know, I know Gary Marcus pretty well,  who was one of the main people driving it.  I do not question his his motives at all. I don't think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you think it's a good idea that we should have a moratorium.  What was the moratorium on? Not on development.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  The moratorium was not on development.  The moratorium was on was on wise gate deployment.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, it was what OpenAI said originally, which is  this is too dangerous to release.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And I didn't sign that letter.  I don't think anyone's waiting to see which way I go,  because I'm genuinely conflicted by it, because the general moratoriums  do sound silly to me, but I don't question the good faith nature of it.  And I think there's a strong argument to be made that we really are  putting these things out to hundreds of millions of people, maybe too quickly.  So I don't think there's a reason to that.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  They're being put out because the reinforcement with human feedback,  reinforcement makes them better learning with human feedback.  We are that we are they.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean, that was OpenAI argument was that's why they released it  until we released it to the public. We need that input.  Yeah, you know, I don't you don't buy that.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But sure, there are so many there's so many easy better, not easier,

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  but better ways to go about safeguarding the future and regulation.  They just don't the problem.  This is I'm not going to go down this rabbit hole, because as everybody knows,  I won't stop at like  traditional the way that we have regulated in the past  does not work for our present and future states when it comes to certain types  of technology. Yeah, we just need a different path forward.  There are plenty of different avenues.  You know, how likely is that?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I'm not arguing for the problem for the moratorium.  I don't know whether it's a good idea or not.  I'm just saying that it's not I don't dismiss it 100% out of hand.  And I I don't question the motives for many of the people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And one of the arguments against it was, well, some people will stop,  but not everybody.  And that just lets China or whoever or the UAE or whoever continue in  in their process. And.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Can I go back to this thing about what Phil said?  I can't stop thinking about this infrastructure thing. Go ahead.  No, no. But so here's the argument that I'm spinning out in my head.  So so the tools.  So to be fair, there were there were like there were the railroad barons, right?  So you can't know not anybody, not just anybody can like  plop a train car on that rail and just go wherever they want.  However, it is still accessible, knowable technology.  And if you if you if you have the right  whatever cap amount of capital and wherewithal and you can negotiate,  you can participate.  What Phil has made me think about is.  These systems really are designed to further  the next generation of AI, which is already fairly concentrated  and entrenched. And what's happening is the value creation in the future  winds up with an even smaller group of people, because it's not like anybody  can just hop in and create new value.  That's a really interesting.  So this this this time around, the sort of this is general purpose technology.  Right. So the infrastructure layer of the more important GPT,  which is general purpose technology, is not like a pick or a shovel.  Which is a rudimentary tool that anybody could get.  You may not have the land rights.  And it's you know, it's it's different this time around  because it's much more closed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it though? Because we think all of this LLM is a well known technology.  Nobody owns it.  It requires a certain amount of hardware, but not an infinite amount.  I mean, stable diffusion was able to do what it was able to do  without huge capital investment.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  You you would need.  To create and train a new model, to do something better than what exists.  I mean, you would have to have enormous amounts of money  and you would have to have enormous access to data,  which is being closed off more and more.  That's the other interesting thing.  Regulations could wind up backfiring.  Yeah, because you need to scrape all the public data. Right.  And what could start happening in Europe is this.  All of these bills, which are in the process of passing  all this legislation, which was intended to help people,  could actually wind up having a reverse effect.  It could actually decrease competition in the future because it's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the Italian regulator blocked Chachi to be for several weeks  until they agreed to certain privacy restrictions.  And you're saying that's that's depleting the the the.  I'm saying if you spin this out.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah, if you spin this out in the future, the sort of unintended consequences  that they wind up protecting the company, the companies with the train models  and make it harder for the competition.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Regulatory capture.  They they set up a barrier to entry.  But isn't it the case that we are seeing hundreds of companies every week spring up  around these large language models?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  They're customers of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're all dependent on chat, GPT or Microsoft. Right.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  They're not they're not they're not buying the pick or the shovel.  Yeah. Right.  They are customers who are building applications on top of.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're just completely dependent on these big companies.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  And to me. So again, like the the analogy to me that makes the most sense is media.  So all of these media organizations just gave like gave away the keys  to the kingdom and didn't didn't fundamentally change their business models  so that they could get onto the platform.  And I again, like I think that I think the and it and it  was a brutal mistake.  And I think that's going to happen with brands, with CPG, with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you who's worried about Google  using AI in its search results instead of its its spider links.  Neiman Lab has an article Google is changing up search.  What does that mean for news publishers?  They're worried it'll decrease the traffic because people will read the  the summary, the AI summary and never get to the publishers sites.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what?  Like, let's go back 20 years.  That exact I'm done with news organizations.  I have for the past two decades.  And this is I'm just finished.  I'm done having a conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't believe they're whining, in other words.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I don't believe they're serious about radically reinventing  a business model that makes sense for the 21st century.  So look, I mean, I feel I feel zero sympathy.  And this is my background. I came out of journalism.  Yeah. And by the way, this is what we do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, Twitter does not do any journalism.  We merely comment on existing work done by other journalistic entities.  So we are kind of Jeff Jarvis and I pretty much disagree on everything.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  And I think this is one point that we actually agree on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got to get you on with Jeff, then that sounds like fun.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Not usually that will not be fun for anybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that bad, huh?  But he does agree that the publishers are whining  because they're you know, Google's done nothing but drive traffic to them.  Although I have to say, you know, this is from Neiman Labs.  This is an example of a barred  search where you would get all the information you needed  from the AI generated synopsis.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So fine. This isn't a snippet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a lot more than a snippet, though.  This is this is enough information that you could stop right there.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Great. And when they introduced the Knowledge Graph, whatever,  seven or eight years ago, they should have had the conversation then.  And even before then, when they were indexing websites and nobody understood  how they should have had that conversation then, it's like there's nothing.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  There's no like there's nothing in the Bible or the Constitution  or kind of anywhere that guarantees a particular business model,  the right to perpetual existence.  True. There's nothing that says that like,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but if those original sources go away, what's chat GPT or Google's SGE?  What's it going to use for the original sources?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's it that's a very significant problem.  Reporting. But the but the  I think that's a very big problem.  It's a very big question.  But the way forward isn't like isn't in every individual company  acting in their narrow, short term self-interest  to avoid the work of like reinventing what they do. Right.  It's everyone saying, oh, but this disrupts, you know, technology  X disrupts the way that I've been doing things for the past Y years.  Therefore, something's a problem.  Like that is the nature of every technological innovation  is it's going to disrupt a bunch of stuff.  I'm much more concerned about the larger kind of societal implications  than I am with individual. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And as some have pointed out, in fact, in this Neiman article,  it also gets rid of all the sites that are just click bait.  You know, what time does the Super Bowl start?  Those call those all go away because, yeah, Google just answers it.  And then you can move on with your life.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And the regulatory question is interesting.  You know, there's a you know, this like a big TikTok meme  of like the pelican trying to eat a coffee bar.  And it's just like, can't quite get its beak around it at all.  I missed that one, but I get the idea.  Yes. And you just Google for Pelican and coffee bar.  You probably find it.  That's what a lot of this stuff reminds me of, right?  I mean, of regulators actually trying to, you know,  get their beaks around what to do with this thing.  And they just kind of can't they can't deal with it.  And it's a really deep and interesting problem, I would say, as important.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You've just enriched my life significantly, Phil. Thank you.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  You're welcome.  So what are we going to do?  If you could just take a moment to appreciate this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you're not watching the video, just imagine that pelican  trying to eat a rather large rodent like mammal and not being able to.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  You get the.  And and I would love to like engage in this again in good faith,  because it's it's easy to like make fun of regulators.  But like, yeah, to the extent that we need like governments to do something,  it's probably about this, like potentially society ending, you know, thing.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I feel you, Phil.  But I for I don't know, six years now, multiple meetings at state at DOD.  With, you know, these guys, you've met with them.  Yes. Yeah.  Here the the issue is we cannot get together in the United States.  The EU's gone.  The right direction that is about regulating,  I think, to some degree, without thinking through the knock on effects.  It's pretty clear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you go to the go to Europe and try to surf the web,  every page is covered with a cookie banner  that you have to click through to no purpose whatsoever.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah, we we lack long term.  We lack a long term vision in this country and we lack good long term leadership.  That's the issue.  There was a Biden administration, just as an example,  issued an executive order on biotech that literally took.  It was not his original idea.  That order.  It was for general.  It started with the Obama administration and then he couldn't get it done.  Trump couldn't get it done.  And then it was Biden.  And really, at the end of the day, it's just doesn't have teeth.  So we just don't have one of the things that I've been recommending  and trying to stand up is a.  So like 10 years ago, I wrote this whole thing and recommended  a sort of office cabinet level sort of office of the future.  They they we did have something called the Office of Technology Assessment  that got defunded in the 90s.  And short of that, we just don't have any.  Nobody is in charge of long term vision on science and tech.  And I know everybody's got different groups that they will note.  But we need something that's horizontal that touches all the other agencies.  We don't have that.  We've got a whiplash situation in our government.  And I think we've got people who are going to become apathetic  because we've got the same.  It's like a rerun.  We've got the same people running again for this next.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm actually, to be honest, more worried about  the end of the world with climate change that I am about whether we're going to.  It's really going to be a race between whether AI takes over  or we all get boiled to death in a giant sea of.  Again, this comes back to there's something like like I that

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I will no longer bring up Bitcoin around friends because it's a little bit like  giving them parenting advice.  Like I can't talk about religion or parenting or like Bitcoin,  because there's this religious insanity that takes over.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, those people have moved on to AI, I thought.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what I was going to say.  So now this AI conversation is like completely polarized.  And it's just like I'm just exhausted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one of our editors has just pointed out that thanks to AI,  we can bleep all the profanities in this.  Sorry, I will stop.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not having it.  We have AI.  Please swear your little heart out.  Sorry, I will stop.  It'll be automatically bleeped.  It's amazing, this technology.  Just bleep, bleep, bleep everywhere.  No, this is such a good conversation.  And frankly, this is the first we've been talking about this for months.  It's the first time I really feel like I finally have two.  Nothing wrong with all of our other posts, but two really smart people  who've thought about this is like you've been thinking about this for almost  a decade who are kind of insightful into all of this.  It doesn't give me great hope.  But also it doesn't I don't I'm not worried anymore either, right?  Because it's these LLMs aren't going to keep us alive.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Look, I'm optimistic.  I'm just annoyed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's in a nutshell.  I think that's Amy as well.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Optimistic, but just I'm just I'm less eloquent  than the fellow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's a word, Smith, you can tell.  So optimistic.  So I'd like to hear from both of you what you think.  You know, obviously, regulatory issues and all this other stuff, there's a lot of.  Chaff in the air, but what do you think the in the best case scenario, Amy,  this this could look like in five or 10 years, what where are we kind of headed?  I love them. I love the medicine story.  Yes, remarkable.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So what I would say, let's put aside geopolitics and.  The real possibility of yet another winter,  because I think a lot of outsized expectations are never going to get fulfilled.  So like, let's put that stuff as and regulators talking out of their,  you know, whatever, let's put that aside.  There are incredible.  Opportunities on the horizon.  So this this like thing that I mentioned with this company,  the company is called Abseye.  They're doing really busy.  They're doing really cool stuff. Right.  And the possibility of getting to a point where  we can shrink what might have been 10 years,  might have taken 10 years down to, let's say, 18 months to get viable  candidates for things. Well, we saw that with MRA. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's the vaccine so fast. Exactly.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So it just it just means that the possibility of medication  being one size for me, custom for me versus one size  fit all fits all is a real possibility.  This is an issue that's very close to my heart because my mother died,  I think needlessly of a of a rare cancer that we just like.  Not a lot of people had it.  So there wasn't a lot of research.  My dad's got Parkinson's and dementia, you know,  and the way that we deal with that in the United States is everywhere  is kind of like, let's try to make this situation as comfortable as possible.  Right. I think this.  So the thing that I find promising about AI is that it is  it is part of a Venn diagram that includes biology.  And there's a lot of really awesome possibilities  that we then have to think through to make equitable  and to make sure there's not negative knock on effects like I mentioned  medical deep fakes at the beginning before we started.  I'll tell you what is that. Yeah. Tell me about that.  So right. So somebody has already figured out a man in the middle attack.  Well, sorry, there's a couple of things.  Somebody not that one.  Somebody's already figured out a way to  they've demonstrated how to infiltrate a database that houses scans  and to put what looks like a tumor in where there wasn't before.  Oh, my God. One away, which would potentially mean  that somebody goes in for chemo that didn't need it or doesn't.  Who did? I was with a bunch of it was US.  It was Brazil week in New York last week.  So there's all the big Brazilian business people and politicians  and stuff were in the city.  And I was talking to a bunch of them.  And I said, you know,  and I just kind of thought of it at the moment, but I was like,  what if Lula, the president, there is his name is Lula.  What if Lula,  you know, you could destabilize the Brazilian government by deep faking.  You know, every president has a has a exam once a year.  Every CEO does.  You could destabilize a government.  You could destabilize a company by making it appear as though somebody is sick.  Who's not? And then they go in for treatment.  I mean, you would hope that they have second opinions and whatever else.  But there it presents potentially novel security threats  that we hadn't thought through before, which we can manage.  We just have to like plan in advance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think Amy understands how unlikely it is that we will do.  Right.  You know, this is it's a our government is a random walk.  And we just bounce off of light posts and.  And we end up.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think I think to get like slightly technical.  I think this is this is stuff that.  I think Amy understands better than I do.  But I can I break things up into a few different categories in terms of AI.  There's the general computational ability  that machine learning  is really helpful, but even ML, even something as broad as as as a model,  it's just like a type of, you know, a branch of algorithms.  But there's been massive progress on that.  I'm a very early investor in a company called Occam's Razor, for example,  which also does a novel therapeutics discovery for Parkinson's  and your degenerative diseases by reading everything ever published  and suggesting compounds and doing like really, really cool stuff.  And there's massive potential for that.  That if you want to call that AI, sure.  At some point, right, it's just math.  So I guess we are getting much better at math to, you know, to figure this out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And our computational models are getting bigger  and the data sets are getting bigger and the speeds are getting faster.  And so we can do more than we've ever done before, whether it's AI or math.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Absolutely.  LLMs and in particular, these like generators, right?  What the G stands for in JAT GPT, these are the T, the transformers  are very interesting subbranch of algorithms  that can really help us with a bunch of stuff, including how to process language.  So a big leap forward that is happening right now is our ability  to process huge amounts of natural language at scale.  So we could take things that were said or written by people.  We can analyze them, we can data mine them, we can find all sorts of things.  We can combine that with our improved computational models  that can have all sorts of positive  results in health care and biology and all sorts of stuff.  Well, none of that is what's really getting most of the attention.  What's really getting most of the attention is in many ways  the least interesting segment of all this, which is just using it  to generate language, using it to like pump out speech or text or art.  Just like, you know, blather and that stuff.  Yeah, like that's the sexiest part.  That's like the most impressive part.  If you're really not thinking about it very deeply, because it turns out  these systems can generate very glibly lots of language.  And that's that's like that least impressive part of AI  is the thing that's getting 95 percent of the hype and attention  over the past six months.  And that's the thing. That's why I say like I am I am optimistic.  Big picture, but I am annoyed as well, because I actually think that like  this stuff is not the interesting part, but it's what happens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what happens. I mean, that's  you know, that's what it takes to get a.  Populist that really doesn't understand  what's going on to kind of get excited about it.  I am concerned about your notion that the infrastructure  we're developing is not necessarily useful or germane.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It's worse. It's worse than that, right?  It's because like the ability like it's hard.  It's hard to see the the I think it's going to take a while for us  to see the really giant benefits of this.  But I think I think the problem is I think the cost we pay immediately.  I think like all of the ways that this is going to break things  is happening now.  Societally, all right.  Yeah. All like basically we are looking at this is going to be  the year of a tsunami. This could be messy.  Yeah. Here's what I think a tsunami of crap right now.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah. Speaking of tsunami of crap.  So Goldman, I think, put out a report that, I don't know,  attempted to list or quantify the number of jobs.  It'll go away in X amount of time.  Lots of people are doing that right now.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  So, again, here's what I would do a good job of that report.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These are all the bulls jobs, though, right?  Well, but especially yes and no.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But here's what I think is here's what I think is plausible.  I think that there are, if it is the case that we are  maybe not looking at a recession, but certainly not looking at a period  of strong growth economically and we're coming off of a wave.  So there's a hundred, two hundred thousand tech workers displaced out of jobs.  You know, I wonder if because I know, because I've had conversations  with the heads of companies that one of the questions are asking us  is to build a model showing them which jobs can go away over the next three  to five years. My answer is we're not going to do that for you.  But I I'm concerned that this may be planting the seed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that not possible? Or are you just?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Because I don't think AI is going to replace all these jobs over the next  three to five years. I'll give you an example.  I pulled so I'm constantly experimenting, right?  So I pulled a PNL from a publicly available hospital  and I dumped it into chat GPT and I used the four  and I asked it to look for an eight percent reduction  in overhead without without challenging whatever patient outcomes or whatever else.  So it did that, but and it did it relatively quickly,  but there was nothing in there that was useful.  Right. So it was just sort of like a super generic.  If it had been my an MBA student in my class, I would have given them like a D  for not coming up with anything tangible.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But if it was a McKinsey consultant, you would have given them a million dollars.  Absolutely. And that's the business model.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But here's my concern.  My concern. Well, let's go back to McKinsey.  If you guys want to read a great book, it's when McKinsey came to town.  It's very interesting.  But a lot of big box consultants will come in  because the problem that they're solving for is how do we improve our margins?  And the easiest way to in the very short term, improve a margin is to get rid  of headcount. So my what I think is could be happening is  companies are going to see this sort of permission to get rid of jobs earlier  because I will air quoting again, like I will do it better than a human.  I may be able to imitate a human, but the  we're not at the point where the insights are there yet.  So I just I think that a bunch of companies are going to let go  a whole bunch of people for because they think that this is cheaper, better, faster  and realize that like their their their cup of barred.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Should I worry that the guy who is direct report to Sundar Pichai  and is now in charge of AI ethics at Google  was a longtime McKinsey consultant and became partner  at McKinsey is that should I worry?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Should I be scared?  I know I am not bashing McKinsey.  OK, that is not what's happening here.  But I am I am now hearing enough of the same conversations  and enough of the tops of organizations.  They're looking at these reports as as like a green light to reduce headcount.  Yeah. Well, they'll take whatever they they'll take any mistakes, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just that's that's just an excuse. That's not I think there's

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think there's there's no such thing as AI ethics.  There's only there's only ethics.  OK, excellent point well taken.  And I put and I think like when we have like  like when we have a sharp point like this, where things may be changing,  like it's a very good reminder that like we haven't necessarily decided  what ethics what our ethics should be anyway.  And like that would be a healthy thing to take away from all this.  What do we want as a society?  What do we like? What are the outcomes that we want?  And maybe that's the step of how the regulators can can try to do  to to to be productive about this isn't so much figuring out like  what to ban and what to restrict.  But we can have a discussion about what do we what are the outcomes that we want?  Let's describe the world that we'd like to live in.  That's a good point because we're focused on.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  That's a great point because we're focused on outputs,  quantity, right, outputs.  We are not focused on outcomes.  And I think that that tends to happen when business and tech come together.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah, like I propose, for example, a thing that that I that I think  could be very dangerous if we ever slip away from this is if we ever get to a point  where no human understands  deeply at a very deep level how important stuff works.  We've long since gotten to the point where most people don't understand  how most things work. And that's fine. Right.  Like, I don't really know.  Like, I couldn't tell you exactly how the TV that's on my wall here works.  Exactly. I kind of know a little bit, but I don't.  I couldn't really describe it to you.  But the people who made the TV could tell you exactly how the thing works.  You know, when I write code, I haven't actually written any code  in probably a decade, but, you know, I used to be a programmer.  I couldn't really tell you like how the code that I write and, you know, Java  like gets translated into into machine code, into ones and zeros.  But I know people who absolutely can. Exactly.  And I know how I could if I really wanted to put in the work.  I think it's a very important kind of societal norm  that we never humans, we never give up, like actually knowing  how something works at a very deep level.  And that is that's definitely something that I feel like we're in the danger  of slipping away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jerry Pornell warned about that in his novel Lucifer's Hammer, that  that we would that we would get to a state where we didn't understand  how our technology worked.  And we know. And this is like, yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And this is like the you know, you see this in the, you know, prompt  engineering, you know, phony jobs.  Yeah, you don't need to code just prompt engineer. Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I saw a job posting for three hundred thousand dollars for a prompt engineer.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And this is like this is waving a dead chicken around.  This is literally superstition, right?  We're literally going to have a class of people who wave chicken,  who wave dead chickens and like incantation.  It's good money while you can get it.  Right. But like, but we don't want we don't want to make like a cult.  And yes, a cultish religion around technology around technology would be a bad  right where we don't understand it.  And I think we may be heading there.  We don't have to. We don't have to get there.  But I think that's we're definitely I suppose that's like  a very good thing to strive for and probably a very good thing to  to try to enforce in regulations is like somebody needs to understand this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  At a very deep level.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and, you know, there are people like Jeffrey Hinton and  Blake Lemoine, who are kind of implying that it's a black box  and you can't understand what's going on inside.  And I think we shouldn't use it then for serious things. Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  That's not true of every type of thing.  That's only true of like LLMs because of again, because of how they're  they're created. And so, yes, that to me is an argument for.  Well, let's not let's not like before we wire up the whole world  to be run by a thing that we can't fundamentally understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's not do that. Yeah, that's a good point.  Let's take a little break just because I have to,  but also because you probably need a drink of water or something.  What a panel. I was smart.  Jason Howells and I both decided if you've got Phil Libbon  and Amy Webb on one show, you don't need anybody else.  I should just step back and let you guys talk.  Phil is at all-turtles.com.  You're turning into a podcast network here.  Look at all the shows you guys are doing. That's great.  The newest series Culture Fit talks about racial bias in tech.  All-Turtles is I use the word incubator, but you like  you prefer studio software design studio, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.  Lots of portfolio companies, including one that Phil's using right now.  He, believe it or not, is not sitting in front of a beautiful rainforest.  He's probably in some grim, dungee basement somewhere.  But I'm actually here.  Oh, OK.  Bentonville, North, Northwest Arkansas.  Life works here.  The first Walton's right there, the first Walton's drugstore.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  That's why everything Walmart does is perfect.  And I can't criticize it because I'm literally looking out the window at the.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you really in Bentonville? Seriously?  Yeah. Like, like that's where you live now. Amazing.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Where I live. Really? I didn't know that.  Two blocks from here. Yeah. I thought you were in the Bay Area.  It's great. No, I fled.  Now I'm in Bentonville.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  There's a really good art museum in Bentonville.  Oh, yeah. Crystal Bridges. I was there. Yeah.  They're always always. I've wanted to go.  I just I've never been there. It looks amazing.  Why? I'll show you.  Phil, I'm fascinated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How did that happen? Do you have family there?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It was kind of random.  We were just looking to to just flee, you know, during during during covid.  So we thought we'd go to a few different places.  And yeah, we had we had we had some some some friends here.  Because they just got the job at  I hope I'm pronouncing it right.  Walmart, I think it's called Walmart.  Walmart. And they said, yeah, it's nice and quiet.  Come hang out for a couple of months.  So we did that intending to just leave, but we just fell in love with it  because it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one of the side effects of this pandemic.  Lisa and I both thought the same thing.  I don't have to be here. I don't have to be anywhere.  We could we could do our jobs anywhere.  There's high speed Internet.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  So that's what I was started telling people.  I started thinking that like, well, yeah, I can live anywhere.  So I may as well live somewhere nice.  I can work from anywhere. So I may as well live somewhere nice.  What I realized is the second half of that is I'm actually much better at work  because they live somewhere nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't you feel like, though, that you need to be, you know,  in person with people at some point like your your founders, don't you?  Like so you're flying around a lot.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Not I mean, not nearly as much as I used to.  But yeah, we you know, people come over.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I go see them. You make them fly to Bentonville. That's it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I get it.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Really nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, one of those Walmart airplanes, they're coming in every five minutes  and you go to Bentonville. Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  We have a whole like philosophy about what you should do in person,  what you should do on video.  I want to hear about this. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can record a video.  We're trying to deal with that here because I want I want all my editors  and producers in studio with me.  Yeah, of course, I'm sure they hate that idea.  But there's no excuse for not being at your workplace anymore.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I've also I've also been entirely replaced by an AI once ago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There he goes. He's glitching. He's glitching.  Yeah. If you want to glitch to mm hmm.  M M H M M dot app. Really cool.  Amy Webb is also with us.  She is with the Future Today Institute newly redesigned  beautiful website.  If you want to know more about what they do and what they create.  And and Amy's clearly one of the smartest people in the world.  She's also the author of The Genesis Machine, our quest to rewrite life  in the age of synthetic biology and the Jeanne Perot endorsed the big nine.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  It was such a surreal, bizarre day in my life.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  News loves the big nine.  Oh, my God, we do.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  We really do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Great to have you both.  I am honored that you are here.  Our show today brought to you by and I'm honored that you're here  to watch in the show. Thank you.  I bet you're glad you're here, too.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  I want you to the next time you go into private mode or incognito mode  in your browser, read the the pop up, the little fine print that appears,  which nobody reads, you just go, yeah, yeah.  It actually says your activity could still be visible to your employer.  Your school, your Internet service provider.  In fact, all incognito mode ever does is is hide what you're doing  from somebody on your computer.  That's not incognito.  If you really want to stop people from seeing the sites you visit,  you need to do what I do.  You need to use Express VPN.  Think about all the times you've used Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, a hotel,  even at your parents' house without Express VPN.  Every site you visit can be logged by the admin of that network.  Though the big corporation that owns the ISP or Starbucks,  you know, Howard Schultz writing it all down, even in incognito mode.  I mean, that's not privacy.  What's more, your home Internet provider can also see and record  your browsing data, even in incognito mode.  In the US, they're legally allowed to sell that data to advertisers.  They could just pass it along.  Express VPN is an app that encrypts all your network data,  reroutes it through a network of secure servers.  So your private online activity stays just that private.  Express VPN, it works on all your devices.  It's easy to use one button.  You're immediately joining the server that's nearest to you.  And I've got to give them a little plug because Express VPN  invests in their architecture.  It's fast.  You can watch HD video through Express VPN.  That's you know, it doesn't bog you down.  They also invest in IP addresses, so your numbers are rotating.  So you're even more private.  It's not always the same IP address.  One button connects and your browsing activity is secure from prying eyes.  You can even put Express VPN.  They sell routers.  They have very good routers actually.  Or you can put it on certain routers.  You can find out more at the website and then it protect the whole house.  Stop letting strangers invade your online privacy.  Protect yourself.  Expressvpn.com slash Twitter.  There are a whole host of ways to use this.  Maybe you're in Turkey and you'd like to see what's going on on Twitter.  For instance, Expressvpn.com slash twit to get three extra months  free with a one year package.  EXPRESSVPN.com slash twit.  Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.  Speaking of Twitter, they did block in fact, a bunch of anti-Erdogan  tweeters at the request of the Turkish government may not have been too much  avail because I think they're going into a runoff election was today.  Twitter does have a new CEO.  Elon Musk has selected Linda Iaccarino formerly in charge of  advertising at NBC Universal to helm Twitter.  Elon says he will continue to run the technology organization much to the,  I'm sure the dismay of the engineers there.  And, you know, I guess he'll continue to post all his humorous tweets.  I presume he will also continue to drive policy at Twitter.  Do you both of you still use Twitter?  You still use Twitter, Amy?  I see you have a Twitter handle.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Ish.  I don't ish.  I, you know, I, I don't know.  I, most of the people that I used to follow, like my, my crowd  dispersed to other places.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm, you know, that's the problem.  They dispersed to many places, right?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Instead of, it makes me sad.  I do find the, the new hire than the new CEO, less curious as than everybody else.  This is, this is a person that has not served as a chief executive  officer and a CEO function is a pretty specific.  It's a pretty specific role with a pretty specific set of duties.  This is somebody who came, who was like the head of advertising at NBCU.  So I think this is really just about teasing, like getting  advertisers back onto the platform.  I don't think it's truly about leading the organization into the future.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Elon will continue to fulfill that role, right?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  She's, I've heard a couple of kind of cringy panel conversation.  I heard a cringy panel conversation where she was interviewing him.  And it was a little, it was a lot cringy.  So I, I think it was, it was a lot of, um, praising and try like, I'm a cool girl  and you're a cool guy and we're cool together and, you know, just a lot of that.  So I don't know where I, I'm on mastodon.  You know, I'm on, I'm on the Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you on Twitter.  That's social.  Good.  That's a good place to be.  But, uh, but the problem is that your friend group is  dispersed to the four winds.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  My friend group is dispersed.  I'm actually talking to people on the phone again and I don't want to do that.  It's a horrible, horrible, I blame Elon for making me talk on the phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've said it before.  I think, you know, it's sad, uh, Twitter had a real value, uh, despite, you know,  it's kind of rocky ups and downs, uh, and it's, we're kind of losing it.  And that's just, you know, I think that's the way it is.  I don't know what else to say about it.  How about you, uh, Phil, are you still?  A Twitter.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I am.  Yeah.  I mean, I haven't, I don't, I don't tweet that much.  It kind of go through periods where it kind of runs hot and cold.  Uh, you know, I just, I just got the new legend of Zelda games.  I'm not going to be feeding much for the next few months.  Have you started?  I just downloaded it.  Check it out.  I even got that, that, that you're going to play it on the, you're going to play

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  it on the switch.  You're not going, you're not going to play it on a television, like a big

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  monitor under both, I think, I think I've got some, I've got some, some flights  coming up, so I wanted to something I could play off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We, uh, we, uh, just on the, as the tech guys did a little demo, this is, this  game came out Friday.  It is already, in fact, I have it right here on my switch.  It's already,

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  everyone wave their switch around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody wave your switch.  Uh, it's already, uh, on Metacritic and, uh, yeah, it looks amazing.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's already being hailed as the best video game of all time.  I think that may be a little overstatement, but if you're a Zelda fan,

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I mean, I thought the last one was the greatest pieces of like art and culture.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Um, it is, I think it's, that's one of the reasons we showed it on Ask the Tech  Guy, I said, not as a promotion for the game or as an ad for the game, but just,  you're going to hear a lot about it in the next few weeks and you perhaps would  like to know more about what it is.  Uh, and yeah, I think it's cultural.  I'm, I'm not of an age where either Mario or Zelda was, uh, you know, in my  formative years, but I do like games and it is such an open world and you could  do so much, including building, uh, that it's, it's pretty, it's very interesting.  I'll probably play a lot more of it.  Um, I've only gotten to the first few hours of it.  Uh, we had our,

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  what's the story?  What's the new storyline?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I don't know.  I haven't, I have literally just, it just finished.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I, I can tell you a little bit, which is, it's  the same story line.  So, uh, as you may remember, link, uh, was gone for a hundred years, came back.  Uh, he hooked up, he solved, he got rid of the, uh, get calamity, Ganon, uh,  cleanse the world, but got severely injured.  So he's waking up from his coma.  Uh, Zelda's there.  They go down into the basement underneath the castle and discover an ancient  civilization.  So it's kind of the precursor civilization to high rule.  It isn't, it's a sequel, but there's a whole new open world, uh, a  bunch of new adversaries and puzzles.  It's huge.  It's beautiful.  Uh, and one of the things that happens in almost immediately is you get to a  high vantage point and you look around and you can see the world and it's huge.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So it's, it's, uh, it's both got an underground and above ground component.  The building is very interesting.  I think a lot of people will be a kind of a Minecraft style building, uh,  mechanism, mechanic that's going to be quite good, but seriously, literally some  of the review open critic saying best video game ever.  I mean, it's already, uh, and it's only been out for two and a half days, but,  uh, time.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And I think, and I think we need like, um, I think a lot of this, uh, large  language model AI stuff reduces the amount of work that it takes to make  something mediocre.  And I think the antidote to that is making stuff that is really exceptional.  I'm very much looking forward to this as being something that I hope is going to  be, is going to live up to expectations.  It'd be really exceptional.  I really think that last game was like, this is for me, the most optimistic way  to look at chat, GBT and stuff like that is it should raise the bar of what it  means to be human, it should raise the bar of what it means to be like made by  people like I've already tried to apply this as just my own stuff.  Like I think like, well, if chat, GBT could have written this, I can't.  Right.  Like I have to, I have to set the bar higher.  Um, and, and yeah, like I really think that this is going to be like, I am very  much looking forward.  I could be disappointed, but early reviews are very positive.  I think that could be an exceptional thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an excellent point that, uh, one of the things that happens with, uh,  technologies is it is that there's a higher value put on human, uh, effort,  you know, that, uh, that it suddenly becomes more valuable.  The art that's created by humans, not a machine or the writing that's created by  human, not a machine or a game created by a human.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And of course it's not accurate to say that like AI it's either made by a human  or an AI, like everything in the future.  I think to Amy's point is going to be made by humans using AI, like our tools  will all become, you know, AI infused.  Uh, we'll just have to find that balance.  Like what we're seeing right now is not AI infused.  It's just like mediocre crap that things are being turned out.  Very much looking forward to seeing what like the next legend of Zelda, you know,  that comes out and whatever, I guess it was five years since the last one, the  next one, five years from now, obviously will be made by people using a tool set  that very much is AI informed.  And there's a potential that it becomes even greater, but we just, we need to  find that equilibrium.  We need to find that.  Like, you know, we're not like hand coloring pixels.  We're using modern tools and modern tools will become AI infused.  And hopefully that will lead to even, even more beautiful exceptional things.  But what we're seeing right now in this kind of early phase is just like  AI generated mediocrity.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, as a point of example, uh, Snapchat influencer, Karen Marjorie released an AI  powered virtual girlfriend based on her, her voice, her story, and it ended up just  basically being a sex chat, which I don't think she's too unhappy about cause she's  charging a buck a minute, even though she says, Oh, Oh no, that's not what we wanted.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  That's an interesting regulatory question.  I wonder how prostitution is actually like legally defined.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, how do they, well, it's not, I mean, there's no sexual act.  It's just a, it's just a text chat.  Um, certainly not illegal prostitution.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, I'm asking because, you know, in Utah, I'm sure you guys talked about this  already at some point, but Utah, um, changed its privacy and age things.  So like Pornhub, I think you have to somehow verify with a driver's license  that you're over 18.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I want, can I get my porn chick?  Cause I'd like to go to, of course instantly, uh, Pornhub left Utah and you  even if you got your age verification, you couldn't use it, but there are plenty of

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  sites that could, I'm sure.  Generative systems.  That's another one of these like gray areas that the states I think are going to  have a lot of power and we wind up with ever more splinter net versions of.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, it's an interesting point.  You know, I, uh, if you're a highly conservative state where they're worried  about social, uh, you know, social networks on effect on kids.  Um, yeah, a sex AI based sex chat bot might be, uh, might be something  that bring down the law.  I didn't, I didn't talk about that.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  This is actually an interesting topic.  So I was a, I was an early investor of replica replica.ai, which was  in the news more recently.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  That company took a turn.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Um, well, it, it, it kind of didn't.  It's kind of been, you know, the, the, the idea of replica.  You should have, you should have the CEO.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  uh, uh, on your show.  She's fascinating.  Um, you know, the, the, the whole point of replica, which we helped with, you  know, at all turtles many years ago, was that you could have the, uh, an  emotionally resonant connection with a chat bot, with an AI actually much  easier than a factual one you can make an AI that, that, that spoke to  like an emotional connection.  It wasn't, it was, it was, it was more possible to do that than to make one  that would give you like factual, you know, answers about stuff.  And so they designed this thing to be initially kind of a friend, a  companion, a mental health bot.  It was about giving people support and therapy and it went in more recently.  It went into all sorts of, um, uh, kind of erotic and sexual direction.  Some of it intentional, some of it not.  There was a backlash.  They turned a bunch of the sex stuff off, but then users felt really lonely  about it because there was a lot of people who actually, this was their  friend.  Yeah.  Uh, and so they restored it, but I think like a well designed version of  that is actually quite laudable.  Like the only embarrassing thing would be doing this poorly.  So yeah, like, like, like half assing a sex bot could be quite harmful, but  doing it thoughtfully and doing it well is potentially, potentially a valuable  thing.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't reject that off hand, which is not necessarily what

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  replicas existed in China.  What six, seven years ago there, it was the precursor to Tay.  It was the same code.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft learned nothing from that experience.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But, but I mean, there was a bot that, that did possess, it could remember  conversation.  Um, you know, if you had a soccer injury, uh, you know, it, it had a persona.  So I think it was meant to be an older teenage girl.  Um, but there was this research done and like most people didn't realize she  wasn't a human.  And then when they did realize that they, they had created, just like Phil said,  this like deep connection that they didn't want to let go.  Um, so they continued chatting with her anyways.  And then they, it's a little creepy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would worry about the long-term.  I mean, it's like the, uh, pillow brides in Japan.  I mean, I, I worry a little bit about the long-term impact of such a thing.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Look, I think there's, um, right.  We are potentially more lonely than we've ever been, right?  As a society, there's all sorts of stats on this.  Yes.  But is this the solution?  Well, well, hold on, but we're more connected to other people than we've  ever been, right?  So like, this was, this was always the big lie of Facebook, right?  Facebook was saying, oh, we're about connecting people.  And actually it turns out that you're not about connecting people.  You're about connecting you with your own biases and getting you out of actual  like human connection.  And loneliness is not about lack of interaction with other people.  Loneliness is fundamentally about a lack of understanding of yourself, a lack of  connection with yourself, a lack of like knowledge and expertise about like what  your emotional state is, not being able to name your emotions, not being able to  think about those and social media has made a lot of that much worse.  So like, yeah, it's kind of creepy.  I mean, it's, it's weird if you make it weird.  Uh, but, uh, you know, a, a thoughtful tool that's designed to help people like  understand themselves a bit better through conversation with that isn't with  another human, so it's not judging you.  So it isn't going to do anything like potentially harmful is very valuable to,  to many, many people in many, many conditions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, Freudian psychotherapy, like traditional Freudian psychotherapy, the  therapist says very little, right?  Uh, it's, it's all about the process of talking it out.  I suppose you could do psychotherapy with a, with a bot, but I wonder if  if some of the value of psychotherapy is going in the room with it, you know,  into a room with a human, some of the original, it was one of the original

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  intensive AI, there was a chat bot built right, Eliza for, for therapy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eliza was terrible because Eliza had no, I mean, it's, they've gotten better.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Eliza wasn't meant for that, right?  It was just like, Eliza was a little toy, right?  Toy.  But it just said, look, the first bot I ever wrote, and I really think I, I  think I should be known as the godfather of the, of these conversations.  I wrote a bot once many, many years ago.  It was called rash bot.  And, uh, the way rash bot works is you texted it a picture of your rash and it  replied, it replied, ew.  That's all it did.  Except 10% of the time, 10% of the time, randomly, it also added, you ought to  get that checked out.  Oh, good.  So you would, you would text it a photo of your rash or anything.  Obviously it was doing no, no image recognition and it would reply, ew.  And sometimes, ew, you really ought to get that looked at.  And I think that was kind of like the MVP product for all of the AI that we have now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  Rash bot.  When he first said the name, I thought, well, he can't mean R-A-S-H, but I guess he did.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, was, was, was ahead of its time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think, I mean, seriously, do you think that, uh, psychotherapy could be  done by an AI effectively?  I mean, if, if a Freudian therapist just goes, uh-huh, every five minutes.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Um, I mean, Freudian, Freudian therapy has been discredited.  I think so.  A hundred years ago.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I think, I don't think it's, I don't think it can.  I don't think so.  I've been in cognitive, no, I've been, I've been in cognitive behavioral  therapy for several years.  Yeah.  And I started out with an acute issue and then I kind of stayed  cause it's a little bit like.  It's fun.  AA.  Yeah.  It's not, no, it's not fun.  Um, it's hard.  It's hard work.  It's very hard work, but it's like, um, I need to check in regularly.  You're hooked.  So here's, here's why I don't think it works because the thing that I needed  treatment for at the beginning is not the same thing that I need right now.  And what I have now with the same guy is learning a little bit about theory and  where some of this is coming from.  I think the problem is if he was a, how would you encode a system to know, to  teach it, to evolve with the patient?  Um, and how would you be able to anticipate that this, that what I'm  looking now for is more almost like, uh, instruction on theory of mind and things  like that, what I need is so vastly different from what somebody else at the  stage might need that I think that there was, there's really no way, maybe sort  of a extremely short-term, very acute issue that has more limited parameters,  but we don't really understand how the mind works anyways.  I think it'd be, I, this is not where I would push the frontiers of AI.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I think as a tool, it could be, it could be useful for, for some people.  It certainly wouldn't be the same, uh, as doing with humans.  And I think there's going to be a next generation of therapists that are coming  onto the market right now that will grow up with this technology and  will use AI power tools.  So it'll be, again, it'll be sent to our chest.  It will be augmented intelligence.  It would be a combination of.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  What is it that we're all looking for?  We're all seeking insights.  This is the word we haven't used yet, but that's what all of this is about.  It's not truly about automating it things so that we don't have to do them anymore.  Exactly.  Right.  It's about getting to new depths and new insights.  It is.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  This is maybe the most profound thing about this, that, that, that this is  very much what you said.  I don't think it is.  I don't think anyone needs us to make it easier to do things that we  don't want in the first place.  Reducing the friction to mediocrity is not a virtuous thing.  That's going to make the world worse.  It's not going to make it better.  We don't need to make it simpler to do things that that are, that are poor quality.  We don't need to reduce the friction of both the bullshit jobs.  The, so the, which is, which is what 95% of this stuff is, but maybe to Leo's  point, that's kind of always what the beginning is because you're taking the  low hanging fruit, shaking the easy stuff.  And if I'm trying to be optimistic about it, it's about saying that like, after  we've sort of washed through that, which hopefully happens quickly, we wind up  kind of using these AI tools to make really high quality, effective things.  Not easier, just, just possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You've talked about, you've talked about coding, Phil, and a lot of coders are  using co-pilot on GitHub and similar things.  Are they think temporarily, but yeah.  Okay.  So do you, do you don't think it's a real value?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  No, no, I think it's a tremendous value, but I think it's a, it's a, it's probably  a stepping stone to better computer languages, right?  They're using it to automate things.  Uh, and so the things that are, that are automated or to just be part of the  language and, and, you know, in the beginning, so like you just, like, probably  the next generation computer languages are constantly evolving and my guess is  that the next few that come out are going to be deeply informed by things like  co-pilot and then you just won't need them.  This is again, that's what Amy was saying before.  Like we could just like step one.  So you have a bunch of nonsense.  Step one, step two is you bring in AI to automate that nonsense.  And then hopefully we all move on to step three, which is you just get rid of that  stuff, right?  Not automated.  You just get rid of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that chat GPT could write rash spot right now.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It could write rash, but it couldn't write Zelda.  It couldn't write Zelda.  No.  Although people working on it could certainly use co-pilot to save some time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the writers guild, which is going on strike among other reasons.  One of the reasons is they don't want AI to be utilized against them.  Um, they, they fear that, you know, an AI could take all the episodes of, uh, the

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Simpsons.  So they're doing the thing that the AI will never do, which is go on strike,  which is maybe not the best.  Maybe ask chat GPT what their strategy should be.  Isn't that fair?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But I, so I, we do a lot of work on shows and with studios and I've, I've had a  couple of higher level folks very seriously say, are we there yet?  Can we get, can we say I.  Yeah.  They want to, because a couple of, again, what are the external forces pressuring  them?  Um, there's more consolidation coming.  So the streamers are going to start consolidating down to fewer than, than  there are right now.  There's a glut of content.  And in order to keep subscriptions high, you have to keep pumping things out, but  the business model doesn't work.  It's too expensive.  So they're looking at this.  There's no, I mean, I was, I was thinking through like, is there any franchise  where you could theoretically get a script 80% there and it would have to be  something formulaic, like a law and order, uh, which pulls headlines, you know,  the story concepts for, from the headlines.  It's basically the same thing that happens, you know, every show, but, uh,  but we're nowhere, nowhere close.  That being said, I think I've had meetings with four different studios about scripts  involving everybody wants to write something about AI that's going to come out.  So like brace yourselves in the year 2025 and 2026, there's going to be like more AI  shows about AI than any of us want.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Your job.  I think the, the, the, the, the way I usually put this to people, and I forget  who I first heard say this is not original by me.  Uh, your job is not going to get replaced by AI.  Your job is going to be replaced by someone using AI.  Uh, like if you're refusing to use it, yes, your job is in danger.  You're going to lose your job to someone who is using it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would you recommend now?  Or is this stuff just toy and not worth spending time on?  I mean, obviously, uh, if I can make $300,000 as a, a year as a prompt engineer,  I might try that, but what would you say if you were serious about becoming  this symbiotic AI human thing, what would you do right now?  Is there anything you would do right now, uh, Phil to pursue that?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm just trying to get higher and higher quality in everything that I do.  Uh, and I'm looking for.  Not worry about AI at this point.  Not worry about it.  Yeah.  Just use it.  And then like, and I haven't actually, I haven't incorporated chat GPT or AI  successfully into my daily workflow because for me, I have not found the  thing that I can do that would actually make the quality better.  I found lots of ways that I could automate crap, but then I just don't do  the crap anyway, and it turns out I don't need to automate it.  The one thing I've done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Please.  One thing I've done with chat GPT that actually was useful.  We were, we had a surprise visit to Genoa on our vacation, Italy knew  nothing about it, didn't have any guidebooks, asked chat GPT to write a  three hour walking tour, starting at a specific point, it was quite good.  Mm hmm.  It didn't take me to any non-existent spots, but everything else I've done  is very toy-like and not useful.  I mean, I have fantasies that maybe a chat GPT could, I could say, uh, tell me,  uh, give me rank the top 10 tech stories of the week.  Give me summaries for these as my, uh, rundown for the show, for instance.  But, but it won't do a better job than you would that.  Yeah, but it would do it and I wouldn't have to.  So even if it was 95% there would be happy.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  But then like, but then the next step of that is like in the audience, why am  I watching this?  Cause I could just, I could just ask.  Oh shoot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nevermind.  Forget I said that folks.  Uh, X-Nay on the at-che.  Microsoft's.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, what's the name of the company?  Imran Chowdhury, former Apple exec started hum humanity, human.  What's the name of that company?  Uh, human something.  What does it do?  This is, uh, well, it was revealed finally, after all of this time, he's a former  Apple guy, he, they're making a invisible interface.  So it's a chat bot, but it's, it's not like the a word or Siri.  It's, um, you know, the, it's not a living demo.  So it was a concept, but, uh, the idea is you, we wear something and you sort of  tap it as instead of a wake word.  He demoed it at Ted, um, and was like, Hey, summarize, uh, I was just in a meeting.  Summarize it.  Tell me, tell me that give me the highlights.  Tell me what's happening.  That's it.  Tell me what's, uh, the most important stuff in my day.  I have a terrific executive assistant.  She's great.  I cannot put her in my pocket and travel with her everywhere.  So the idea is this is a sort of living, it's an EA.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The advancement here is, is the UI, right?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Right.  We're right.  Right.  So this is the, so, you know, for a long time, we built a model a couple of years  ago showing that, that, um, smartphones had plateaued and I don't care what  Google's pixel foldy phone does.  I just, this word we're, we're on the other side of the, uh, of the Hill now.  Um, and I've been thinking that glasses would replace it.  Glasses present a bunch of really challenging technical problems, but it  makes sense that, you know, to me that that's, that's what would be next.  This introduces a different type of UI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So project this onto his hand.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So there's a, a man, the thing that I saw is like this little, um, it's a little  sort of oval, like a black oval that seems to have both a projector and a  camera.  So the idea would be, um, the demo that he showed, which again, I think was  staged, but it was his like wife calling and he's, he knew that that was her  because he, he raised his hand and it says, Bethany is calling.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It also, you know, the difference between raising my hand with a phone in it and  not in a phone in it is kind of the minimus.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I mean, it's, I mean, yes and no.  Um, yes and no, I think it cuts down distractions.  You know, if, if I've got a phone in my hand and I'm taking, I'm doing one thing,  I have so many other potential things I can then get into this.  This is really more sort of single serving, but, um, I'm at the thing that I  also thought was really interesting is the input, um, mechanisms visually.  So imagine being able to hold a food item or something up and, you know, and the  thing knows how many calories I've consumed or how much energy I'm going to  need for a ride.  And it could tell you whether you  were a rash.  There you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, he has, he has a hundred million dollars in funding, uh, from, uh,  Kindred ventures, including Sam Altman.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Uh, so again, I don't know.  I don't know that.  I don't know how this thing scales.  I'm going to guess he's hoping to get, he's hoping to get rehired by or

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  purchased by Apple because Apple's got a big problem, which is they're making a  honkin big thing you wear on your head to try to make this happen and that is  not going anywhere.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  And I just, I think that this, um, sort of constellation of new UIs that are  coming again is the more interesting piece of the, of the AI conversation  than the current modality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Cause I thought voice assistance would be that new, uh, UI and they failed us  miserably.  You were just yelling at Siri a minute ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I, I'm really interested in the, in the new UI stuff.  I know this project I've, I had talked with, with him, um, years ago when  you're going to start working in this.  And I think it's potentially it's a, it's a, it's a big move.  I mean, it's, you know, who knows whether it'll work out or not, but it's a really  interesting idea, the projector you're projecting things on your hand.  I actually think it's, if you can get that working, that's very cool.  It's like, I have this rule.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  You don't need a ton of tech to make that happen though.  Right.  If it's not going to be visually pretty.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  And if it's talking to your, to your phone or something anyway, it doesn't  have to be the process.  You still need a phone, right?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Uh, and Microsoft, no, not necessarily that I don't, I think the idea is no phone.  Um, Microsoft in what?  2002 or 2008 had skin put early, early days, which was, remember that it was  like, you could, you could sort of project on your forearm and interact with it.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is, this has a Qualcomm snapdragon and it's running Android.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  And I think it's meant to be a, a, a phone list device, right?  So you don't need the phone.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It is, but the, I guess like the devices will continue to shrink, right?  The interesting thing is that, is the, is the interface modality.  So sticking out your hand, then having a project on there and then recognizing  gestures is really cool.  And I agree that probably better than, than something you're wearing, you're  strapping onto your face.  Uh, this was sort of my central thing.  I don't know what Apple's going to release.  I'm actually, I'm hopeful.  I'm optimistic.  I'm a giant Apple fan boy, like everyone knows.  Uh, but I've said for a long time that like any, any tech, any consumer  technology that makes you look stupid while you're using it is not going to work.  As we learned from the segue.  Exactly.  The segue and the blue glass and all of the, all of the Facebook meta nonsense.  Uh, I should have seen it coming.  Cause like literally, um, you know, I think, I think, I think Zuckerberg's  vision was always that, uh, you know, he's going to ask people to strap  something the size of a book onto their face and they called it Facebook.  And like, we should have seen it coming.  Do you think actually telegraphed it that far in advance?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think, uh, Mark has given up on VR and meta, the metaverse?  I don't, I wouldn't know.  I haven't, I don't know.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  No one knows, but, uh, wasn't there an earnings call where he basically said  that we're moving to AI now a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  It's all AI now.  Uh, I'm interested to see what Apple does with it just because like, I  bet you'll be super cool.  I still think here's going to be my test for, especially for using it in a  business application, uh, this is, this is, this is the living test.  Uh, I am not going to use any device to have a meeting or for work.  If I cannot drink a hot cup of coffee while wearing it, if I, if I literally  can't do this, cause it like hits the thing and I spill out coffee on myself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that one of them USB heated mugs you got there or is this a regular mug?  Okay.  So many, but this is a new, like five, what are you drinking?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Or you've noticed I've had, I just, I'm drinking tea, uh, but it's a, it's  a really long show and so I just set myself up drinking.  I'm drinking Earl Grey with lemon and a little bit of honey.  Cause I have a, my voice is a little bit sore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So can't do the burger.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  So basically when the Apple releases their thing, that's just the test.  Like, can you drink a hot cup of coffee?  While you're, can't then like that I'm not that I'm, then it's a hard no  for any kind of business usage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Honestly, I feel like Apple and it's, it's got too much momentum to stop.  But I think they've made a horrible mistake.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I'm reserving judgment until I see it.  I'm excited to see it.  I love Apple stuff.  Right.  We'll, we'll see.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  You don't think what's coming are just a pair of old school analog  looking glasses that have someday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not, not, not in June.  I hope so.  They're going to have something in June that is going to look  just like the Oculus Rift.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah.  If they, if they can release something that's just glasses that I'm actually  looking at the world through clear lenses.  We all agree.  That would be amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The tech business exists, right?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, it can.  I'm married to an eye doctor who repeatedly tells me every day  why that can't happen.  Well, you wrote, you wrote in a treatment for a wonderful show that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  unfortunately got canceled.  Uh, people had these glasses and they were sending, uh, stuff.  You helped them with the, uh, right?  I did.  What was the name of that?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  It was called the first.  I really liked that.  Yeah.  Who's first streamer.  Yeah.  Our first, uh, bingey streamer.  Yeah.  The, there is a challenge trying to get the, the, um,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  so your eye doctor guy says, no, can't happen.  Not going to happen.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  You know, I don't, I don't know why, but I, for some reason was like, I want  to read some of those original magically patents again, so that's, that was  my version of fun.  Uh, last week I pulled a couple and they were just, they were so far ahead.  Yeah, but they couldn't make it.  They needed 10 years.  It was one of these things where it was like somebody had very interesting ideas.  This was basic research and they just needed to put their heads down for a  decade or 15 years and just like work.  We talked about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You were on the show at one point.  The, yeah, it was the problem is venture capital is going to give you 10  years to do anything.  Yeah.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  I will buy immediately whatever Apple releases, uh, or his headset.  I'm going to have you on June 12th.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll have you on the show.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Cause all I'm saying is if, if, like, if I can't drink coffee, I'm not  going to be in the meeting.  So if wearing this means that I, that I can choose between seeing 3d  representations of my coworkers and having coffee, that is not a choice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Big innovation.  Well, they'll have legs.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  No legs.  Yeah.  Maybe like a sippy cup as well.  Maybe they can come up with a sippy cup.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you could just have one of those, uh, backpacks with a little,  little thing just attached and then you'd be all set camelback.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  If Apple releases it, cause I'm not, I'm not going third party.  You need an Apple camelback.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  They need an Apple camelback.  There is a kind of bizarre TV show on free V app, Amazon prime's free ad  supported channel called jury duty.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Oh, I've heard about that.  It's interesting.  Hilarious.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One guy is, is, is not in on the joke.  He thinks he's on a regular jury and a regular trial.  Everybody else, the judge, the bailiff and all the other jurors are actors,  including James Marsden as himself.  But there's one, there's one guy who is a, um, what do they call those guys who  are trying to do body modifications for the future?  There's one of the jurors is, is that kind of guy and he's, he's wearing a  camelback he said, but the ideal would be have some sort of bladder that you  insert into the body that contains all the water and he has another one that  has all the nutrition he needs.  He's got anyway.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny.  The joke doesn't make it through all eight episodes or whatever, but it's, uh,  the first few are humorous.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Very slightly sidetracked.  Did you guys start silo yet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love it.  I hadn't read the books.  Had you read the books?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  A friend of mine read the books and said that he works at AWS.  He's a super nerd.  Um, and so the books were amazing.  He loved the books.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I feel like I should have read the books.  Now I'm watching the show.  It's going to spoil the books and the books are always better in my opinion  than any, any motion picture TV show, but it's, it's pretty good.  I missed the most recent episode.  I got to watch it.  Apparently it takes quite a turn.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Like that's on Apple, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I think Apple's struggling with their content.  Their studio content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's interesting.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  From my point of view, there's the new, uh, the big whatever machine.  I tried a little bit of that.  Yeah.  I think that there's this formula they're following and they have like the  world's largest catalog of music.  So there's a lot of interstitials that I think are a lot of music and all of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  their shows, you could tell there's some, there's some of the soundtracks.  I think it's, it's, it's the Zelda problem.  They're it's all formula, not enough human, right?  And that's what HBO did so well in the early days.  I despair of the future for HBO, but in the early days they were famous.  They would say, we're giving you money.  We're not going to give you notes.  Just do what you want to do.  And they got the Sopranos and they got amazing stuff.  I have to say succession.  Now you work in business.  So do is six.  I think succession is the best TV show I've ever seen, but it's

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I have firsthand experience with a lot of those storylines and the people who were.  And I will tell you that, um, I think I I'm wondering actually if there was  somebody on the inside leaking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Things they, uh, apparently did have some Murdoch info.  I think there had to be.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  But I, I, uh, I'm, I'm in a, I, I wish I had time to play games at most.  I've got like 45 minutes of free time occasionally or a half hour.  And I just, I can't get into Zelda for you.  I mean, I wish to God I could, you have to ration, I need like a block of time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to ration your, uh, your amusements because you have important duties.  I do.  I need, I need, you know, it might help.  I just want to show you something.  One of our sponsors, it's right.  Help our show today brought to you by Miro.  We've been playing with this a little bit and I am very impressed with it, but I  have, I'm challenged.  I don't know exactly how to describe what Miro is.  If you have a team, you're working on something, maybe the team's distributed  somewhere in Bentonville, Arkansas, summer in Rome.  Uh, you've got multiple tools, you know, you're using a design tool and a typing  tool, maybe some AI and all these brilliant ideas, they're kind of getting spread out  and losing information along the way.  Miro, the whole idea Miro is it's a collaborative visual platform that brings  all the great work together no matter where you are, whether you're working from  home in a hybrid workspace, your team might be in different time zones.  It's, it's got it all in one place, one single source of truth that is so flexible.  It can be anything you need.  It democratizes collaboration and input.  It's great for zoom meetings.  They actually have a timer and icebreakers, all sorts of tools.  They're infinite shared boards give product teams a perpetual space where they  can drag and drop insights and data.  Nothing's lost.  You can zoom in or zoom out.  They cover so many use cases.  You can build visual assets.  You can present findings, run brainstorms with cross-functional teams, can  ban boards, voting tools, live reactions, sticky notes, even a timer.  You can express yourself, but it's so hard for me to describe what Miro does.  Maybe the best thing to do is to go to Miro.com slash podcast, sign up.  Your first three boards are free and then check out the Miro verse, because  this is what people who are using Miro have done with it and it will give  you a very good idea.  Actually, you don't even have to, you know, you could just look at it.  Here's a Harry Potter retrospective from the UK government.  I don't quite understand, understand that.  Uh, TikTok marketing strategy, team mapping, uh, product vision, midnight  sailboat retrospective.  I, you know, it goes on and on.  Oh, here's one for mother's day.  But this is the point of it.  There's even games that people have designed in Miro.  Miro can be whatever you need it to be.  It integrates with dozens of other third party tools.  We're using it with Zapier because we use Zapier to trigger stuff.  We use it with Google docs because we use a lot of Google docs.  Miro users report saving up to 80 hours per user per year by streamlining  conversations, by cutting down meetings.  But more importantly than the time saved, the product you create is that much  better because your team is staying connected to real time information, a  single source of truth.  It gives project managers and product leads a bird's eye view of the whole  project, so nothing slips through the crack.  Nothing I say will really communicate what this can do for you.  You just got to try it.  So get your first three boards absolutely free.  You start working better at Miro.com slash podcast, Miro.com slash podcast.  And, uh, you know, the whole world is available for you.  You can do an amazing thing with Miro.  We had an amazing week this week at twit.  We've made a little, uh, little movie for you.  Enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are such a fun and simple way of expressing yourself.  So we thought, wouldn't it be cool to bring them to your wallpaper?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, this is awful.  This is the keynote.  This is awful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get one of these a year, Google.  Previously on twit, twit news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're sitting down with Dave Burke, VP of engineering, Android and Samir  Samat, VP of product management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what we wanted to do today was to showcase not just the technology,  but also how the technology comes into each and every one of those products  that we all use and what can it do for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the hard part in my view is like, how do you make this approachable,  right?  And relatable and fit for purpose.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mac break weekly.  Apple is bringing final cut pro and logic pro to the iPad.  Uh, you will have to buy it a new.  In fact, it's a subscription this week in space.  Strange sounds recorded high on Earth's atmosphere from space.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us the Sandy and national labs.  Uh, a scientist, they launched a solar powered balloon, uh, up like 31  miles above our planet.  And what they found is this really, really strange series of sounds that  repeat every few hours and no one knows what it comes from.  That's clearly aliens, right?  Rod?  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait, let me see if I can reproduce this.  Hold on a second.  How's that sound?  My beard against the microphone.  It's a microphone actually reminds me that for about 15 years, there were audible  click sounds in radio broadcasts and other things.  It turns out it was some Russian giant Russian antenna that they were trying to  use to spy on people and it was causing radio interference.  It wasn't aliens.  Uh, I think the odds are it's probably, probably not aliens.  I hope you enjoyed this week in a tweet and I hope you will continue  to watch all of our shows.  Of course, our club members get special access.  No ads, no promos, no spy, no, you know, ad monitoring technologies, just  the shows all clean, pure, you know, we should do, we should leave the  swear words in for the club members so they, so they can hear what it  really sounded like club twit is $7 a month ad free versions of all the  shows, special programming.  We don't put it on anywhere else.  That's how this week in space got started.  Uh, home theater geeks is right now in the club and it's a, you know, it's  birth pangs, uh, we've got the hands on Macintosh with Micah hands on Windows  with Paul, we've got an untitled Lennox show, all sorts of stuff, the great club  twit discord, I think it's the best seven bucks you'll, uh, you'll ever spend.  And it really helps us do.  Uh, I think, uh, more of what we want to do for you.  Um, you know, ad supports nice.  Listener supports even better.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  There is, there is a version of the show from Alia, Alia G with all the  swear words.  You are, you hang out there once in a while.  I love seeing you in there.  It's wonderful.  Uh, you know, I would love to get all the smart, in fact, Phil, I'll send  you a complimentary membership too, but love to get all those smart people in here.  Uh, it's fun because there's something about a social network where people  have paid seven bucks to be there.  They just have an investment in it.  It's like a, you know, a private park.  You don't, you don't, you don't get the messing around stuff as much.  It's really great.  Uh, AM radio is on its last legs.  Washington post.  This broke my heart because I'm a long time radio guy and of a love affair.  AM radio being removed from many cars, Ford, the MW Volkswagen, Tesla.  Uh, they kind of have the excuse.  Well, the electric motors interfere with the AM, but really it's, you know, why  put it in if people are going to be using their smartphones, it does raise  an issue because AM radio is used for safety announcements, emergency announcements.  And there are plenty of places where you can't get a cell phone signal.  Um, so I imagine there'll be a, quite a bit of lobbying from, uh, broadcasters  to keep it alive.  What do you, do you guys ever let you ever listen to the radio, Amy?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I, yes, I listened to college.  Uh, usually whenever I'm in a new place, I listen to a college.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Much better.  Isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Like I get good, you know, introduced to new music that way, but I was actually on  an AM radio show, trying to remember the name of it.  It's a national show in the middle of the night.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, our coast to coast, coast to coast, coast to coast, our Bell's old show.  Now George Norrie hosts it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I was on coast to coast.  Did he ask you about aliens?  It was mostly call in people.  So I was on from like 2 AM to 4 AM or something when I was launching the last  book and, um, well here's what it was.  It was a lot of people who were really worried about, uh, vaccines.  Yeah.  And they listen, if you're up in the middle of the night, you're worried about  something, you're, you're probably anxious and, and it occurred to me.  So Zelda comes into play.  Um, so listening to everybody, it occurred to me that they all must feel like  everybody was really talking down to them and just treating them like they were dumb.  And I think when you're genuinely anxious and afraid, that is not the right response.  So I was like, actually one guy who had called in, I was like, do you ever play Zelda?  And he was like, yeah, I play Zelda.  And I was like, okay.  Um, the, this is COVID is a little, and the mRNA vaccines are a little bit like,  you know, you're out roaming around Hyrule and you meet, what are those blobs?  I can't remember the name of them, but the blob comes by and like the first time you  see the blob, you don't know, is this food?  Is this a good blob?  Is it a bad blob?  Maybe, you know, it's hard to tell.  And since you can't recognize what it is, you don't know what to do with it.  You're, you're missing the instructions.  Once you have the instructions, like, oh, that blob is actually a bad thing.  And it's going to kill you.  You know, which weapon in your quiver to pull out and to use, to defend yourself  against it, that is what the messenger RNA vaccine does for you.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually called blobs by the way.  That's the official, official name.  Yeah.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So, I mean, it was like, and we just had this moment where he, I heard he was like,  nobody ever, why don't, why don't they just tell us that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And it just, it, it, um, so I mostly just listened to people being really  worried and telling them like, your fears are totally valid.  Like I, you know, like, I get it.  This is a hard stuff.  Um, so it was very good.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's, I think if AM radio dies is because broadcasters have killed it.  Basically.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Right.  I'm surprised that it's AM in not FM, right?  Cause like you would think that like FM is actually more useful.  But I would have expected it to go first.  Yeah.  It's like, we don't need radio for like higher quality and AM, AM gives you the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  range and it's like an information and it works every in the apocalypse.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  You'd rather, you'd rather.  That's a good point.  Why aren't they taking it serious shows are still commercials.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  So it's not like you've.  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was very, uh, I thought I'd bring this one to you because of your  book, the Genesis machine, uh, Amy in, um, uh, in, uh, the central California  area, there was some deep concern.  We had so much rain about mosquitoes and there was an attempt attempt was made.  Uh, to use Oxitec, which is a U S owned UK based technology company that  generates genetically engineered insects.  And they have a mosquito, uh, that is, um, basically destroys the Egyptian  mosquito, which spreads dengue fever and chocongunya and Zika fever  and my arrow and yellow fever.  Uh, the genetically modified mail that they release mates with regular  mosquitoes, but, but like a, like a donkey and a horse, there's no, there's  no, uh, you can't, there's no mosquitoes born.  So it actually is a pesticide less way of killing mosquitoes.  Isn't that how you get the mules though?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Well, no, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Donkey and horse a bad example, but a mule can't reproduce because it's, you  know, it's got no, it's, it's, there's no, there's no mules don't mate.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Uh, so the company, I think it's got no self-esteem, no self-esteem

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because it's a mule.  Uh, the funny thing is they have used this successfully in Brazil and Florida,  maybe, I don't know, but green, but green activists in central  California got them to kill it.  They're going to have mosquitoes.  Cause it's genetically engineered.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Um, look, this would take us a long time to untangle, but there's a  couple of things happening.  The first is the city council.  It's not a true city council, but the people sort of the community council  in charge of Key West at the time that they had to decide whether or not to  use this technology, they were like a couple of retired real estate agents.  Another guy was like a retired restaurateur or something.  None of, you know, they're retired in a beautiful place.  The last thing that they wanted to be doing was to make heated, you know,  challenging decisions in a heated political environment about genetically  engineered mosquitoes, obviously about which they knew very little.  Um, the issue is that we're forcing communities to make these decisions.  And the people and the states and the federal government and the states are  intentionally handing this down so that the political heat is off of them.  And I think it's a horrible, horrible thing that we are asking locally  elected officials to do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In this case, in California, it was friends of the earth who lobbied the  California department of pesticide regulation, presumably people who would  know enough science, uh, and they convinced them to withdraw the research application.  And then they published a press release said victory.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  The who knows?  I mean, listen, it's, we don't, we don't know the political, what  was happening on the backend.  There are.  Solutions.  There are knock-on effects and there are people who talk about genetically  modified as though that is some type of ultimate, like horrific thing in the  United States at this point, it is, uh, it is very difficult to consume something  that has not in some way been modified.  I mean, it, but you know, it's, it's very, it's again, it sort of mirrors  some of the talk about AI, which is just completely salacious and over the top.  And we're not taking five seconds to be reasonable, which makes me crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you're going to have your mosquitoes in the central valley and  you can thank the first of the earth.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Spotify has ejected thousands of AI made songs.  They're by the way, they're all terrible, but, but this is a flaw.  People can gamify Spotify by, uh, there's a whole bunch of songs about poop, for  instance, on Spotify, because they know kids will ask Alexa for it.  As soon as they find out that they can ask for a poop song, they will.  And they make money on it.  Now that I know, I know what you can't wait till you try that out.  Tens of songs.  Why is, why is that?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Why?  Why is that bad?  That's no, I'm not saying, did I say it was bad?  I'm just saying, Spotify kill this.  Why are they removing them?  What's the damage?  I mean, it's taking money away from legitimate artists, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  And I mean, I realize that I literally haven't listened to real new music with

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  any regularity posts like 1997.  That being said, a lot of music, let's face it, kind of is interchangeable.  And I recommend if you want to catch up on all that stuff, watch Eurovision,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which for the first time was broadcast the United States on, uh, I think it was  on peacock this year, you will be amazed.  And how bad some of the music is.  Oh, I know spoilers here.  I don't, I'm sorry if you saw that, uh, who won and all of that, but this was  something, uh, I watched last night and I was thinking, this is why the US  music industry is so dominant worldwide.  I think it's rich that Spotify.  Let's talk for a second.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I forget who did this study, but somebody looked at how Spotify is putting  together the sort of recommended, uh, music industry, uh, music industry  daily lists and they're not random.  So if you look at, if you, if you look across multiple accounts, everybody's  basically being recommended the same songs over and over again, so I don't  care what anybody says, the discover ability it's it, you see this across  different platforms in the digital arena.  The same thing happens with search, the same thing happens, you know, with music.  Um, it's, it's not as though everybody truly is getting a random assortment of  enhance if you click on enhance and Spotify.  So like, you know what I mean?  Like, so what does it matter if people are making AI?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Yeah.  I, I played with it.  I've been listening to the cheese tax song on a, on a continuous loop from  tick tock, just tax cheese tax.  Cheese tax.  It's a, it's a dog thing.  I have a new dog and, uh,  is there a cheese tax?  Cheese tax.  Should I be worried about the if our reg, if our regulator,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you gotta pay the cheese tax every time you're cooking, when the cheese comes out,  this puppy comes in the rules or the rules and the facts or the facts.  And when the cheese draw opens, you gotta pay the tax.  Okay.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Does your dog like that song?

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  There's like, my dog likes my dog enforces the cheese tax.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He gets a little bit of whatever cheese comes out of the cheese.  The dog gets.  Okay.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Thousands.  That's tens of thousands of these clips.  And, uh, yeah, this is why I hope tick tock will never get banned.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mr.  Phillip.  And thank you so much for spending some time with us.  I hope you enjoyed your five cups of tea.  Um, you didn't run out.  Three, only three, only three large.  Oh good.  Three, but they were large.  You didn't run out.  Did we, do we make it through the entire show without a tea shortage?  I think it's hysterical that you noticed that Amy.  I'm very impressed.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Well, I've got a bunch of vessels on my desk too, but I've been drinking black  coffee out of this one and topo Chico out of this one.  So perfect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You cannot make a Molotov cocktail out of topo Chico, by the way.  I've learned that.  Uh, is it the glass is too thick?  Yeah, no, it's doesn't burn.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Someday you'll have to tell us why you know that.

Speaker: Phil Libin
Transcript:  Next time I'm on, I'll be plugging, uh, our menu restaurant, which is  to be called bento Ville.  Bento Ville in beautiful in, in Bentonville.  That's a great idea.  That sounds cool.  Are you going to start a restaurant that'll have bento boxes in Bentonville?  Yep.  It's called bento Ville.  It's all happening.  I love that website now.  You can see, but it's all the pop-ups are sold out, so you  can't get anything right now.  And this is your restaurant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I have partners who know what they're doing.  The problem, unfortunately, when I search for bento Ville is Google's too  smart and says, oh, you mean Bentonville.  Yeah, that's going to change.

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  I love it.  I think that sounds so cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The world is going to come to bento Ville.  Yes.  Mr.  bento box, Phil Libbon.  Uh, his app is mm hmm.  Mm hmm.  It's mm.  HMM dot app.  Got to try it.  Mac and windows.  You can present with it.  You can change your backgrounds with it.  It makes every zoom call better or Webex or teams or meet your video companion.  Thank you, Phil.  It's so smart.  I just love having smart people on the show.  Then I could sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bentonville that just blows my mind.  All turtles.  Come visit.  I'll show you around.  Yeah, I will.  Uh, Amy Webb, just great to have you.  The book is the Genesis machine.  Our quest to rewrite life in the age of synthetic biology.  Future today Institute is her company.  What do you want to plug anything?

Speaker: Amy Webb
Transcript:  Um, yeah, I mean, I guess if you're like interested in AI, the book  that I wrote previous to this one is the big nine and it's still  Janine Piro's favorite.  Janine Piro is endorsed it.  Actually, it's a great book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I, you know what?  I have all your books and I brought this one out because it's the most recent,  but I should have brought the big nine out too.  Next time.  I'll know better.  Had I been watching Fox news, I would have known how tech Titans and their  thinking machines could warp humanity came out four years ago.  It was prescient.  Both these people knew what was coming.  Uh, long before I did.  Thank you so much for being here.  Both of you.  We do tweet every Sunday afternoon, 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Thank you for watching.
