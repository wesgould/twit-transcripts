And then it turns out that a guy  who was a woman who was there,  his husband, has a microphone  collection.  Leo, you would have loved this.  I was driving to Tehachapi  Saturday morning and I look at  old microphones going back to  like 1905.  Wow.  And they have a great  collection.  This is why you drive.  This is the adventure.

With computers.  With all this and this and  this and this and this and  this was the year that CES  for some reason decided we're  going to let regular people in  on Saturday.  Oh no, don't let that.  Don't let that.  That's not okay.  It was, I mean, it was as  close to hell on Earth as you  could have.  You mean Comic Con?  That's what Comic Con is.

John Pepper.  John Pepper, some guy.  He's a jerk.  And then, no, because I like  Showstoppers because that's  Steven Leon, who's great.  Yeah.  In contrast to Pepper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, but I don't, I have a  all three of them, even though  I love Steven.  The problem with those is  they're very small.  There may be 30 or 40 or 50  booths there.  Oh, no, there's hundreds.  Okay, but they're in a ballroom.

Start time: 468.82
End time: 471.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 477.82
End time: 522.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  paying 50 grand to be at  these.  And they get over covered  because they're in the days  before the show floor opens.  Right.  And local news and everybody  who's listening to the show  floor opens.  And they're in the days  before the show floor opens.  And everybody who's lazy  goes there with a camera crew,  gets the first thing in the  door.  I remember one year it was a  haptic feedback fork called  the happy fork.  Oh, I remember that.  Remember you saw the happy  fork everywhere like this is  the big story at CES.  But it was only because it was  inside the door at Showstoppers  and everybody saw it and  everybody reported back.  And so my my it's you got to go,  of course, and you get free  food.  But I don't I usually say  that's not CES when if you just  go to that, you're getting  a subset.  You can't do everything.

Start time: 522.88
End time: 544.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I get you know,  I get the emails from people  and I get the private meetings  and of course I'll look at LG  and Samsung and Sony yada yada  and a bit of TV.  TV's are the big thing  there still, right?  TV's are the most notable  thing.  But the big thing this year  I guess I'm starting off  what will be around people  on the...

End time: 595.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  smart mirror and they had  the mirrors.  I had a briefing with them  about it.  So you could talk to the  mirror, say mirror, mirror  on the wall.  Well, the idea is...  It's got lights in it.  Yeah.  So it's derived from the very  popular makeup mirror series.  So the reason it's called a  makeup mirrors because it has  the lights right in front so  that when you do your makeup  you have you can whatever  see what you're doing.  And the nice thing about it  is it's got the speaker  built in on the bottom.  So if I'm getting ready to go  out for the night or for, you  know, getting ready for work  in the morning, I got some  music going on.  I can check the traffic right  in there and I don't have to  bother my husband who might be  sleeping in the other room.  Is it a decent speaker?  I didn't get to really...  It's hard to gauge on the  show floor.  Somebody there needs to go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook.com slash Larry  Magan and scroll down to see  how I look in Rihanna's makeup  because there was a booth  where they took a picture of  a magazine that was selling  a magazine, a celebrity  magazine, and then they  superimposed that makeup on  whoever was willing to have  that be made up.  So there's a shot of me  made up in Rihanna's makeup.  And I actually think I look  pretty good.  Can you guys find that shot?

Start time: 635.14
End time: 637.79

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it, right?  You could do that with  Snapchat, Larry.  Where have you been?  Well, I know, but just with  CES, that I had to report  something from the darn show.  Well, that's okay.  I mean, I'm not going to  report something from the darn  show.

Start time: 664.12
End time: 692.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so that's the thing.  Sitting here from a distance,  I see, and we sent Robert  Ballas there, Scott Wilkinson  was down there, Dick DiBartolo.  We had a lot of people down  there.  But sitting here from a  distance watching your guys'  coverage and their coverage, I  really felt like it was one of  those shows where nobody has a  good idea.  So they're either doing crazy  stuff like roll up TVs or  they're mushing technologies  together in any way possible.  Just hope desperate.

Start time: 692.20

End time: 713.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is my first year  covering.  I'm switching to covering more  smart home.  It's kind of the natural  evolution of where Google's  going.  As we saw, they took out a  giant ad on the monorail that  said, Hey G.  Hey G was everywhere.  Yeah, it was everywhere.  Google was everywhere.  They even had assistants  dressed in scary little Steve

Start time: 714.12
End time: 717.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zizou white caps.  They were very warm though.  They were warmer than me.

Start time: 717.14
End time: 719.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was kind of jealous.  In white jumpsuits, they  looked strange.

Start time: 720.16
End time: 721.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hopefully I can find one on

Start time: 721.16
End time: 739.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  eBay.  But I actually saw that in  this move to get everything on  an assistant, in this move to  get like this home automation  going in, there's also some  really smart stuff that's  being introduced.  For instance, one of the  things I saw that I really, I  was really impressed by the  utility.  Yeah, this is what the Google  people were wearing.  Yeah, right.

Start time: 740.32
End time: 740.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were everywhere.

Start time: 741.16
End time: 747.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were very warm because it  was cold at night.  It was the desert.  Wouldn't you be embarrassed to  wear that?  Not if you're getting paid  really well hourly.

Start time: 748.18
End time: 750.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not as embarrassed as  you would be if you were

Start time: 750.22
End time: 791.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wearing makeup on.  Well, she has good makeup  actually.  Somebody else's I might say I  would be embarrassed.  But yeah, one of the things I  saw was...  I don't take, but it was  fair.  Maybe Jason, you saw this, was  the Fin Plus, which is this  large device that connects to  your central water pipe in your  house.  And it effectively learns your  water usage so that it  understands if there's a leak,  it understands if there is a  giant break.  And what it will do is it will  stop the water if it starts  flooding up and you don't even  have to touch the app.  So what happens, maybe you're  in a meeting, your house is  getting underwater in the  basement or something.  This thing will take care of it  for you.  Now it's a little cost  prohibitive.  Is this from Belkin?

Start time: 791.34

Start time: 808.32
End time: 809.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I had a flood in my

Start time: 809.28
End time: 816.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  house last year and it was  $50,000 worth of damage, so I'm  very flood conscious.  Yeah, and so for $1,000, you  install this.  Flood sensors are nothing new.  Well, that's it.

Start time: 816.36
End time: 818.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is in a flood center.  This stops your water.

Start time: 818.28
End time: 827.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it turns it off.  It turns it off immediately.  Oh, okay.  But that's useful.  That would have saved me  $50,000 before.  They had a whole demo where  they actually had a booth on  the show floor where the demo

Start time: 827.36
End time: 831.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was all this gushing water and  you could see the water  coming out of the water.  And it was like, oh,

Start time: 831.34
End time: 846.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's a lot of water.  And it was like, oh,  it's a lot of water.  And you could see in real time  how it stops that water and how  you can tell.  It knows where the water is  coming from to stop it from  there.  So it's very smart.  So it's smarter than just a  valve in your main.

Start time: 846.28
End time: 849.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because a valve is like  $50 from D-Link that you can  just put in there and a little  sensor.

Start time: 850.30
End time: 852.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure a water sensing valve  has got to have been around for  years.

Start time: 853.28
End time: 859.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is smart enough to find  the leak.  Because it's learning your  patterns.  It doesn't have to.  Oh, it finds the leak or just

Start time: 859.32
End time: 879.88

If you have a house, a summer  house that's in a place that it  snows, then you kind of know if  oh crap, the pipes are frozen  back at my place on the  Minnesota lakeside.

Transcript:  I have leak detectors under all  my faucets and toilets, which  would theoretically alert me if  there's a flood.  It works, but this is much  better because it shuts it down.  But there's another one that I  saw at CSNVAL.  I can't remember the name of the  company now where it basically  measures your water temperature,  your water pressure in real time  and lets you know...  But just lets you know it  doesn't do anything.  So this does have an advantage

I mean, I've had this happen  where a toilet's been running  all summer and you get this  massive water bill or maybe a  faucet's turned on outside.  So this would also see that  because it knows what's normal  and it knows what's abnormal.  It gives you a little readout of  what your water usage is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he started it.  He had a house that was kind of  remote and it was like where do  you go hiking?  I'm talking about Alex  Hawkinson, again, the CEO of  SmartThings.  And they went up with his family  who was ready for vacation and  went there and like the pipes  had flooded, broke, I mean,  completely trashed the whole  place.  And it was like,  how is it that this house was  off the grid and I had no way of  knowing what went on?  And so that was his whole  inspiration for starting SmartThings,  which was one of the early big  hits of crowdfunding 2012 and  then in 2014 got bought by  Samsung.  And then this year,  I think it was like the first  year when it was sold.  It was like the second year  when it was sold.  So that was his inspiration  for starting SmartThings.  So it was like the first year  when it was sold.  So I think that was the biggest  thing he did for the beginning  of the year for the company  and for the company in terms of  the success of the company and  the business and the success of  the company.  And then this year,  I'm at the show,  maybe one of the biggest  announcements that has the most  potential for long term effect  in terms of consumer experience  was Samsung announced that,  you know,  they used to have 60 different  things.  So to Samsung Connect or to

Samsung Connect,  of course,  has the SmartThings hub  built into it.  But I think potentially,  you've got to remember that  the SmartThings is made  up of the same things  that we have in the  same way.  So I think that's the  You've got to remember  that the SmartThings  is made its whole case  as an open platform.  Right.  So it works with iOS,  it works with Android,  it works with not just  Samsung products.  So and they have,  you know,  50,000 developers.  And so like 100,000 products  or something that can be crazy  that connect to it.  So now Samsung is moving  all of its stuff to that.  So I think you have to think  that and one of the scenarios  I asked them about was,  OK, so one of the things  that would be great is  you have a Samsung TV, right?  Your ring doorbell rings.  How about it could  automatically come up  on your Samsung TV?  They said that's one of  the things we've already,  you know, that were  even though it's not owned.

It's not just Amazon and Google,  but all kinds of folks that don't have voice yet  are trying to add voice to their products,  in some cases probably successfully,  in most cases probably not.  And they'll eventually support both  and you see a lot moving to support both.  Some will support one originally  and they'll sign an exclusive for whatever, a year,  and then they'll eventually support all of them.  The key is, the CTA, their researchers said,  that voice speakers are the fastest growing consumer category  since tablets, which were the fastest growing since DVDs.  So it is one of the very, very few handful,  like top five fastest growing categories they've ever seen.  So there's no doubt these things are going...  According to the CTA...

Penetration among the population, 18 and older,  11% Amazon, 4% Google.  It's because of advertising.  But well, Amazon's three years older than the Google Home.  Exactly.  And I think this is a big jump for Google Home, frankly.  It is a big jump.  Yeah.  They're a third, but they're going to...  But here's the thing that makes me happy.  Because of it, 71% are listening to more audios  They're watching less TV.  They're listening to podcasts.  They're listening to music.  They're listening to audio books.  I think this is very good for podcasting.  You can listen to our shows.  For you, that's true.  Yeah.  We're safe.  But always the problem with podcasting,  I said this from 11, 12 years ago from day one,  is it has to be as easy as it is to listen to a radio station.  I agree.  Now it's easier.  It is.  It is.  And that's huge.  It's huge.  Because you just say,  Echo, listen to Twit on TuneIn,  and you're listening.  Actually, that's for Echo.  On Google, you just say, listen to Twit.  The Twit podcasting will do it.  And now you can do it in your car as well, which is great.  Thanks to the ROV.  And other products.

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  I actually want to talk a little bit about cars.  Because, of course, cars was a big part of CES.  But also, I do think car behavior is changing a lot.  I've been seeing a lot of pictures, for instance,  of the Tesla Model 3 dashboard,  which has no gauges, no buttons.  There's two stalks in the steering wheel and one smaller,  not even that big of a screen in the middle.  That's where your speedometer is.  That's where the auto driving is.  It's very interesting.  I think we might be moving to a world  where there are fewer buttons and more voice control.  So I want to talk a little bit about that.  Brain implant.

Transcript:  That's where I want to go, man.  I just want to think it and it happens.  Florence Ion is here from All About Android,  from Jason Hiner from Tech Republic,  from CBS News Radio.  Got to get it in the right order.  I'm on the radio, Larry Magid.  Speaking of the Ring doorbell,  that's who's bringing us the show this week.  The Ring Video Doorbell,  which by the way, in case you don't know,  who doesn't know about the Ring doorbell?  Who doesn't own it yet?  If you don't, just go get it.  It replaces your regular doorbell,  has a high-def camera in it,  has a speaker, a microphone, motion sensors.  Now when somebody comes up your path,  you see them, you get an alert,  no matter where you are in the world,  on your phone, it rings.  You actually hear it probably all the time  on our podcast.  We all own it and there's always the sound  of the Ring doorbell,  the wind chimes of somebody coming up  or the ding-dong of somebody pressing the doorbell.  You can see and speak to anyone  on your phone anywhere  and you can even share video clips  with neighbors using the Ring app.  You might say, why do you want to do this?  Well, if there's somebody suspicious  in the neighborhood  with the Ring neighborhood features,  and of course you have to participate,  you have to say yes to it,  but you can share these and say,  hey, there's somebody, keep an eye out.  This is making neighborhoods safer.  Absolutely.  In fact, they put one in 10 homes,  if you go to ring.com,  you can read about this,  they gave them Ring doorbells  and the crime went down almost half,  more than 40%  just because one in 10 homes had this.  Everybody should have a Ring doorbell.  It's good for you and your neighborhood.  And now with the Ring floodlight  and spotlight cams,  you can build a Ring of security  around your whole home.  The floodlight cam is,  you've probably seen these,  the lights that are motion activated,  but first of all, these are LED lights  so you don't have to climb up  and change them  and get rid of all the yucky spider webs.  So that's nice, they go forever.  And then they have attached basically  the same unit as the Ring doorbell,  except there's no doorbell.  They have the cameras, the microphone,  the speaker.  They also have a big light  and a 110 decibel siren,  which you could trigger remotely.  So if somebody's in your backyard,  you could say,  hey, what are you doing there?  Talk to them.  Even if you're far, far away,  you're at work or you're on traveling.  And then if they don't get out of there,  you press the alarm button,  they run.  Ring floodlight cams off  for the ultimate in home security  because thieves just can't hide.  So now you're monitoring your front door,  you're monitoring every corner of your property.  So if you want to get some sense  of what Ring can do to save you,  I love this.  In the Ring Twitter feed,  they actually, people are putting up,  this is from the Baltimore police,  a person sought in a burglary  because they got the video  from the Ring video doorbell.  After a chance encounter  with the Clark police  at a local restaurant,  Logan got the surprise of his life.  Oh, when the police showed up  with a toy police car  and made him an honorary  junior police officer.  That's also the kind of things  you can record.  Here's something from the camera  the floodlight cam.  This is actually,  this is, this is,  IMQ.Tweeted this,  shout out to Ring capturing me  being scared half to death  by the neighborhood stray cat.  Superheroes come in many forms,

And here comes the homeowner  and she tackles her.  Get off me.  I'm calling the cops.  Anyway, fun to,  fun to follow the Twitter feed  twitter.com slash Ring  for examples of  all the things Ring can do.  The Ring video doorbell  and the Ring floodlight cams  you can get them together  with a Ring of security kit  with one, two or three floodlight cams.  You get your choice of the Ring  Pro  or the regular Ring  and connect your Ring video doorbell  with your favorite smart locks  and hubs too  for added convenience,  monitoring and security.  This is, to me,  this is like the best example  of what IoT can really do.  Stop crime before it happens.  Help make your neighborhood safer  with Ring.  Save up to 150 bucks  on a Ring of security kit  at Ring.com slash Twit.  Ring.com  slash Twit.  And we thank them so much  for their support of this week  and for keeping my neighborhood safer.  That's for sure.  Plus when the UPS guy comes,  I can say leave it there.  And you can watch the package  if you have a problem  with packages getting stolen.  That's a big problem  in Petaluma for some reason.

Transcript:  Yeah, so the real story  of CES this year  and it's really been coming  leading up to this year  the last several years  because CES started out, right?  It was a TV, DVD, VCR kind of show.  It evolved into for a few years  it was a PC show.  Microsoft and Intel kind of dominated  for a few years.  And then for like a minute  it was a mobile devices show  before that all moved really  to mobile world.  There was a brief few weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But for the last two years  and leading up this year  was really the cap  the capper of it.  It's really become  an Internet of Things show.  It's about everything  that's connected, right?  It is.  And the great thing is  in every one of these categories  what I saw this year was  even a step beyond that  it was about all these devices  getting a lot smarter.  So it's really  the wizard behind the curtain  is big data and machine learning  on all of these things.  So you got a lot of things  Jason, if I could  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I could take it a step further  they're actually getting useful.  So IOT has actually been around  CES for probably a decade.  I mean, Samsung has been showing  smart refrigerators  for as long as I can almost remember  but they were really dumb  smart refrigerators  they didn't do anything useful  and they're beginning to actually  be practical.  I mean, even the refrigerators  are starting to be quasi practical  in the sense that you can now  see what's in them without  opening them and that actually  is a good thing because it means  you're saving energy.  It's not a great thing  but we're starting to see people  actually think about  not the fact that we can do this  but it's actually solving  real world problems.  And I think that that's to me  what I got out of this year was  you know, actual utility  not completely but more than  I've seen in previous years.  So you finished my sentence

Start time: 2322.34
End time: 2439.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for me, Larry.  I mean, I think the thing  is so to Larry's point is  so, you know, there have been  a smart bed for years, right?  For a few years.  Sleep number now this year  it's smart bed.  They're talking about like  the next level of the sort of  big data and machine learning.  So the bed not only now  when you're laying in it  can check your heart rate  your respiration, your brain waves  and things like this.  You know, some of the other beds  actually do that but  and then they can  they can automatically  if you're snoring, right?  They have a sensor that will  prop you up a little bit  to help you so that  you're not snoring anymore.  They say that the next step  for them is that that bed can  sense when you're having a stroke  when you're having a heart attack  and can automatically call EMS  so that especially like if  you're alone that you don't  you don't go hours without  treatment.  So really it is this next level  of taking care of your heart  taking the data and machine  learning to the next level  same thing with Under Armour  with their smart sneakers.  It used to be just about  tracking your steps and miles  and that kind of thing.  Now that smart sneaker  tracks the cadence of your run  and your stride  your length of your strides  and will give you mile splits  for when you're running.  But if a lot of times  what it found is that  80% of people over stride  and that leads to injuries  and also less performance.  So the app actually will  coach you and say  look you're over striding  and so now you can adjust  your stride.  Same thing with the bed  the bed can actually  coach you a little bit  and on you know  okay we understand your  activity level  because we connect to these  other things in your life  you know the apps  where maybe you track diet  where you track your exercise  and it can tell you  look the days when you are  exercising in the morning  you're sleeping a lot better  and so it will coach you  you know on better behavior.  Jason if I can add

Transcript:  something on this IOT  so I don't know if  Sleep Number is doing this  but there's no reason  if you do have the heart attack  in the middle of the night  why it couldn't unlock  your door for the paramedics  turn the light on in the room  I mean you know you could  create an integrated platform  that could literally  set into a trigger  of things that would  save your life  and that's not there yet  by the way  this is all still futuristic  but it's practical  it's going to happen  and up until a few years ago  I thought it was pie in the sky  before you talk about  what does your coffee maker  do?  What does your coffee maker  have to say to your  washing machine?  Well it turns out  they have absolutely  nothing to say to each other

Transcript:  stuff to work really well  I'm not so worried about that  you're right  I think a lot of people will be  a lot of people  one of the reasons that  Echo and Google  are only in 16% of homes  is because probably  50% of America  doesn't want anything  with a microphone on  in their home  with all this machine learning  and artificial intelligence  limits market penetration  however  it's learning about them  I also think  this is a story  that's been told  by these home automation  people for years  and it's  okay you think  it's really going to happen  really is my bed  going to save my life

Transcript:  there'll be 845s  in the next generation  later this year  and those are  we are now getting  these are 9 nanometer chips  we're getting  I think 9 or 10  anyway they're really  I think we're getting  to the range  where these ARM processors  are starting to really  look like desktop  class processors  tiny little chips  and especially  with Intel  and Spectre  and Meltdown  slowing down  everybody's computer  yeah it doesn't help  this may not be an issue  alright I don't want to  end CES yet  let's do one more  think about the things  that really matter though  we didn't get to  the CES  but we did get to  the CES  we didn't get to cars yet  we  Hyperloop  Hyperloop  we haven't talked about it  drones we haven't talked about  so anything that you  really thought was great  that we haven't covered yet  let's  we'll do our final  CES bit in just a second  but first I want to  talk about our sponsor  our great friends  at FreshBooks  with the  and I mean a friend  because in 2004  when I was invoicing  in Canada  and I wasn't invoicing  I hated invoicing  and I would put it off  and I wouldn't get paid  I was complaining  because I had skipped  six months of invoices  I used to  go up to Canada  do the TV show  and I had to bill them  for my time  and I put the expenses  and I had to do  the currency conversion  blah blah blah  and I didn't want to fire up  Excel and Word  and make an invoice  I was lazy  and after six months  I finally did all six invoices  and I gave it to them  and they said if you ever  do this again  the bookkeepers said  if you ever do this again  we're just not going to pay you  and I went to  Amber MacArthur  I said what do I do  she said oh  nice timing  my friends in Toronto  have just started FreshBooks  it was a web 2.0 company  now here we are  what is it  12, 15 years later  FreshBooks has 10 million users  it is the easiest way  not just to make invoices  yes they still have that  in fact  that's kind of the  the spine  the cornerstone  of what they do  but it turns out  if you're putting all your expenses in  and you can do that so easy  with their FreshBooks app  take pictures of the receipts  and all that stuff  they go right into invoices  if you're putting in your  you know bills  and what you get paid  you've got accounts receivable  you've got everything you need to do  your books  in fact  with the new FreshBooks dashboard  they just put this out  it's so beautiful  you'll know whether you're profitable  at every moment of the year  you don't have to wait  until tax time to know  if you made money  and by the way  tax time comes  you're ahead of the game  you can do all the reports  your bookkeeper needs  you can get your  it's beautiful  of course you can always  send out professional looking invoices  in seconds  and because  every invoice you send out  from FreshBooks  has a pay me button  you can take credit cards  payments online  they do it all for you  you don't have to get the  merchant account or anything  it's all through FreshBooks  you get paid an average  of twice as fast  turns out your client  hates paying bills  as much as you do sending bills  and if you make it easy for them  everybody's happy  clients are slow to pay  don't worry  they have automated  you know reminders  you don't have to chase clients  for payments  you don't have to go to the bank  you get the credit card payment  instantly  in your account  you see which invoices  have been sent  which have been paid  which are overdue  and outstanding  and how much is owed you  you can now create proposals  with rich text content  images and customizable sections  that's a great way  to get new clients  show them what you can do  it really is beautiful  and then  you kind of a step ahead  of the game  when they say  yeah we want to use your services  they're already in your FreshBooks  and by the way  you can do time  and hours  automatically  it's in the app  on iOS and Android  but it's also on the website  you can even designate  different rates  for different services  I mean  I can go on and on  put your business on autopilot  for payment reminders  to late fees  automate as much  or as little as you'd like to  and get back to doing what you love  you didn't get into business  because you like sending invoices  you got into business  because you like what you do  and look at that  those nice folks  the FreshBooks team is great  make 2018  your most productive year ever  try and it did for me  by the way  try FreshBooks free  for 30 days  at FreshBooks.com slash twit  enter this week in tech  in the how did you hear about it section  so they know you saw it here  that will help us  FreshBooks  dot com  slash twit  thank you so much for their support  of this week in tech  alright  all three of you  you're all back from CES  you're all exhausted  Florence Ion is in an altered state  I can tell  are you  are you tired?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the biggest story  two  and I'd say one  and one A  you know number one  it's a  it's about transportation  the stuff that's going to  have the biggest impact  on society  will be transportation  and the number one was  actually  Virgin Hyperloop  one was there  they had the pod  that they did  that they used  they had the test  in Nevada  just a few months ago  that reached 240 miles an hour  and I asked them  I said okay  so that's  but the promise is going to  be going 7, 800  and they said no  that was over a short distance  so that proves  that it's actually  going to be able to go  the 700, 800 miles an hour  and they said  we've proven the technology  now we're just  commercializing it  and it's all about  they're picking  where the routes  they're going to put it are  and all of that  and we talked about  if they had it  going from  LA  to Las Vegas  how long would it take  it'd be just under  30 minutes  and so  but the thing that they did  which I thought was good  was  they're thinking of it  not as a  just a tube you hop in  but as a whole ecosystem  so they're making  their  their data  available for their  for what they do  available to other  transportation systems  to Google Maps  to others  and they're taking in  all of the data that  these existing  routes will take  right like there are  APIs for Lyft  and there are APIs  for public transportation  and  there  they announced  or what they showed off  at least in private meetings  was this app  that  again  where you'll design  your ride  from  for example  from Las Vegas  to Santa Monica Pier  and it'll show you  the fastest  the cheapest  or the greenest  way to get there  and so  greenest  sorry  greenest

Transcript:  which  lots of Disneyland  weekend trips  one of the things  I maybe was  Jason Callahan  has told me this  that doesn't get  covered enough  with hyperloop  is that  is freight delivery  in particular  undersea freight  delivery like  from China to  LA via a  hyperloop instead of a  747 loaded with  iPhones did they

Start time: 4404.12
End time: 4477.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  talk about that at all  or was it all passenger  travel  no it is both  because obviously  you know because  and they say the thing  is is they can  they can basically  take the demand  understand the demand  for both  freight  and passengers  and use the  use the hyperloop to  to help balance that  out right so that  when there's  higher demand  for freight  you know  then they'll use  that or  again they'll sort of  say okay well we've got  more demand for  passengers during this time  so the freight will have  to go  you know on a plane  or have to go over land  and they're talking about  that kind of coordination  and data it's all based  on this kind of  real time  you know economics  that run a lot of factories  and those kinds of  facilities now  so they're definitely  thinking of  freight and that's going to  be a cornerstone of  you know of these  kinds of things  where they're going to  build the first  what we got to  and there's a video  on tech republic  where I interviewed  their CEO  talk to him about  what's your road map  going forward like  you know how far is this  and they're going to  build the first  routes in 2018  and they're going to  build out those roots  isn't this a huge  construction project  so what they're doing  is they're going for

Transcript:  I was thinking about this  remember the term  ubiquitous computing  used to float around  a number of years ago  we didn't really know  what it meant  but we were floating around  I think that's where we are  I mean you know  we talked about laptops  we talked about tablets  we talked about phones  but I think computing  is literally in the air now  in the sense that you just  you know you think it  you ask for it  and you get it  I mean when I think about  the 11th century  the echo  and things of that nature  that  that just deliver  the information I need  to me  in whatever  wherever I am  without having to  touch a device  and I  you know I just think  I think it's  it's moving in the direction  where  we're going to be  dependent less and less  on things that we have to  touch  whether  you know we'll still have phones  but  we may  for example  Vuzix  had a really cool  set of glasses  their version of Google Glass  which  is much cooler  than Google Glass  but it's going to have Alexa  built into it  so you'll be wearing these glasses  and so what if you don't have a keyboard  because  you'll ask for what you want  and it will just deliver  right there on your eyes  through these very cool looking sunglasses  that's real  that'll be out this year  it'll cost a thousand bucks  and it won't look that geeky  and I think that  that's just the tip of the iceberg  in terms of what it's going to mean  to be using technology  going forward in the next  you know certainly in the 20s  in the next decade  and we saw that at CES  and  and as I said before  for the first time  it looked kind of real

Transcript:  I think it is a hard thing to take advantage of  it's a hard exploit because A you have  to be a very good programmer to write it  and script kiddies will get it though  B the data you get  back you don't get to choose  so it's just kind of a random dump of cached  data so it's not  the kind of thing you would want to send out to a million  machines you just get a bunch of stuff and you have  to sift through it but if I were  targeting Florence for instance  I would try to get it on all your devices  because I would know what I'm looking for right?  I'd be looking for your email address  and then whatever followed it as a password  so I would  so I think it's a great exploit  for the NSA and for all we know they've been  using it it's been around for 20 years  because if you're targeting  somebody that's where it's really going to be  useful I don't think people need to go crazy  one thing though I mean  I guess what do you say should  you patch knowing  you have a choice?  yeah you have a choice well you don't run Windows  you have to event you can defer it but you can't defer it  forever on Windows 10  but knowing that it's going to slow down your machine  and then some machines Intel  says Haswell or earlier  that's only a few years ago I have a lot of Haswell  stuff it's going to have big slowdowns  even the newer processors  I just bought an iMac Pro it's going to be slower  all of a sudden because of the  mitigation  ultimately all the processor manufacturers  say that we'll only really  be able to fix this with new processors  without changing performance  Paul Thurotte was  pointing that on Windows Weekly it's going to be a boon  for the PC industry in a six month  way of Telecom

Transcript:  yeah they'll clean that up I'm sure  that they'll have to clean that up but  I think to Larry's point you know  I think to what Larry's getting at was  eventually you have to run fewer  ads but because though  those ads there are fewer  of them they're more they're worth  more right you have to pay more  to get them is  the assumption yeah  so that's what Facebook that's  Facebook's challenge Facebook is  a self-serve ad platform right now  that brands pour  tons of money and that's why the  revenue has gone up so high  and so quickly  but this fee this  will change their business model  fundamentally right because  that it's not going to be all that  they're not going to be able to do that volume  if they do what they're talking about  so this is me being a little  skeptical of it at the same  time saying they've been working on this for a while  but wondering  because I know you know Facebook is  essentially the over 40 social  network right like it  is they have a real problem  with under 40 and so  you you know they've  got a number of  of things that are coagulating  here that are challenges for  Facebook and so it's going to be interesting  to watch how it unfolds

People magazine  people I don't confess to reading it  but if I were I could read it on my texture app  they have all the Conde Nast Traveler  a lot of great travel magazines  it's great for dreaming  do you like housing they have Dwell and Houzz  I love those I love those but I would never admit it  but I love those  so here's the deal go right now  to texture  you can try it free  you're going to get hooked  but then the best part is  we have a special offer  we can actually sell it to you you can subscribe  for less than the going rate  30% less than the going rate  $9.99 a month now really  200 plus magazines  Rolling Stone, Adweek, Atlantic  the New Yorker, the National Geographic  Wired  $9.99 a month that's less than subscribing  to a couple of magazines  a lot less than buying them on the newsstand  and you don't have the guilt the dead tree guilt  texture.com slash  twit I'm telling you  it is the number one app  for any phone any tablet  you got to have texture  this article Alexis Madrigal  I love you Alexis Madrigal  in the Atlantic  opened a lot of eyes  for me that doesn't sound right  it opened my eyes  anyway not a lot of eyes  so Alexis  bought a nice coat  the West Lewis looks good too  doesn't it?
