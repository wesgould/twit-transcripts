Start time: 219.32
End time: 224.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. You gotta read it. You're listening to it on, don't, you know. I'm listening. That counts as reading it.

Start time: 229.34
End time: 236.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Different side of your brain, Leo. I have the hardcover book, I have a Kindle version, I have an iBook version and I have the audible version.

Start time: 252.32
End time: 256.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm doing all of them. Yeah, but you're listening to the audio. I'm doing, I'm reading as well. I'm reading and listening.

Start time: 256.42
End time: 287.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now you changed it. You changed the story. Well, you know why I did get the hardcover book? Because I wanted to underline it and annotate it.  So that, you know, because I want to frequently, it's been hard not to talk about it.  So you see, it's heavily underlined and annotated. Did you see in the New York Times, Mona Simpson's very, I thought, very touching obituary.  Wow, they printed this. This is a toner printed book. What do you mean toner? You mean it's like laser printed so they could get it out faster?

Start time: 288.50
End time: 295.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean it's cheaply printed? No, this is not cheap. But this, I would bet money. It's not ink. I would bet money.

Start time: 296.54
End time: 306.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that is that common now in books? I think all books are eventually.  Isn't there's a certain irony to the fact that Steve Jobs, the guy who really brought us laser printing, affordable laser printing, his book would be laser printed.

Start time: 306.70
End time: 310.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would be stunned if this was not done with the toner based printing. How interesting.

Start time: 312.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He it is revealed in Mona Simpson's obituary what Steve Jobs final words were.  Seriously, shall I read this? Yeah, please do.  She talks about their relationship. It's really it's actually beautiful.  I believe this is the eulogy that she read actually at his service because she refers to, you know, people in the auditorium and so forth.  She says Steve was like a girl. How about that in your eulogy?  Steve was like a girl in the amount of time he spent talking about love. Love was his supreme virtue as God of gods.  He was a romantic. Isn't that funny? I would not have expected that.  But let me continue on to the final moments. So he knew he was going to die.  He died on Wednesday, Tuesday morning. He called his sister, Mona Simpson, his estranged sister.  Remember, he was adopted and didn't know his mother and his biological parents until he was about 25.  He found her and her daughter, who was his full sister, Mona Simpson.  She turns out to be a fairly well known novelist. Tuesday morning, she writes, he called me to ask me to hurry up to Palo Alto.  His tone was affectionate, dear, loving, but like someone whose luggage was already strapped onto the vehicle,  who was already beginning his journey, even as he was truly sorry to be leaving us.  She started his farewell. I stopped him. I said, wait, I'm coming. I'm in a taxi to the airport. I'll be there.  He said, I'm telling you now because I'm afraid you won't make it on time, honey.  When I arrived, he and his wife, Laureen, were joking together like partners who lived and worked together every day of their lives.  He looked into his children's eyes as if he couldn't unlock his gaze until about two in the afternoon.  His wife could rouse him to talk to his friends from Apple.  This is how I want to go, John. Surrounded by friends, family, alert to the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you want, when we do the eulogy, like on a lively podcast that we start off with something with hats like this so we can get the audience engaged.

Start time: 440.50
End time: 447.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't want him to be somber. And I think he'd particularly enjoy the Android pumpkin behind me.  You know how much he loved Android.

End time: 448.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Lord, this is terrible.

Start time: 450.68
End time: 493.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Okay.  He made it through the night. Laureen next to him on the bed, sometimes jerked up when there was a longer pause between his breaths.  She and I looked at each other. Then he would have a deep breath and begin again. This had to be done.  Even now, he had a stern, still, handsome profile, the profile of an absolutist, a romantic.  His breath indicated an arduous journey, some steep path, altitude. He seemed to be climbing.  Steve's final words were monosyllables, repeated three times.  Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister, Patty, and for a long time at his children, then at his life partner, Laureen.  And then over their shoulders, past them, his final words were, oh, wow, oh, wow, oh, wow.

Start time: 494.70
End time: 498.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not kidding. Those were his final words.  Are you auditioning for the next reading of the book?

Start time: 499.34
End time: 505.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those were his final words. Oh, wow. He was a hippie to the end. Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, my mind is blown.

Start time: 508.36
End time: 512.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By that? Well, you'd think you'd say something profound, although in some ways, oh, wow is profound.

Start time: 512.82
End time: 528.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it is completely profound because it makes you think about what is he seeing or feeling that's making him say those things.  It's like they have the dead type stuff, like the veil between what we know and what we don't know is so thin.  And Steve Jobs' dead is huge. And so God knows what he was.

Start time: 528.32
End time: 546.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he was seeing the light. He might have seen the light. And he's going, oh, wow, like, oh, wow.  Now, remember, in the book, he says that half the time he was a believer, half the time an atheist.  He couldn't decide. And maybe he was finding out the truth at the end and saying, oh, wow. Or maybe, you know.

Start time: 546.64
End time: 551.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this where the show is gone? No, I'm just... I think this is very interesting.

Start time: 571.34
End time: 580.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm really not making light of it. I think as you do, Jolie, it's...  I mean, he could have said Klaatu Barada Nikto. We don't... I mean...

Start time: 581.32
End time: 585.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you're not making light of it. I'm not.  You start talking and cling on it at the end.

Start time: 586.32
End time: 604.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he said, oh, wow, oh, wow, oh, wow is very interesting.  After your whole life, your whole life, you live your whole life.  Ups and downs, tragedy, comedy, your whole life.  You come to the end of this and you want some great insight.  What would your last words... I know what your last words would be. Rosebud.

Start time: 604.56
End time: 613.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. He said something like, f*** off, get away.  That's your last words. That's your last words.  There's got to be something like that. A reputation to uphold.

Start time: 614.40
End time: 622.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would your last words, Jolie, be? Because you know it could happen to us anytime.  You're a young woman, but it could happen as you walk out the door here.  A bus could run you down. That's true.

Start time: 623.06
End time: 642.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In which case you'd say, oh, wow, oh, wow, oh, wow.  Oh, for shame. Oh, wow.  Well, I don't know. I'm not making light of it. I just...  I don't know. I don't presume to have any idea.  I have no idea about what comes next or when we all die, what happens, or if anything happens at all.  But I hope it's something worth saying, oh, wow, about. I hope it's wonderful.

Start time: 642.48
End time: 645.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what would have been interesting? If he'd said, oh, one more thing.

Start time: 645.48
End time: 650.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and we do have a new product.

Start time: 653.57
End time: 686.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, another revelation. He loved the Japanese designer Issei Miyake so much.  He got him to design the trademark black turtlenecks.  And he ordered hundreds of them. And he had them in his closets.  Hundreds? Literally.  Literally. And that's all he wore.  He felt he should have an iconic look. This is really not so long ago, maybe eight years ago.  That he should have an iconic look. And he ordered a hundred or more T-shirts from Issei Miyake.  I think that's kind of... I think it was quite beautiful.

Start time: 687.00
End time: 692.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, didn't Anna Wintour do kind of the same thing?  Like she had this one iconic thing that she ordered.

Start time: 692.36
End time: 694.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The editor in chief of Vogue. What was that?

Start time: 694.40
End time: 704.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I forget. But I think that's kind of...  It speaks to how he merges traits of technical genius with creative genius.  He does that weird, egotistical, creative genius thing.

Start time: 704.52
End time: 744.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly what the book... Really, if you take away a...  And I'm not going to talk... We've been talking about it all week.  But I'm not going to belabor this.  Why stop now?  Why stop now? The final lesson from the book is that what Jobs really was good at is merging the artistic, creative, intuitive side with the rational, technical side.  And I think that that is really what I came away with was that was his mass...  That was his real ability was to bring those two sides together.  Ed, you wrote an article actually about Steve Jobs and the battle for the living room.  His last product might indeed be an Apple TV, you think?

Start time: 746.71
End time: 780.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's been rumored since, what, 2006, 2007.  For ages.  It took like four or five years for the iPad to come into being.  But I do believe that what he told Walter Isaacson is probably accurate.  And I would say that when we see iCloud fully implemented, that you'll get a lot more hints of what's going to be in an Apple TV next...  You know, when it finally comes around.  But it's at least a year away and maybe two.  Right.

Start time: 782.08
End time: 812.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says in the biography, I'd like to create an integrated television set that's easy to... completely easy to use, seamlessly synced with all your devices and with iCloud.  It would have the simplest user interface you could imagine.  And here's the important part.  I finally cracked it.  Some say what they believe what he's talking about is Siri.  That he was the voice control.  Does that make sense?  Play Gossip Girl?  I like the theory.  Record next week's Gossip Girl?  Something like that?

Start time: 812.71
End time: 818.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then it won't do anything, of course.  Well, that would be...  Things don't work.  Or shut up, Phil?

Start time: 819.36
End time: 851.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the real problem with all of this stuff is the business relationships with the Hollywood content providers.  Impossible.  That was... cracking the code for the iPod and iTunes meant working out business deals with every single one of the major music labels so that they gave him the rights to sell digital copies of their music and then ultimately unprotected.  And that's the code that has to be cracked in order for something to work in a TV format.

Start time: 852.31
End time: 885.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know how he did it with the music industry was piracy.  He said, guys, you're getting robbed blind by pirates.  He said it's bad karma.  I don't want people to be suffering the karma of stealing bad karma of stealing music.  We're going to make it possible for them to buy it.  The music industry didn't want to sell 99 cent songs.  They didn't want to break up albums.  They absolutely were terrified of digital distribution.  But they realized that because of piracy, if they didn't give people a way to get it legally, they were dead meat.  Is that also going to... I mean, piracy is becoming a problem in movies and television.  Is that going to move the movie and TV industry?

Start time: 886.51
End time: 913.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so Apple is going to buy BitTorrent.  That would be the logical conclusion of that.  You know, I mean, that's... I don't know that piracy is such a big deal on the video side.  You know, there's a lot of BitTorrent users, but they're this much of the market.  Whereas... because it's difficult to get BitTorrent going.  You have to be kind of geeky.  And they're giant files.

Start time: 914.32
End time: 919.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can only be popular stuff.  If you try to pick up some old classics, you'll never get them off of BitTorrent.  Go ahead and get Casablanca on there.  But with CD...

Start time: 920.58
End time: 923.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can get... there are a lot of...

Start time: 923.60
End time: 929.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's becoming less... I have nothing to say about anything.  I have never downloaded a file illegally.

Start time: 929.32
End time: 931.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Transmission is very simple, not complicated.

Start time: 941.50
End time: 952.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think it used to be complicated.  And I think it's becoming less complicated as people are discovering that,  oh, why am I paying when it's all out there free?  And why am I making it hard on myself?  So do you think it's a threat to the industry?

Start time: 953.03
End time: 954.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And do you think that they know that?

Start time: 954.64
End time: 964.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think... you know, I think that that is one industry that's keeping up a little better than the music industry did  because they're doing deals with Netflix and with Hulu.

Start time: 964.36
End time: 966.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That Netflix deal's really interesting, isn't it?

Start time: 966.56
End time: 971.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the whole thing and then being able to buy some shows on iTunes, I think.

Start time: 971.88
End time: 974.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I was so frustrated. I wanted to watch a show on ABC this week.  What?

Start time: 975.34
End time: 978.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it Gossip Girl?  No.  You can tell me.

Start time: 978.34
End time: 981.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Suburgatory.  Okay.  Terrible. Terrible show.

Start time: 981.95
End time: 1016.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't say that because my friend is the star of it.  It's terrible.  The young girl, Jane Levy, family friend. We grew up with her. She's a wonderful girl.  She lived just down the road.  Sucks.  But it might be a terrible show.  Grim. Grim. See Grim.  I want to see it, but I've never...  Grim's great.  So I'm trying to watch Suburgatory because I want to see Jane, not because I want to see the show.  You better see it soon.  Well, I'll tell you. No, no, no. They got a whole season.  Sure they do.  But ABC is not on Hulu. It's not on Netflix. It's not anywhere. It's on the ABC website.  And it's only there for a couple of days. I couldn't watch last Tuesday's episode.  Oh.  Two nights. Well, that's stupid, isn't it?  Yeah.  Why do they do that?

Start time: 1016.32
End time: 1021.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they're stupid.  Because I'm not going to...  Suits. That's why you don't work for these guys anymore.  Suits.  Suits.

Start time: 1023.14
End time: 1063.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Dana Burnetti was on Triangulation. He's a producer. He got a producer at Social Hour.  He was on this week on Triangulation. He is the guy who sold House of Cards to Netflix.  This is a full series. It was a British series. Very successful.  It's going to be about Congress, not about Parliament. It's a prestige production.  Kevin Spacey stars. He was able to sell it to Netflix. He's very excited about that because Netflix not only paid him more,  but gives him a lot more flexibility. This is the beginning, isn't it, of disintermediation, of eliminating the networks.  Did I say the Social Hour, the social network? Thank you. I always say that wrong. Social network.  We have a show called The Social Hour. It's a wishful thinking.  It's the social network?  You know that one, Facebook? The show, the Zuckerberg movie?  Yeah.

Start time: 1064.32
End time: 1068.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He produced that.  Okay. And so he's got a series called The Social Network?  No. It's called House of Cards.

Start time: 1068.32
End time: 1075.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  There are others now. Netflix has bought a couple of others. But don't you think that's interesting that they have the money to spend?  Maybe not anymore.

Start time: 1075.32
End time: 1079.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have the money, but do they have the expertise? I think that's the thing that's been weird about it.

Start time: 1079.34
End time: 1082.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't need the expertise because they go to the producers who make the show, right?

Start time: 1082.48
End time: 1084.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they hire the expertise from Hollywood.

Start time: 1084.32
End time: 1151.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They hire. And this is what he says. He says the smart people in Hollywood are the content people, not the producers, not all the other people, right?  And they're making the suits. They're making the deals. And that's the future. And they realize that's the future.  And it's the suits. He said the problem with the suits is they know it's going to happen. They just say, not on my watch.  That's what Cory Doctorow said about the music industry, too. They're just holding on until they retire. And then they know it's going to all change.  So this is Netflix that was doing this?  Netflix bought a... He wouldn't say how many episodes. He said it's more than we would have sold to the network.  They were this close. They were literally a day away from selling it to a network.  They were about to do the deal and Netflix called and they decided to do the deal with Netflix because of Netflix, because of create...  Listen to what they got. Creative control. Isn't that what every artist wants? More money. Good.  And Netflix... I don't know how Netflix is going to distribute it. Are they going to do it once a week? They don't need to.  That's a television trope. They could do what they do with Breaking Bad. Just put all the episodes up and watch them.

Well, for at least a year and a half, a couple of years now, I've been following spy guides  that companies basically give out the guidelines for turning over user information to governments  and police agencies because at some point you realize that I would rather have the child  molester arrested because of his email or his search traffic if that provides evidence  against him.  And a lot of times, you know, they also get data for good guys.

They say the number of content removal requests increased by 70 percent in the last six months.  The number of user data requests.  That means information about a Google customer increased 29 percent.

Transcript:  Well, I think we're missing the point here.  It's not so much that it's good or bad that they do this at all.  It's the fact that if you look at these numbers, it's the United States above all other countries  by a factor of 10 that have requested that we spy on our own public.  I mean, it's almost as though we're just why don't we just admit that we're in a police  state and get it over with.  There's no other country that's listed on this entire list.  And Google is a universal product that even comes close to these numbers that we have  here in the U.S.  So it's being abused and nobody seems to care about it.

Yeah, this guy you were tracking down like a dog.  We tracked, we got him like a dog.  Yeah.  No, we didn't.  I mean, a kid had made a death threat to one of my family members.  And when we found, I was worried that it was real, it could be local.  When we found him, it was this kid in the suburbs of Chicago.  And he, when the police came to his door, scared the hell out of him.  And that was that.  In fact, his dad was madder than anybody else.  However, I've gone through that process.

And they must have galled him endlessly that Apple comes along with the iPad.  Falling off a log.  Boom.  Yeah.  But, you know, and the article is called A Decade's Worth of Windows Mistakes That Changed  Microsoft for Better and Worse.  Was a tablet PC better or worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was worse for a long time, but it has changed them for the better.  I think they finally woke up.  Windows 8.  They finally woke up and realized that the tablet functionality is not a feature that  you put into a laptop.  It's an experience that you integrate into a unified hardware, software package.

Oh no, I'm sure they did.  This has happened numerous times.  Microsoft was the worst for this.  Nobody did anything, of course.  They call your bosses at ZDNet or whoever.  It was at Ziff.  Ziff.

I was also licensed to PC Magazine Brazil for a while.  So I was hanging out with the publisher.  He tells me that Microsoft, as soon as he starts the magazine, they come in and they  say, here's what we want.  We want this page.  We want the inside front cover page.  We want two ads inside.  I said, okay.  And he says, this will cost you this much.  I said, oh no, no, no, no.  We're not going to pay for these ads.  What?  Apparently, this is standard procedure with these guys.  He says, what do you mean you're not going to pay for these ads?  I'm not going to give you these ads.  He says, oh, no one is going to take your magazine seriously if we're not advertising

Now, they start saying, okay, you get more than 25,000 page views a year.  Boom, you got to pay for it.  That's classic Microsoft.  That's what monopolies do.

And the whole Motorola thing.  Buying Motorola?  Buying Motorola.  And I know that Andy Rubin says, no, we're going to run Motorola as a hands-off business  at arm's length.

They are all being invited to all the parties.  And, in fact, being invited to those parties is how they curry favor with their sources.  And so they have to be careful about what they say and they have to go to all the right  parties and talk to all the right people.  If you live in Silicon Valley or you live in Seattle or you live on Route 128 or any  one of those places, you are going to be sucked into that culture and you're going to make  friends with these people.  And every time you write a story, you're going to be going, oh, can I really...  Maybe I should tone this quote down because maybe this guy won't take my call the next  time I call him up or he'll snub me at the next party that I go to.  And it's really refreshing not to be in a culture like that.

But I feel that when you're in the milieu, I think it's critically important because  you get a second sense, kind of a deeper sense and understanding of things because you're  in the milieu, whether you go to the parties or not.

Wasn't this the Clippy era?  And it was completely patronizing.  And somebody on Twitter this week said, well, how is this different from Siri?  And I just went, let me count a thousand different ways.  The whole thing with Rover the dog, the search dog, it was an unnecessary distraction.  It was adding steps to a process that you should be simplifying.  Siri is a way...  They may go overboard slightly, but it is a way for you to construct a query in a way  that's familiar to you and to get an answer back in a way that's familiar to you.  And I don't think that they've imbued the thing with too much personality.  I think Apple's done that much.

Start time: 3853.96
End time: 3891.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Number eight, of course, is user account control going overboard, which it absolutely did.  It annoyed people.  In fact, it had the negative impact because people got to the point where you just say  cancel, cancel, cancel, whatever, or OK, OK, OK.  They stopped paying attention to it.  I think it was a good idea.  It was a good security model, but the problem is you bug people.  They're going to just say OK and keep going.  And then, of course, I agree with you on this.  The product copy protection in Windows, it wasn't enough just to have serial number protection.  Then they had to have genuine user, what is it called, Windows Genuine Advantage.  Like that's an advantage.

Start time: 3891.62
End time: 3906.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they've gone through several different names for it.  The problem with WGA, Windows Genuine Advantage, when it was introduced in 2006 and 2007 was  that it didn't work and it caught in one study.

Start time: 3906.86
End time: 3911.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3911.92
End time: 4048.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They admitted five percent, but I did my own independent study.  It was probably where I made my bones at ZDNet.  Forty-two percent of the complaints that they were getting in the first year for Windows  Genuine Advantage were people who were being unfairly tagged as pirates.  And it just wasn't right.  And I think over the course of three years, now, I will give, this is one of those cases  where Microsoft changed for the better as a result of getting criticism.  Even when I was pounding them every week on this for months, maybe a full year, I was  going up to Redmond and having these incredibly tense meetings with people.  And I would say, you need to do this.  And they would say, we're doing that.  And I would say, that's not enough.  And they made some very serious changes to what they had done.  And today, you have not heard users complaining about activation being a problem in the last  two years.  None.  It's a non-issue because they finally figured out that the tie goes to the runner.  Yes.  If there's any kind of a doubt.  And in fact, they had their original thing with a kill switch that they had for Windows  that would turn your screen black and after three days make Windows stop working.  Eventually, they came up with a switch that they have in their offices in Redmond that  If they detect that the activation servers are doing anything out of the ordinary, they  flip that switch and everything's OK.  Conflict is resolved in favor of the customer until they figure out what the issue is.  That's what they should have done all along.  And they finally figured that out.  But it was a couple years of nightmares.  And every single one of those people who were impacted by that, they say one bad recommendation  wipes out ten good ones.  And this is an example of where that was completely true.

Folks, if you are not yet an Audible member, ooh, you're missing out on the show.  Ooh, you're missing out.  Some great stuff on Audible.  Of course, we were talking earlier.  I do listen to the Audible books.  I feel it's just like reading.  And their book, the Steve Jobs book, is very nicely done.  And now this is a long book.  And you know, the best way to-  By the way, I'm not going to say anything, but you can get it on iTunes for like 30 bucks  or $19.59 on Audible.  They have the best price on this book.  Really nicely done.  Same exact book.  It's a Simon and Schuster production.  And it is a long book.  So this is the way I would list it, 25 hours.  But now that sounds like a lot.  And if you're reading it and you go fall asleep every three pages, it's going to take you a year to read it.  But I've read it an entire week because I spend time in cars.  So when you drive to work, that's a couple hours a day.  You pick up the kids at school.  You go to soccer practice.  You don't have to watch the game.  You can read a book.  You drive five minutes to this job.  You know, sometimes I drive around and around and around because I'm so excited by the book.  Just saying.  I do it while I'm in the gym.  Actually, you know where mostly I get my time in the gym is because that's an hour a day.  And I listen in the gym.  It's good.  Anyway, this is a fantastic book.  Highly recommended.  But there's so much more on auto.  You like Neil Gaiman?  I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan.  And they have done something new here.  Let me see if I can find the link on this.  Neil Gaiman.  It's a Neil Gaiman collection.  Introducing Neil Gaiman Presents.  So I'm reading American Gods, which is one of his great novels of all time.  But what he's done is he has selected books from Audible.  So if you like his style, you want to check this out.  This is from the Audible creation exchange.  Not Neil Gaiman books, but books that Neil loves and recommends.  See, that's great.  One of the things that's fun about Audible, it's a bookstore.  Seventy five thousand audiobooks and shows and speeches and stuff.  But the fun thing is it's like browsing a bookstore.  I just downloaded this.  It's supposed to be good.  Haruki Marukami's 1Q84.

And the books are yours to keep forever and ever and ever.  They work on the iPod, all the iDevices, but also the Zune, the Kindle, many GPS devices.  Of course, your PC and Mac.  I just love it.

I know you don't like me to say reading, even though I am.  After listening to the book, I found myself a little saddened.  Oh.  I felt like this was an unhappy man.  Who?  Mr. Jobs.

Start time: 4715.48

Picked some sexist picture of her.  They figured they had to put this ridiculously flattering photo, and I don't think she demanded it.  And the next thing you know, you see what she really looks like.  She's okay, because I thought she was a dingbat, and then I saw what she really looks like.  Oh, yeah. There is a big difference.

He listens to the radio show and he listens to iPad today.  Anyway, Steve said to me, is there any way, Leo, is there any way that I could collate my tweets?  Keep my tweets around?  Because he was writing some interesting stuff.  I asked you the same question once.  Well, and I told him, Gina Trapani has a great app called ThinkUp at ThinkUpApp.com.  But you have to run the server. You know, you have to install it as a server.  So I went to Gina and I said, would you mind if Steve Martin used your app on your server?  She said no. He's been collating the apps and now he's got a book.  It's a Twitter book.  He says, due to absolutely no demand, soon I'm publishing a book of my tweets.  Many of your replies included all profits to charity.  So there you go. There's the connection.  Cool. Isn't that cool? I think that's neat.  It's interesting.  He's very funny, actually.

He did claim to be tweeting from jury duty.  That's illegal, I believe.  And most of the time they block you from speaking to the phone.  It's so funny because he told me he was going on jury duty.  I asked him if he'd go on the Ski Cruise with me.  And he said, no, I have jury duty. He really did.  And then he tweets from jury duty, report from jury duty, defendant looks like a murderer, guilty, waiting for opening remarks.  But then he said he was just joking.  I like that.

Great for anybody who needs a reliable backup system but doesn't want to have to think about it.  I use it. I put it on my family's stuff, so they don't even have to know.

We have to protect the artist's rights.  And Jolie will back me up on this.  Most writers, for example, and most artists in general, to work for most of these companies today,  you have to sign away your rights. And so they end up with your copyright.  This doesn't protect anything but large corporations who have a lot of copyrights.  Disney being the perfect example.  This doesn't protect any artist. This is a bogus issue.  If artists were being protected, they would have passed a law that says you can't give up your copyright.
