This is twit this week in tech episode 104 for July 8th, 2007, blocked, unstuck and two months roaming.  This week in tech is brought to you by audible.com for your free audio book.  Visit audible.com slash twit.  It's time to twit.  Hello everybody.  This week in tech is on the air.  Joining us right now from the UK.  The only guy on the panel who can't get an iPhone, Mr.  Will Harris from willharris.co.uk.  Hey, Will.  Not only can't get an iPhone, but we can't hear him anymore.  That's nice.  That laughter in the background.  Patrick Norton from DL.TV.  His cohort from DL.TV is also here.  Mr.  Robert Heron.  How are your eyes, Robert?  My eyes are just about fully recovered.  I had a checkup about a couple of weeks ago and everything's perfect.  Yay.  You don't have to sit upright anymore, huh?  Or no, face down.  That was getting a, that was a challenge to say the least.  But as far as retinal reattachment surgery goes, it went, it went really, really well.  Good.  I'm glad to hear it.  We missed you and you're back on DLTV now.  I am indeed.  Although I'm on vacation right now.  All right.  Well, we've got some, some interesting high def stories for you in addition to the usual  components news, not a lot of iPhone news.  Well, there's a little bit, but also here actually to tell us a story of his own, Scott  Jordan, who we all know for and have known for a long time.  He's the founder of Scott E. Vest, which is a makes all the Twitter merchandise and is  a great place to go for geek gear.  Hey, Scott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How you doing, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see we're on the cover of Think, the front page of Think Geek this week.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got it up special today for the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thinkgeek.com or you can go to twit.tv and that's because we have those new hoodies, which  are really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not the USB Doomsday device hub?  Well, that too.  Like video watch with OLED screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can get that too.  I love Think Geek.  They're so great.  We, you know, we had, we've had trouble with merchandise.  And so finally we just said, we're going to go with the best.  And that's of course, Scott.  They do great stuff.  It's got e-vest and then for fulfillment, who better than Think Geek?  Yeah.  I like the USB Doomsday devices right under that.  The twit ultimate hoodie micro fleece.  Finally, we've got a, now I don't want to make a commercial for this, but finally we've  got a hoodie that really is just worthy of the name and it's worth it.  It's expensive.  It's not cheap, but if you really want a nice fleece hoodie, this is beautiful.  Soft.  Thank you, Scott, for doing a nice job.  I appreciate all your support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to enjoy your podcast.  We're going to enjoy your podcast every week as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to send one to, to all of you guys and anybody who wants one, go to twit.tv  or thinkgeek.com.  So Scott, you have a website, you do e-commerce.  The Scott e-vest site is, is it scottevest.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And like any sensible guy selling online, you wanted to put some sort of indicator on  the front page that you, you know, had security policies in place that your credit card was  safe, that kind of thing.  You've got the verified by GeoTrust and the BBB online reliability program, but you got  in a little bit of trouble with something, with another one.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I started seeing on just my own online shopping experience, all these  Hacker Safe emblems popping up on a lot of major websites.  And so I inquired with Hacker Safe, you know, you know, what the deal was.  And I was very interested to learn about what they do to provide a level of security  for your visitors and whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen sites with that Hacker Safe logo on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's amazing how many sites, especially recently, are using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what do they do to make, I mean, how do you earn that besides getting that money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You effectively pay a fee is what it amounts to.  And a fee that is much more than most typical small e-commerce sites, web hosting fees.  It amounts to about, I think it was like 1800 bucks a year, about five bucks a day.  And that's how they like to sell it, just five bucks a day.  And it will increase your conversion rates by up to 15%, they tell you.  And, you know, I was very intrigued by it.  And I tried to find out a lot about the technology beyond, you know, just, you know, putting a symbol up,  another logo up on my website to understand what they're really providing in terms of hacker-proof material.  And I had several phone calls with them and they had a very difficult time explaining their technology.  It seems as though their biggest selling point was that, look who else is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Technology. There's no technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, they say they do this, that, and they scan your computer every 15 minutes.  Oh, they do. Okay.  And over 75,000 websites are protected.  But it got a little interesting because I started thinking about it.  And just like you said, I was skeptical about the quote unquote technology beyond, you know, the SSL certificate  and other, you know, customary practices that my webmasters, you know, employ, you know, in port scanning and whatnot.  And it occurred to me that the primary reason to do this is to provide your users with a reason to let them feel safe.  So I came up with a symbol called hacker-proof.  And it just merely described what we were doing and guaranteeing 100% of hackers, you know, versus the 99.9% that they provide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't like that too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they didn't. They actually threatened litigation and insisted that we take it down.  And it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they say we have a trademark?  Well, actually, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.  They have a series of trademarks with the word hacker in it.  If you go to uspto.gov and search ScanAlert, you'll see they're very aggressive in their effort.  I didn't know you could trademark hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what terms do they have trademarked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't have that pulled up right now, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously, hacker-safe would be one of them, yeah.  I can understand that.  I mean, you don't want hackers and sites that are, you know, malicious sites to put that logo up.  I mean, you kind of want to protect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right?  Exactly. I mean, I can appreciate that, you know...  But they claim that you can't say hacker-proof either?  Well, hacker-proof, someone else had filed for that a number of years ago and they abandoned it.  And I felt that, you know, all the registrations...  And I was a lawyer in my prior life before I became a fashion designer for us geeks.  And I'm a bit familiar with the registrations and whatnot.  I don't think they had a legal leg to stand on.  We made it really clear that the symbol did not look anything like their symbol.  They used a green and white look and, you know, a little shield.  We used a lock similar to the SSL lock that appears in your browser.  Used red colors.  And they were very, very aggressive in their protection of this.  And rather than, you know, go about a lawsuit and a fight, even though I knew I would win,  I just decided it wasn't worth it.  I'd been sued by Scott USA for the ski poles and goggles.  Thought we were trying to copy them.  And IBM threatened to sue us at one point because the E and Scottie vest  resembled the E business solutions, all of which was unintentional.  I did not, you know, hope that people would confuse a clothing company with IBM or with a ski pole maker.  So, you know, it really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what this reminds me of is this green bar now that you're seeing in some browsers.  And that costs $1,500 a year.  What's that?  Well, it's the anti-phishing thing.  And Firefox does it.  IE7 does it.  But you have to get, you have to buy a certificate.  And, you know, it's a standard, which is great.  But this certificate, this extended validation certificate, or EVSSL, is very expensive.  And the whole, you know, it's interesting.  We're talking about it on security now.  The whole theory behind it is, well, in the old days, banks would build big buildings  because that way you'd know that the bank wasn't fraudulent because a fly-by-night company couldn't build a big building.  So we have to charge you $1,500 for this to prove that you're not a fly-by-night phishing site.  And that just didn't make a lot of sense to me.  But it has the upshot, and this does too, of if you don't have that green bar,  you don't have the HackerProof logo, then there's somehow this feeling that you're not really safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I think almost every site I've ordered things off of does not have the HackerProof green logo bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed Amazon doesn't do it.  Yeah, a lot of websites don't do them.  And I feel safer then.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, did you feel...  Once you're sensitive to it, you'll start to realize it.  It's pretty prevalent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not arguing that it's not prevalent, but I'm thinking about a lot of,  most of the major, most of the larger corporate e-commerce websites don't have anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The big ones don't do it.  I think they feel the same way as you do, Scott, like, who are these guys and why should we have to do this?  I'm glad that you decided not to cave into them, because I don't,  and I don't think anybody really is going to say, oh, I don't see that sign.  What is it?  I'm just sorry that you couldn't put your own sign up.  And it's a shame that they claim all rights to use the word hacker.  That sounds like their main IP right there.  Yes.  Those trademark names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And their lawyers backing it up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Scott, hey, it's great to talk to you.  I thank you for stopping by.  And I do want people to, it's safe to visit scottyvest.com.  Thank you.  I assure you.  And if you don't feel that way, well, you can always go to thinkgeek.com.  Either way, we'd love you to take a look at these new Twitter hoodies.  They're really great.  Scott, I'm going to let you go because Franklin Harris is on the other line.  I want to make sure that he can get on as well.  I appreciate it.  Thank you so much for joining us.  My pleasure.  Have a great weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scott Jordan, always been one of the great guys in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's great to talk to him.  And I have a box of care package for you guys.  So I will make sure you get it.  Leo, can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Couldn't I hear you before?  Oh, good.  No, you were saying that you couldn't hear me.  Oh, you had dropped off.  And then we...  Yeah, it's really weird.  Skype.  You know what's funny?  Yeah.  Patrick sounds great.  Yay.  I've always had trouble with...  Patrick's always had trouble with Skype.  Are you at work still or did you go home?  No, I'm at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm actually on...  I only pretty much only use two systems for this.  And this is actually running on my notebook rather than on the 4,000 megahertz desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the big story that broke today, Microsoft take a charge for $1 billion for Xbox 360 repair.  Holy moly.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  I was listening to a bunch of the one-up guys talk about this.  And the one thing nobody talked about was that Microsoft's going to miss a billion a  lot less than I'm going to miss a hundred.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think the key is that Microsoft is finally admitting something that Xbox 360 owners have  known for a long time, that the failure rate on these things is pretty spectacularly high.  That I would agree with.  Yeah.  Sometimes I think 30%.  It's hard to find an Xbox 360 owner who hasn't had a heat-related failure.  This summer, I think, they're dying in droves.  Have any of you had Xbox 360 problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I've had a friend who sent his back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say again, Robert?  My buddy just sent his back for an exchange for a new one.  And I don't believe it was heat-related at all.  I believe...  I really would love to know how many of these are more about the quality of the electricity  coming into a person's home than it does about the device itself.  And that new warranty that they've extended on the 360 is for the, I guess, the somewhat  infamous three red light error.  So if you do get one of those, you now have an extended one-year warranty on top of what  you already had.  The red ring of death, we call that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I mean, I've got a 360 and I know at least four friends that got 360s  and none of us have had any problems whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, Paul Theron knows everybody.  Paul's brought three back.  So I guess it's just, maybe Paul's skewing the average.  He said, I don't have...  I've had one for...  I bought one, I guess, last Christmas.  So it's only been six months, but I haven't had any trouble.  But I don't play with it every day.  I'm sure you play with it all the time, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not so much.  I mean, I play a few times a week.  I actually use it more for watching TVDs than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me too.  I'm getting a lot of email though from Xbox, frustrated Xbox 360 owners.  There's one site that asserts it's a 50% failure rate.  People are just freaking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just can't believe that they screwed up the manufacturing to that degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially a year and a half later, you'd think that they'd been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, you'd think that they'd have an understanding of what you can and can't put out in the marketplace.  I mean, the Xbox was a fairly reliable machine.  So what have they really stuffed up this time?  Like, it can't be anything in the design because they'd understand the design.  It must be something purely based on manufacturing, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, for one of a nail, a shoe was lost.  For one of a shoe, a horse was lost.  We don't know what's causing the failures.  Is it a problem with resistors?  Is it design flaws?  Is it inadequate cooling?  Is it a bad assumption about obvious temperatures?  Is Heron right?  Maybe they didn't bulletproof the power supply enough to compensate for voltage fluctuations in local areas.  I mean, there's so many places things can break.  And this is essentially a very complicated computer.  Microsoft's saying it's not any one problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say it has 1,700 components and 500 million transistors.  There's three power PC processors in there.  There is a lot of heat in that sucker.  Definitely.  But interestingly, if there had been an issue, you'd think they would have redesigned something with the Elite.  And that's pretty much the same, I think, internally anyway.  I'm sure it has a handful of those fixes, though.  My buddy, when he did swap out his last 360, which was about two weeks ago, he ended up getting the Elite.  And he claims it is a more stable unit compared to the first unit he had.  Certain games, especially for him, were driving him crazy back when Madden was still, I think it was Madden 2006 at the time.  But that was one title that we were never able to really get into because that was one that would simply lock up his console every time we tried to play it for any extended period of time.  And his new Elite, though, is at least so far has been dramatically more stable.  They also have a problem, people have reported, with gouging discs.  Has anybody seen this one where you put a disc in and it goes,  And then it'll come out.  That can happen on just about any game console that you can turn vertically or lay flat.  If you have it upright and you bang it and it starts rocking back and forth, or you lay it down while the disc is spinning, you run that risk.  So you think it's people running it sideways?  Or they're turning it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's also because it's one up has a really good interview with has a really good interview with Peter Moore that they put together today or yesterday.  Excuse me, not with Mike and sue me with Peter Moore.  And when he talks about like, you know, they've had 10 million units out there.  They're analyzing the data and they've been, you know, redesigning the machine as they go along.  But it does seem to be a lot of a lot of recurring issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you thought you'd buy a PlayStation 3 instead because of the rumors, there was going to be a hundred dollar price drop.  Dream on. Sony's president said, No, we're not dropping the price.  Even though nobody's buying the PS3, we're going to we're going to still try to get 700 bucks out of you for it.  No, because they just launched a five hundred dollar Blu Ray player and that has to be the low price Blu Ray player for at least six months.  That's a good point. They can't undercut the Blu Ray player.  Now, it was the PS3 was the cheapest Blu Ray player, but now it's so I think it's their BD 300.  Have you played with three other? Not yet.  But a friend of mine just bought one and I've been meaning to borrow it for an afternoon just to test it out.  I'm about to receive a Samsung's new BDP twelve hundred, which is a should be a very sweet Blu Ray player with a great video process.  Where do you come down on the Blu Ray HD DVD? Is there one that you think is better?  Yeah, personally, at the very given moment and since the beginning, I really feel that HD DVD had an advantage and still does for a couple of reasons.  One, the hardware has been consistent since launch.  There is no difference between a player you would have purchased at the beginning of the launch of the HD DVD format compared to today's hardware.  Whereas with the Blu Ray hardware, you're looking at significant changes before the end of the year to add things like persistent storage, like a little bit of flash RAM, a network connection for Internet enabled features.  All of these things are coming before the end of the year.  And while you will be able to play these new titles that support those features in the Blu Ray format on older players, you won't be able to take advantage of any of these new upcoming features unless you get yet another new piece of hardware to play it on.  That's really minor. If you love movies, it really doesn't matter.  Both formats offer literally identical performance in terms of resolution and audio support and everything else.  So there's really nothing there for me.  It is addictive. I mean, I watched the Xbox 360 HD DVD and it's just hard not to fall in love with it.  I mean, it looks so good.  You have a pretty decent HD TV as well.  So that's the whole thing is once you start really getting into the HD movies compared to you, you're spoiled almost immediately.  It's hard, hard to go back.  Survey says customers prefer plasma.  They surveyed a number of people and which is interesting, the widespread point of view that many customers have is that plasma is somehow better than LCD.  I can't get this. I know you said it depends on how you're where you're watching, right?  The thing I liked about that story was that they even made it clear that these weren't right out of the box.  These were they they set them up properly with LCDs and plasmas.  They actually sat them down in front of it and said, what do you like better?  Right. And and you know what?  It doesn't surprise me. I think a few things probably viewing angle has something to do with that.  Even with the better LCDs out there right now, if you get as little as 15 or 20 degrees off center, you start to see significant color loss and things like that.  And the whole motion performance thing was brought up.  There is significant blurring compared to other display technologies when you look at LCD versus a plasma display or or most reprojection technologies, too.  So if you look at a lot of fast moving images, well, the one that gives you the clearer picture is going to cause less eye fatigue and usually more pleasurable, pleasurable to watch.  I do like how plasma looks, I have to say.  The only thing that plasma really had kind of slipped on a little bit was just straight up resolution, putting more pixels on the screen.  But now, especially with the latest release of Panasonic's glass, they're offering 42 to 65 inches in all sizes in between available at 1080p now.  And I'm looking forward to seeing that.  However, though, I was in the store shopping for a new 50 plus inch flat panel for a friend of mine.  And we looked I was trying I was staring him toward the plasma displays.  But in store lighting, that glass that you see with the plasma is glare everywhere.  And the bright, detailed picture you get with an LCD with minimal reflection is it's hard to ignore that.  And he ended up going LCD for that for that reason alone.  So, huh? Yeah, I think in a bright room, you do want to go LCD generally.  Almost. But however, I just finished a review of Samsung's new 52 inch T series LCD.  And they put a clear coat on top of the display that makes it look very plasma like.  And it does improve black level and color color saturation, the apparent color saturation anyway.  But but it now takes that one thing that LCD kind of had really dominated.  And that was the the matte screen. It's good at minimizing light reflections.  And now here it is glossy and reflective as can be, which is kind of funny.  Bad day for piracy. All well, bad and then the good again.  All of MP3 has been shut down by the Russian government.  We've been talking about all of MP3, I think, since Twit began.  This is the site looked so professional, so real claim to be paying for them.  Yeah, claim to be paying money to artists through some Russian agency.  Finally, after pressure from the World Trade Organization, the Kremlin has taken the website down.  Oh, by the way, it's like Whack-A-Mole.  There's it's already back up with a different name. All the same songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think they'll? Yeah.  And if you've got an account of all of MP3, you've also got an account of the new one as well.  Yeah, isn't that interesting? MP3sparks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is down at the moment. Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Do you think the Russian government really has the will to keep following these guys around and shutting them down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got the will to join the WTO. Maybe they do.  Yeah. Oh, you're right. MP3sparks is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh. Huh huh huh. But I want to buy cheap pirated music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aww. Well, you know, it's I mean, you laugh, right?  But I mean, think about it. You know, you're essentially, you know, international policy is being declared by the recording industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's right. There is a dictated. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So on one hand, it's like, OK, you know, stopping piracy.  It's good for Americans. But on the other hand, it's like, wow, doesn't our federal government have more interesting things to lean on people about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got three stories that really belong together, but I'm not sure how they could be tied together.  Bill Gates, no longer the world's richest man. He will be speaking at CES and NASA buys a 19 million dollar toilet.  Somehow these belong together.  How about a moment of silence?  For how long? He's been like 13 years. He's been the world's richest man. Bill Gates now number two.  Behind who?  Carlos Slim, the guy with the billionaire with the best name in the world.  That is. That's got to be a fake name. A new pseudonym.  Hello, I am Carlos Slim. I'm worth sixty seven point eight billion dollars.  But what it shows really is the value of telecommunications.  Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, he has Mexican telecom stocks did him well.  America mobile. But, you know, if you look at the top, what is it, 50 billionaires or whatever the kids at 50 or 100?  There's a lot of telecom guys new on this list.  I mean, telecom is definitely the place to be right now.  And I think that shows you what's happening in software was the place to be.  Michael Dell and Bill Gates are still on the list, but you're seeing these telecom guys up and coming big time.  Is any of it VOIP related or is it really just the people with the hardware out there doing things like cellular technology?  Cell phones, pretty much, isn't it?  It seems that way.  Carlos Slim, he also owns part of Cop USA.  Bill Gates has been doing the keynote at CES for the last 10 years.  Might be his last time, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll be stepping down next year, isn't he?  As chief architect or whatever he is at Microsoft.  And so this is going to be his final hurrah.  We talked about this in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We weren't sure if he'd come back in CES 08.  And now he said yes.  I think I'm going to have to go to CES this year just to see it, just to say goodbye.  Don't you think? It'll be like Elvis retiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Gates' keynotes at CES are always actually pretty well received.  Although a lot of people sort of criticize him for being a sort of maybe not the best public speaker all the time,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the stuff that he does there is usually pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, he had the memorable one with Conan and stuff a while ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But unlike Steve, there's always something that breaks.  Like Jobs, like, you know.  That's part of the fun of it.  Yeah, it's like what's going to fail for, you know, for Microsoft Gates on this keynote presentation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't have the suave sophistication of Steve Jobs.  But what they do is they spend a lot of money and they get big name celebrities and they get make special movies.  And so it is more entertaining.  I mean, the set is beautiful.  This is going to be this will be I think this will be a big one, right?  This is this is unless he's going to come back.  He even said this in January, unless they want me to come back and talk about world immunization.  I'm not going to have a lot to say after 2008.  So who would who would you bring in for CES 2009?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's his year, isn't it?  He's the Elvis.  He's the Elvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who do you get to talk Bill Gates?  Well, it's going to be Steve Jobs, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even though Apple is such a small player in the PC world?  Are they maybe by 2009, they won't be such a small player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're also defining the PC Gates isn't the head of isn't the keynoter at CES because he's he's he's hard to the PC world because they're probably investing the most money and buying the biggest.  Oh, there you go.  Yes.  And what am I taking over the consumer electronics world where am I?  The iPod owns what?  Eighty seven percent of the MP3 player, which is, you know, but Apple doesn't buy a booth at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there is a music show, though.  It's really about personal computers and computing technology.  CES is not about computing technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about everything.  It's about everything.  Everything.  Computing.  It just you know, it just because it's so.  How about Carlos Slim?  Let's get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't really.  I should take that back to there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is some really high end audio as well.  It is.  Yeah, there's TVs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comdex is just gone.  I mean, that was the computer show.  That's gone.  What's that?  What was com?  You know, someday we'll be saying, you remember there was some.  Remember, there was something called Comdex.  People go, what are you talking about, Grandpa?  Shut up and play with your iPhone.  I saw my first Ethernet adapter.  OK, we've been putting off the iPhone stories are quite a few cringy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.  One one one question before the iPhone festival.  Anybody care about E3 being next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You remember the electronic public, though, or is it even what happened?  Remember they closed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've moved it.  It's interesting, right?  It's no longer the big giant show at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  They've got it in Santa Monica.  For the guys that are going down there, they've got to do appointments all over hotels, all over Santa Monica.  And then I guess that's not a big convention town.  Well, what's interesting is they are going to be using an aircraft hangar to have a somewhere near there, I guess, in Santa Monica to have sort of a central zone to keep the convention center.  Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Bureau or something.  This is the rumor I was told from from E3 has always been in L.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Number one in the L.A.  Convention Center.  If they're not using that, then well, oh, boohoo.  I guess they're just spreading it out.  But I thought it was shut down.  Is it practically shut down?  It's back now as a kind of a what is it?  A press only event?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's basically a press only event.  And it's more of a it's more of an affiliated gathering of sweets than an actual sort of big center event.  It's going to be interesting here.  The guys, the game guys are actually freaking out because they've got to go to instead of being able to like run around the show floor and figure out what the big surprise stories are, because, you know, you kind of go and know them what a lot of the big stories are going to be.  They've literally got to do like 20 vendor meetings on the first, you know, on the Wednesday, the first day of the show to figure out what everybody's got.  So they're running all over the place.  Well, yeah, when.  But I mean, think about it, dude.  If you're if this whole event is about the press and you're starting out by, you know, ticking off the press.  That sounds like every other trade show we do.  I know, but E3 sounds like it sounds like my experience at E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a zoo.  I'd love to see them break that up and shrink it down.  Even CES.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it seems like they've actually made it even uglier than CES because instead of everybody being in a hotel and running from suite to suite or from like, you know, booth to booth and that nightmare at the end of the show.  And then they're running from the booth and that nightmare at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  They've got people that you're going to have to get into a car in L.A. and drive to your meeting in the next hotel.  But it's just like it's so funny.  It's like, is, you know, is anybody the other thing it said, it's going to change the way people are marketing their games because they're not going to be spending all the money on the booths.  And there's going to be a lot more junket based coverage and promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sort of pseudo competing event, which is a couple of months later in Santa Monica, right, which is open to the public.  So there's like they've taken the massive E3 event and split it up into sort of the journalistic end and the public end.  And, you know, conceivably, it could cost more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't, you know, there's so much money in gaming.  I don't think it really matters, does it?  It's going to it's going to go forward no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does if you're one of the smaller titles at a place like EA.  You feel like you're wasting it because they basically they pull what I never knew is they pull they pull the money for these big trade shows or for E3.  They pulled it out of the individual marketing budget for every game rather than being some real corporate expense.  So that's why a lot of the product managers have hated E3, not just because it was kind of a, you know, strange place where they're getting yelled at by angry blogging children,  but because, you know, it was pulling their marketing budget away for this big central effort.  So they pay a help pay for this huge booth where nobody pays attention to their game because super giant first person shooter is taking all the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see this story about the guy killed by his cell phone exploding?  No, I don't know, because it comes from China, although it's published by Wired, a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a like a wire story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't say what the provenance is of this.  A worker died yesterday, almost three weeks after his cell phone exploded in his chest pocket.  Zhao Jinping of Gansu, China, had a Motorola handset and they said that maybe it was the high temperatures.  Official investigations are underway.  Reports seem to imply the phone was so badly damaged that ascertaining the exact model is proving difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? Back in 2003, there were a bunch of Nokia phones that were exploding and burning people.  And it was almost a Nokia claimed it was almost entirely due to bad counterfeit batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bad batteries. I think that's the case, because the key on a lithium ion battery is you got to stop charging when it's full.  If you keep going, bye bye.  And if these cheesy batteries don't have the proper circuitry, you could be in trouble.  Let's see what this is from. It's from newlaunches.com. I never even heard of this site.  There's a picture of the phone there. It doesn't look good.  Motorola's Beijing representatives say the company is not to be blamed and think that it was either a fake cell phone or a fake battery.  I think that's probably the case.  Nevertheless, scary.  For that poor bastard, maybe.  Maybe that's why Apple didn't allow you to remove the battery. There's no chance of it exploding now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know what else is up on that website?  What?  Will, your suffering will soon be over. Amazon UK starts advertising the iPhone at 329 pounds. December 1st is the delivery date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much is that in real money?  Oh, yeah.  Not that much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's rubbish. If you've been a Brit following the iPhone all week, there's just been rumor after rumor after rumor about which carrier.  It looks like O2 now, right?  No, because that story ran with the typical sources close to the deal and then O2 denied it.  Then it was, oh, Vodafone has it, sources close to the deal. No, that was done.  Then, oh, there's a T-Mobile graphic in the, no, well, they denied it.  T-Mobile got it in Germany, right? Orange has it in France.  No, because it's all rumors. Nobody has confirmed anything.  The trouble is eventually, every reporter on the planet eventually ends up saying that everybody has got the contract and then somebody is right a month down the line.  One of them will definitely have it.  Yeah, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cringely says the good news is that there will be, what Apple's strategy was, now Cringely is just making this up, I understand, but this is his thesis.  Apple's strategy was they would, you know, they want to have a big Christmas selling season.  They rolled it out now so they get all the bugs worked out and they'll ship the 3G phone with everything fixed for Christmas.  So maybe you're going to get the good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's add Patrick back in. He got bumped off. Sorry about that.  You don't believe that? Why not, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because, I mean, they're saying that the main concern with 3G was battery life, really, and the rollout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's true. Anybody who has an HSDPA phone knows it. It just, pshh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But are you serious? Are you thinking that in the next four months they can advance battery technology, create a new hardware revision, and roll out a new cellular network across the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it will be a tricorder that can be able to diagnose any illness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? I think they can do it.  I think this is like the beta iPhone that Leo spent hundreds of dollars on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $600 and waited in line six hours. And since my time is worth, gosh, hundreds of dollars an hour, really the effective cost of this was thousands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you really need to hire an intern to wait on line to buy your products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was so sweet. Dane came and sat with me.  We'll just go in the very next day and buy it without the line.  I know. Isn't that funny?  Actually, most places sold out.  They are sold out now.  Some did, but...  Lots of people told stories about walking in even that evening after the line cleared and just strolling in saying, I'll take two.  Anyway, I had to, I have a reason. It wasn't because I, you know, I had to have it for the radio show the next day and I just need...  Yeah, right.  I did. Imagine me going on the radio and saying, the iPhone looks pretty good. Don't have one.  I had to have one so I could review it.  I'm still using it, by the way. I'm pretty happy with it. I like it.  There are obvious negatives on the thing.  It's been hacked already and guess who did it? DVD John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not my favorite DVD John hack.  It's like, okay, so, you know, you can sort of not activate it and have Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi web browsing and MP3 play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A $700 iPod is basically what we've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. The best 8 gigabyte iPod ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have to say it is a great iPod. I mean, A plus on this one. Apple definitely made the best iPod they've ever made.  It's beautiful. I mean, the screen is stunning and it's great to watch video on.  It's great to listen to music on. Cover Flow works.  So there's no question about that. It's a pretty good phone.  I have the biggest issues are, you know, the fact that it's a locked platform.  I can't think of a single smartphone that doesn't let you at least I would like to replace the stock button.  Couldn't care less what Apple's stock price is with something useful like a to-do list, which doesn't come on the phone.  It's just bizarre.  I mean, I think it is a 30 minute or longer phone call with the iPhone yet.  No, I don't usually talk that long. Why? What happens?  I was just saying it just seems uncomfortable to hold that.  Oh, yeah, you know. Yeah, I agree with you.  Face for anyone at the time.  So you probably wouldn't want to do that. But you know, the earbuds that come with it actually work very well. Sound very good too.  There you go.  So for as a hands-free, it works fine. It works with any Bluetooth hands-free device as well.  And Apple will have its highly overpriced version soon, I believe.  There are some issues about singular voicemail being or AT&T singular voicemail being susceptible to caller ID spoofing.  It's been weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been a singular customer for a while and watching this AT&T singular conversion has been very peculiar as a customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what you use is you get a calling card from spoofcard.com and that lets you spoof your caller ID.  You call your cell phone. This is to test to see if the problem exists on your system.  With your spoof card, when it asks you what number you want to spoof, you enter your number again.  Don't answer the phone when the call goes to voicemail.  See if you can listen to your messages without being prompted for a password.  Apparently, many people have this problem.  You just spoof your number. Pretend you're calling yourself.  Because it looks and says, well, clearly if the person has the originating number, it must be you.  But of course, you can spoof that number.  Wow.  So I think that's just turn on the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just bad behavior, isn't it? So you have to go in and turn on the password.  Turn on the password and you don't have to worry about it.  Pretty leaky security there, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, the spoof cards, though, people have used those to emulate people they wanted to pretend to be.  They were calling from there was a representative's office that somebody hacked.  So people were getting calls, bad mouthing a representative, supposedly from his own office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, let's add Franklin Harris on to the call here right now.  If you want to leave, Patrick, I know you had to go at 430. If you want to split, you can.  Oh, I'm late. It's been a pleasure, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks. Thanks, Pat.  Watch DL.TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please do. Yeah. Anything else you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, have a great weekend.  That's a good thing to plug.  Oh, and Moms in, not in Salina, in, yeah, Salina, Utah.  What is it, a race?  It's a restaurant.  Moms in Salina, Utah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moms.  Moms. Really?  Moms Cafe in Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You ate at a place called Moms and you lived?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It started in 1928. It was a venerable institution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The original Moms.  It may be the original Moms. My wife highly recommends the blueberry sour cream pie.  I will stick with the scones.  Not Salina, Kansas, Salina, Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Salina, Utah.  Moms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, 10 East Main Street. You can't miss it. Just north of 70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't have a website, but there are reviews of them.  Yes.  At roadfood.com, splendidtable.publicradio.org. It apparently is quite well known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's a classic. And by the way, the folks, the new biography of the Road Foods folks is an outstanding read.  They just wrote a book.  Who are they? Is that the old folks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the couple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the couple that rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've interviewed them. They're wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and they just wrote a book. Two for the Road. I don't know how recently they wrote it, but it's basically kind of an autobiographical discussion of finding all these hometown small restaurants. It's an epic read. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moms. So we've got two plugs. I don't know. I'm going to have to look and see if that's on audible.com because that could be our Audible Book of the Week. We'll find out.  Thank you, Patrick. Oh, my pleasure. Take care. Take care.  Patrick had to run and for people who are saying, where is Dvorak? He couldn't make it today, but we've got Franklin Harris on the line along with Will Harris. So that's very confusing. And Robert Heron. It's the H's version of twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not even going to attempt my British accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frank is actually an L, but I always think of him as a Harris. Hey, Frank, how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good, good. How is everyone doing this fine day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frank is a good friend who's been on the call for help in the lab many times and also has promised, has sworn to hack the iPhone. Now you have to drive to Buffalo to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually did on release day drive all the way to Buffalo only to find out that I needed a credit card drafted at a US bank before the AT&T store would give it to me.  So you didn't get one?  No, there was like there was 60 people in line at the Apple Store in the Walden Gallery in Buffalo and like five at the AT&T store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man, I'm sorry. So we'll get you one. We'll get you one. There have been some hacks. We mentioned the DVD John hack, which is underwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I was looking over the source code. I downloaded the source code directly from his site where he released the activation server.  And it seems to me that the interaction between iTunes and the activation system at AT&T is not encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's nice. So that's how I figured it out. He just sniff sniffed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Snip sniff the traffic. I mean, someone was bound to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People have also figured out that you can remove the SIM card. There's all sorts of shenanigans. You can play with that.  You can't take your existing SIM card, though, and pop it into your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can't. But you can't take your iPhone SIM card and pop it into any AT&T phone. If you want to travel somewhere and maybe not damage your iPhone. That works just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real question is how soon before we can get Will Harris an unlocked iPhone?  Yes, please God.  As soon as I ask for your benefit and for Frank's benefit, I asked AT&T when I was there and they said, well, here's the issue is if you roam for more than two months in a country outside of the US, we will brick your iPhone.  And it's in the contract. So I could I could bring it over. You could use it for two months, but we'd have to get it back in the US every two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they're also. Yeah, like you have to building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're probably Robert. You're saying there's services that will do this.  I believe so. Definitely for what?  For the price. You just put it on the Virgin Atlantic. You call you make one call in the US and you fly back.  I was going to say, can we activate one here and just send it to Europe for him?  Well, that's the problem. You do that. But you can. And absolutely.  And or if I go to Canada and I could bring one up for Frank and Amber and everybody.  But the problem is after two months in Canada being used in Canada, it'll stop working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also the other problem is that I would have to pay American roaming charges for every call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another reason why. And this is actually good to know. That's how you can get out of a contract because because they don't want you to roam that much because they end up serving a lot of that cost.  So I was reading there was supposed to be a software push for the iPhone yesterday. Did that happen?  Oh, really? Was it updated? That's what I was told.  Or I was reading they were they were talking about July 5th being the I didn't. Great software push for a new update.  And I was just curious if anybody had seen it. It hasn't happened yet.  I had heard rumors that that would happen, but I think my iPhone today and it did not give me any new software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're still at one point. But I mean, people are predicting that the it'll be unlocked before the weekend is done.  Frank, what do you think? I'll put my money on that. I'll definitely put money on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I maybe not the weekend, but definitely by mid next week, people have taken this thing apart.  They've already figured out the root password for the actual version of of OS 10 that's on the software.  Now, what does that give you? If you if you can get the root password, was it what advantage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now? Absolutely nothing. But direct access to the operating system, which will allow people to figure out exactly what type of security they've got to keep their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lockdown or what's called the PLU code for the phone to unlock it.  So is there a central site where this is going on that you could go to to keep an eye on things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most of the discussions are well, most of the discussions are happening on kind of backroom IRC channels, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where I've been hiding out under an unassumed alias.  What people are doing. So unlock your iPhone dot com is not necessarily the place to go to find out what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't that Scott Borne site? No, Scott Borne has not done that site yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be very I'd be you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Question I've got was how are they pushing out the software?  They doing it over the network or will they be doing it with the Wi Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anyone know? Won't be Wi Fi.  It will be through iTunes.  As far as I know, the same way that you update an iPod is a firmware update that iTunes will apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, iTunes has in on its iPhone.  You know, when you when you dock an iPhone, you get just like you do with Apple TV or an iPod, you get a new page, a new a new button on your iTunes.  It's your iPhone.  And right on the front there, it says, how often do you want me to check for firmware updates?  And you can check.  So in other words, if you want, I don't think if you unlock it using this DVD, Dijon unlock, even if you're using the Wi Fi, I think you're safe.  I don't think anyone knows you're on an iPhone and will stop you.  You have to be on the store and iTunes and and revert right back to the pre activation state on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you'd have to get a fresh iTunes, though, wouldn't you?  Because you've hacked. You have to hack the iTunes as well as the iPhone for DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John's thing to work. Yeah.  But I mean, you just install iTunes, you use a friend's copy of iTunes or a different computer you might have laying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I you know, it's it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been a, you know, there's been a lot of people that have been on iTunes for a long time.  It's it's interesting.  There's been a backlash against iPhone.  A lot of people affect a lot of the press.  I think covering iPhone failures may be a little bit more assiduously, enthusiastically than they would have had there not been so much promotion on the iPhone.  Chiefly, what chiefly comes to mind and one that got a lot of coverage in all the local news is the MSNBC reporter Joe Hutzco, who had an iPhone die on him.  But but but I mean, they sold a million of these guys.  Kevin had a lot of problems with his iPhone.  Kevin's was rebooting all day. He brought it in.  Kevin Rose were talking about trying to get him on the show.  Couldn't do it. He's very busy. He's got a new product.  We'll talk about that new site. We'll talk about that in a second.  But yeah, his died. But but as with Hutzco, you bring it in to Apple and they say, oh, well, here's a new one.  I mean, it's not like it's not like a big deal.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's created a marketing frenzy with this thing.  People are bound to unlock it.  There's people all over the world like Will and myself that are just dying to get not only our hands on one, but one that actually has the phone features enabled.  And, you know, it's that's the key, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't care if it's a you don't want a seven hundred dollar iPod or a five.  Well, I kind of do. Oh, you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not against it.  I mean, if it's that or nothing, I will probably take that.  But it will be like constant torment.  I see.  Pick it up and realize that you can't phone on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could just take your Nokia N95.  You tape it duct tape it to the back of the iPhone and then it's a.  Hey, that'll work.  Did they allow you to save your contact list or anything like that online somewhere?  So if you do have to trade in your phone, you would make it really.  Yeah, because it's all.  Well, no, no, you don't need that Mac.  It's all synced anyway.  Soon as you know, it's coming from on the in the case of the Mac, it's coming from address book and I call on the on on Windows is coming from Outlook.  So you never you don't really lose anything, I don't think.  And because it's such a lockdown phone, it's not like you have any other applications on there.  You have to restore.  Good point.  All you can do is, you know, get it, get it.  Basically, the way you got it, the day you activated it, when it synced up your phone numbers and everything.  I think that's one of the things that the iPhone does very well, by the way, is it's very clean.  It's not as good on the Windows side as you might imagine.  It does sync with Outlook and Outlook Express for your contacts.  But the calendar thing only works with Outlook.  There's no, as I said, there's no to do list.  It doesn't sync the here's what's weird.  It doesn't sync the notes.  There's a notes application, but it doesn't sync it with anything.  It's only on the phone.  Almost useless.  Yeah.  I mean, what's the point?  OK, I got a note on my phone.  This feels like it's not finished, to be honest with you.  It's great.  It works.  It does the job.  But it feels like there's more to go.  There's something else they could do with this.  I just, I don't know.  Anyway, maybe you guys will hack it.  Are you having any issues bookmarking websites?  You were saying something about that earlier, but would you then be able to say use an online calendar and just have that page bookmarked?  You could, but do you have to, what I'd like to do, it's not that it's an issue doing it, but what I'd like to do is replace some of the buttons I don't use.  There's a weather button and a stock button.  You should be able to replace that with a bookmark to say an online to-do list or an online something else.  For instance, you can use Google's applications on the iPhone.  They work quite well, but you should be able to bookmark them, right?  Yes.  I mean, you can bookmark them.  You just have to launch Safari.  So Apple's saying, oh, fine, develop applications, but your platform is Safari.  But Safari does not appear with everything else.  There's no way to take a bookmark and put it right up on the front page.  So I'm stuck with this stupid stock.  Now, I'm sure Apple will fix this.  Maybe even by the time you hear this show at Apple will fix this.  I don't know.  I just can't believe they're going to force us to look at the Apple stock price instead of my to-do list.  I don't care about stocks that much.  Kevin Rose has a new company.  He has started something with his buddies, Leah Culver and Daniel Berka.  Daniel is the great designer who is the designer for dig.com.  And Leah is a well-known programmer who's been around the Bay Area for some time.  And it's called Pounce.  Have any of you guys tried Pounce yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like crack, Leo.  It's become like crack in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Franklin Harris, you're a Pouncer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't seem to get off it.  I got to let everyone now know.  I mean, I was doing this with Twitter, but for some odd reason there's this invite junkie syndrome that Pounce has created.  I got to let everyone know at every second of the day everything I'm doing.  Do you think Pounce is more compelling than Twitter?  I like the features of being able to send files and links and directing your posts either to group because you can group your friends in certain groups or directly to a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  P-O-W-N-C-E dot com.  Unfortunately, it's invite only.  And I don't know if this is good or bad, but unlike Twitter and unlike Jaiku, which I also use, you can't...  For Jaiku, you could go to my page whether you're a member or not and see what I'm saying.  You can't do that with Pounce.  You got to sign up.  You got to get an invite.  Robert, are you or Will, are you on Pounce at all?  No.  I don't need another instant messaging client, unfortunately.  It's more than an instant messenger.  I don't know exactly how to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't want to rain on anybody's parade here because I'm sure Kevin's thought about it a lot.  But it's a combination of Twitter.  I've got Twitter.  It's like send files to your friends.  Well, great.  I've got email or instant message or FTP.  Send events to your friends.  Well, I've got upcoming or email or any number of shared calendar things.  And then it's share links and texts with your friends.  Well, I've got SMS or email lists or whatever.  Do I really need all of those things again?  And so I'm not sure I get it really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If that's an applet that would be brought over to the iPhone, it would probably be awesome.  Aha.  Yes. And that's kind of what it needs.  I use Jaiku, which is...  Jaiku is kind of...  If there's a continuum, there's Twitter, which is basic and simple.  And a lot of people like it for that reason.  It's very easy to get.  Pounce is kind of in between that and Jaiku.  Jaiku has more features.  Pounce is very pretty.  But there are ways to do it on Safari, all three of them.  But there's no dedicated client.  You have to use the browser to do it.  And then you also have to use the iPhone keyboard, which is a mixed bag.  I mean, some people say, oh, no, just give it time.  Apple says trust it.  If you trust it, it will work.  It's like the force.  For the file, the grouping features and everything else that you've named so far,  those are all things that I've had available to me within...  Sure.  Like...  Adium or Trillium.  Trillium or any of those clients, really.  And I get the support of multiple IM engines.  Good point.  So...  Why is it better than the IAM, Franklin Harris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just seems...  You and your public notes had said something about Pounce that really made a lot of sense to me  and probably to the general public.  You kind of do what your friends do, right?  I mean, if you got this grouping of people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the same with IAM, isn't it?  If your friends are on AIM, you're going to use AIM.  If they're on ICQ, use ICQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a few features that are still lacking.  They don't have SMS support yet.  They aren't working on it, from what I understand.  And really, you can only update it through their client, their desktop client,  which is written in AIR, I believe, or via the web page.  I'm sure they'll work all the kinks out.  The problem with Twitter is there's a lot of people that we're sending feature requests in,  and their dev cycle has been really slow at updating stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if that's the case or if they don't want to.  And I think they may want to keep it very simple.  That's the appeal of Twitter, right?  You know, Jaiku, which has a lot of features, drives...  Some people go...  I admit, when I first went there, I had the same reaction.  I don't understand. It's too much. I don't get it.  It's too complicated.  Pounce is kind of nicely in between.  We'll see. You may be...  How do you spell Jaiku?  J-A-I-K-U dot com.  K-U.  Yeah. It's Finnish.  That's the other question.  Can a Web 2.0 company that's not in the San Francisco Bay Area succeed?  I mean, both Twitter and Pounce are in San Francisco and benefit from that,  because we're friends of Kevin. We know Kevin. We join Pounce.  We're friends of Ev. We're joined Twitter.  You are a featured member of Jaiku.  That's right. Yeah.  About half of Jaiku's users are following me, because I'm in a very public way.  You were out of commission when this happened, but I moved from Twitter to Jaiku,  because it was confusing people.  Twitter sounds so much like Twitter. It was confusing.  So I went to Jaiku. I like Jaiku. I still use it.  But Pounce is appealing.  But I guess the question, and you really raised this, Robert, is why do we even need these new ways of socializing?  Don't we already have that with IM?  I don't mind a new technology, especially one that wraps up a lot of things I like doing anyway.  But I still need to maintain my backward compatibility to the IM clients and other clients that I know most of my other friends are already using.  And I'm not going to get everyone to switch.  That's my big thing.  Moving on to, and I'm sorry, Patrick's not here for this, because I know he'd have something to say about it.  I'm sorry about it.  AMD announced it's investing $7.5 million in Transmeta.  Is that money being thrown away?  What's that all about?  A low-power computing necessary to expand probably a product line they just don't have.  Maybe AMD needs a patent or two that Transmeta has.  Could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because AMD's really got $7.5 million to throw into another company.  They're still paying for ATI, right?  Right, and trying to fund their ridiculous stock price buying notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you guys think about the new AMD processors?  We're starting to see benchmarks and hear stories about...  Look, they're still a little ways off, but AMD is right now getting handed their...  Intel's just clobbering them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just don't have it.  Will they, though, with these new processors?  No.  Back at the beginning of the year, Barcelona, native quad core was going to launch two months  ago, and it was going to come in 2.8 GHz.  It was going to hand Intel its butt.  Here we are two months later.  It's not coming out until next month.  Even then, you're only getting the 2 GHz version, which is nowhere near approaching the performance  of the current Xeons that Intel has out.  The proper Barcelona product, anything with a decent speed, you're not going to get until  Christmas by which time Intel would have re-revved everything anyway.  It's just too little, too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When they're talking about these two points...  The Inquirer published some notes, I guess, from an AMD marketing presentation.  When they're saying the 2.6 GHz Barcelona, they're talking about a part that's not even  available now.  It won't be available.  It isn't going to exist for another three or four months.  When they're saying it beats the Clover Town, it's meaningless.  Absolutely.  What about Phenom?  This is next year's chip.  Yeah, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if they can deliver it, it's a low-power version.  Great, but so far they haven't delivered anything that they've promised in the last nine months.  There's no reason to think that's going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The attitude is, show me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Believe it or not, we'll see it.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is the attitude.  Yeah.  That's too bad because I think it's really important that AMD provide a credible alternative  to Intel.  Otherwise, we're back to where we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, AMD has the potential to put out a lot of cool stuff.  I mean, they undoubtedly have some really good chip designs.  Barcelona is a good chip design.  They've just completely dropped the ball when it comes to actually getting these things  made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it the process is too difficult?  Is it that they don't have the facilities, the fabs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the infrastructure that Intel has.  The one thing that Intel does really, really well is it really makes stuff very well.  They have some great fabs.  They keep restocking them with the latest technology.  They have a really quick turnover.  AMD has forever been struggling to keep up to build new fabs, new facilities.  There was the rumor last month that they were just going to kill all their fabs and outsource  all their manufacturing elsewhere.  So bad has their execution been on this front.  And so they just need to get better at making stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's too bad.  I'm rooting for them.  But when I see them spending money on things like Transmeta, I have to wonder what the  heck.  Must be a patent.  They must be a patent they want.  There must be some IP there that they need.  It wasn't a great couple of months here either for Intel in terms of at least that microcode  update that they pushed for the Core 2 series processors.  That was something that was affecting the server sides for major companies, including Dell.  They issued their own major update for that.  So you can update the microcode on these things?  Apparently through BIOS updates and in addition to...  In addition to code updates that were pushed.  What is it?  Jump to the BIOS if there's to patch the code?  That's wild.  Not exactly sure about that.  But it was just apparently the main issue was that they were getting some blue screens  and other specific crashes related to server environment computing.  Interesting.  You know, it's on the high end.  Yeah, Intel is just kicking butt right now.  But for some of the value end processors for regular computing, not necessarily the state  of the art server or the high end gamer, I think either platform offers some great value right now.  So AMD is still okay?  Yeah, unless you're strictly focusing on the high end server and the people who want the latest  and greatest gaming boxes in my opinion.  AMD would be an acceptable choice for anybody who's surfing the net and wants word processing.  Oh heck yeah.  Either company has some great value parts out there right now.  But for the last nine months, like Will was saying, it's just kind of depressing to see them slip  this far and not ship product.  Another interesting, the most interesting stories this week were telecommunications stories.  Google buys Grand Central, which is I think a really interesting service.  I haven't used it, but I know people who have.  It's invite only, although I don't think it's too hard to get one.  Does anybody here use Grand Central or have tried it?  Nobody?  The idea is it's a kind of a follow me service.  It's got VoIP capabilities, messages come in your email.  It's been free, which is kind of neat.  Google says Google will continue to run Grand Central.  It will remain operational.  Uninterrupted service for current customers.  I'm not sure whether new customers will be allowed.  It's still free, although Google may charge at some point.  It says we'll send out a limited number of invitations during the beta period,  but we'll open the service to the public in the near future.  It's a very interesting service, and I think it's a smart play for Google.  They already own Dialpad.  They're getting telecommunications like in every other business, frankly.  It's pretty amazing what Google's up to.  Any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called a glorified asterisk for an infinite service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frank, I wish we had a better VoIP situation right now.  You're probably on Rogers, aren't you, Frank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We always have this problem with Amber as well that Rogers starts out fine.  It's as if they're packet-shaping.  They notice you're on Skype, and they start to deteriorate you after about half an hour.  It is almost every time.  I know.  It's too bad.  I'll tell you what, Frank.  Let me hang up on you and call you back.  Watch this.  Sometimes this helps.  We'll see if we can add Frank back into the conference.  All right.  Now, is it better, Frank?  You guys are fine.  No, it's just you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  We're done anyway.  I want to thank you, Franklin Harris.  Is there a site you want to plug?  You're going to be on the lab soon.  In fact, pretty much all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're just working on another episode of Digital Underground.  And we'll have an iPhone in pieces.  So that's what we're working on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that digitalunderground.tv, right?  Digitalunderground.tv.  Yeah, it's a great podcast, video podcast.  The next one is going to be Taken Apart the iPhone.  Whose iPhone are you taking apart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to be disclosing that.  This is the first person I want that information released.  So stay tuned next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to let you go because it just sounds just awful.  But I do thank you for joining us.  He sounds like a robot.  He sounds like a Dalek.  Now, I'm going to make it.  It's time for our commercial for Audible.  Now, normally what we do is kind of like a book group  and give people a chance to pick a book.  But, you know, I didn't, Will or Robert,  Robert, I didn't give you some forewarning here.  So I have a book.  You have a book?  Will, you demand.  First, let's mention that you can get this book for free  if you're not already an Audible subscriber.  If you're in the U.S., you for sure can get it free.  And in many countries you can, but some you can't.  So it just depends on the book.  But it's worth a try.  Audible.com slash twit.  And we do thank Audible for their support.  Now, each week we like to recommend a book  that you could download and listen to.  What's your choice, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, well, my choice is The Audacity of Hope  by Barack Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I've heard some really interesting things about this.  The audacity of hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is interesting because there's a whole,  there's a little section on Google that's actually quite interesting  to read about as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he talks about tech a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so the reason I liked it really was because  it definitely sets out, like, it's very readable.  Like, I just read the new Al Gore book  and I felt like I was really, like, it was tough knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the earth got warmer and...  Yeah, Al's funnier than he used to be.  He's looser than he used to be.  But he's still kind of an academic.  He still loves those facts and figures.  And it could be a little dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the Obama book was quite accessible,  especially to someone like me who is not particularly intimate  with American politics.  Although perhaps more intimate than a lot of Americans are.  But he had an interesting thing about how Google has a problem  with hiring people, with immigration,  the whole H-1B visa situation.  Where does he stand on the H-1B?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says that Google's policies are not good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just that Google would love to hire more American,  you know, super-duper math grads,  but that American schools are not producing enough  super-duper math grads for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the complaint of every tech company in the United States.  And of course the debate is, well, aren't you,  by asking for more, to bring in more workers from other countries  who have this training, aren't you undermining,  further undermining, U.S. engineering programs?  If you're not going to hire the engineers from the U.S.,  why should somebody go to school to study it?  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's one of the sort of things that goes round about  in the book, and I find it very interesting.  Yeah, it is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He reads it.  It is one of many books available on Audible.  You can get it for free if you're not already an Audible member  by just going to audible.com slash twit.  We thank Audible for their support of twit,  and I thank you, Will, for your recommendation.  I'm adding it to my wish list right now on Audible.  That sounds like an interesting book.  He's a great speaker.  I don't know what he's like reading.  But boy, he's dynamic.  Quite good, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He actually does a podcast.  No.  Really?  That you could get.  Yeah, it comes out maybe once or twice a month  when he's in session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say this will be the YouTube election in the U.S.  Now, you have an election coming up in the U.K. soon, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not for a while.  We had a transfer of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you mean when Tony Blair says,  okay, I'm giving up my post,  that doesn't mean that there's a new election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  That just means that the next in line in the ruling party takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you call yourself a democracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can follow the local papers here  and discover how that's been working out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shouldn't he call for an election if he's not going to run,  be the prime minister if he's not going to run the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't work like that.  You vote for the party, not the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will never understand it.  Well, it's going to be a very interesting election.  2008 is going to be very interesting in the U.S.  They're already calling it the YouTube election.  In fact, did you see?  It's a little salacious.  This is not for the kids.  Obama girl.  Obama girl.  I'm in love with Barack.  I'm starting to think poor.  I mean, in a way, now, Obama's team is trying to put a good spin on this.  But I think in a way, this is not the kind of publicity he...  Let me play a little bit of this just for you if you haven't heard it.  The pictures are pretty sexy.  But this is the part that I would be embarrassed by.  Thank all of you for your time, your suggestions, your encouragement, and your prayers.  But she's dialing her phone.  I look forward to continuing our conversation in the weeks and months to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, B. It's me.  If you're there, pick up.  I was just watching you on C-SPAN.  Anyway, call me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This kind of smacks of Monica Lewinsky a little bit, doesn't it?  I mean, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cross between that and the Spice Girls, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not good music.  And it's been watched millions of times, over two million hits in the last three weeks on YouTube.  Mostly because she wears a bikini and there's a lot of...  There's no nudity, but she's...  Money, fame, and power, man.  It's a great aphrodisiac.  But if I'm Obama, I'm going, I don't really want to bring up these visuals of Monica Lewinsky.  I mean, she even talks about rewarding him, so to speak, in the Oval Office.  And I'm thinking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can bet Mrs. Obama isn't too pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would really back...  Who knows?  You're not going to see anything like this for Hillary.  I can tell you right now.  Although she did, I thought, a very good video that was a spoof of the last episode of The Sopranos.  And Johnny Sack was on it and stuff.  I mean, it was pretty good.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, Edwards did a fundraising video with...  Where he and Elizabeth baked a pie.  And it brought in, according to the campaign, it brought in $300,000.  They did his mom's pie recipes, pecan pie recipe.  Well, that's politics, we so need to reform our campaigning election processes in this country.  Well, in a way, though, this is democratizing, because it goes right to the people.  There's no money spent on it.  There's no...  You don't need campaign donations to make these.  And here's the other side of it.  When you make a goof, a boo-boo, everybody sees it over and over and over again.  Like McCain, we played this on the show a few months ago, where McCain goes, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.  I mean, he probably would love to live that down, but no, that's on YouTube and it's going to be forever.  Rudy Giuliani dresses as a woman and they do a drag skit in which Donald Trump kisses his chest.  And this is, of course, a video that I'm sure Rudy would love for this.  He's a Republican candidate for president.  Can't we give him aptitude tests or something?  None of this is doing it for me.  It's not going to make you vote, you mean?  It's not going to bring you to the polls.  I'm going to vote, but it just won't be for any of the above.  Mitt Romney and his wife do Mitt TV.  Oh, that's got to be scary.  Oh dear. Oh dear.  It's time to watch this crap.  Well, apparently the electorate, two million downloads on the Obama girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not the electorate. That's below 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. They can't vote, can they?  But they can talk their moms and dads into voting.  Oh, well, anyway, I think just a fascinating, I think this is going to be a very interesting election and we're going to watch a lot of it.  Not on TV, but on YouTube.  And I don't, you know, I have to say, unlike you, I think that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I think at least anything that gets people thinking about these issues is a good thing.  It'd be nice if they all read each candidate's book.  But you know, that's not going to happen.  It'd be good to get more people just in the habit of voting. That'd be nice.  Even that. Even that.  Leaving it up to so few.  That's right. That's what you get.  Hey, I really want to thank you for joining us, Robert Heron.  We've missed you. It's been a long time.  And we're glad to get you on.  We're glad your health is great.  We look forward to seeing more of you on DL.TV.  We'll be back in about 10 days.  Just taking some time off to go kick it with some friends.  Will Harris is doing his thing in Britain, doing his own TV channel.  You can find out more about it at willharris.co.uk.  It's W-I-L-1-L-Harris.co.uk.  Anything else you want to promote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sums it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright, guys. Thank you for joining us.  We remind you, we've got those great twit hoodies.  I know they're 70 bucks. They're expensive.  But believe me, when you get them and you'll see them, they're worth it.  They're beautiful.  Scotty's gear is just great.  He makes the best stuff.  I really do. I still have a vest that I picked up a while back.  It's awesome. It's well-made and just a great piece of gear.  If you're into that sort of thing.  I haven't counted the pockets in the twit hoodie, I will.  But I think it's well over two dozen.  I wouldn't doubt it.  It's got a pocket just right for the iPhone.  It's the only clothing I've lost stuff in.  And I know it's in the coat somewhere.  Either I can't find the zipper to get into the pocket.  I can't get to it.  But it also held a 12-pack of soda.  There you go. You can put your laptop in it.  The hoodie does not have a laptop pouch because we want to keep clean lines on it.  But it is a nice fleece. Very pretty.  You can find out more about that.  If you would like to support the podcast, we sure would appreciate that.  You can see I feel guilty even asking.  I'm falling all over myself.  Tweet.tv is the place.  We thank you so much for being here.  We'll see you next week. Another twit is in the can.  I should have paid attention. I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work. The problem is, there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal. I'm just trying to get the thing up.  But I have the hell of a time.  What, what, what? Blue screen's like, forget it.  I'm, I'm killing you.
