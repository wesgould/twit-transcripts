Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think in some ways if you're an Apple fanatic, fan, you are part of a community  that's Borg-like.  I mean, it's not exactly a hive mind.  You know what this goes back to?  It sounds like a hive mind to me.  This goes back to the early days, 1984, when it, remember the commercial and the marching  IBM?  The Lemmings commercial?

Start time: 348.18
End time: 351.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought this thinking this would be gorgeous.  Ugly as.  This is the LG Urbane.  And everybody from my wife on has said that is the most ugly thing I've ever seen.

Start time: 385.24
End time: 386.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Jolie can probably keep a straight face looking at it.

Start time: 387.24
End time: 423.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The rose gold hardware is a nice touch.  People think it looks like I bought it on Canal Street or somewhere.  Like it's a $10 clone.  But it is the latest Android Wear.  It's 5.1.  So it has some features that I like a lot that are different.  Can I see it?  Yeah, sure.  You can see.  It probably looked good on you.  I doubt it.  What do you not like?  Why do you think this is an ugly watch?  Just saying.  Because it's too big.  It looks clunky.  It's 52 millimeters, which as we know, the Apple Watch is...  It's a huge monster.  You might as well have a pocket watch on your wrist.  But you need...  But now see, this is one of my issues with smart watches is they are so small, it's hard  to do a good UI on them.  So sometimes having a bigger watch that you want to be missing...  Wait, wait, what just happened on your watch?

Start time: 424.86
End time: 429.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were a bunch of notifications and it looked like a bunch of gobbledygooks.  Get off the air is what it said.  That's the weather.

Start time: 429.40
End time: 429.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 430.75

Start time: 436.46
End time: 439.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awfully small.  Don't say hail Google.  Say okay Google.  Okay Google.

Start time: 442.23
End time: 446.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, if you do that on these shows, okay Google, it turns on most people's things.  Say okay Google to your watch.

Start time: 448.60
End time: 452.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was a good idea to invite you both.  No, no, no.

Start time: 452.48
End time: 455.17

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly how it was the last time you heard it.  The train is off the tracks.  It's off the tracks before it even gets on the tracks.

Start time: 465.02
End time: 468.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said there was no news, so we're just doing our bit.  You know what's funny?

Start time: 468.48
End time: 485.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I often figure that when there's no news, we're not going to have much of a show.  And invariably the longest shows are the shows where there's no news because I feel like  we should fool around a little bit and then it gets out of hand and pretty soon you've  got a five hour show with no news.  Right after that.  And then you're banned.  Yes.  Okay.

Start time: 486.56
End time: 490.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This will be the last time anyone will see Jolie for months, if not years.

Start time: 490.76
End time: 503.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gentlemen, I have something to say.  Yes dear.  I'm going to say it now.  Please do.  Okay.  Can I see the other watch?  I've been gone from the technology sphere.  Yeah, what happened?  Haven't even read any blog articles or anything related to technology.  I come back.

Start time: 504.64
End time: 506.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 506.70
End time: 523.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think I talk to him?  We're married.  So I'm reading the document about the things we're going to discuss today and it's the  same bull crap as was on the show before.  Nothing ever changes.  No, it's the same story.  Look, Apple is trying to do stupid crap.

Start time: 523.68
End time: 524.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Yes.  Cradle to grave.  They've got you.  Hail Apple.

Start time: 537.82
End time: 554.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hail, hail Apple.  So the gesture John's using is of course the gesture of showing off your watch, which is  the same gesture cattlemen use to test whether cows are pregnant.  Oh.  They take their watches off.  You probably don't want to wear your watch during that.  You may not get it back.

Start time: 554.72
End time: 560.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, or that it'll stink for like months.  In any event, actually when you say that I hadn't thought of it.

Start time: 567.84
End time: 573.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, wait a minute.  OK, let's make a deal.  If I lean back like that, that means you guys go ahead.  We won't.

Start time: 573.80
End time: 575.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not taking this sort of cue.  We're not slaves.

Start time: 577.40
End time: 581.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically the rule is going to be that you'll only do it if you can interrupt me.

Start time: 582.46
End time: 588.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, half this chat room thinks I just interrupt you all the time and the other half thinks  I'm hilarious.

Start time: 589.12
End time: 599.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, everybody thinks you're hilarious.  You're beloved.  You are.  You're beloved.  And Jolie, what happened?  Yeah, let's get back to Jolie.  When?

Start time: 600.25
End time: 604.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When?  Look at this.  You can't get it off.  This thing keeps sticking.  It's a magnet.

Start time: 604.94
End time: 611.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I got that part of it.  Yeah, magnets work, right?  So you separate the two and then you may just pull it off.  It's not that tight.  You're already tired of the Apple Watch?

Start time: 611.88
End time: 618.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm done.  Oh, the passcode comes up again.  Does this happen just constantly?  It happens.  OK, so.

Start time: 618.92
End time: 624.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me see this.  Here's the deal.  Put it on.  How, with your man fingers, how are you supposed to even?

Start time: 625.12
End time: 630.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think all watches have the basic problem that it's such a small screen that your face  is difficult with man or woman fingers.

Start time: 630.98
End time: 634.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, women fingers would be just as bad.  No, we have dainty little fingers.  They're adorable.

Start time: 634.96
End time: 649.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The way this works is somehow it knows, probably capacitive skin response, that it's on your  wrist.  So what happens is once you put it on your wrist, you unlock it via the phone using your  finger.  Oh, I see.  And now it's unlocked, but the minute it's removed from your wrist, it's going to ask  for the pinning.

Start time: 651.22
End time: 652.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I getting that right?

Start time: 652.26
End time: 660.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  The watch requires the phone.  Is anyone else hearing this?  No, there's one reason for that.  Look at this.  If I double tap this, I'm now in Apple Pay.  I've got my credit cards in here.  Don't you have that on your phone too?  I do.

Start time: 661.06
End time: 661.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Start time: 662.04
End time: 675.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the phone also locks with my fingerprint.  So the theory is that this is you don't want this watch to kind of be able to anybody could  put it on because then they could use Apple Pay.  So it is Apple Pay is only unlocked as long as contact with your wrist is maintained and  you've unlocked it with your fingerprint.  I think that's actually.

Transcript:  I think that's great.  Let's talk, boy, there's a lot coming up later this month, Google I.O. and of course, shortly  after that in June, WWDC.  Let's start with WWDC.  Apple is expected to announce its Beats software.  You know, they bought Beats, it's been a year now, for over $3 billion.  And there was a question in my mind.  First of all, I thought this is a bad rumor.  No way they would buy Beats.  Seemed too stupid to be true.  It hardly seemed possible.  Then it became true and it was Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine who got offices on the Cupertino  campus.  I don't think Dre has spent a lot of time there.  Iovine maybe.  It turns out it wasn't so much the headphone business, although Apple is selling Beats  headphones, in fact updating them.  They have some new phones that people are saying are quite good.  I haven't tried them.  But the streaming music business, that seemed to be what Apple really wanted.  So we expect June...  Which is odd.

Start time: 1669.47

Transcript:  But it wasn't going to continue, don't you think?  Well, actually, this is an interesting point.  You're right.  iTunes was the place to buy music.  Not just digital.

Start time: 1680.18
End time: 1693.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How hard would it have been for them to buy some code and transition to streaming?  Do they want the hip hop audience, I guess?  That's the only reason I could think of them going with the other group.  That wasn't that successful.  No.

Start time: 1694.02

Transcript:  Why didn't they buy Spotify or something else?

Start time: 1699.00
End time: 1709.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now, as it turns out, Spotify would have been a bad bet.  They're losing more money this year than last year.  Apple can afford it.  Well, they can afford Beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Tidal has an exclusive tonight, by the way.  Prince is giving a concert in Baltimore, a benefit for Baltimore, and Tidal has exclusive  rights to stream it.  We'll be streaming it for free.  This is one of the things Apple does not like.  In fact, they've gone to the labels, apparently, asking them, stop giving your music to services  like Spotify that offer free streaming.  And the theory is they're doing it.

Also remember that he was the guy who encouraged other Silicon Valley companies to do non-competes,  to not try to hire employees, poach each other's employees.

And I mentioned my favorite recording of his is a live performance he did in 1971 at Massey  Hall in Toronto.  Just him and a guitar.  It's beautiful.  It's considered a classic.  He said, yeah, that was recorded on a two track analog tape.  Yeah.  An Ampex probably.  Yeah.  But I think he even agrees that analog is the best.  A great high speed tape would probably be the best reproduction or a slat.  Of course he's going to say that.  Except for one thing.

There were only I think 26,000 of them made.  The Beatles released, because I was complaining to Neil, I said, why haven't the Beatles ever  released anything more than CD quality of their music?  And Evan told me they did.  They did.  They released a metal Apple with a USB thumb drive in it that had all of their albums.  It was the 2009 remaster at 24 bit.  Oh nice.  44 one sampling but 24 bit.  So I bought it.  Figures.  Should come sometime soon.  Don't know if I'll hear the difference.  Probably not.  You're too old.  Yeah.  To me it's more the spirit of having, don't you want studio masters?  But all of the Beatles stuff was recorded on reel to reel so obviously unless you can  get the reel to reel or some sort of analog version of it you're not going to get the  best quality.  But apparently when they remixed in 2009 they did digitize.  Obviously they did for the CDs.

One when I was working at Union I discovered the fiberglass ones made by Billson.  Can I still get those because I need good ear plugs.  Well there's two kinds.  The fiberglass ones are outstanding.  Yes right now.  And then there's a couple of them that have a little hole that has a little tube and those  are like professionals use though.

That's why cocktail napkins aren't the choice of audio files everywhere.  No they muffle.  That's the problem.  They're muffling not attenuating.

This was actually, I think, Harvard Medical School is doing it.  Personalgenomes.org.  They founded this in 2005.  This is all about helping humanity by giving your genome and not just your genome, but  answering a lot of health questions.

Transcript:  I applied.  They never accepted me.  You pay them to do a full genome.  This is not the 23andMe like little, you know.  Coney Baloney thing.  Yeah.  This is like the full genome.  You have to do a lot of questionnaires and then they make it public with your name.  Oh, not good.  Well, the reason is they said, look, you don't want to worry about whether somebody gets  this information.  So we'll just release it.  We can't promise you.

Start time: 2530.76

Start time: 2533.64
End time: 2588.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is literally exactly what they say.  The data is given to any researcher who wants it with your name.  And the reason is there is a huge value, if you think about it, matching the genomic  information with the lifetime health record.  Because you can start to make, and if they get enough people, this could be very valuable.  Most people, I understand none of you would ever want to do this, but Esther Dyson has  done it.  A lot of people who say, look, I live in public.  I wanted to do it because, you know, I'm at the point in my career where I'm not worried  about insurance.  I'm going to die soon anyway.  So now somebody did bring up this is an issue for your kids.  Don't forget by giving your genome to these guys, in a way you're telling them something  about your children.  And I hadn't thought about that.  Oh, and yourself.  My parents, you know, but myself, I'm not worried about that.  Because it's the idea is this is altruistic.  Yes, of course you're losing.

It is, of course, a very dangerous disease and needs to be controlled, obviously.  Yes.  But you're right.  You don't want to weed out the quirky nature because you might eliminate van Gogh.  You don't want to do that.  But wouldn't it be great if you could find a genetic component in this that would help  with treatments that would help?  I agree.  You probably don't want eugenics.  You don't want to say to a parent, a pregnant woman, OK, let's take the genome and see if  there's bipolar one in there because at the end of the day.

And you have maybe had a disposition toward it.  And in fact, they generally say my parents are both damn insane.  Yeah.  Generally, they say if there's not a family history of it, it's unlikely.  But so there is a genetic component, but it's also often triggered by environmental totally  circumstances.  So it wouldn't necessarily.  But it might if you if you knew that you might avoid those environmental circumstances, you  might be more proactive.  You might learn as a kid ways of dealing with it.  I think this is a well, you're going to say it's the insurance companies wanting to find  people.  That's one of the reasons I wanted to volunteer, because I don't care if an insurance company  banned me because of that.  That's life.  It's a contribution to society anyway.

Transcript:  You know, it's a really great story in the week this weekend.  He does a call back to Cory Doctorow.  Let me see if I can find it.  Cory, I guess in one of his young adult novels, talks about the math that apparently even  the NSA doesn't understand that demonstrates that these mass surveillance techniques just  can't work.  This is an article by Ryan Cooper.  And I'll give you a thought experiment.  Oh, I love those.  My Chrome crashed.  I'll give you a thought experiment.  Let me try that again.  What if you had a technique...  Put on your thinking cap.  Yeah, put on your thinking cap.  I'm pizza pan.  What if you had a technique that could detect terrorists with 99.9% accuracy?  So like minority report?

Start time: 3372.58
End time: 3374.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if such a thing...

Start time: 3374.64
End time: 3458.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What could go wrong?  I don't know if such a thing worked, but what if you could, going through these mass things,  you could detect with 99.9% accuracy?  That's not good enough.  Exactly.  The problem that Cory Doctorow raises is that if you search for every million records you  collect, you're going to have 1,000 false positives.  That is, people who are 1,000, which is 1 one-thousandth of a million, people who are not terrorists  but are flagged as terrorists.  Those people, every single one of them, the FBI has to investigate.  And in fact, that's exactly the problem with this mass surveillance.  Bruce Schneier in his new book says, in the years after 9-11, the NSA passed to the FBI  thousands of tips per month.  Every one of them turned out to be a false alarm, which is about what you'd expect.  Even if you had 99.9% accuracy, the cost was enormous and ended up frustrating the FBI.  The agents were obligated to investigate all the tips.  Schneier says, also writes, we saw this with the suspicious activity reports, or SAR database.  Tens of thousands of reports, zero actual results.  And all the telephone metadata the NSA collected led to just one success, the conviction of a taxi driver  who sent $8,500 to a Somali group to pose no direct threat to the US.  And Schneier says...

Transcript:  This is one of the examples that they hold up before Congress.  See, it worked!

Start time: 3463.34
End time: 3500.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Schneier says that was probably trumped up so the NSA could have better talking fronts in front of Congress.  So a simple math would tell you that the mass collection of data is exactly the wrong thing to do  because you're just creating more false positives that are almost impossible to track down.  So whether it's constitutional or not, whether it's justified by the Patriot Act or not,  it's probably the wrong thing to do.  There's a message for you, John.  Why would it be there?  It says the 49ers have just drafted Joe Montana in the eighth round.  That's the best they can do.  Pretty good.  Okay, you guys obviously have nothing to say about that.

The first time we go to China, they're all wearing Hawaiian shirts.  They kind of look like you.  They're wearing Hawaiian shirts.  There's not a Mao jacket to be had.

It's like Gandalf's wand with about six GoPros on top of it.  And that's what you would use.  So it records.  And because a GoPro is pretty wide angle, it records basically a sphere.  Yeah.  So they must have been...  The guy must have had that, like, been holding it like this.  And then so you put on the helmet and you're there.  And you can look up, you can look...  Oh!  Look down, you can look left, you can look right.  You're actually in the scene as it would look like as you were there.  How long did you stay?  Well, it was a short. It was a trailer.  So only...  It was just a trailer.  But you watched three of them.  It was fairly...  Yes.  I watched all of them.  No, it's actually...  How can I say this?  It's pretty compelling.  Yeah?

That's where you're actually still wearing a visor,  but you see what's going on.  You see the world around you.  And superimposed upon it is a user interface.  This is something Microsoft's been showing with HoloLens.  In fact, that'll be coming out sometime this year,  they said, later in the fall probably.  They did show it, and we've talked about this before,  at Build a couple of weeks ago.  And Paul Theroux was very disappointed  because it was kind of a narrow field of view.  Like the AR was as big as like a little raccoon visor thing.  But I think that's more compelling to me.  It's not good for adult material, obviously.  You'd want immersive for that.  And for movies and some gaming, you'd want immersive  if they can get over the nausea factor.  But other than that, you're hanging your head.  It's the nausea factor.

Lying on a mattress in the showroom is no way to try a mattress.  I could just see you and Aaron.  You want to buy a new mattress.  Have you ever bought a mattress in a showroom?  You lie.

And believe me, it's easy to return it, but you're not going to want to.  It's the best mattress you ever had.  Get a Casper mattress.

They want to protect the US against terrorism, right?  Who doesn't?  Right.  Well, lots of people maybe don't care.  Terrorists.  Terrorists.  But I'm just saying they're not doing this for nefarious reasons.  They think this is the best way to protect the US, but they have a sense of humor about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will be.  I'm sure the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled the government does not need a warrant to search wireless carrier cell phone records.  That's a reversal of, I thought, a much better decision from last year.  Yes.  The case focuses on a fellow named Quartavius Davis, who was accused of armed robbery.  Prosecutors tracked Quartavius using location records obtained from his phone carrier, Metro PCS.  Eleven thousand location records.  Davis's lawyers said the records are inadmissible because they're obtained without a warrant or probable cause, violating his Fourth Amendment rights.  The court said government only has to meet the standard for records obtainable under the Stored Communications Act.  So the bar that the government has to live up to is there has to be, this is very strange language,  specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe the records are relevant and material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No?  It's, I think, a lower standard, but that's the question.  That's what the courts are being asked.  It sounds like, so specific and articulable facts.  Well, we think Quartavius is a robber, showing there are reasonable grounds to believe he was seen in the vicinity.  And he has more money than he ought to.  Relevant material to an ongoing commercial criminal investigation.  We're investigating these robberies.  I think that you don't need much of a standard to do that.  Are you sure?

It was after the Nepal quake.  Facebook has a safety check, facebook.com slash safety check.

Because if Uber, they only have a couple more years.  Not Uber, here Maps.  Here Maps goes away.  Microsoft has no map play.  Bing Maps goes away.

That might have been a mistake.  No, you know what?  But that's why you're a risk.  I have no problem walking through the projects.  But that's the point.

Hey, this is something you might want to vote on in Congress.  Next time you're a member of Congress, you might want to vote on this.  Do you remember the this has happened many times that there are companies who will sue  you if you put a bad review about the company online on Yelp or somewhere.  They actually go after you.  There are even comes companies clear gear dot com that put this in their terms of service.  So, um, clear gear tried to charge a Utah company a couple $3,500 for a negative review.  They wrote on ripoffreport.com.  The company demanded the company, the couple take down the negative review because in their  terms of service, clear gear has this, your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits  taking any action that negatively impacts clear gear dot com.  The couple said, we're not going to pay $3,500 clear gear went to credit reporting agencies  and tried to damage their credit saying they owe us 3,500 bucks and they won't pay.  Now the judge later threw this out, but Congress, four members of the House of Representatives  introduced legislation this week.  The bill is the Consumer Review Freedom Act and it would render null and void non-dispersion  clauses like that.  This is not the first time this has happened.  Lots of companies have these non-dispersion clauses.  You're not, remember what was it?  The Vermont, was it a hotel or an inn that went after people that said bad things about  them on Yelp?

But I tell you, in business, there's a better solution.  Your employees use Dropbox.  In fact, before we did Dropbox for business, I went around.  Everybody was using their own personal account to share files with other employees.  I was using my personal account.  Dropbox for business, a much better solution.  First of all, everybody on staff starts off with a terabyte.  It's easy to get more information.  Works just like the Dropbox your employees want to use, except there are tools for IT  professionals.  You get control.  You have remote wipe, for instance.  Employee leaves the company.  They don't leave the company with your company documents.  You can wipe it.  Intuitive sharing and permission controls, complete audit logs.  You know what's happening to the data.  And you control that only the right people get access to the company data.  It works with third party security administration solutions, SIEM, DLP, eDiscovery.  I love it.  And by the way, if you're worried about privacy, you'll be glad to know Dropbox for business  uses encryption not only for file data in transit, but also at rest and segmentation  and hashing.  The files are anonymized.  There's even single sign on two step verification.  I use two step with my Dropbox.  Dropbox for business.  Around the world use Dropbox for business and we want you to try it.  It's the better way to manage accounts, to manage billing, to have visibility and control  over your data.  I guarantee you if you go around, your employees are using Dropbox already.  Maybe it's time to have a corporate account.  Dropbox for business.  It's very affordable and really works.  Dropbox.com slash twit.  You'll get a free 14 day trial.  Dropbox.com slash twit.  We converted over to it because everybody was using it.

Our community created, but thank you, guys.  They do a great job.  So make sure you find the mobile app, your podcast app, whatever,  and subscribe to the show.  Very important, just two days remain to get our twit 10th anniversary t-shirt.  These are really great.  We have them for men and women in all sizes.  But as with all of our t-shirt sales, we're never going to sell these again.  This is limited edition.  So when it runs out in two days, that's your last chance.  So go to TeeSpring, T-E-Spring.com, slash twit, and pick up as many as you can  because you're going to want to have that.  That's the front with the 10 on the back.  It's got the cute banner.  Anthony Nielsen designed that.  Did a nice job.  It's Anthony's, right?  I think Anthony designed that.  TeeSpring.com, slash twit.  We had a great week.
