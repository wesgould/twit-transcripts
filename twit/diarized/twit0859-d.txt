Transcript:  No, no snoozing in this tech snooze this week.  And we did have, I'm sorry to say we had Brianna Wu scheduled.  Both last week and this week.  Brianna had nodes in her throat operated on.  And she still sounds really gravelly.  She wanted to join us.  And I said no, I want you to rest.  So we'll get her back on.  This would have been a good week to have Brianna's take.  Because the big story of course.  Microsoft making its biggest acquisition ever.  Bigger than LinkedIn.  $68.7 billion to buy Activision Blizzard.  And I'm sure Brianna would have had lots to say.  Of course Blizzard, Activision has been under the spotlight lately.  For the harassment and the kind of the boys club.  It was interesting because in a way Microsoft is too.  They've just agreed to have an investigation of how they've treated harassment cases in the past.  Including the Bill Gates harassment case.  So is it two boys clubs joining or is it a chastened Microsoft saying we're going to do the right thing.  And we're going to clean up Activision.  What do you think Devendra?  First of all is Bobby Kotick's going to be the one to do it?  I mean he's going to be the one to do it.  And he's going to be the one to do it.  And he's going to be the one to do it.  And he's going to be the one to do it.  And he's going to be the one to do it.  Is Bobby Kotick going to stay or no?

Start time: 275.34
End time: 313.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the big question for a lot of people.  I've spent the past year charting all the stories around Activision.  And basically how Bobby Kotick fostered this company that was not a great institution.  When it came to women and harassment and things like that.  It wasn't a great place for a lot of people.  The story now is that at least what Microsoft is saying is that he's going to stay on.  What?  If this merger goes through he's going to stay on.  There was an additional reporting after this was announced where people were under the table just telling WSJ and others.  He's out.  He's going to be out.  But with a big multi-million dollar parachute.

Start time: 313.88
End time: 381.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a huge shareholder.  So Kotick joined, I didn't realize this, in 91.  He's been there since 19.  That's almost 40.  What is it?  38, 9, 40 years.  What is it?  I'm not 40 yet. I'm almost there.  91 plus 2 carry the 4.  Anyway, a long time.  Almost 30 years.  A little more than 30 years.  He's actually taken Activision to new heights.  He really took a company that was dying, almost bankrupt and turned it into a gaming behemoth.  But at the same time he's also, I'll look at this article from a few months ago on the Washington Post.  Over 100 Activision Blizzard employees stage walkout.  Demand CEO steps down.  Maybe this had something to do with the sale to be honest with you.  Maybe Kotick said I'm going to cash out.  Certainly one of the reasons Microsoft was able to buy it is the stock price had tumbled over the last year.  It was a strange situation.

Start time: 381.50
End time: 413.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing.  As we were reporting this, the board of Activision was fully on his side.  They fully supported him because he's made them a lot of money.  Activision and shareholders a lot of money.  So nobody's going to out there, basically for the past few decades, like Kotick has created that company and turned it into a behemoth.  This is probably the best possible solution where he gets out, the company can start fresh somewhere else.  He faces no consequences because that's the way business works in America.

Transcript:  Here's another story from IGN.  Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick reportedly turned up late and left early from a fireside chat meeting that was meant to reassure employees of Activision Blizzard about their future.  A fireside chat that was supposed to last half an hour, 16 minutes after Kotick himself turned up 7 minutes late and finished early.  I think he's on his way out.  I think he's taken the big payoff.  Microsoft probably is solidifying its position as a gaming company.  They just bought Bethesda.  They have Minecraft.  This is huge.  And by the way, they don't just get Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.  They get King.  They get Candy Crush.  This is a gaming behemoth.  They also get mobile.  There's Mobile Call of Duty.  Obviously, King is mostly mobile.  This is a really good way for Microsoft to position itself in the gaming industry.  Shares of Sony, makers of the PlayStation 5, tumbled.  $20 billion when this news came out because of the fear that Microsoft would make all of these money makers for Sony Xbox exclusives.  Microsoft kind of hedged its bets on that one.  Yeah, no, we wouldn't.

Transcript:  Yeah, you've got to wonder if this has to get through regulatory scrutiny.

Start time: 517.32
End time: 538.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, and I suspect that it's not going to get through regulatory scrutiny until there are ironclad agreements or at least as best as you can get them that Microsoft won't take all these and make them Xbox exclusives.  And actually, Microsoft's current point of view seems to be the more platforms the merrier.

Transcript:  That's exactly what Satya Nadella does.  His first act as CEO was to announce Microsoft Office for the iPad, which was very sacrilegious in Microsoft at the time.

End time: 592.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Microsoft wants, as you mentioned, there's all these mobile games on here.  Microsoft really doesn't have a mobile platform.  This is iPad.  This gives them iPad and Android to a certain extent.  And so it'll give them, I don't see this stuff going under Xbox umbrella.  The only thing is, of course, is that there's been this constant cliche of the Netflix of games that that's what everybody is headed to.  And it could be that Microsoft just makes it easier to do these games on any Microsoft platform.  That could be the order.

Start time: 593.00
End time: 607.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's address this regulatory issue.  Microsoft says this acquisition makes us the number three gaming company in the world, not even number one.  Obviously, that's a defensive statement.  We're not a monopoly.  We're still so small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're right.  This is not the climate right now.  I mean, the FTC and the DOJ will get to this in a little bit, but they're starting to say, well, what does monopoly mean in the modern age?  I think there's a lot of regret about not stopping the WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions by Facebook.  And I think that there may be that there will be additional scrutiny that you can count on that of this.  On the other hand, yeah, doesn't make Microsoft number one.  Tencent is bigger.

Start time: 643.80

End time: 670.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sony is number two.  I don't know.  It really depends what the rules are these days.  And that seems to be a shifting playground.  Bobby Kotick himself gave an interview with Gamesbeat.  And they asked him, why do the deal?  Why is this a good time to sell?  Why is it a good price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To which Bobby said, what are you crazy?  No, he said, it's interesting.  He said, as you look at the increased competition between Tencent, NetEase, I'm not sure who that is, Sony.  And now you have Google and Amazon and Apple and Facebook and Microsoft and Netflix, which is interesting  because they're getting into gaming too.  We were looking at over the course of the next couple of years, starting to realize  in order to execute our future plans, we needed thousands of new people.  That's interesting.  We need them in disciplines like AI, machine learning, data analytics, cloud, cyber security.  There are people we don't have.  And the competition for that talent is really expensive.  We've started to see that now.  Apple is offering big bonuses if you don't leave to get a job somewhere else.  Engineering talent is hard to come by.  Kotick says that.  So we're starting to think about skills we need.  We don't have...  We don't know how to get this talent.  Then Sacha and Phil Spencer, head of gaming at Microsoft, started having conversations with them.  When Phil called, it happened to be a time we were getting ready to start our long-range planning process  realizing there were going to be challenges and issues.  This is the kind of thing, by the way, that you would say.  It was a strategic move.  It was the move we had to make at this time in the business.  Completely ignoring all the other issues that he's facing personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're moving on.  Plus, their stock price, thanks to all these harassment allegations,  had tumbled to almost half over the last year.  And Microsoft was offering them 45% premium over the price.  In cash!  Of course you're going to take that.  There's not even a question.  They asked him, good on GameSpeed,  was the sexual harassment investigation a factor?  He said it seemed to affect the stock price, right?  He said I think what affected the stock price  is pushing out Overwatch and Diablo.  And then people started to see this year's Call of Duty wasn't performing well.  And then people started to see this year's Call of Duty wasn't performing well.  And then people started to see this year's Call of Duty wasn't performing well.  I think the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment  and the Wall Street Journal article contributed,  but stocks go up and down for a variety of reasons.  And our view is $95 a share with all cash,  that's a great deal for our shareholders.  And it was an easy judgment.  It's a great deal.

Transcript:  Has there been any reporting on who else  came at Activision?  If anybody else started to make a run at them?

Start time: 860.90
End time: 884.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen any, but it's also like  who can?  Who has enough money to do this?  Maybe Apple, but Apple historically  has been really bad with games.  They've had good stuff since the App Store  came about and Apple Arcade is starting.  And they're really good with indie developers, but  they don't really make their own games.  They don't really understand this market.  Maybe Google.  It would have to be a big boy to get it.

Start time: 884.94
End time: 897.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if Google comes to you  and you're bobbing Kodak.  Amazon I would listen to.  Google I would laugh them out the door.  Look what they've done with Stadia.  They did in fact create their own independent game studio  which didn't even last a year.

Start time: 899.00
End time: 902.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did Amazon.  I think they need to shut some stuff down.

Start time: 903.34
End time: 948.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've heard doing very well for Amazon.  So it just  Microsoft makes sense across the board.  They're already in gaming.  They make a very popular console.  Not the number one, but the number two console.  The other thing that's  not to be ignored, as Kodak  was saying, they have AI expertise.  They have cloud expertise. They have Azure.  In fact it's good for Microsoft's other  businesses. The more they use Azure,  the more they use gaming.  Especially Xcloud,  their cloud gaming.  That's a good testament to the strength  of their network, which they can show  other companies.  We're living on Azure. You should live on Azure.  I think this all in all  is a great deal for Microsoft.  It's expensive. That's the only negative.

Start time: 948.94
End time: 1036.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the thing Dwight had  mentioned too, like the Netflix of gaming.  That is what Game Pass is. We haven't talked about  Game Pass yet, but that thing, that subscription  service is ridiculous.  It's a ridiculously good deal for consumers.  You pay a monthly fee and you get  access to hundreds of games. As Microsoft  buys all these studios, those games,  they get wrapped into Game Pass.  Then it's a no-brainer  if you're a Windows user or  an Xbox user. Why wouldn't  you pay for this? Why wouldn't you pay for  what was it, Game Pass Ultimate,  which also has Xbox Live?  You get everything. I'd rather  pay 15 bucks a month rather than  60 bucks for a new game. But 15 bucks  a month, you get those new games like the new  Microsoft stuff immediately.  It's just such a good deal. That is  completely changing the gaming  landscape right now. Sony is hustling  to figure out a solution because  the way Sony makes games is so  different than the way Xbox studios make  games. Sony makes big AAA  titles like The Last of Us 2.  Microsoft has had a lot of trouble  making their own games. It took Halo Infinite  so many years and so many delays to come out.  The value proposition  of what Microsoft is building here just seems  undeniably  great for consumers.  There's a lot of worry. I'm sure Brianna would have  talked about what this means for developers.  Over at Engadget, Jessica Condit  wrote up a great piece about why this is not  a good thing for the gaming industry because  for developers, more consolidation  isn't always good.  A lot of people think indie gaming is where

Start time: 1038.92
End time: 1070.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you even be an indie gamer these days?  Not with this.  I don't think with this deal.  Who knows what  Tencent is doing, but  you've got Sony,  which is a giant studio. You've got  Microsoft. There's a lot of  gravity. It's like black holes.  Regarding the Netflix  of games, there's  more than one of these  operations like XPass.  There's Nvidia has one.  Steam.  Steam isn't a subscription.

Start time: 1071.16
End time: 1080.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nvidia isn't the same.  It's a little different.  That's just streaming. That's not  all you can eat. Just gobble up all these  games immediately.

Start time: 1080.88
End time: 1085.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wouldn't take that much for Steam to  start offering that. They probably will  at some point.

Start time: 1087.10
End time: 1093.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little bit of a cloud business  in Steam, but it's not the big  business. Mostly it's you buy games in Steam.  It's a library.

Start time: 1094.88
End time: 1150.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You buy games and it's your internal cloud.  If you have a Steam box, you have your gaming PC,  and you put an app on your Apple TV or something,  you can play games remotely within your  house. You can stream locally, but  doing it remotely or from far off  distances, that's much harder.  What Nvidia is doing is interesting, but that is  specifically against Xbox Cloud  gaming, which I feel like  Microsoft is just kind of hedging their bets on right now.  But the brilliant thing is that is a part of  Game Pass as well. Game Pass subscribers  on their consoles now, on PCs,  can just hit a button and start streaming  and don't have to download anything, don't have to install it.  Microsoft just really has  their fingers in all the pieces  of the future of gaming.  I think that's what's worrying a lot of  big companies. I'm sure Sony  is freaking out right now because  when it comes to online stuff,  when it comes to next-gen  gaming ideas, Sony  almost always feels like they're kind of lagging  behind, whereas Nintendo and  Microsoft tend to be the invaders, really.

Start time: 1151.57
End time: 1171.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if  Game Pass is clearly  a winner. I'm sure  the price will go up. I wonder if  it would be even more of a winner if they could have sold more  Xboxes.  The supply is so constrained.  Although, I mean, the benefit of Game Pass  is you can play on  a dumb terminal. You can pay it on an old one.  You can play it anywhere.

Start time: 1172.88
End time: 1178.46

Transcript:  They've also talked about making dongles that you  just plug into your TV and that's what you used to  stream cloud games to.

Start time: 1178.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where Microsoft's going, there are no  consoles.  It is the back to the future thing. They are  leapfrogging to this whole other idea  of what the industry is going to be, whereas Sony's like,  please buy this box.  This is all of us.  People are buying that box.  People are buying that box.

Start time: 1200.92
End time: 1214.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the best seller by far, far and away.  The supply is not  as constrained either. I don't know what Sony did differently  from Microsoft, but it's a lot easier  to get a PlayStation 5 than an Xbox Series X.  S you can get, but  X is hard to get. I know because I keep trying.

Start time: 1214.98

Transcript:  Microsoft doesn't care  because they just want you to buy that subscription  to stay on it forever.  In fact, the way they want you to

Start time: 1223.36
End time: 1277.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  buy an Xbox these days  is with a $35 a month  Game Pass subscription that  includes an Xbox.  They're so smart. I honestly  am more and more  impressed with Sachin Adela's management.  He's turned away  from that  it's windows or nothing, right?  He's turned away from that.  He's really pivoted a giant  company and has made it more  successful. I think this is a  really good example of a strategic acquisition  that just makes sense  in every way.  They've got the money.  It's about half of their cash position.  It's about one month of revenue.  That's  expensive. It's not cheap.  But I think it's a good investment in their future.  The main thing to me  is it synergizes well with their other businesses.  It's just a natural  all around. I can't see any negatives at all  to it.

Start time: 1278.88
End time: 1298.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  This has shifted the entire industry, but also  really charts the course from Microsoft's future  when it comes to mobile gaming.  I cringe when people talk about the  metaverse now, but whatever that  is, certainly this puts them in a  place to be a major player  in whatever virtual future  we're moving towards.

Transcript:  That's the other question.  I mean, eSports,  you'd like to be in that business these days.  That's got a growth.  Cloud gaming, but  everything. Cloud  Windows, Cloud Office.  That makes a lot of sense.  The other thing Microsoft clearly  wants to do, it's one of the reasons they bought  LinkedIn. It's why they tried  to get Discord.  They want to be, they want somehow  to be part of  communities. Part of  social, I guess  is the way you describe it.  They want the social graph. They want access to the social  graph. And that's what you get with this  as well, right?

Start time: 1338.98
End time: 1375.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they're not good at it. Microsoft is  kind of like Apple, but they're not  that good at it.  And I mean,  I saw, I forget where I saw this,  but I saw something written  last week about  LinkedIn is the most cringe  social network  that there is.  It's marketers and wonks  and business geeks and more jargon  than you can shake a stick at.  And it's just, it's really uncomfortable.  And  Microsoft is just not good at that.  Historically, they've tried and  they had just not been able to make that  work for them.

Start time: 1399.00
End time: 1435.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Xbox community. The communities are  per game. Well, that's a really good point.  Because we discovered that  10 years ago, almost exactly when we created  a gaming show called Game On, that  there is no monolithic gaming community.  There is this so diverse.  There's console gamers who hate PC  gamers who hate casual  gamers. And if you're  a Call of Duty player, you don't  you're not interested in Battlefield.  It's really interesting.

And the

I don't  have enough time to like  play all the games I want to play or read all the  reviews and stuff. So podcasts are like a nice  passive way for me to keep up with what's  happening. And there's  a lot of great general coverage there.  But I know the way people want to  kind of consume stuff now is by watching videos,  watching people play either via  live streams or Let's Plays.  That's what's really exploded

Transcript:  the last 10 years is Let's Play videos.  First on YouTube with Minecraft and  now with Twitch. And Microsoft  tried to get in that business. They bought Mixer, remember,  and had to fold it.  There was so much money at it.  They  stole away Ninja and  other famous gamers and  just flopped miserably.  Maybe, I mean, maybe  they do have something to learn in this.  But here's another chance.  Here's another shot for them.  Certainly, certainly.  I certainly don't blame  Bobby Kotick. I hope he gets out  though. I really do.  And then goes to jail. That would be  my hope.

They had, I mean,  we've covered these stories over the years, but  they had a Bill Cosby  room where they had a picture  of Bill Cosby and they would invite women  back to the room. I mean,  and Kotick knew about all this. There's no question.  He  either turned a blind eye toward  it or even encouraged it. And  so I think he, I think the  buck stops there. I really do.  And boy, it's just a  nasty nest  of stuff. We talked about this also  and this is where Brianna would be a great  advantage to this show.  I think they had  the perception. There is the perception.  You need to create that kind of environment to get the  best game developers. That's what gamers  are. That's what game developers are.  And I hate that notion. I think  we've got to get beyond that. That's terrible.

People  thought the game developers,  they wanted to be rock stars.  So they get to be as wild and crazy as  like Led Zeppelin was in their heyday  or something. It is that mentality  of like, it is basically bro culture.  Programmers.  Yeah, programmers  makes genius and that makes us  money. So that's what we want.

Transcript:  If you go back to the earliest days  of gaming, that's  how Activision started.  Atari wouldn't let their programmers  take credit for the games.  Remember in Atari  games in the early days, programmers would hide  Easter eggs so that they could have their name  be seen.  Activision said, we'll give you  credit. We'll let your name be on the  game. And they were able to draw huge  talent away from Atari to  Activision, developed amazing games  like Pitfall, Prince of Persia.  It was a really great game house. And it was because  they said you can take credit.  So maybe that's in the roots of  Activision.

You know, I had  seen the original developers of  Doom and Quake referred to  as like the Beatles of  gaming. And  it was funny when they went off on their separate ways.  They really couldn't kind of do  what they did at id.  But what's interesting is Bethesda  owns id and id is  now under the auspices of

I think  that times have changed, I hope.  By the way, did you know that Bobby Kotick  and Sheryl Sandberg dated  for three years?  What?  Very confusing.  I don't know. I mean, this is the People Magazine  segment here. I didn't.  Chatroom just told me a year after  Sheryl's husband passed,  she started dating Bobby Kotick.  So I don't know what that means.

Neither here nor there.  Very interesting.  First, they got to get regulatory approval.  That's not a cakewalk.  And then B, they've got  to absorb this behemoth. They did pretty well, I think,  with Bethesda. They certainly did excellent.  We know they did well with Mojang and  Minecraft.  So I think there's a good track record there.  And then let's see what happens with the exclusives.  I think Microsoft's  best bet is just to say  game pass everywhere.  Play it on your PlayStation. Game pass everywhere.  We don't care. Bring it to the Mac.  Well, it's funny because  there is a story about Fortnite coming  back to the Mac and iOS  through the backdoor.  With GeForce Now, with Nvidia's service.  So that could happen.  Right now, you can play  I think you can play  Game Pass in a browser on the Mac.

They have the same kind of  a graphics subsystem that is on  the iPhone and the iPad, which is  great for mobile gaming.  And so the components are there  for them to do it in a big  way. I think somebody just needs to kind of  step up and go,  it needs a  killer app. It needs a killer game. But aren't they

Because  it seems, I've actually  thought this, when Apple is creating these better and better desktops,  and there's no question, these things are  superb. I'm in love  with my M1 Pro MacBook,  14 inch MacBook. It's amazing.  But isn't the trend  away from powerful desktops  towards cloud computing?  And that's where gaming  is going, right? You don't need a fancy gaming  rig, you don't need an M1. We'll  run the  servers in the  cloud. You just need a stream to it.  And so I wonder if  maybe  we've been saying this for years,  I don't know if the desktop computing is dead, but  I do feel like the cloud is going to at some  point take over.

So  we want cloud gaming to be the kind of  end all and be all, but right now people just want  an easy way to like get their little  gaming fix. So I guess Apple is leaning  in on mobile, right? And they're extending mobile  to desktop, to everything, to even Apple  TV. But I just, I'm a little disappointed  like proper desktop gaming is  not really what they're doing at all.  Yeah.

They  can't use the Unreal Engine because that's an Epic  thing, and they don't like Epic.  So you've got to use Unity,  which is kind of a weak  second. Unity might get  better. I don't know. I feel like Apple,  it's almost as if Apple doesn't even care.  I don't know.  And should they care? Why should they care?  Beyond mobile games, yeah, I don't know.  Mobile, they own mobile, really.

And the other thing is,  what you could see is you could see it coming in the  back door because  the Zip1 Macs can run  iOS titles.  And if you had a developer  who created a killer  game on iOS, then when you  ran it on a Mac, it  ran like a game on a Mac, that would  be really interesting. I think

What are you excited about?  There's a couple things.  There's this movie I just  saw called After Yang by  the director Koganada,  which is fantastic. It's about a family that loses  their helper  kind of android, and  it basically dies at the beginning of the movie,  and the entire movie is them dealing with that.  It's amazing.  It's amazing and beautiful.  Do they grieve it?  It is a grieving movie about  the influence this thing has had on the family.  It stars Colin Farrell too, and I love  sad, broody Colin Farrell  in good, serious stuff.  It's sci-fi. There's this great  vision of the future of self-driving  cars with plants and bamboos.

Dwight, I'll ask you about your life too later.  It's not  all about Devendra.  I do want to talk about our  absolute favorite VPN.  I think you know if I say that, you're going to say  oh yeah, Leo loves ExpressVPN, of course.  Honestly, there are  so many reasons to run a VPN, but I think  the one, it used to be about security,  right? And it's still about security.  And I think for some people it's about watching Netflix  in Japan or England. It's still about that.  All that stuff still works.  Increasingly, it's become a privacy  issue.  When you're looking at what big tech  is up to, and you really say how  can I keep  these companies from knowing everything  I'm doing, people want,  there's a lot of things people want to  do to protect themselves. And I think a VPN  is not the only thing you should  do, but it's one of the big  things. The idea that a single company might control  90% of the internet searches,  do your email,  runs your phone,  has a device in your house  with a microphone,  it's pretty amazing. And in  at least the case of Google, they  make money by  exploiting your personal data.  They're very clear about that. That's how  Google makes money, selling ads based on  what they know about you. Maybe  you, like many of our listeners,  want to put a little layer of protection  between your online activity  and these big tech companies  who do literally want to know  everything you do. That's why  you might want to check out a good  VPN. You might want to check out ExpressVPN.  Now, something I've always talked about with  VPNs is you're just  passing the buck. You've got to trust  the VPN you use. It's very  important. Well, I can tell you, you can trust  them. Independent audits  have proven it. They care so much they  created something they call the trusted  server technology. You're running  in memory in a sandboxed  process that literally cannot  write to the hard drive. And as soon as  you log out, it disappears, poof,  and so does every trace of your  visit. And again, that has been  proven so by  independent auditors, so you can trust that.  Think about how much of your  life you're putting on the internet. Every  site you visit, every video you watch,  every message you send is tracked, is data  mined. But when you're running ExpressVPN,  your IP address is not yours.  The IP address you use to emerge  into the public internet is theirs.  So it makes it so much harder to trace  and sell to advertisers. You might  use incognito mode in your browser, but that  just means somebody on  your machine can't see what you're up to. You better  believe the browser  company knows what you're up to. Your carrier knows  what you're up to, unless you're using ExpressVPN.  It also has the benefit  of encrypting 100% of your internet data,  so you're safe from eavesdroppers  on the network. And the best part about  ExpressVPN is they invest.  They invest in  their business.  When you get a free VPN,  you've really got to wonder who is  the product. Are you the customer  or are they selling your information?  With ExpressVPN, it's not expensive, a little less  than seven bucks a month, but  that's important.  That transaction means you're the customer.  You're not the product.  That's why they protect your privacy.  That's why they make sure you've got enough speed to  watch high-def video.  They don't slow down your connection.  It's one of the reasons it's the number one VPN  service. Mashable says so, Techradar  says so, and it's so easy to use. You download  the app, you put it on your phone, your computer,  you tap a button, you're protected. You can even put it on your  router, protect your whole household.  And I can tell you this, no one will complain, oh, what  happened? The internet's so slow because ExpressVPN,  again, invests in the network.  I've turned it on on my router and no one  even knows. I took ExpressVPN  to Mexico. I was using it  for security as much as privacy.  Stop handing over your personal data to the  big tech monopoly that mines your activity  and sells your information.

FAA,  airline manufacturers,  airlines and airplane manufacturers  say, wait a minute,  you're going to break our altimeters.  Wait a minute,  planes are going to come out of the sky.  They put a hold on it,  AT&T, Verizon,  FAA said,  can you put a hold on it? They said, well, we'll give you a week or two.  Anyway, it's starting to roll out.  Wednesday was the day.  So far, no planes have fallen out of the sky,  but maybe some planes aren't flying.  I'll read you  it's very tempting to  blame  the manufacturers  or blame the FAA or blame the FCC.  I'll read you something that shows you  there's enough blame to  go around on this one.  This is from  Jucadrp on Reddit.  It was one of the Reddit best ofs  and I thought it was the best thing I've read  explaining this.  Airplanes are equipped  with radar altimeters.  They use radar  on the frequency between 4200 and 4400 MHz.  These 5G towers,  these C-band towers are 3700, 3980 MHz.  There's no overlap.  But,  and this is the problem,  there's a filter  in order to protect the frequencies that the radar  is using so it doesn't get  interfered with by other,  there's a filter, but the filter  is set  because thanks to a decades old design,  no one else was using this frequency  to  overlap with this 5G frequency.  It doesn't need to, but it does.  So 5G radio  could confuse these altimeters.  That could be of course a big hazard  for an airplane.  So in fact there's a  here from 5G technology world  is a graph  that shows these bands.  So the altimeter, can you show that John?  The altimeter is this yellow thing.  This is the frequency it needs.  This is where the 5G band is.  Unfortunately this green line,  that's the filter.  So because of this  and it is admittedly an antiquated design  and we should point out that these  5G towers, this spec  is 10 years old. They knew this was coming.  But they never fixed the  altimeters.  It's a-beer-ating.  Yeah.  So basically  the altimeter opens a channel  to listen to radar, but it ends up  listening not just to radar, but to 5G.  At the time they were designed there was nothing there.  There is now.  And in fact modern filters could easily  be put on these things that would eliminate this  problem entirely.  This guy in Reddit writes,  The aviation industry had time to retrofit their airplanes  and now they are, sorry  to be blunt, playing dumb.  They know they can hold the nation's hostage  by saying this will disrupt flights  in the middle of a pandemic.  Obviously safety is paramount.  But carriers paid  $81 billion for these frequencies  because they were not in use.  So they paid $81 billion for exclusive  use of these frequencies. The aviation  industry is basically arguing they want  to take over more than they need, more than  they're even allocated, to operate  these altimeters.  So, but, and then  to defend the aviation industry,  one of the reasons air travel is so safe  these days is because they are not  you know, throwing stuff in willy nilly.  And so you can't just  go change all those altimeters  and then you know, you want to test it and so forth  so you can't change it overnight.  They have had a little more. If only we had 10 years to test it.  We had 10 years.

Transcript:  No, this is kind of the  mid, this is kind of in between  sub-6 and millimeter wave.  This is, I wrote about this in my column  last week  about what it was, what it meant  for AT&T and Verizon  which are the two that are using it.  They've kind of essentially been  behind T-Mobile because  T-Mobile has a mid-band  that it got from  Sprint, the spinner acquisition.  And it's been able to offer these  speeds that AT&T and Verizon  can't for some time.

Start time: 3055.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's at a different frequency.  T-Mobile has bought some  C-band, but they're not going to set it up  until 2023.  But it is,  you know, in Houston, a lot of  this stuff comes here first.  Because it's so  flat here, so it's a good testing ground.  And T-Mobile, Sprint  had one of its first  standups of its  service, and it was remarkably fast.  T-Mobile now is very fast.  And when they switched it on here  on Wednesday,  I began hearing from  readers on  Twitter and Facebook  saying that they were starting to see some speeds  on their compatible  AT&T and Verizon phones  that now could kind of match  in the center area  the stuff that T-Mobile is doing.

Transcript:  they're saying for C-band  it's up to about a gigabit  at best. When I was  talking to Verizon for this story,  they said that kind of  what they want to hit is about 300 megabits.  That's plenty.  That is plenty. And on  my, I have an iPhone 13  Pro Max. I doubt my phone could go faster  than that, to be honest. Right. Well, on my iPhone 13 Pro Max,  I have T-Mobile,  and I have seen  download speeds up to 700  megabits on my iPhone.  Oh, wow.  So you can go that fast.  Yes. And typically,  what's really interesting on T-Mobile  is that if you're down  to like two bars, I still  see like 250 and 300  megabits when I'm picking up  one of their mid-dance.

Not a lot, but some. I think  probably this is more like the airplane manufacturers  want the phone industry to pay them  to fix the altimeters.  Yes.  But that's a good compromise. Just don't put  the towers within two miles of an airport.  So,  everything's going smoothly.  So far.

If you're T-Mobile  customer in an area that they have  added it and it's in a lot  of urban areas, you  are seeing that already. And it's  the only use I've seen  for it is I was  I was  away from home and I knew I was going  to be in a place where I wasn't going to have  cellular  service or good cellular service.  And I was getting the 5G  5G  UC, which is ultra capacity  that it calls for. I was getting like 500  megabits down. So I quickly  downloaded a couple of episodes of  something on Netflix and I got  it, you know, in just in just about  30 seconds. And then when I got there, I had  it down on my phone.

But I was getting  probably with that about 200 megabits down.  You know, on my Comcast  Doxys 3.1  Internet  service, I've got gigabit  service and the fastest  I can get maybe is about 800 megabits  on my phone. It's like  400. But with  C-band, I mean with mid-band  on T-Mobile when I'm out and about, I get  700 megabits down. It's faster  than what I get in my living room.

I'm really wondering like the  AR glasses we're all hoping to see  in five years. They would need 5G.  They need to be connected. They can't just  rely on their phones.

In Japan,  they've rolled out  this according to Ars Technica.  And in fact, they're  deployed at 4100  megahertz. So there's just a 100  megahertz guard band between 5G operations  and those altimeters. And there have  been no claims of interference.  So  I call  foul on all of this.

Actually, this is, now  I'm starting to get the calls. I had a guy  call me today. Said,  I just got a phone in the mail.  Because,  from AT&T, because they say  my phone's not going to work in a month.  AT&T  is on 0222  February 22nd of this year.  Turning off the 3G towers.  He has a Galaxy S7.  I said, well wait, that uses LTE.  But turns out  AT&T is using  the  3G for  signal to make the connection.  On that phone?  So it will just stop working.  So they sent him like a $20 crap phone.  Unsolicited.  I said, you should probably just  get a newer. But this is going to be  get ready. This is a month from now.  A lot of people with older  not even that, an S7 isn't that old.

That happened a couple of weeks ago.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Let's see.  What else? Intel is going to build  new president, new factory.  Intel is going to build  a massive, the largest  chip factory ever in Ohio,  they say.  They will build two new  semiconductor fabs on a  thousand acre site where Intel will research  and develop and manufacture its latest chips.  And this is really part of the Intel  transition from  being an IDF, an integrated  design foundry where they design and make their  own chips to becoming  kind of almost two companies. A design  company like Nvidia or  ARM or Apple  for that matter. And then a  fabricator, a chip builder like  TSMC, they want to do both.  And so these new plants, I think,  are part of their Pat Gelsinger's  mission to start selling their chip manufacturing  capacity to other  companies, including, they say,  aspirationally Apple.  Very aspirationally.  Construction begins this year.  The plant should be operational by 2025.  So this is,  it's really going to be interesting to watch.  Traditionally,  companies making this kind of pivot fail.  It's a hard thing to do.  The one prime example is  Microsoft, which has really made  an amazing pivot and is actually  a stronger, better company because they moved  from being the Windows Office company to  being the cloud company. It'll be  very interesting to see if Intel  can make this transition. Ben  Thompson wrote about it in his  strataquiri column.  In fact, that's where I get most of my understanding  of what the hell's going on in Intel  because it's very, very confusing.  But he actually, years ago, said  Intel should split into two companies. This  integrated solution  is not going to be a good solution.  And it turns out he was right. It was one of the  reasons Intel struggled with new technologies.  They got ossified,  fossilized, stuck.  And because  TSMC didn't have to worry  about, you know,  being an integrated company, they were able  to leapfrog them.  But now Gelsinger has at least  decided he's going to try to change  Intel's tune. You think  they'll succeed, Devendra?

Transcript:  You know, I've been covering Intel  for a while in AMD and all the  big chip companies.  It does seem like they've been affected by the  innovator's dilemma, you know, for a while.  I think at least within the last decade.  And now we're seeing AMD  come up with much, much better mobile  chips and desktop chips, like the competitions  heating up and also with what Apple's doing.  I think Intel has a chance  of doing something really interesting  here. It's a big bet. And  this is kind of the thing Intel has needed to make.  We just recently  saw their 12th gen chips, which have this new  hybrid design, which I think is a really  interesting idea. And that is something like  we just saw on them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And Snapdragon chips  as well. Mobile chips have been doing  that. Yeah.  It is interesting to see that come to  laptops and desktops.  And Intel's leaning in on that.  AMD still has the  lead on actual manufacturing,  making them  in smaller sizes. So Intel  is just kind of racing to catch up at  that level. They kind of have to do  something like this. You know, it's a big bet. And this company  just can't keep doing what it's doing  right now when Apple can just  build mobile chips that blow  pretty much all their desktop hardware out of the water.  So, yeah, I can't tell if  it'll work, but we need capacity.  I think the big problem right now  that we're facing with the whole global chip  industry is that we've relied  so much on a couple  companies that make all the chips.  And if something happens in that pipeline,  we're all kind of, so many  industries just kind of start to fall apart.  So I think it's smart for Intel.  Clearly there's a demand for this stuff.  And I think we're going to have more and more of a demand  for anything that requires  chips right now. So, yeah, it's  a payoff, even if it's not Intel's own chips  being built there.

Transcript:  One of the things that Thompson's points out  in his article on Stratecri is that  Intel actually ended up going to  TSMC saying, can you make our chips?  Which was kind of crazy  because here you are, this is your biggest  competitor, and you're actually giving them  capital to continue to whoop your ass.  But it actually  was maybe part of this transition to  kind of two different businesses,  the design business and the fab  business. And the design business  needs to get its designs made  somewhere, and it doesn't have to always be an Intel  company. It'll be very interesting.  I think, are they building in  Texas too? I think they are.

American manufacturing is something that we've  kind of just ignored for so long.  And now that we're  thinking hard about where stuff is being built  and what we can invest in here now  too, they're still trying to pass  the chips bill, which hasn't  gone through the house yet, I believe.  So, there's still  things we could be doing, certainly down here  in the South, after Rivian announced that they're going  to be building stuff here in  Georgia. It's going to be really exciting  to see where manufacturing moves around  in the US.

Transcript:  In Texas, it's AMD  in Austin. And Samsung  also is going to do  chips in Austin.  And one of the things that  I think is really interesting, and  I'm curious about how  this will work out, is if  they're freeing up Intel from having  married manufacturing  with design, if  it will accelerate the innovation in  their design.  That's the theory, right? Yes, right.  But how would that  work? What  exactly is the mechanism there that  would cause that to happen? Well, I think

Start time: 4168.88
End time: 4207.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the premise, at least Ben's premise, is they were  being held back because their  fab capabilities were not developing  at the same speed as their design  capabilities, so they couldn't design future  chips. That's why they ended up getting  fab at  TSMC. And remember, Intel couldn't get  below 10 nanometers. I think  they still are struggling to get below 10 nanometers.  It took years, yeah.  So in a way, whatever their design teams  wanted to do, they were very much limited by what  their fabs could make. So this  is probably smart to decouple  the two. Now let's see what the... They've got good  designers. Gelsinger designed the 486.  Let's not forget. He's a designer  by trade. He understands this.  My first CPU, yeah.

Transcript:  They've made a good recovery. They've gotten  pretty good with selling  cloud computing servers there.  They sell a variety  of services. They have moved here  to Houston. The company is now based  in Houston. And  what's interesting is a lot of  the people, the older  executives, are from the old compact  days when they were building  servers here. So it's kind  of been... In fact, Antonio Neri,  who is the CEO, worked  here and was part of  the compact server group  and HP when HP  had it. And so  it's kind of a homecoming for them. They're  doing pretty well from what I can tell.

I'm looking at HP's  stock over the last five  years, and it's pretty flat. It's not  going through the roof. It looks a lot like Microsoft  did before its pivot.  But I do have to say, at least from the consumer  side, HP's  making the best computers they've made in years.  Really much nicer, much more

I feel like that's kind of it. At least that's the way I've  been seeing it. Yeah. Maybe that's really the  story. Let's take a little  break. We'll have more. Devendra  Hardwar and Gadget.

Well, and, but the other  fun thing is, is that  you know, I have found  that I am incredibly busy  with my free time. It's not like  I'm like sitting around, you know,  binging Netflix. Although when we're done  I got to go finish watching Ozark.  But... Oh, yeah.  But, but, it's  like, it's, I'm incredibly busy  with life and so it's  pretty wonderful.

If you're a freelancer  who writes at a lot of different  places, it is a great way to have everything  all in one place. I'm not getting any  money for saying that.  It's just as...

It's good to have Dwight and  Devendra here on our show today.  Always pleased to welcome  New Relic to our show  as our sponsor. I am.  I've known about New Relic since back in the day  when they were a Ruby on Rails  solution. These days, New Relic  is just a must have  for anybody who's got to keep a stack  running. You know how that  feels, that 9 o'clock call  or maybe 3 a.m.  call when you're kind of winding  down, maybe watching a little  Ozark and the phone rings  and something's down, something's  broken. And you're going,  what is it? What could it be? Is it that  fix I just pushed?  Is it the backend? Is it the frontend?  Is it global? Is it the server? Is it the network?  Is it the cloud provider?  Do we have slow running queries?  And now suddenly you've got a team scrambling.  They're going from tool to tool.  They're slacking you.  They're calling you. They're buzzing your  beeper, trying to figure out what's  going on. It's just like an anthill that somebody just  kicked. If only  you had a system for figuring  out what's gone wrong. Weirdly  enough, such a thing exists.  They call it observability.  New Relic just did a report. Only half  of all organizations are implementing  observability for their network and systems.  And it's a huge  issue that you can solve  with New Relic.  New Relic is an  umbrella for 16 different monitoring  products. You'd buy them  separately. Maybe you'd try to make them work together.  But you don't have to. With New Relic  you'll get application monitoring, APM.  So you can build  New Relic into your tooling  across the board. Apps, microservices.  In fact, it's  so good that  if you have an error in your code, it can  tell you the line number. It can tell you  what your stack's doing. You can get an instant  feedback, which makes it much easier  to fix what's wrong.  If you use Kubernetes, you'll love PIXI  for observability. Distributed  tracing, so you can see all your  traces without management headaches. Find and  fix issues fast. Network  performance monitoring.  Stop guessing where performance issues start.  Ditch data silos  for a system-wide, correlated  view. It's so much  more. There's 16 tools. That's just four of them.  And I love it that  you can know instantly, exactly.  Look at the companies that use  New Relic. 14,000 companies.  DoorDash, GitHub, Cloud  Flare, Alassian,  Epic, Games. Everybody  loves New Relic because it  solves that problem with an IPM  phone call. You can push a  button, see what's wrong, and fix it  and go back to Ozark. Or whatever you're  doing. You could be knitting. I don't care.  Whether you run a cloud-native startup or a  Fortune 500 company,  it takes five minutes to start New Relic up.  Get it going in your environment. And get  ready for this. No credit  card required. You get 100  gigabytes of data free forever.  And for many people, that's plenty.  If you need more, you can get more.  But you really want to get  New Relic. Before  that 9pm call, it's just  out there waiting to happen. Get New Relic.  Before it does, sign up at  newrelic.com slash twit.  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C dot com slash  twit. And if you're Boston and you want to see some smiles,  ask your team.  Hey, guys, do we need New Relic?  Oh boy. They'll go, yes.  We thought you'd never ask.  Or more likely, they'll say,  yeah, we've been using it.  You want to get more?  Newrelic.com slash twit.  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.  Newrelic.com slash  T-W-I-T.  I love this company. I love these guys.  And they do such a good job. And you definitely  need it. New Relic!  Okay.  Oh, I wanted to ask you.  I'm asking everybody. This is Pixel 6 week.  We got the January  update. I know, Devendra, you've  covered it. I see Dwight, you've covered it.  Has it  fixed your... Personally,  I love the Pixel 6. I've not had any  problems. Fingerprint reader works great.

I did not have any problems with it. I like the phone.  I had to send it back so I don't get a  chance to see what the updates are like.  By the way, if you hear any crinkling  or other sounds,  my cat got into the room and  he's in... That's okay. I heard some meowing.  Yes, yes. He's in the room.  Maybe he'll be quiet, but he's in this  kind of tube.  So there's a little  crinkle. Oh, I hear it.  He may jump on me. He likes to get  right here. Are you actually in the cat's...  I think you're in the cat's room.  I am in the cat's room.  That's why they're mad. That's why they were trying to get in.  This is my wife's  office.

Transcript:  It's such a shame because this was supposed to be  the iPhone killer for them, right?  So much seemed good.  As an iOS user, I was  really jealous of some of the things I was seeing on that phone.  And then this is happening.  And it just kind of reminds me that  Google is so bad at consumer products sometimes.  So many things are so bad.  I have Nest Thermostat that is always  losing its internet connection.  I don't know why.  It's so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not an iPhone killer. It's a good phone.  It is probably the best  phone that  Google has done.  But it is not an iPhone killer.  Mainly because while Google  has created  a really decent piece of  hardware and Android 12  is interesting, Android 12 is  just not as easy to use as  iOS still.  And so to be able to  pick it up and kind of do the things that  Google touts isn't necessarily  always the simplest thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shortcuts have made the iPhone a lot harder to use.  You know what else made the iPhone  harder to use?  Is this new focus feature.  I felt terrible the other night.  Lisa is desperately trying to figure out  how to only allow text messages  from her son. Michael is down  the hall from us but he has COVID.  We've sealed his door  with caulking.  So if he needs something we want to know  if he can slide something under the door or whatever.  It's like  it's bedtime. I'm going to sleep.  She says, I can't figure out this focus  thing. Could you help me?  The tech guy doesn't take calls  after 9pm. Go away.  The helpline is closed.  The helpline is closed.  I don't want to help you.  It's not because I don't want to help  her. It's because it is hard to figure  out. I can't figure out for the life of me.

I want to be in  but the problem is the Apple ecosystem  is so integrated.  You can't use  an Apple watch with it.  So it  ends up just sucking you into this all  Apple ecosystem.

That's going to happen this year.  They're using a service  a company called ID.me  starting in summer 2022.  And this is  you know it's all about security.  But this is going beyond two factor.  You'll have to create an account  with ID.me  and you will have to  send them  a scan of your drivers license  or a government issued ID.  You'll have to prove you or you  copies of utilities.  You'll have to prove you or you copies of utility  or insurance bills.  Maybe they'll ask you questions about your mobile phone  service. But you're going it's going  a lot farther to say you are you  and I guess this is all because  I guess the IRS is experiencing a lot of fraud.  I don't know.  It says 27 states are using ID.me  this is from  Krebs on security.  27 states use ID.me because of  identity theft with benefits.  It's becoming  such a problem.  But I think people are going to go  you want me what?  Sometimes you have to do a video of yourself  a selfie video of yourself.  A live video chat.  What do you think?  I mean on the one hand this is  smart for security.  But boy ID.me is going to have  all of our information.  It's also

That may be the most advanced  thing they do. And for them  this is just going to I have  a feeling this will not stand.  This will not be immediately  required.

But I was looking at  some of the reporting from this past week  and even the IRS is saying  it's not true. You don't have  to submit  facial authentication  That sounds more reasonable.  Yeah so it's like  maybe they're in the process of setting this up  and there's certainly issues with  relying on a single company to do this.  Especially a private  company.

Actually, the US government  actually has  and I can't remember what the address was  but has an analytics  site  that's open to all. Let me see if it's analytics.  Oh, that's right. Is it data.gov?  USA.gov. Yeah, you can see  this. So, this  is, if you can narrow  it down to just  the postal service, which is  I guess what's running this.  It was  more than a quarter of a million when I went there  on Wednesday. There were  1.29 billion visits to the postal service  over the last 90 days.  This is actually really a great  trove of information here.  Right now, there are  a quarter of a million people on government websites right  now. Number one,  USPS, then  COVID home test, then USPS, then COVID  tests, and then login.gov.  So, the vast bulk  of it is people getting COVID tests

It was in the Judiciary Committee  past Thursday 16 to 6.  This is  the American Innovation and Choice  Online Act  that requires companies like  Amazon, Google, Apple, do not  favor their own products  in their search results.

Now, I'm not  sure. I mean, that's another step.  I'm not sure what the next steps are.  Because I did not watch  Schoolhouse Rock.  So I do not know how a bill  becomes law.

Transcript:  Yes, they're doing the same thing on that side.  Then they do a reconciliation.  Basically, Mitch McConnell  has to say, okay,  we'll let you vote on that.  So, you know,  it's not just Mitch. It's whoever's...  I don't even know who's in charge anymore.  Is it Chuck Schumer? Schumer.  Chuck Schumer. But he's  in charge. It's kind of a joint  sharing thing.  So they have to bring it up for a vote.  But meanwhile,  boy, are Apple, Google, Microsoft  lobbying like crazy.  Ted Cruz, this must have been a  hell of a phone call, had a  40... He said this at the market, had a 40  minute phone call with Tim Cook  to discuss it.

It'll make it harder for  Apple to let consumers out of monitoring  from apps, you know, that... Check that  IDFA box.  Cruz said, I don't think that's the  case. You know,  big lobbying against this, which probably  means it's the right thing to do, I would guess.  I don't know. I don't know.  But  it passed with a very big majority.  So we shall see.

Transcript:  if they actually start... If this  all goes through and becomes law  and we're actually looking at what these companies  are doing more crucially  too, right? Like I think it's targeting  companies with a ton of users, right? Like a  large amount of users who have  big, big tech that has markets  way and then can help to  avoid things like the way Google  can prioritize their own links or Amazon  can prioritize their own products within their search  because it's something I look at.  I see it happening in front of me and then I see Amazon  starting to make products  that I know were being sold by other companies,  you know, and now they're under Amazon basics.  All this stuff is happening  and we are kind of just powerless  to stop these giant companies from absorbing  everything and making everything their own.  We need to do more. So  I hope this leads to something.

But I also don't  fully trust Congress's  motivations here.  Some of it seems to  be more like we want  to knock down Section 230 and  we don't want to be censored on Twitter.  They always try to stick that in.  So I just... I have very

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

I said, oh, that's a Simple Human  can. You know, it's very slick, very stylish.  And you know what?  It's Amazon basics. She paid  about a half of it.  And it looks very much like Simple Human.  And it's of better quality  and it's less expensive.

But that's essentially what he  has become. And we are powerless. We are  powerless against what Facebook is doing.  And other countries. Like these things  have blown up so much that  I think at the very least, government  kind of wants some controls or  some ability to push back.  And we can't, we've seen what happens  when industry, especially in  America, is fully untapped.  It has full control over everything.  So there needs to be a conversation. I'm not anti-government.

Start time: 6115.57

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, part of this is  that the antitrust laws,  the Sherman Antitrust Act,  and  what's the other one's  name, I can't remember, are  a little antiquated. And so, their  question is, how does this change,  how does the modern world change  how we should  treat this? In other words,  traditionally we've considered  consumer harm, but are there  harms that perhaps  are more subtle that we don't pay attention  to? Things like  reducing innovation,  which, you know, that's a serious  concern. And also this issue of,  and this is a complicated one,  monopsony power.  So, the idea of monopoly is  one seller to many consumers. Monopsony  is the opposite. There's only  one buyer. And this is a particular  issue in the labor market. If there's one  big company is the only company hiring  engineers, then  they have huge power over that  market. And so, they're  trying to understand that a little bit  better. That's a big  monopsony, I believe, was Alina  Khan issue when she  was a professor.  She's, of course, the new chairman of the FTC  and has  written, wrote papers as an academic  complaining about the power of Facebook.

Start time: 6198.88
End time: 6238.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is the one who's basically like, yeah,  deconstructed the way Amazon works and says  why it's anti-consumer, even though  the regular argument is like, yeah, sure, prices  are cheaper, so it's better.  Right. Right. Right. But I think  it is more complicated than that. And yeah,  I hope she ends up doing great work at the FTC.  But Leo, I mean, you  probably remember like how hard the government  was against mergers like  back in the, what, 60s and 70s,  too, right? Like, I remember like  I've read stories about like  grocery stores in California  and how much the government  was like, these two tiny little  chains can't come together because  it would be a percentage too much.  I think it all changed under

Start time: 6238.94
End time: 6256.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the Reagan era.  In the late 80s  and early 90s under Bush as  well. And even Clinton,  where they just did not as aggressively  pursue litigation  against mergers.  Yeah, greed is good. It's the greed plus.  Greed is good. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Threats to potential competition.  That's, of course,  the accusation against  Facebook buying Instagram  and WhatsApp is to prevent  Instagram was tiny when they bought it.  Why would the FTC have prevented  that merger? Well, because  it was taking a nascent competitor out  of the market. And so they want to consider  that as well.

Start time: 6299.08
End time: 6346.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that one is kind of tough too, because  I was reporting on startups, you know, when  that deal happened. So in the span  of a couple weeks, Instagram went from being a  company where I could email the CEOs  to say, hey, how's your user  growth going? And  to being a billion-dollar company.  And I don't think anybody was  prepared for the whiplash of that, and that is basically  because Facebook had the power to be like,  here's a billion dollars.  We see your future threat, and nobody  will ever give you this money, so why don't you take this  acquisition? It was so  big, the government had no way to really respond.  And I think now, after WhatsApp,  after everything is early, after  this Microsoft Activision deal too, I do feel  like there is more, the government  is kind of seeing what's happening in the long-term effects  of some of these things coming  together. Maybe there's going  to be smarter ways to push back against this stuff.

Start time: 6347.75
End time: 6372.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really don't. Yeah, in fact, looking  back on what happened with  Instagram and Facebook may  have a big impact on whether  Activision and Microsoft  come together, because, you know,  it's essentially, it's  a huge  acquisition for Microsoft,  and it potentially changes  Microsoft and changes the entire landscape,  even though there are plenty of other  game companies out there.

Start time: 6372.88
End time: 6594.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should point out, this is just a request  for comment, a request for information.  The FTC and the  this is the joint press  release from the FTC and the Department of Justice  say the comment period is open for 60  days, you have until March 21st,  But then, it isn't  even after that, it's not really  up to them. Congress  ultimately tells, I think,  tells the FTC and the DOJ,  and the courts, frankly,  you can bring a case, but  the courts are going to  look at case law and they're going to look at the laws  themselves, so it isn't  really ultimately up to FTC and DOJ,  they can decide to prosecute, but  it may go nowhere. So,  it's interesting, I think these are reasonable  things to think about, I absolutely do.  I would hope, really, the place that  they should be thinking about is in Congress.  Do we need an update to our anti-trust  laws? Now,  in the EU,  the European Parliament is  absolutely moving with alacrity.  The  members of the European Parliament today  or Thursday voted in favor  of the Digital Services Act.  This is a big  bill  that covers the digital market,  has a lot of  amendments, but  among other things,  the most, let's see,  they passed amendments extending the limitation  to sensitive personal data  so that a  company or a site can't collect political  and religious beliefs, sexual orientation.  Moreover,  they decided online  platforms should not make denying  consent for processing  personal data more complex than giving  it. It shouldn't be harder to say no  than it is to say yes.  And, this is a big one,  refusing consent to collect personal data  should not be penalized by disabling  functions.  I haven't read this whole  bill, it's a big one,  and there's a lot to it, and this has been  much debated.  They got a vote on measures  against dark patterns,  Article  13A, dark patterns  are techniques designed to distort or impair  recipients of services' abilities to make  free, autonomous, and informed decisions or  choice. In other words, to trick you.  It forbids  the use of specific techniques  to extort consent on  personal data, for instance, via  repeatedly showing pop-ups.  You sure? You sure? Really?  Come on! You know!  It also prevents platforms from requesting  such consent if users already chose  via automated means. In other words,  finally, that setting in your  Firefox that says do not track,  ask companies not to track,  maybe they'd have to  listen to you, which they don't right now.  There's a lot more  anonymity online, all  sorts of regulations. Now,  I think,  I think,  the way  the EU works is a little confusing  to me, but I think this is just advisory.  I think that each member  nation has to decide  what to do about it. That's my sense  of it. But the good,  and you might say, well, what do we care if we're  not in the EU? And of course, many of our  listeners are, so you would care, but  even in the US, we should care because companies  often are influenced by this.  GDPR has absolutely changed how companies  collect data. This is kind of the next step  to GDPR, the Digital Services  Act, so it has been  adopted.  Now, I think that the other issue  will be to wait and see what the countries  do with that. That's my sense.

Start time: 6595.47

We thank them so much for their  support of this week  in tech.  Letter went out, a coalition of 270  scientists and medical professionals  with an open letter to Spotify  urging them  to do something about  Joe Rogan.  Somebody please stop Joe Rogan.  Rogan says, I'm  just a comedian. Of course, that's what  Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson  also say. On  New Year's Eve,  the program featured Robert Malone,  a doctor who calls himself the inventor  of mRNA vaccines.  He was banned from Twitter.  You would think the inventor  of the mRNA vaccine would not circulate  anti-vaccine misinformation.  YouTube deleted a recording  of the podcast shortly after it was uploaded  to the website by a third party.  The letter says, quote,  by allowing the propagation of false  and societally harmful assertions,  Spotify is enabling  its hosted media to damage public  trust in scientific research  and sow doubt in the credibility of  data-driven guidance offered by  medical professionals.  The signers asked Spotify to immediately establish  a clear and public policy  to moderate misinformation on  its platform. But  is Spotify responsible for what  Joe Rogan says?

So I would love for them  to take a moral stand at some point.  But at the end of the day, they have shareholders  and they have shareholders, right?

Transcript:  Rogan's podcast, number  one on Spotify globally and  in the US last year.  I'm reading Bloomberg. They say  11 million people listen to the Joe Rogan experience.  But I think that number comes from Joe Rogan.  So...  Spotify does not say.  Spotify paid him, and again, no one  knows, but it's estimated around 100  million dollars to be exclusive on their  platform. They have, to be fair,  deleted more than 40  episodes of his show to date.  They've removed 20... Spotify  has, not YouTube.  Spotify has removed 20,000  Well, the first thing they did is took all of the stuff down  from YouTube because they own it now.  So that was a different thing.  Spotify has removed 20,000 podcast  episodes for COVID misinformation.  They do  prohibit  infringing an illegal content and hate  speech.  But they don't, I guess misinformation  is the problem. Partly that's hard because  it's hard to identify  what's factual and what's not.

Transcript:  One primary difference between the Fed's  dollar and other digital transactions,  current digital money is a liability  of the bank, you know, your credit card.  A digital dollar from the Fed would be a Fed liability.  Among other things, that means the Fed wouldn't pay interest on money stored with it.  It is riskless, so you  get to choose.  I don't know.  I don't know how this relates to stable coin,  which is another  kind of currency,  you know, kind of a crypto currency  that a lot of national banks are looking at.  I'm not sure how this relates.  Advocates of the digital dollar  worry that the Fed's delay in implementing  a central bank currency will put it behind  China, which is already doing  a digital currency.  There have been suggestions.  Suggestions have been made  that China's lead in the space  ultimately could threaten US dollars  hegemony as the world's reserve  currency.  The Fed says, eh, we're not that worried about it.  The Fed says, eh, we're not that worried about that.  We've got to get this right.

Transcript:  This is Milo.  Hi Milo.  Wow. What a leap.  So anyway  last week I wrote about 5G  and I thought I'd write about home broadband this  week and  Comcast had  completed this test  of the next generation  of cable modem, which is  known as DOCSIS 4  or to the marketing guys  at Cable Labs. It's called 10G.  It's called 10G because they think  it can get up to 10 gigabits  eventually.  5G.  5G is fifth generation.  This is 10 gigabits.  So anyway.  This is coming at the end of this year and early  next and  Comcast and  Warner and  all of the other cable companies  are going to be moving to this  and it will take your speeds  up to, if you're willing to pay  for it, 10 gigabits.  I talked to  an analyst about  this and what's interesting is  that right  now you  barely need gigabit  speed or what  a lot of people have with Comcast.  This would take it even beyond that.  But as we were talking about  Activision and  Microsoft and what's coming in the future,  gaming in the metaverse,  streaming games, at some  point if you have multiple people doing this  in your house, you  may actually start to need more than a gig  of it. And so it's kind of  an  the cable companies attempt to  get ahead of fiber  providers like AT&T  and it's  coming faster than you think and  likely next year.

Start time: 7706.90
End time: 7724.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is kind of like that 5G conversation  we had earlier.  Yes, but it's wired.  I have  gigabit right now through my cable company.  And how much do you actually get?  Close to a gigabit.  Very close. Like 900 something.  Why? Is that not

Start time: 7726.01
End time: 7752.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people don't.  Like I have Comcast gigabit  and because of  I have a gigabit router,  what I thought was a gigabit router, and it really  can max out only at about 800.  Oh, okay.  And then my phone  can only get out of that,  gets about 500 or 600.  And so, but  I could probably  get by with what I do  with 300 megabits.

Start time: 7752.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. If you have a household  with multiple kids,  they're all streaming  games or they're  watching 4K video  at the same time.  You probably would need it. And of course, you'll  also need Comcast to raise  its bandwidth cap.  I pay for  no bandwidth cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This specific technology sounds good  because I do remember being in New York and  relying on cable and you could tell  everybody was online at home at  bedtime. And then your neighborhood  speeds start chugging. So having  better speeds overall,  expanding that pipe a little, I think  is a good thing overall.  But I'm sure people are not getting  the speeds they're actually paying for.  I'm subscribed to AT&T gigabit  down here near Atlanta.  I only really get gigabit if  I'm wired directly into the router  or standing right near the router.  And then I just started testing their new  Wi-Fi 6 gateway.  And that made things a lot  better. But they're also doing things like  I have an extender  down here, a mesh extender.  And now AT&T is going to force  people to pay $8 a month forever  for these things. Whereas  last gen before,  I used to be able to just buy one for like 50  bucks and you own it.  That's like a forever add-on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The good news with at least with Comcast  when I was talking to  their senior vice president of network  operations, he said  to me directly when I asked  that they will continue to allow you  to have your own modem  and your own router when they go  to DOCSIS 4. So you'll be able  to buy a third party. Yes.  So I was very happy. Because you can't really do that in Fiber.

Start time: 7930.88
End time: 7956.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. The one thing about  DOCSIS 4 is that it does use  the existing cable  infrastructure. So the  coax comes in your house. It's just a different protocol with the same  hard... Right.  And the other thing is that cable companies  have been, they use  Fiber up to nodes in  your neighborhood. And they've been pulling that Fiber  closer and closer. And that's one  of the reasons why they're able to do it. But they don't have  to retrench. You don't have to do Fiber

Transcript:  I do want to throw a PSA out there for AT&T  gigabit users. Apparently this new gateway  has Fiber right to the  gateway, which is kind of nice. Oh,  interesting. Normally there's like a little box that comes  to your house, right? And that normally connects  to Fiber and then goes ethernet to the old gateway.  Now it's like Fiber right to the box.  So I think that would be the upgrade,

Start time: 8008.90
End time: 8020.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 8034.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a box like at some point,  you know, yeah, there was a hole drilled through the side  of your house, right, to pull that fiber in.  But the box that like sits by  an outlet in your house, they just have  to swap that out. And then they can pull another Fiber  line right to the gateway.

It should be gigabit, but the only  speeds I'm ever seeing are like 200  to 300, like at most. So not really  that much.

If you're going to have that fast bandwidth,  you better get better Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi 7 products should become available  according to a report  from Digital Trends  Next year, in anticipation  of the launch of Wi-Fi 7  around 2024,  so you could buy the hardware,  but you won't be able to do anything with it  until 2024,  Taiwan-based semiconductor  firm MediaTek conducted  the first ever tests showing  super fast speeds and low latency  transmission of its Wi-Fi  7 phylogic technology  to key customers and  industry collaborators.  2.4 times more speed than Wi-Fi 6,  even with the same  number of antennas.  30 gigabits?

The more  people are going to see your posting, and  that's good because the more people see it, the more likely  the right person will see it and apply for that job.  But here's another secret,  super secret sauce  that Zip Recruiter has. They'll actually  look at your job posting,  analyze their resumes,  and find people who are right  for your job and then send you their names  so you can invite them to apply.  And I have to tell you, when you  invite somebody to apply, they show up.  They show up for the interview,  they're ready, they want to work for you because  they're flattered, frankly,  that you said, hey, you look good, would  you like to apply for this job?  No wonder Zip Recruiter is  the number one rated hiring site according to  G2 ratings, number one in the US.  Now you can try Zip Recruiter  for free, ziprecruiter.com  slash twit, T-W-I-T.

We made a big deal  when Twitter hired Mudge  to run its security team.  Peter Zatko,  he's gone now.  I don't think he was there more than two years.  Zatko was famous. He'd worked in government,  but he also was one of the founders  of the  Cult of the Dead Cow  hacking group.  Twitter recruited him after teenagers  compromised the company's systems  in July of 2020.  I don't know. Somebody help  us with these teens. Help us with these teens.  Mudge, I don't know  what happened. Mudge is gone. That's it.  It's a Mudge Nudge. It's a Mudge Nudge. He was nudged out  after the new CEO came in.

Transcript:  I'm going to ask Mr.  Mr. Filmcast.  Netflix, kind of in trouble.  The stock market anyway,  didn't like it when they reported  a net game of,  this sounds good, right, 8.28 million  subscribers in Q4,  driven by markets outside North America.  221 million total  subscribers, but it was below  estimates.  Shares fell more than 20%.  Wall Street analysts  have been projecting a gain of 7.25 million subscribers  for the first quarter of 2022.  The company forecast a third of that.  Also, investors  likely spooked  by the fact that Netflix admitted  in its quarterly newsletter  to shareholders that stepped up  competition in the streaming wars  may be affecting our marginal  growth sum.  That's the quote.  That's the quote.  Maybe  affecting our marginal  growth sum.  A little bit.  They spend  a lot of money on  content.  And of course, it works for them,  or has worked in the past.  But, you know,  if it doesn't, then you've spent a lot  of money.

It's about people who have found friendship and relationships in VR chat.  It's a really well done documentary too.  They all show the director Joe Hunting shot it like a real documentary.

It's alerting people to it.  The Android hole is a big problem  right now because  Apple has this app that  will let you find it, but you have to turn it on.  And you have to manually  look for it.  But it's  a really interesting conundrum.  I used it to find my keys  the other day because my cats had  knocked it off a stool and  it fell behind the stool and I couldn't find my  keys. And it's the first time I used  air tag to really find something and it worked  great.  So good for keys.
