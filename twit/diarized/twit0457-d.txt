Transcript:  Well, you don't get better than that.  Hey, I want to welcome Dan Gilmore back to the show. I think the last time Dan was on was many moons ago.  It's great to have you. Dan was for a long time at the San Jose Mercury News.  He left to create citizen journalism as we know it.  He is a technology writer, director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at the Cronkite School of Journalism at ASU.  And writes a regular column on The Guardian, which I find increasingly I turn to because you really seem to do a very good job of boiling this stuff down.

End time: 328.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's an amazing conference. Absolutely amazing. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like a good conference, actually.  It's incredible. Yeah.  So let's talk. We could start off with the FCC.  We've been talking about net neutrality now for a couple of weeks.  Wednesday is the day that we will finally see whatever these proposed rules are.  It was leaked to the Financial Times, apparently, who wrote a couple of weeks ago.  Oh, my God, the end of the world is nigh.  That's why the FCC is going to allow carriers, broadband carriers, to charge for access to their customers.  In other words, to charge edge providers like me, like Netflix.  You're an edge provider?  Anybody who provides content over the Internet. You're an edge provider, and you're an edge provider, and you, and you, and you.  And of course, the world went, what? And there's Alexis Ohanian's raising money to put a billboard outside the FCC.  I called Tom Wheeler a troll.  You know, I mean, it's just, but the truth is we haven't seen the rules, right, Dan?  I mean, or do we know what the rules are going to be?

Start time: 330.00
End time: 350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we know pretty much what they're going to be.  And it's a proposal. It's not official rules yet.  But they're, you know, they're in the process of doing it.  If it happens the way Wheeler wants, then there will in fact be a slow lane and a fast lane on the Internet.  And it would be pretty damaging.

Start time: 352.52
End time: 446.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The rule, what's going to happen Wednesday is the commission as a whole will see these proposed rules for the first time, vote to open a period of public comment.  I think it's a total of 90 days of public comment, 60 and 30, and then vote on the rules.  This is in response, and stop me anybody if I'm saying this wrong. I'm doing my best, but this is, A, it's technical.  So you have to have some technical expertise.  And a lot of the commentators I've read who understand the politics of it don't understand the technology and vice versa.  So it's, you know, you've got to understand the politics of it and the legal ramifications of it and the technology of it.  But this is my understanding. The FCC proposed Internet rules, Verizon challenged them in court and won.  And the court said is you don't have a mandate from Congress under the Telecommunications Act to tell Internet service providers what to do.  The court said, come back. They said, we recognize, in effect, in the opinion, we recognize open Internet, free Internet is important.  But you just don't have the legal authority to do this. You don't have jurisdiction.  Come back and try again.  And there are a couple of approaches. One, the FCC can rewrite the rules under the framework proposed under Title III of the Telecommunications Act, Section 706.  Or, and a lot of people are suggesting they should do this, they can use Title II.  They can declare the broadband providers a common carrier, like a telco, and say, hey, you're a common carrier.  Now we're in charge. We regulate, FCC regulates common carriers.

Start time: 447.90
End time: 452.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We always thought we didn't want the FCC or the government involved in the Internet.  But now all of a sudden we do.

Start time: 453.18
End time: 460.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I agree. This is part of the conundrum of this. Certainly government regulation of the Internet, everybody agrees, is a bad idea.

Start time: 461.00
End time: 463.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's going to happen the way you guys are promoting it.

Start time: 465.00
End time: 485.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're actually promoting it.  The government set up a situation in the United States that is pretty bad with a really strong lack of competition.  They basically gave monopolies to cable companies.  They created duopolies in most areas where you have two possible providers, your phone and your cable company.  There's not a lot of competition. The lack of competition means you can't go anywhere if you don't like what your cable company is doing.  Right. You're stuck.

Start time: 486.36
End time: 490.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the local governments can't do much about it because of certain regulations that were put in place.

Start time: 490.30
End time: 539.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now we had a very good This Week in Law on Friday, and I was listening very carefully to it.  And a couple of things came up.  First of all, some of the panelists on the show believed that Tom Wheeler was not the devil incarnate.  Who knew?  Did not represent the interests of the cable companies and the wireless companies, both of which he's worked for in the past as a lobbyist.  But in fact, was trying to do the best he could without going Title II.  And the panel felt that the Title II rules were really draconian and start to regulate the Internet like broadband providers like common carriers.  And it is a nightmare.  In fact, that was AT&T's opinion.  This week, AT&T said, oh, no Title II.  That's going to kill the Internet.  Dan, maybe can you cut?  Have I said anything wrong at this point?  And can you cut through this a little bit?

Start time: 540.46
End time: 647.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm equally concerned about the idea of going to the common carrier rules without thinking through really carefully what that means.  And it could all go wrong if they do that.  However, as John pointed out himself, the what we have now is effectively a duopoly or really a monopoly in the places where either Verizon has fiber or Comcast or the cable companies pretty much everywhere else.  If you want to have even decent speed.  And we've seen that these carriers simply are going to insist on the right to decide what bits get delivered where at what speed, whether they get there at all.  And that's just not acceptable.  It would common carrier notion means that they have to do their best.  And you also pointed out, and this is right, that the lack of competition for what we laughingly call broadband in this country, which isn't really broadband, the lack of competition comes from the fact that the government, starting with Congress, basically gave these companies control.  And here we are. What people have been predicting for more than a decade is starting to come true.  And Title two is awful, but it's probably less awful than letting the cable companies run roughshod and the telecoms run roughshod.  And keep in mind that with wireless mobile, it's already over.  No one's even contesting that they're going to control that stuff.  So this is really close to being over.

Start time: 648.44
End time: 657.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, why don't people complain about that more that the wireless thing?  There's no equal bits, equal packets for everybody on wireless.  Even Google is in bed with Verizon on this one.

Start time: 659.68
End time: 673.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said, well, we understand that wireless has and I think this is true.  Wireless has very difficult, different technical considerations and wireless shouldn't have to be at least at this point neutral.  It was not going to landline should be not going backwards.

Start time: 674.20
End time: 704.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't I don't understand why why we accept this for wireless either.  They yes, they have different issues.  But if it's a matter of capacity, then charge people on how much how much they use.  But the people out at the edge of the network should be making the choices, not the people in the center.  Right. And that inexorably we're moving toward the people in the center deciding for us.  Really, the real problem in conjunction with with their partners that are really big companies in other respects.

Start time: 705.08
End time: 720.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but I don't want government involvement in the Internet.  But but I also don't trust Comcast as far as I can throw them.  And all of these companies, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, their their job, their mandate is to maximize profits.  I love Comcast. They don't have they don't.

Start time: 721.44
End time: 727.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't use it for podcasting. Why not?  Because we have jitter. It's weird.  Well, what a surprise.

Start time: 728.24
End time: 745.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's the other problem is that these companies are all in the television business.  They're all, you know, Comcast, not only NBC, NBC, it's also provides content, premium content over the wire.  And they have telephony.  So all of these companies are direct competition with the free Internet.

Start time: 745.28
End time: 751.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is all monopoly stuff.  But that's the real problem to me as far as I'm concerned.

Start time: 752.36
End time: 784.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is there is a way out, but we're not going to get there with the current people in charge.  The way out is to do what people what the what other countries have done in many cases,  which is to say to the people who have these monopolies or at most duopolies on the pipes, say, OK,  you have to lease capacity to compete competing ISPs at an imputed cost.  It's roughly what you pay now.  And that doesn't fix it instantly.  But that's what we have to do.  Or we're just not going to get there.

Start time: 785.68
End time: 796.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I loved your article in The Guardian.  The FCC is about to axe murder net neutrality.  But your advice is don't get mad, get even.  And you suggest and I think I agree.  I think this can I guess what he says?

Start time: 797.00
End time: 809.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't read. Yeah. How would you get even?  Get off the Internet now and kill your cable subscription.  No, he said that's not practical.  Yes, it is. There's no reason for us.

Start time: 810.00
End time: 817.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, we have no net.  We get my bit.  You just put me out of business.  Thank you very much. You're not out of business without the Internet.

Start time: 818.95
End time: 827.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, you can find something else.  I'll just sit here. You got you make most your money from the radio show anyway.  That's indicated you make a fortune on that thing.  You can still do that. You're such a disturber.

Start time: 828.00
End time: 885.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just saying that you recommend and I think this is a good solution.  Community Internet movement.  I think that's a really good movement.  Bill, if you don't like the Internet, build your own community broadband networks  owned and operated for the public.  You say waiting for Google Fiber.  You might as well wait to win the lottery.  Google is not your daddy or your savior.  But you got that right.  Yeah. And then call Congress.  And see, I and you know, I talked to John Perry Barlow about this a couple of years ago.  He's, of course, founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation on the board.  He said even among the board members of the EFF were divided.  Some of us understand that government regulation would be a terrible thing in any regard.  Others say, well, but there's no other solution at this point.  Matthew Ingram, help us cut the Gordian knot.  What do we do? Your fault.  Wow. Yeah, you're Canadian.  He's Canadian. He doesn't care.  You know, you can say whatever you want.

Start time: 885.36
End time: 887.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Canada. Stop it.

Start time: 888.04
End time: 964.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I do.  The only sort of rational argument that I've heard for why making the cable carriers,  common carriers wouldn't be a good idea, came from Mark Andreessen,  who I had a sort of back and forth with, along with a bunch of other people on Twitter about when this first came up.  Right. And when they lost the ability to to regulate and everyone was saying, well, make them common carriers.  His argument was if we want to have the Internet get faster and faster and faster and more and more bandwidth  so we can do, you know, virtual reality or so we can do telepresence and we can do all these amazing things,  education and so on over the Internet, then we need investment in the infrastructure.  And his point was if we make cable companies common carriers, they lose the incentive to invest or over invest in the kind of infrastructure that we need.  And now I'm not saying I believe him, but that was the sort of nub of his argument that and he didn't really know how to prevent them from doing the things we want to prevent them from doing either.  But his point was if you if you just legislate that they are common carriers, they will presumably lose the incentive to invest as much as they have.

Start time: 965.12
End time: 974.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is why it's so damn complicated. I don't know if there's a golden or silver bullet on this.  I really don't. The more I learn, the more intractable it seems, frankly.

Start time: 979.34
End time: 1021.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, if if this country had common sense, which I'm afraid we don't anymore, we would look at this the way we looked at the interstate highway system in the 1950s, a public works project that is essential, right?  That we the taxpayers should pay for. We should put dark fiber everywhere, essentially as taxpayers.  We should put it there and then let private industry light it up.  I, you know, again, I don't see us doing it.  I think there's been a conscious decision made by the government to get in bed with the telecoms and to control our communications.  And I don't think that's not that's not conspiracy.  It's just reality.

Start time: 1022.62
End time: 1050.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there is a lot. Another thing that that Mark and others have mentioned is that there's a lot the FCC and the government could do in terms of helping regions or towns or cities, you know, provide their own high speed access.  And some of that is freeing up unlicensed spectrum, you know, forcing carriers to give up spectrum they're not using so that then you can, you know, those different like smaller areas can create their own effectively Google fiber or their own ISP and provide some competition.

Start time: 1052.08
End time: 1198.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Great post on the level threes blog observations of an Internet middleman.  This is Mark Taylor writing and he really kind of lets you know that these big broadband providers are not looking out for our best interest.  Level three is is a kind of an Internet middleman.  They own backbones. They make deals with other networks to provide access to the Internet.  Most of these deals are peering what we call peering relationships, mutual agreements that have gone on since the beginning of the Internet often handshake deals between engineers saying, hey, we'll direct connect to you if you'll direct connect us.  Sometimes those relationships are asymmetric one user sends more data over the network than the others.  In those cases, maybe there's payment and so forth.  But he says typically in these agreements, the way it works is everybody's responsible for fixing congestion.  If all of a sudden the way people use the Internet changes and there's a lot of congestion on a particular route or router, they beef it up.  That's normal. So he mentions that level three.  And by the way, these are real numbers. And that's one of the nice things about this is that this is somebody who's right there in the middle.  Level three has 51 peers like that.  They are interconnected in 45 cities, one thousand three hundred and sixty ten gigabit Ethernet ports.  That's capacity of thirteen point six gigabits, thirteen point six thousand gigabits per second.  Thirteen terabytes, thirteen terabytes per second per second.  And the average number of interconnection cities per peer is five.  So he shows a normal situation where this is a hundred gigabit port in Washington, D.C., a peer connection without congestion.  That's the bottom graph here. And you see these spikes of usage.  But there's no congestion. All the packets get through. In fact, the right hand bottom right graph shows zero packet loss.  Look at the top line. This is a connection with one of the five major broadband providers in this country.  It is congested. So you see that the top, the peaks of the graph are cut off and you see the packet loss significant.  I mean, at the point where the port is so congested that it is unusable.

Start time: 1199.06
End time: 1205.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he says all six are large broadband consumer networks with a dominant or exclusive market share in their local market.

Start time: 1206.06
End time: 1211.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And interestingly enough, they're all dead last in customer satisfaction for that reason.

Start time: 1211.88
End time: 1214.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can triangulate on that one pretty quickly.

Start time: 1215.18
End time: 1239.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he doesn't name names. These are customers. These are deals. He doesn't want to.  Sounds like everybody.  Basically, one is in, I think England and five are in the U.S.  Basically, all the big broadband providers in the U.S. are intentionally letting ports become congested because what they try.  It's essentially blackmail to level three and others saying, you know what, you know, you know, for a fact that this is intentional or they're just well, they're asking.

Start time: 1240.04
End time: 1243.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're demanding money. It's a heck of a coincidence.

Start time: 1243.56
End time: 1261.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's they're coming to level three saying you need to pay us or we're going to keep those congested.  They did this to Netflix. They said your Netflix Internet connectivity went down on Comcast 38 percent since last October.  And that's basically Comcast saying, you know what? You're sending a lot of traffic.

Start time: 1261.32
End time: 1265.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They wanted better peering Comcast or Netflix than this. So they did the deal.

Start time: 1266.20
End time: 1283.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Netflix did the deal, but they're not happy about it. Reed Hastings has published that, you know, in the Netflix blog that he was felt he was blackmailing.  By the way, now it's Verizon and AT&T are coming to Netflix. Same thing. Hat in hand saying if you would like for full access to our subscribers, you would be behoove you to pay us a little money.

Start time: 1284.00
End time: 1285.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this would all be solved by a fast lane.

Start time: 1286.35

Start time: 1307.02
End time: 1324.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the video. Who was the guy that said that we should have it more like a public utility?  That was Dan's position. I agree.  You do?  Oh, that's funny because at least two years ago I went on and on about how we should meter the Internet like a public utility.  Oh, we can't meter the Internet, but that's what they do with public utilities. So why don't we meter the Internet?

Start time: 1325.00
End time: 1354.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, my position was you can meter it, but there is plenty of bandwidth.  If, in fact, we did what Dan's suggesting, which is laid fiber across this country that's owned by the government, lease it out to people, there would be true competition.  The highway system would be preserved.  I truly don't mind paying for more speed. That's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about equal access to customers for edge providers.  What about bandwidth caps?  Yeah, bandwidth caps effectively are the same.

It's as if UPS said, oh, Amazon, you're sending us so much business that we want you to pay as well as the customer.  The delivery is already paid for.  They're double dipping going to Amazon saying, if you would like to reach our customers, you should because you're sending so much business to us.

Transcript:  Wow, that's the most specious thing you've ever said.  Really? Why is that specious?  Well, for one thing, half the time you're not paying for Amazon.  It's always free.  And the second thing is Amazon does pay them to ship the stuff.  And Amazon, if they want more.  Well, somebody pays either me or Amazon.  If UPS wants more money, they can charge more money and they do that commonly, charge more.  The post office does it. They keep raising the rates.  No, that's fine.

And if you remember in the probably the Carter phone, the mid late 90s when they had North Point Communications and all these other guys and they were running through the AT&T switches or the Pack Bell switches, you'd lose the connection commonly because every once in a while, some guy would be in the office during so there's that the North Point thing.  Let's pull it out.  And they were always playing dirty and these guys are played dirty too.  So that idea is never going to fly.  Huge coalition led by.  Go ahead.

And there were a zillion competing ISPs.  That's one of the reasons the Internet got huge quickly in this country, because the phone company, which was then the carrier monopoly said was not allowed to discriminate.  That's why we had.

Transcript:  There's one thing the FCC could do right now that in fact I think would work.  They've required telcos to allow third party DSL providers to sit on the telco networks.  They never did that with cable providers.  If you have Comcast in your, you know, if Comcast built the plant Comcast is your provider.  No other company can ride that cable.  If they said that's why you saw it.  Net your buddy.  Yeah, if they did with DSL Sonic Net can ride on AT&T's wires into my house.  If they did that with cable and said, hey, Sonic Net, you would you like to be an ISP on top of Comcast cable?  They could do that right now.  They did it with DSL.  That would change things that would provide competition.  Is that what you recommend?  OK, we're done.  Laporte writes his prescription.  Amazon, Microsoft and others have agreed.  Google, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Netflix, Twitter and Yahoo have all agreed.  They've written a letter to the FCC saying you guys, you cannot let net neutrality die.  They don't, unfortunately, tell the FCC what to do.

Shaw Cable Rocks, no?  No, you know, I think there are issues.  I know Rogers for a while was knocking Skype off.  I think they fixed that.  We don't have any problems with our Canadian contributors anymore.  Yes, it has gotten better, I noticed.  But it used to be, I couldn't talk to Amber for more than an hour, it would drop out.

Wheeler said, no, if an Internet Service Provider is doing this kind of thing, they may be allowed to,  but if they're doing it, they have to tell you.

I can't remember.  Was it the Financial Times?  Anyway, still no confirmation.  I think it's a bogus rumor.  I don't believe it.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought Dr. Dre confirmed it.  So Dr. Dre posted something on his Facebook that apparently was a phone call, and he said, I'm Rapp's first billionaire, which he would be with a 25% stake in beats.  Added to his existing fortune, he'd be well over a billion dollars.  Then he pulled it down.  Now, I got to tell you, beats business is almost entirely driven by marketing.  It's bad.  The headphones are crap.  Oh, yeah.  The streaming music service has been a flop, despite the fact that AT&T has offered a family plan for it and aggressively marketed it.  It is a marketing-driven business.  It has been from day one.  It's the name of Dr. Dre, the name of Jimmy Iovine, the music industry, cache, the design, the styling, and frankly, the huge advertising budget.  By the way...  So they're not good?

I cannot think of any reason why Apple should buy this company.  Admittedly they have a cash flow of a billion dollars a year.  So a 3.2 billion dollar acquisition is not an expensive acquisition.  Well, your 3X sales is pretty high.  But you also got to wonder why they're for sale.  And I have a feeling that the streaming music service has been a flop.

They might as well have been invented by the Soviet Union in the 50s.  They are so, except they're better looking, but they are so painful to use and so awkward and they do such incredibly terrible things.  It's like, I don't know.  I don't understand.

No.  The kids like them because they got Dr. Dre.  It's all about marketing.  3.2 billion is coincidentally exactly what Google paid for Nest, a thermostat company.  So 3.2 billion is the new one million.  I guess.  That's weird.  The other thing I'd point out is that Apple, most of Apple's $160 billion is overseas, is offshore.

Everybody's chosen.  Everybody's chosen.  And I know this because the deal AT&T was offering, $16 for a family,  was much better than the Spotify deal or the Google Music deal.  So I went to my kids, 18 and 22, and I said, hey, kids, let's all use Beats.  OK, Dad.  No.  They said, no, I like Spotify.  No, I like Ardeo.  I mean, we're all using...  Maybe they're too old.  Oh, yeah, if there were four, I could convince them.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Apparently, according to one story I read, 200,000 subscribers is not a significant number,  not worth billions.  I'm going to be the...  You know, the New York Times is confirming this.

I got a package from a company that wants to promote these little bungee cords for wiring.  They sent me those.  They sent me those.  Yeah, those things.  They put thick stamps on it, and they didn't put enough.  It was 85 cents postage due.  What a lousy impression.  You should not have this kind of lousy impression.  If you're in a business that requires mailing, whether it's invoices or brochures or products,  maybe you're an Etsy seller, I can't believe the number of Etsy sellers.  It looks like the package was handmade.  They should look professional.  That's why you need Stamps.com.  Stamps.com lets you print your own official U.S. postage from your computer and your printer,  eBay, Etsy, Amazon, wherever you sell.  You get a scale.  We're going to tell you how they get the scale, so you always have exactly the right postage.  You're not guessing.  You're not applying it with your thumb and your tongue.  You actually can print right on the envelope with your company logo.  The return address is very professional.  It really is a great way to do any kind of mailing.  The mail carrier comes to you and picks it up.  In fact, there's even a big button on the Stamps.com interface that says,  get the mail carrier here.  So if you miss the pickup, you can get another one free.  Plus, you get special discounts on mailing and shipping you can't even get at the post office.  Stamps.com, last year, take a guess, how much postage, I'm going to hide the number,  how much postage Stamps.com customers printed last year?  Just take a wild guess.  A lot.  A lot. Very good.  That's exactly right.  It's $1.5 billion worth of postage in one year.

Transcript:  So, all right. Let me see if I can explain what happened here.  Google, when it started shipping Android phones...  Actually, Google acquired Android.  Andy Rubin started the company, then Google bought it.  When Android was created, it was based on Java.  Right.  But they did not have an official Oracle Java runtime on it.  They had their own. It was called Dalvik. D-A-L-V-I-K.  And it was, correct me if I'm wrong here,  reverse engineered to be compatible with Java,  but it wasn't the Java written by Oracle,  which owns the rights to Java.  Java was invented by Sun in the mid-90s.  And bought out.  And bought out.  It was written as a write once, run anywhere application programming language.  A lot of people use it.  So, Dalvik is open source.  It was written by Dan Bornstein, who named it after an Icelandic fishing village.  I thought you might be interested in that little tidbit.  And it is API compatible with Oracle's Java.  Oracle sued Google, saying, you stole our APIs.  Lower Court said, no, you can't steal APIs.  That's just, you know, the names of calls. You can't steal that.  Oracle appealed the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  What district?  That's a good question. I don't know what district.

Now, this is a huge deal because while software is subject to both patent and copyright,  the idea of the name you give a call or the name you give a variable being copyrightable is really tough.  The jury had previously deadlocked on this, whether Google's use of Java APIs was covered by fair use.  And that basically is the contention.  Oracle sued Google for patent infringement and copyright violation.  The jury said no patent infringement, but Google did copy the code from 37 APIs.  Google said computer code, like concepts in a written language, are subject to fair use in terms of structure, sequence, and organization.  You can't copy verbatim the words.  Which they did.  Well, that's what's interesting on this. They did say Google had copied this code, nine lines of code.  The judge at the time said, well, any idiot could write a range check.  In fact, I decided to learn programming language and I wrote one.  Which I kind of admire the judge for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This judge compared the descriptions or the calls in the API to Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities.  Which seemed kind of, I mean, I'm not sure we're at the point where we want to say that computer calls in an API are literature.  But that seems to be where she was going.

Transcript:  Well, and that's what the EFF said.  They say treating APIs as copyrightable has a profound negative impact on interoperability and therefore on innovation.  All software developers use APIs to make their software work with other software.

Start time: 3681.00
End time: 3727.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Allowing a party to assert control over APIs means, this is the EFF still, means that a party can determine who can make compatible, therefore, interoperable software.  For instance, there's an emulator on Linux called Wine that allows you to run some Windows software on Linux.  The way it does it is not by duplicating the Windows code, but merely by duplicating the API.  So when a program says, open a window, draw a window, put a line there, it does it in the same way with the same calls that it would if it were on Windows.  The code that runs may be different, but it responds in the same way.  So an API means that you can create an emulator.  This ruling would allow Microsoft to say, hey, by the way, you cannot ever create Wine.  Wine's dead.

Start time: 3750.32
End time: 3759.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it would now all of a sudden give them control.  You could write, for instance, a mail server that only works with clients you approve.  You could.  I think it'd be a big change in the way we do things.

Transcript:  So this court is the one that has done patents for years and has basically this court is in love with anything that has intellectual property attached.  Right.  And they're getting increasingly slapped down by the Supreme Court because they've been going vastly overboard, the appeals group in favor of patent holders.  So, you know, maybe this will get slapped down by the Supreme Court, but it's pretty bad.  And the other thing I'd be really curious about is I think it's inevitable that Oracle has done its share of what it has sued Google about.  That's a good point.  And I'd kind of like to see a list of the APIs that Oracle, by its standard, has been stealing over the years.  I bet there are quite a few.

Start time: 3816.00
End time: 3845.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, Google says it will appeal.  The first thing it'll do is go back to the lower court and see if they can rewrite it and get the lower court to you get the higher court to approve it.  But ultimately, I think you're right.  I think this is going to the Supreme Court and there is hope there.  Although, frankly, with the Supreme Court, we have I feel like it's unpredictable.  You never know what they're going to do.  But, Dan, you say that they are this is the kind of thing they might well overturn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's easy. Let me explain.  And I'll read this is from the judgment.  To use the district court's example, one of the Java API packages at issue is Java.lang.  Within that package is a class called math.  Within math, there are several methods, including one that's designed to find the larger of two numbers.  We'll call it max.  The declaration for the max method is defined for integers is public static in max parentheses in X and Y, where the word public very important means that the method is generally accessible that they're publishing it in effect.  Static means that no specific instance of the class is needed to call the method.  The first indicates that the method returns an integer in X, X, Y, or two numbers inputs being compared.  And I think any literate person could understand.  They'll figure that out. No problem.  The programmer calls the max method by typing the name of the method, M, A, X, and providing X and Y.  Ah.  The expressions used command the computer to execute the implementing code that carries out the operation of returning the larger number.  Yeah, they'll have that down.

Start time: 3926.14
End time: 3932.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

I've been trying, like the Dickens, to get a Macintosh email client, including Apple's  own mail, to work with Gmail.  Have you tried Mailbox?  Yeah, like Mailbox.  It doesn't have some of the things I need.  I've been using something called Mailmate, which is written by a Danish programmer,  and it's really good.  But he said, you know, the problem with IMAP on Google is just that it's not going to  work with Gmail.  It's not going to work with Gmail.  It's not going to work with Gmail.  But he said, you know, the problem with IMAP on Google is just really weirdly implemented.  It's not standard at all.  Does Thunderbird work with it?  All these things work okay, but there are issues.  And Apple's mail only started breaking with Mavericks, but it just adds to my general  pain, my frustration with email.

The router is from a company called Media Link.  Media Bridge Products took umbrage at the negative review.  Did they do that?  Threatened to sue the guy for libel.  Yeah.

One, he asserts that we are posting reviews, fallacious reviews of our own.  Which most companies do.  And two, that the Media Bridge router is a rebranded router from another company.  Which most routers are.  The Media Bridge folks said that is, those are both demonstrably not true.

If you're a reviewer, you might actually be libeling a company  if you say something that is demonstrably untrue in the review.  I've always believed that too.  Be careful.  Yeah.

And they have now shown themselves to be somebody or a company with a thin skin  and with serious questions raised about the routers that they're selling,  whether...  Right.  I don't know if it's true or false, but it has made me,  for two reasons, less likely to buy it, because the first one is  I don't like companies that sue people for things like this,  and the other is I don't know much about the router.

Start time: 4804.00
End time: 4842.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  with Hachette over pricing.  You know, all the time Google.  So what happened when Amazon first started out?  The publishers loved them.  Oh my God, we have somebody we can go to that won't charge us  like Borders or Barnes & Noble.  And then Amazon puts Barnes & Noble out of business,  or Borders out of business, shrinks Barnes & Noble's presence  significantly.  And then Amazon goes to them and says, oh, by the way,  we're going to take a little more money.  This is what Tower Records did.  And so I don't know what's going on, but it seems...  I can find out.  It seems likely that Amazon wants a bigger discount from Hachette.  It could have to do with the e-books because Amazon really

Start time: 4843.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4848.33
End time: 4865.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's affecting a lot of authors, and the authors are  pissed because in some cases the discount has disappeared.  So they're charging full freight.  In many cases, it's just not available.  And so it's costing...  Who does it cost really?  Well, not just Hachette, it costs the authors.  Two to three weeks.  Lost sales.  Two to three weeks.

And if Amazon is doing this, it is stupid and arrogant, and  it's going to come back and bite them because they do have  enough market power in books that they should not be pulling  stunts like that, assuming that that's what they're doing,  which seems pretty likely.  Yes, it sure does.  It's really, really dumb on their part.

Transcript:  This is a graph from Tim Lee.  Patent approval rates.  If the patent office says we approve 54% of all patents.  But that's a little funny number because what they're saying is, of the patents that come in the door, 54% get approved immediately.  But it turns out what mostly happens is patents that are turned down, the guy goes back, rewrites a few words, brings it in again.  Of all patent filings, 94% are approved.  That's nice.  Now here's a graph.  It's kind of hard to see.  I'll zoom in a little bit on this.  Patent office allowance rates.  The patent office uses the lower line, but the top line is the line.  If we just look at all patents that come in the door, whether they ever get patented, we start in 1996, got almost 100% in 2001.  And then went dipped a little bit.  But under President Obama's patent commissioner, who happens to be a former Googler, by the way, it's going, it's skyrocketing.  It's down currently 94%.

My kids, both my kids use it a lot.  And I think... We talked to Dana Boyd on triangulation a couple of weeks ago.  She said she's a wonderful researcher, the Harvard researcher, who really kind of keeps up on what kids today are doing and thinking.  These kids.  No, she's good because she said, you know, what they really...  It's for them, they understand privacy, the implications, and they just want to...  They want ephemera. They don't like the fact that everything they do is preserved forever on the Internet.  Ephemera.  They want to be able to send an ephemeral picture once in a while.  I think that's reasonable.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually talked to my daughter and some of her friends about it, they're teenagers.  And it's not so much that the pictures are dirty, it's that they don't have to care about them as much.  So if you take a picture, you put it on Instagram or Facebook, people are going to see it forever.  And so then you have to agonize about whether it's any good or not.  If you just want to take a stupid picture of yourself sticking your tongue out or making a stupid face,  you don't have to worry about everybody seeing it because only the person you send it to is going to see it,  and they're only going to see it for 10 seconds.

It's all so important.  Yeah, and there's a huge amount of social pressure to just, well, why didn't my picture get any likes?  But Snapchat, you don't have to worry about any of that.  It's literally just there and gone.

Transcript:  So, well, let's talk about this.  But first, Facebook tried to buy... no, Google tried to buy them, or Facebook, somebody for $3 billion.  Snapchat said, no, we're worth more than that, and they probably would have been, except for this.  Maybe they wish they'd taken the money now.  I think, yeah, that would be what I would think.  Facebook tried to compete with Poke.  Mark Zuckerberg said, I wrote this myself.  Actually, this week, Facebook announced that they're killing both Poke and Facebook camera,  two apps that they developed that nobody adopted, but Snapchat lived on.  Well, a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Snapchat...  The FTC said Snapchat was deceiving customers because, well, see, this I don't... I think is BS,  because there are ways to save the message.  For instance, opening it in a third-party app or doing a screenshot.  I think everybody understands that.  Well, that's, yeah, for sure.  And you can't fight that.  I mean, you could always put the Snapchat picture up there and take a picture with a camera.  Yeah.  But also, there's some issue about whether Snapchat may not actually be getting rid of that image on the server.

Start time: 5655.24
End time: 5660.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5661.00
End time: 5675.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, to me, it's not just the images.  They kept your location in some cases.  They kept contact information and other sort of personal information.  Like the images, I think we all knew they're on your phone.  Someone can get them if they want to.

Start time: 5676.02
End time: 5696.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the FTC did point out that for a year the FAQ at Snapchat's website read like this,  is there any way to view an image after the time has expired?  Snapchat's answer, no, snaps disappear after the timer runs out.  I think it's reasonable for the FTC to say, well, a consumer might read that and think foolishly those pictures have disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That happened with WhatsApp as well, by the way.  There was an Android malware, a couple of malware apps on Android that were sending bogus paid texts, remember?  Yeah.  And the way they got the phone number was they just checked with WhatsApp.  They said, hey, what's the phone number?  And WhatsApp said, oh, I'll tell you.  So this is an issue all around.  FTC's complaint also said there were several security failures at Snapchat,  a data breach in December in which 4.6 million Snapchat accounts and cell numbers were leaked onto the internet.  But did anybody assert that Snapchat could save those images on Snapchat servers?  Because I read that as well.  I did too. Why not?

They ship it to them.  If you don't remove the data, they'll do that for you.  And then they'll send you a check, a PayPal credit, or an Amazon gift card that's worth 5% more because they just like you so much.  So if you are a gazelle, an Amazon user, gazelle is a great choice for you.  Visit gazelle.com.  Join the, what is it?  It's how many hundreds of millions?
