Transcript:  tech is provided by AOL radio at AOL dot com slash podcasting.  For your free audiobook, visit AOL dot com slash twit.  And by listeners like you.  Thanks for your donations.  This is twit.  Words of wisdom for Veronica Belmart.  I think we should get started.  Did I just call you Veronica Belmart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did and you're not the only one who's done that recently, which is kind of weird.  I like that.  It sounds like a supermarket.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many of you show of hands were at Walmart this weekend to get your $99 HDTV player,  HD DVD player?  Not I.  Anyway, let's say that's Veronica Belmart.  Mahalo to Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is debuting this week her long awaited video project for Mahalo.  Yep.  Tomorrow.  I think some people thought that you just decided not to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, who knew?  But it takes a little while longer than I expected to get a show off the air when there's  no background in video whatsoever at the company that you're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I do audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You kind of have to build that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Build it from scratch.  That's also Roger Chang, who knows all about that.  He built it for scratch at DL dot TV.  He and Robert Heron host the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although Patrick actually, Patrick and Jim started that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick and who?  Who are they?  I don't know them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I know them?  Well, I don't want to take credit for something I didn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Patrick said he might join us.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen the new addition to his family?  Seamus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  How is Seamus?  Is he pretty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like every other newborn infant I've ever come across.  Looks like Winston Churchill?  Yeah, kind of.  Without the laughter.  He was a funny man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Patrick said if he could, he would join us.  And I said, look, no pressure, dude, because you probably haven't slept in 12 days, but  you're welcome to join us.  He may join us.  There is somebody with a baby on the line, however.  Hey, Mr. Robert Scoble.  The Scoble-izer is here.  Hey, Robert.  Hey, how are you doing?  Congratulations.  Thank you.  How old is your baby now?  Six weeks.  Six weeks old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's his name?  Milan, like the Italian city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a pretty name.  Was that your name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Or Miriam?  Miriam likes Milan Candera.  She's an English major and that's her favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the unbearable lightness of being Scoble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus, I was supposed to take her to Italy and I never did.  This is close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gave you a baby.  What do you want?  Spoken like a true man.  Speaking of true men, Mr. Ryan Block is here, editor-in-chief at Engadget.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever been described as a true man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you offended?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm actually very proud right now.  I'm about to get on a horse and smoke a Marlboro or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not going to talk too much about Leopard, but you did a good job on Leopard coverage  on Engadget.  You still happy with Leopard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's not without its problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm starting to see little niggly things here and there that just kind of make me nervous.  I don't like it.  Yeah, well, nothing's ever perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there's that phrase, software is never made perfect.  It's abandoned.  Right.  And, you know, Leopard is not without its problems.  No, but I love it.  It's definitely Apple's strongest.  Yeah, no, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's really good.  But there's just weird little airport issues and stuff that just come up and it's just,  it's like, come on, what's going on here?  Did you do a clean install or did you do an upgrade?  Archive and install.  Should I have done a clean install?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually did an upgrade and I had a few issues like Firefox not running at all.  It would just sit there.  And then I basically cloned my entire drive to an external drive.  I did a clean install and then had Leopard pull back all my personal and application  That's a bad idea.  And then everything works fine now.  I should probably do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I did an upgrade just because, you know, when I'm doing this thing, I kind  of have to put myself in the position of the readership and what they're most likely to  be doing.  And so, you know, it was upgrade for me and not archive and install or fresh install or  anything like that.  And I had almost no problems.  I mean, you know, a couple of small things with some software incompatibilities that have  more or less been fixed at this point.  But no real changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple told me that I should do it, that, you know, upgrade was okay.  So I also tried to figuring, well, most people are going to do what Apple says.  And yeah, it's surprising, better than it should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, no, it worked.  The upgrade works well.  It was just a few software applications that hung and then didn't want to run.  And so I did a clean install.  All those issues went away.  Okay, enough Leopard talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't the Leopard show because there's bigger fish to fry this week.  Some really big fish to fry.  So, you know, I was just talking with Google, sticking Facebook's face saying, we've got  an API.  Facebook says, what?  AP, what?  You were at the announcement, weren't you, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I was.  They announced that they were joining forces with MySpace and 17 other partners.  LinkedIn.  And let developers build Facebook-like apps, but build them for all 17 services all at  one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, let's make it clear.  This is not, I mean, Orkut, which is Google's little used off forgotten social network.  Except in Brazil and India, by the way.  Which is weird.  But everywhere else.  Because that's because Orkut in Brazil means you're going to get it.  I almost said the bad word, but anyway.  So, it's really more about an API than about Google saying, I'm going to do Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And they clearly are planning something like that with Orkut.  Orkut's one of the 17 services that's going to support these widgets, basically.  I call it the open widget platform, right?  Because I can build a widget, which by the way, the APIs are loosely based on iGoogle.  So, if something runs on iGoogle, you tweak it a little bit and you put it into the open  social platform, and then it'll run on all 17.  You have to be a JavaScript programmer?  Yeah, it's JavaScript and HTML and the usual stuff.  Nothing non-standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this Brad Fitzpatrick's work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was on the team and Joe Krause and my old boss, Vic Condutra, was doing the press stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, how does Joe Krause feel about aliens these days?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's kind of backed off on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We never talk about that.  We just talk about tech.  For people who don't know, he was at Excite and then left Excite and was big on like aliens being around or something.  Wow.  It was just a little weird and he didn't work for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like aliens as an ET?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that's him, unless I'm, I hope I'm not slandering him.  Wasn't he the guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember something like that, but I don't know enough about that part of the place to be authoritative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, so he's doing, and of course, Fitzpatrick's a guy who did Live Journal.  Yeah.  Was swallowed by Blogger and then Blogger was swallowed by Google.  So, he's the little fish in the big belly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Six Apart is one of the 17 companies.  Now, the problem is this stuff is not completely built out yet, right?  Some companies ship some services on Friday like Ning and Plaxo, but MySpace wouldn't even tell me a launch date for their services.  So, and they said probably a couple months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think they, now is it in their interest because doesn't this really make your data portable so you could go from MySpace to any other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the next part of this, I don't know, announcement.  The first part was getting the applications working on all these things.  That's what really they showed off on Thursday was apps running.  You know, because Facebook's apps are really cool because I can see what apps you have loaded on your profile.  That's the first time I've had a software platform like that where I could see what you have loaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're my friend and I let you see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't see what apps you have loaded on your Macintosh, but I can see what apps you have loaded on your Facebook profile.  And that's one reason it got popular.  In fact, I like, which is one of the companies that also jumped over and is supporting the open social thing, got six million users or five something, five something million users in two weeks when Facebook first opened up.  Because everybody could see what apps were loaded on their friends' profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But iLikes about music. So really what you cared about was sharing music with your friends.  Yeah.  But the fact that they could, you think it's the fact that they could tell that you were using iLike that made them want to use iLike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, because I could see what apps you have loaded and like I like what Ryan does.  So Ryan's a cool guy. He has a bunch of cool apps. I'm going to steal all his apps and put them on my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, gee, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around what Google is proposing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first part of this is really an open widget platform where a developer can build one of those Facebook style applications and have it run on 17 different containers and more containers coming.  Containers being MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I'm an application, a Facebook application developer, I may say, oh, forget Facebook. That's only Facebook.  I can write one application that's going to run on all these other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Google is hoping for. In reality, most of the developers I've interviewed over the weekend say, well, we're going to build them twice.  Once for Facebook and once for OpenVotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Facebook has been kind of funny about this. They said, you know, they didn't show up and yet somebody at Facebook said, well, we want to be a part of it.  They're obviously.  Yeah, they're open to it.  They are. What do you know about this?  Well, they say they're open to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's no knowing if they got into it, how well or much they would, you know, how much muscle they put behind them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it risky for somebody like MySpace and Facebook?  Because they're essentially saying you don't need to stay with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. I don't know if any of this is going to make people move to the various social networks or not.  I mean, the reason that people join Facebook isn't specifically because of the apps.  The apps are a cool benefit that they have from using that network.  But having apps on say Orkut isn't going to make me switch from Facebook or make me use Facebook any less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But your data will be portable down the road.  So if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the next part of it that we're not we're still not clear.  This thing hasn't been specified.  What's their intention?  Right. That's their intention to let you move your data.  To Orkut.  From Orkut over to MySpace or to Facebook, you know, and move your data around.  We haven't yet seen that system be built out.  So we don't really know how well it'll work.  The first part of this, though, is the apps and the apps will move.  And the apps are fairly easy to move because they're, you know, like I like is really its own web service.  Anyways, it can live independently of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much how, you know, in a way, this reminds me a little bit of XFN, which was the, you know, the XHTML Friends Network and the Wordpress been most has been most vocal and supportive.  The idea was kind of the whole Internet should be your social network.  And if with the proper infrastructure, it doesn't matter if you're on Facebook or MySpace, you'll be able to see everyone.  Yeah.  Is that you think the end game here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the that's the what they're hinting at.  Again, we haven't seen it built out and we haven't seen the specs.  Why does Google want to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's it? What's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, to keep keep the big companies argue over developers.  And if developers are moving on to somebody else's platform and they definitely are with Facebook, every single startup I interview now says, oh, yeah, we're building a Facebook app.  Why not? Why not?  And so Google sitting there going, man, we're seeing this trend of all these developers moving off of the web and onto Facebook and building things for Facebook.  We got we got to worry about that.  Right. Because Google ain't going to get paid if everybody moves into Facebook.  So it's a total play over developers.  This was aimed at developers to get them to build the apps for both Facebook and open social because there's some really cool stuff like Scrabble.  I disagree with Ron. I think some people will join Facebook for some of the apps like Scrabble.  I love Scrabble.  Scrabble. Yeah. If you see people playing Scrabble, that might actually drag you into Facebook, even though you really don't care about the rest of the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it depends on it depends on how you look at social networking.  Do you look at it? I mean, if you already have a good set of people, you know, in the non digital world that you frequently meet up with.  Yeah, that could be the case. But I mean, if you're younger and you're you're saying a smaller town, you meet a lot of the people, you know, that you know about, you know, online.  That may or may not be a hook. I mean, if if you have a social networking group that skews to one particular kind of group of people, be it like, you know, teenagers or, you know,  goss or whatever, you're more likely to or, you know, or some sort of like anime.  If you're an anime, you know, you go into an anime group, you're not going to suddenly go over to like, you know, the the Wall Street managers, you know, social networking site because there's a really cool app on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think the grouping of apps will drag more people onto specific ones.  I think it will be value added.  Yeah. Facebook today has what, 50 million people in MySpace has more than 100 million people on it.  And that means there's more people who aren't on those two services than are.  And so how are you going to get dragged into one of those networks? It's going to be cool stuff to do on those networks.  And yeah, the social network is a big part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how are you even going to know about the apps until you're on the network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about people. I heard millions of people reading Gadget, right?  So if there's a cool gadget, you know, apps on there, we'll talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go because your friends are there. Yeah. Not because the apps are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but your friends are going to tell you, hey, join our Scrapulus game or join our XYZ thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you could play the same widgets on any platform, then it becomes irrelevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no point in moving. Right. If they're already developing the apps for Facebook and then suddenly similar apps start showing up on MySpace or Orkut or whatever, you're not going to just switch.  It's the same stuff going on. Your friends can play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now you understand why Google did this because they wanted to make sure that people didn't have a reason to switch from MySpace or from Orkut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's at least a level playing field. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to Eric Eldon writing in Venture Beat, he says Facebook on Tuesday is going to announce Pandemic, which is going to change.  What are you laughing at? Pandemic. You like the name Pandemic?  Geez, it's so. Sounds like a disease.  It is. That's what it is.  It's viral. It's now I don't really understand it.  So maybe somebody who's looked at this can can you explain it?  But according to Eric, it's it's going to remove the sponsored groups that advertisers can buy on the site and instead will introduce pages that advertisers can buy and which can include interactive games or other applications of the advertisers choosing.  He says people like I like and Flixster, which are very popular on Facebook, are embracing open social because they're worried about Pandemic.  Yeah. They're you know, they don't want to play in this Facebook.  I don't understand why. What is explain this to me?  Anybody understand this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, part of it is that if if you're an app developer and your total business is inside Facebook, you're having to compete with Facebook and Facebook might turn off your ability to put ads on on the app.  Right. That's scary.  You know, and that's scary. And and Facebook itself has some advantages over a third party developer.  They can stick stuff into my newsfeed where, you know, the problem is with these newer companies now, Rocky and slide were on the first wave of apps and they got millions of people to sign up.  But if you started a new Facebook application company today, you know, it's going to be really hard for you to get a lot of people to try out those apps because I'm looking at Facebook right now and I have hundreds of apps.  That people have, you know, asked me to try and I don't have time to try them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to Mike Harrington at TechCrunch, they're going to launch a way for a Facebook user to tell their friends what they buy online.  Yeah.  Talk about I mean, there you there's what you were talking about. Not just come play Scrabble with me, but come fly to Hawaii with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or yeah, or buy this song.  You know, Engadget will find that interesting because now they could create an Engadget group where they could talk about gadgets.  Right. And have a whole community talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it wouldn't be a PDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All this that I bought an iPhone, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  So, but Google's business is advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it is, isn't it?  Yep.  So is this really and are we now really seeing the real face off?  It's not about Google, Microsoft.  It's about Google, Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  Facebook, by the way, is hiring a lot of the smartest people at Google.  I'm seeing a lot of people who used to work at Google showing up at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the stock's going to be better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  The upside is much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Google at now?  Yeah, if you joined Google now, it's $711.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google can easily double.  But OK, that's doubling.  You go over to Facebook and you get a bunch of stock because you're a hot developer,  stock options, and you can make millions that way.  That's how a lot of these kids got rich at Google.  Remember, they stole all the best people from Microsoft.  That's why they opened an office up in Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about security?  I mean, there's been a lot of talk about Facebook security.  I feel fairly good about the Facebook markup language and its security.  And I think one of the reasons people trust is because it's such a closed system.  You open it up now.  In fact, according to TechCrunch, OpenSocial was hacked in 45 minutes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Facebook has been hacked over the years, too.  In fact, the director of security over there, Chris Putnam, actually got his job by hacking Facebook.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And that shows that Facebook had three or four years where all the college kids have been banging on it.  And it's been hardened over three years.  OpenSocial hasn't been hardened.  It hasn't lived through that three-year period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A guy named The Harmony Guy who says, I'm just an amateur, put a bunch of emoticons on John McCray, the VP marketing at Plaxo's profile.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I think that makes me a little nervous.  McCray, by the way, says he added the...  I did it.  I did it.  I did it myself.  I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and then he took it down.  It was me.  I did it.  I think he came back later and realized, no, it wasn't actually me.  I did it.  I actually like Plaxo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think Plaxo is the kind of company that could really benefit late to the party.  But if you support OpenSocial, then your platform kind of is at a peer with everybody else.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Plaxo lets you share or synchronize your contacts.  In fact, that's why I use it for.  I had 2,000 contacts in Outlook, and I wanted to get them outside of Outlook and put them in other things.  That's what I use it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only know 20 people, so it's not quite as complicated as yours.  But that's exactly what I like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just wish I could hook it up to Facebook and shove them all into Facebook.  But there's two problems with that.  One, Facebook has a cap of 5,000 friends on Facebook.  Aw.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the only guy who knows that, by the way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did you reach that one?  I reached it in eight weeks after joining Facebook, believe it or not.  It's because you add everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  I don't add anybody.  Yeah, I do add anybody.  You add anybody.  Yeah.  I add everyone to Facebook, too.  He's got 14 fake Borats on his list.  It's a two-way medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If people want to follow me, I follow them.  That's the gift economy, right?  And the second reason...  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on.  How many people on Twitter do you follow?  Now, you don't leave that open and watch 7,000 people's garbage feeds.  I absolutely do.  He does, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're not on there.  You don't see him responding to everyone all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I piss everybody off because I respond to so many people.  And other people are going, you're spamming my Twitter.  All I see is Scoville.  Will you shut up?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I opened the Sunday Times business section right on the front page.  The man behind the Google phone, I guess the Google phone must be real, Andy Rubin.  He was an Apple guy.  He went over to Google and now he's in charge of...  What do they call it?  He's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android, Google OS.  It's funny because...  Director of mobile platforms, that's what he is.  Right.  It's funny the way these new cycles work.  I mean, this is no secret.  I mean, they acquired Android, which is this post...  He did Danger.  He's one of the co-founders of Danger, who did the sidekick.  Ah, okay.  And, you know, obviously Danger did its thing.  And he left Danger and founded a company called Android.  And Android was quietly working on a mobile operating system and integrated mobile apps.  This is something that was known.  Google kind of quietly acquired them.  I think it was in 2005.  So, everybody after that pretty much assumed that Google was going to be getting into the mobile OS space.  And then we've been hearing rumors about this and confirmation.  I mean, I've heard from multiple different really trustworthy inside sources who've actually seen it and know it's coming.  And we've written about Andy Rubin.  It's funny how the Times does this expose.  And all of a sudden it's like, oh, huge news.  Obviously it's happening.  But, I mean, anybody who's been paying attention knows there's no news there.  I mean, this is all completely known facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll just, in my defense, I'll say, you know, I read it.  Of course, I read lots of rumors about this.  But when the Times publishes it, it does kind of give it some credence and weight.  I mean, it's not that I don't believe you, Ryan.  I totally believe you.  No, I believe what you're saying.  But all of that's insider rumor, rumor, rumor.  And then, I mean, look, if the time, the time, one of the things that happens, I'm sure, is the Times calls Google and says, is it OK if we say this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you got to remember when you look closely at the language in the Times, they don't confirm anything more than any of the other publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Andy gives him an interview and a profile and pictures at his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but he doesn't say anything about the Google file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's talk about the Google phone.  What we know and what we don't know.  Obviously, there's an operating system based on Android.  Is there hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's kind of a nebulous question.  When you say it's going to run on a piece of hardware.  But is Google going to sell hardware or are they going to do an 8?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, some say HTC, some say this Chinese company is building a set for them.  Is Google going to sell a set or are they going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you got to remember, I mean, this can go with so many different ways.  You know, they could sell their own Google branded phone through an ODM like HTC, the same way that Palm used to sell the trios that were made by HTC.  And they can try to sell this to the carriers.  They can distribute the OS and let, you know, let carriers or handset manufacturers kind of do the hardware end of things.  Or they can maybe, you know, if they're really crazy, they could just put the code out there, open source the code and let, you know, anybody who wants to have at it get onto the Google.  Yes, I mean, everything that I've seen, everything I've heard points to them working with multiple carrier carriers and handset manufacturers.  Basically with the goal of dumping the operating system on as many devices as they can possibly do it on, you know, let them decide the interface and let them decide everything they want to put on it just as long as that it's got that really great Google app integration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did what did they learn from Apple's experience with AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To not just use one carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think not to use just one hardware design.  Either I mean, you know, as cool as the iPhone is, it's not a it's not a perfect fit for everyone.  So I think Google knows that the real money here in the future is not going to be in hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be in services.  It's location based advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what they care most about?  Well, there's there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then there's also just, you know, the value out of making sure that they keep the users they have, you know, locked into the Google app ecosystem.  They don't want to lose, you know, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google search users to other search engines.  It's not just about advertising.  It's about stickiness.  And they want they want to keep Google in your life and they want to remain on the top that way.  And this is an extremely effective way of doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll probably know in about three hours.  Google's supposed to make an announcement at 11 o'clock Eastern on Monday.  Will they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think what they're going to be doing is going to be very shocking to anyone.  I think what we may find shocking or most shocking about it is that it may not be super Google branded.  You may not even necessarily know that you're going to be running a Google phone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gosh, I mean, I think that that's like, you know, that's kind of the beauty of what they're doing is that they don't want to get in between the handset makers and the manufacturers and the carriers.  Why is Google doing this though?  They just want to keep Google sticky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're they're not going to sell it.  They're going to give it away.  You know, Nokia could put it in their phone, not charge, you know, not pay anything to Google might not even branded Google.  What does Google get out of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that they're trying to ensure that the services stay sticky with Google.  So it will have a lot of Google stuff on it.  There may be a requirement that if you if you use the Google, you know, if you use Android, mobile, OS, whatever you want to call it, you know, you have to bundle with Google Calendar, Google Mail, all the regular Google app support.  It's going to have great integration.  You can customize the interface.  You can have it for free or cheap, cheaper than most other advanced operating phone operating systems out there.  We just want to make sure that we can keep these services on there.  I think that's probably the play they're going to be after here.  I think that it's really, really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you also think about the demographic data they could call from that.  I mean, oh, it's hugely valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if I think if you're walking down the street and the phone says, oh, there's a pizza hut next door, I'm going to go and take a left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, I mean, I don't think a lot of people really kind of get how powerful of a play this is.  I mean, when when Google is in your pocket, that is so much different than Google being on your desktop.  And it is effective and sticky and interesting in more ways than we can even really come up with right now.  Well, they may also be a good foot.  They're going to be there for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you alluded to this.  It's also a defensive ploy because people are moving away from PCs.  I just read an article about Japanese buyers who are spending more of their dollars on non PC devices.  If people move away from PCs, they move away from Google on the desktop.  But if it's in the phone, you still you're still a player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the simple fact is at the end of the day, you know, people's base core desire for some form of information, be it a map or what's in your calendar or whatever, you know, information is not something that stops at the desktop.  And Google's job is to make information accessible to its users and try to make money off of serving up that information.  Robert, so not doing a mobile phone.  I think it's out of the question.  Yeah, they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked with one of the executives at Google who runs the maps, APIs and stuff, and they said they're learning a lot from the iPhone and seeing about what to do or what not to do.  Well, they say the iPhone is actually how people use Google's usage of their services than any other device.  So they're learning from that.  And I watch how Patrick uses that.  He's using your 14 year old son.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your 14 year old son.  Yeah, you know, those who aren't on your Twitter list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He sits in the back seat of our car.  And if we want to go to dinner, he pulls up, you know, Half Moon Bay restaurant and starts looking around.  Where do you want to go, Dad?  I mean, I see your Mexican food tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how I survived so long without having Google Maps on a phone.  I mean, I just never had a phone that had that capability built in, even in the in the web sense.  And so I'm really I don't know how to go back from that.  I use it constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing. And that's probably the reason why the iPhone gets so much Google app.  I mean, Google Mail. Sorry.  Google Map usage is because it's the phone that has Google Maps built in.  But what a lot of people don't know is that Google Maps is available for every other mobile platform.  It's in Java. It's on Palm. It's on Windows Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on my Blackberry. It came on my 8700, you know, a year before Apple even mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's interesting because what you're kind of seeing is I think when people talk about, you know, desktops and mobile,  I think it's as long as you have that Internet web connectivity where you can pull that information that's from the cloud in the sky.  I mean, a phone is so much more compact and convenient.  I mean, that's why it's so popular in Japan, because, you know, if you're constantly mobile, you can even with a laptop, it's still kind of bulky.  If you can pull out a soap bar sized device and then be able to pull out essentially the same data, that would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing that we haven't talked yet is about the new world that's coming into the Internet.  You know, we're all used to the Internet. We've seen, we've used, I've used a computer for 20, 25 years, you know,  and most of us who are on this phone call have used computers and all sorts of devices.  But let's say you're a kid growing up in India. Have you been on a computer? Have you seen a computer?  You might not have. And cell phones are going to be what you experience the Internet on first.  You know, a billion people are joining the Internet this year on cell phones. And that's dramatic.  And I think that's one reason Google is investing in it so hard, because they know that the future growth of their company  is going to come from places that aren't here in the United States or in Japan or Europe,  and are going to experience the Internet for the first time on a cell phone device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really interesting point, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like as content providers we should be aware of that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, totally, because, you know, not everyone's going to have the same sort of, you know, screen size or even processing speed.  So, you know, how do you divvy up information? Do you make it a set font size? Do you make it, you know, do you,  I mean even something as simple as layout. Do you go with the traditional web layout where you got a bunch of, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. My blog, I have formatted a WAP version and an iPhone version,  and the iPhone people complain. They say, but we can see the full thing as a regular Safari page. Why do you do an iPhone page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was funny. I did the same thing. iPhone optimized my blog for iPhone users,  and then iPhone users started complaining because they're like, no, we want to see the actual real page.  This is how Apple intended it. They want you to see the real web. That's the whole point of having the internet in your pocket.  We don't want to see, you know, a pared down version of your website.  Yeah, but it's about bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I figured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the conception is that when you do a revised edition for a mobile device, you're basically abridging the data.  You're not getting the full set. So they feel that they're being cheated in the same way people would watch  like a widescreen letterboxed movie on a standard definition TV. They feel they're getting cheated out of the resolution.  You know, run out and buy an HDTV and you'll get a few more lines on the top and bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I found it really funny. I found it really funny when Apple came out with their web apps page and it was an iPhone optimized.  And I was thinking, why are they making the iPhone web apps page not iPhone optimized?  And I'm realized because their whole platform is to be like, hey, we have the real internet in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I understand why Google Mail went IMAP too. I mean, if you're building a phone platform, IMAP is a much better solution.  So happy.  Yes, even not just on the iPhone, but on a Go phone.  So if Apple is not on the list of partners tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock, is this Apple stock go down and Google stock go up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does anyone actually think that Apple is going to be on the list of Google?  I don't think so.  Hardware partners? I mean, Apple does its own thing. It's always done its own thing.  And Apple doesn't really pair with other companies for these kinds of things.  I mean, the only thing I can even really think of in recent history in terms of mobile pairing and integration was its, you know, greatly maligned pseudo partnership with Motorola on the original rocker.  And I mean, they basically they actually kind of screwed Motorola.  They abandoned it. They walked away from it.  Well, they walked away from it. But remember, they they've been working on this phone for I think it was a solid year and a half.  And I don't know if it was because Motorola didn't put in the effort that Apple wanted or Apple just saw this as a stopgap as it was getting its iPhone strategy together.  But remember, they were all set. They called all the press out in I think it was 2005 in San Francisco for the rocker announcement.  We all knew it was the rocker announcement.  And then it was a rocker announcement briefly. And then it was the iPod Nano show.  Right. Right. And yeah.  And then they put, you know, the one more thing was the Nano.  And right. Bye bye, Rocker.  You know, if you looked at the Apple page that day, the rocker was a small link in the corner and the Nano was a lot.  They didn't show the rocker ad. So.  Ed Zander later was quoted as saying that Apple completely screwed them.  They were never doing business with Apple again. And it was just an absolute debacle.  So, yeah, I don't think that Google is going to be working with Apple.  According to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple sometimes reminds me of a small child that gets sick of their toy very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most Apple users are like that, actually.  I think that's it's a perfect symbiosis with its audience.  And I'm one of them. So I can say that.  You're a sucker.  Short attention span.  Short attention span.  Juan Carlos Perez writing in Computer World says 30 industry heavy rates are on board for tomorrow's announcement,  including Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Nvidia, Sprint, T-Mobile, China Mobile, Telefonica, NTT, Docomo, LG and HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually kind of Nvidia.  Nvidia.  Isn't that interesting?  Nvidia is really big in the mobile graphics market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want to get their chips into phones.  Oh, no, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, I'm wondering if they're going to try to.  I mean, like they do with on the iPhone where you have a video player, you know, built in.  As part of an app, I mean, then have it hardware accelerated by Nvidia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to get Kevin Creewell, who works at Nvidia in the hardware division on this show.  He said, well, we don't have anything to talk about in hardware.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, when I talk to the AMD guys, AMD slash ATI guys, they know that consumer electronics is going to be their big growth area in the future.  I think either Kevin didn't know or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's playing it dumb.  Nokia, according to IDG, Nokia, Verizon and Apple not so far on the list.  Surprising not to see Nokia there, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, why? Not at all.  Why would Nokia want to work with it?  Symbian.  You know, the majority of the owners are Symbian and that's where they are.  And they run some variant of Symbian or, you know, their own custom code on every phone they make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Symbian, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  And, you know, they're doing some interesting things with it.  And when Symbian touchscreen comes out, you know, I think it's going to be very interesting to compete with what Apple's got going on the iPhone.  But, yeah, not at all surprising that Microsoft and Nokia are not on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because it's a very eerie parallel to the whole kind of MS-DOS versus, you know, an Apple, Apple, Amiga, Commodore, Atari, where they all had their own hardware platforms running their own specific operating system.  And then you had a bunch of clone manufacturers run, you know, basically Microsoft's version of the PC-DOS OS, thereby making it a lot more widespread, you know, kind of strength in numbers where they had they could leverage.  Oh, we got several hundred million users versus, you know, a couple of million for the Atari and a few million for the Commodore and maybe 10 or 20 million for Apple.  I mean, I think, you know, where you were what Microsoft tried to do or maybe is still trying to do with mobile or Windows Mobile, where you have, you know, a portal or you have you make develop the one OS that works on a multiple, multiple hardware vendors machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe we're facing the end of the PC era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could. I wouldn't actually cry over it either.  I'm kind of sick of the PC as it is.  Do you not need a computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you just do all this on portable devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think that mobile operating systems are going to eventually overtake the desktop operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to I don't want to try to edit a video on it.  But I mean, but I think you could do it on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though.  You can more and more you're seeing these kinds of applications on the net.  Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's still that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're talking about this is, you know, this is like pie in the sky, you know, 30, 40, 50 years down the road when we've all got 40 gigabit wireless connections to our, you know, our WiMAX cell phone carrier.  I mean, it's just not this is not even a conversation we can even really speak realistically about for the PC is still the hub.  Then it's not going anywhere.  Not for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's interesting because like, you know, what you listed as video editing, I mean, for a lot of people that that's not the prime reason why they have a PC.  You know, one of the biggest push, you know, one of the biggest growth areas where you saw people buying PCs is when they started seeing a bunch of URLs for the first time on an advertisement on a TV show.  Like, hey, look, what am I, you know, they see this URL that's on the screen.  They say, I'm missing something.  I need to access it.  The only way I can do it is with a PC.  But if you can start doing that without necessarily buying, you know, even maybe what we do is very specialized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those will be specialized PCs.  But what most people do is word processing, email, surf the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you could get a machine that's powerful enough to do your word processing, web surfing in a phone.  And if you need to full size keyboard, you can get a little adapter and plug in a USB keyboard and then plug into a monitor.  Do you still need a full size PC?  If you can do that just as well.  You know what I mean?  It's I think some of it is just because we've grown up with it.  So we can't see any other way to do it besides that.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just talking about my ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a fairly frequent kind of future.  You know, when is my phone going to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the PC will die.  But I think it will eventually become a niche product used by content developers who need the extra power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you might be right.  I think it might be sooner than you think.  The iPhone, is it the invention of the year?  Time Magazine says so.  Others say, but wait, it's not really an invention.  It's just a gadget.  In fact, I love the article that Lev Grossman writing in the Time Magazine pretty much apologizes from the beginning.  He says, stop.  I mean, don't stop reading this, but stop thinking what you're about to think.  OK, I'll think it for you.  The thing is hard to type on.  It's too slow.  It's too big.  It doesn't have instant messaging.  It's too expensive.  Or no, wait, it's too cheap.  It doesn't support my work email.  It's locked to AT&T.  Steve Jobs secretly hates puppies.  And all together now, we're sick of hearing about it.  Mainstream media knows.  I know, because every time I talk about it on the radio show, I get the email.  Nobody wants to hear a thing about the iPhone anymore.  Sick to death of it.  And yet, it is the invention of the year.  He does give five good reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, you know, the perceptions of us who are in the early wave of stuff.  But you go into an Apple store and there's lines of people still waiting for them.  They're still looking at it.  They're still looking at it.  It's like a cult.  But I do hear from everyone.  It's not a cult.  My ex-wife bought one and she hates tech.  I mean, that's why we're not married anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that if you look at his five reasons, or his reasons, the top  one is the iPhone is pretty.  I don't like that.  It's followed by, you know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's touchy feely is reason two.  Now, you know, and then he says it's not a phone, it's a platform.  Well, maybe not.  Steve Jobs doesn't think so.  Come in February.  Yeah, we'll see what happens in February.  And it's the ghost of iPhones yet to come, which I'll grant you.  It's just generation one.  But that's more of an apology, not a nomination.  He says the one thing he says that does really, I think, resonate is it will make other phones better.  It is, it does set the mark, set the bar.  And you've got to step up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I sit down at the Ritz down here and watch, you know, the tourists come through  and people pet their iPhones.  They, there's something about that.  It's creepy.  It's creepy, but they do pet it.  They like, and they, and they, and I noticed they use more stuff on it.  You know, that more people are using photos on the iPhone than use them on older phones.  I mean, I always had the best Nokia phones to give to Patrick.  He never picked them up.  He never liked them, you know, in the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The joke amongst my friends, the joke amongst my friends is that they used to never be able to get in contact with me  because I wouldn't bring my cell phone with me anywhere.  And I mean, I've always had pretty good cell phones, but now I actually carry this thing with me.  And if I don't have it, I panic.  So it definitely resonates with people on a different way, in a different way than other technology has in the past.  I think it's a lot more personal.  It's a lot more intimate, but I could be biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting because I think a lot of what the iPhone is doing is what they originally envisioned  for the Newton.  I mean, if you think of like...  Oh yeah, it's just a little Newton. Absolutely.  Yeah, the personal digital assistant.  I mean, you've got communications, you have web access, you can type however slowly and awkwardly into it.  Did you notice they got rid of the handwriting recognition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. They didn't try it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 10 years newer and it still doesn't do handwriting recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love watching all those old Newton commercials where they're sending stuff to each other and writing on it.  I get a kick out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually think that's one of the things that Steve Jobs did right.  He took features off this thing and made the feature set that is there work well.  I have a brand new Nokia N95, which does 16 things that the iPhone doesn't.  It does video, it has a GPS built into it, it does 3G.  The iPhone doesn't do video?  Are you talking about recording video?  Recording video, right.  And on and on, it has a 5 megapixel camera where the iPhone's a 2 megapixel camera.  It has a 2 megapixel camera on and on, but nothing on it thrills.  Nothing on it makes you feel like, man, this was just done right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does a really good job of integrating everything, so it feels very seamless.  It doesn't feel like it was a new feature and someone tried to screw it on at the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I can say is every time I do a podcast, I try not to mention the iPhone.  Somehow, everybody makes it.  I know. We're going to get yelled at again, just like last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't win.  Wait for the hate mail in 5, 4, 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was only two stories this year, iPhone and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I got another Facebook story also from Time magazine.  Coming up in just a bit, what are college kids looking at more than porn?  But first, I want to thank audible.com for their support of this podcast.  They're back. They're back. Audible.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  I know many of you listen to Audible books, so I have a book pick.  But if anybody wants to mention an Audible book that they're listening to these days.  You know, you guys on Veronica and Tom Merritt have started a new sci-fi book club online.  Sci-fi fantasy, yes.  Laser and Unicorn.  Sword and Laser.  Sword and fantasy.  Laser.  swordandlaser.com  Isn't that a lightsaber?  And your first book was the Philip Pullman book.  Yes.  Which I love. And by the way, I listen to an Audible. It's a wonderful Audible version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually know a few people on the site that bought the audiobook on Audible and listened to it that way.  And it's been going really well. We're reading The Golden Compass right now.  Just the first book and we're voting on the second one currently as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. Well, if you want to read The Golden Compass without reading The Golden Compass, that could be your free book.  All you got to do is go to audible.com slash twit.  You get a credit for a free book when you sign up.  And The Golden Compass is a pretty good one.  His Dark Materials Book 1.  And I think they have all of them.  I loved it. I really loved it.  It's one of the productions where it's not just a narrator.  It's a full cast.  Oh, cool.  So it's just a great way to read this book.  Highly recommended.  We'll make that our book pick of the week.  The Golden Compass.  And then once you read it, or actually before you finish it, go over to Sword and Laser and sign up.  Because that's, is it free?  You just go over there and.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a social network on Ning where everyone joins in on this discussion.  So all you have to do is sign up for Ning.  And we have forums there and lots of topics.  And then we have a main blog at swordandlaser.com where we do all the voting for future books.  It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you found a great template.  I love this WordPress template.  It's very pretty.  Oh, thank you. Thank you.  Dark Planet.  So that's perfect.  And now you're voting for the next book.  And so far, Ender's Game is reading another great read on Audible, by the way.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that one's in the lead right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would actually be a great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for discussion.  But I see also Philip K. Dick.  He's coming on strong and he's always good.  Anyway, anyway, we can talk about books all day, but I do want to remind you to visit audible.com slash twit and get your free book.  It is a great way to read.  It's my favorite way to read.  I just talked to a woman who rode across the Atlantic.  Talk about crazy solo.  Three months.  She listened to music.  She's going to do the Pacific this summer.  And I said, you got to listen to audiobooks.  She said, oh, I know I'm set.  I got a bunch of them.  That's the way to go.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  So now I got to find this porn story again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I got to run because of my my family friends are here.  But all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Robert, it's great to have you.  It's the Scoble show.  Ladies and gentlemen.  What's the best place to see that?  Scoble show.  Scoble show dot com.  Yeah.  And of course, you can join his fan club on Twitter.  Thank you very much.  You are Scoble Lizer on Twitter.  Scoble Lizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do my link blog on Twitter as well.  Scoble's link blog.  And I'm on Jaiku and I don't know how to say that, by the way.  Jaiku.  Jaiku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll be part of the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And on pounds and wherever Veronica is, I'm there because I'm there.  That's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and that other guy.  Scoble show dot com.  Robert, thank you so much.  I'm glad you could be on the show.  Go socialize.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And see you up in Petalimits.  He's doing it in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Say hi to Patrick for me.  Take care.  Oh, bye.  He is a real life socializer.  I prefer to stay alone in my little cave here.  That's a little twit cave all alone.  So among people 18 to 24 years old, the porn is only the fourth thing they do online.  Web-based email.  Yeah.  Well, they're probably getting it.  That's why.  Web-based email.  Search engines is number two.  You know what number one is?  Social networking.  Of course.  They'd rather be on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, correct me if I'm wrong.  This is what they say they're doing online right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Excellent point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Hitwise.  Actually, Hitwise is tracking it.  This isn't a survey, as I believe.  You know, I'm so not surprised.  It makes total sense.  clients and their clients.  Well, I'm not surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  I'm just surprised.  So it's really interesting how even people who aren't involved in the social networking  landscape understand that people in that age group, that is their main way of communicating  with each other and that's really the main way to get in contact with them.  If you're trying to talk to them, I mean, even email.  All of us, I think, depend 90% on email for communication.  I mean, above phone for me, above IM even for me, it's email.  And then I guess social networking is really coming up there as well.  But I don't think of it that way.  But people who are a little bit younger definitely do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we got a pretty young panel with you and Ryan and Roger.  I mean, I'm the old guy, but just out of curiosity, let's start with you, Veronica.  What social networks do you spend most time on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My number one is Facebook now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then, yeah, Twitter, Facebook, Pounce.  And then I'm on MySpace, but I don't really use it at all.  I kind of hate it.  And then that's pretty much it.  How do you deal with…  Of course, date, Flickr, all those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, go on and on and on.  How do you deal with…  The 10,000 others.  How do you deal with Pounce versus Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use them for different things.  I think we've had this discussion before.  I mean, Twitter I use as kind of a short burst way of making announcements and talking at  people.  Pounce I use more as a discussion kind of forum.  Me too.  I like that I want to bounce off people.  I prefer to use that as a forum style, kind of threaded comments view.  I like that aspect a lot better.  And if I have an audio file I want people to hear or a photo I want people to see.  And I really like the YouTube embedding feature in Pounce as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  How about you, Ryan?  Are you on a social network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on a few.  I don't really use them very often, to be totally honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just got on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not unaware of Facebook or anything by any means.  I think it's actually the media blitz on Facebook that kept me away from it for so long.  I actually only joined up because we did a Gadget Reader event in San Francisco.  One of the event pages was on Facebook and so I got an account just so I could see what  was going on there.  Yeah, I don't really use.  I mean, I don't know if you count on Xbox Live.  I don't know if you count on Xbox Live as a social network.  I kind of do because I have friends and contacts on it and I interact with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can link it to your MSN Live account as well.  Yeah, I don't though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't really use Messenger.  But yeah, I mean, that's probably the network I spend the most time on.  And what game are you playing these days?  I've been playing a lot of Halo 3 lately.  Yeah, that's fun.  I like it too.  But I'm a big fan of a lot of different titles.  We just got Beautiful Katamari, which is great because you can play it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know Veronica's rocking to Guitar Hero 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We haven't got ours yet.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been going other places to play.  I've been more out of the house than usual.  Oh dear.  Except going to other people's houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, she's going to other people's places to play.  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, I don't mean to sound like, oh, poor me and the mental process.  So not Red Octane is a...  Yeah, no, Red Octane is the company that does Rock Band.  I'm sorry, Guitar Hero 3.  Not Rock Band.  It gets really confusing because the company that used to do Guitar Hero Harmonix is now  at MTV and they're doing Rock Band.  Anyway, the people who do Guitar Hero were supposed to send out the review units last  week and they've been delaying it and delaying it and I keep saying, you know, I'll go buy  it.  That's fine.  Just let me know what's up.  So I know I don't have to send some Guitar Hero around here.  And they keep putting it off and delaying it to the last minute.  So that's why we don't have a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because those little plastic guitars are really useful for Halloween costumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to do that as a Halloween costume.  Actually, I was going to go as one of the girls from Guitar Hero, but I didn't get it  together in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would have been so good.  Two of the girls at my daughter's high school were Hart and they used their guitar here.  Oh, dear.  Hart?  Wow.  Where did they pull that out of?  Oh, I don't know.  You know, teenagers these days, they're big into this old stuff.  It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're big into the 80s.  The 80s has made its way back.  They have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was big when I was a teenager.  It keeps coming back around and around again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, vinyl go-go boots will always have a place in today's high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's 70s.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Hart boots were the black platform vinyl boots that go up the thighs.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I guess that's a mod thing.  That's 60s, right?  Not really a disco thing, which would be 70s.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger, do you use a social network in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, it's MySpace and Facebook are tied at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now are you using it as a public figure or do you actually use it with your friends and  stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I use Facebook with friends that I talk to and then I use MySpace because I like really  bizarre stuff.  So, when I was looking for roller derby teams to go watch, I actually found them on MySpace.  So anything that's kind of a little bit left of center, I tend to use MySpace for.  Have I said how much we miss you on Twitter?  What would have been done without that?  People talk a lot about how Facebook, LinkedIn, Pounce and stuff let you connect with your  friends but sometimes I want to see other stuff that I'm not necessarily a part of.  My roller derby, yeah.  My roller derby is awesome.  I went to a couple of games and it's cool.  There's things like Comic Book Clubs versus the obvious, Battlestar Galactica Clubs, really  kind of nerdy, dorky stuff that you haven't made it into Facebook or Pounce because those  are still, these are my friends, this is just all about my friends and not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I don't know.  I don't agree.  I think Facebook is really a huge haven for bizarre groups and clubs.  They've got everything on there.  I get invited to the weirdest stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having been through Facebook looking for really bizarre and weird stuff, you're right.  There's stuff there but it is...  You need weirder friends on Facebook.  That's what you need.  Maybe, but I'm just saying in terms, I think it's a lot more diverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MySpace attracts the dog crowd, the bounty hunter types.  That's who you get.  What do you mean?  You get people with weird sunglasses and strange things in their hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to hear something really interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's creepy.  No, I didn't say creepy.  Yeah, apparently that's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't say creepy.  This is kind of weird and creepy but also helpful.  The other night we went out and we left a camera at a restaurant and the manager actually  receipt to find my name on MySpace and sent me a message telling me that we had left our  camera at the restaurant.  Wow.  Isn't that interesting?  I was like, oh, that's kind of weird but thanks.  It's kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's really weird is that he looked at you and thought, MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it was worth a shot.  We are in San Francisco.  Who isn't on MySpace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  Wow.  I use Facebook.  I use a Jaiku and a Pounce.  I like Facebook a lot actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I've given up on Jaiku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah everybody gives up on Jaiku.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel bad but I think I'm kind of happy.  It's because they're Finnish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  It's because Google bought them.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's Yuri, right?  He's the guy who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yuri and Petri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I met Yuri before and he was great.  He's wonderful.  I really thought the service was great but I don't know.  It's just not doing it for me.  You're not alone.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What can you do?  I try to talk people into Jaiku and everybody comes and then they leave.  So it's just me.  It's just you.  You're just not enough of a draw anymore.  I'm the only one on Jaiku.  Sorry, Ryo.  That's just me.  I'm the only one there.  I don't mind.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Other stories.  Spammers are using strip tease to crack captures.  I thought that was interesting.  A virtual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's absolutely brilliant.  I mean there's really no way to get...  Well, no way that I've heard of to have a bot self-captures like that.  I mean, it's really picture captures too.  I mean, if they're giving people what they want, which is apparently lady stripping,  they can get a whole...  It's like monkeys on typewriters just all day just solving captures and giving them  the information they need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are those weird hard to read text things that you put on blogs to prevent spam.  So what they do is when a spammer wants to create an account on a Yugal or Gahu, they  will go there, start the signup process, get the capture and then interface it to this  page, Melissa, and they put it on there.  And then some geek sitting there says, oh, she'll take off her shirt if I type this.  And he types it.  They sign up for the account and Melissa, I guess, I haven't tried it, takes off her  shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clever, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I heard it's like, it's not even a real image.  It's like an animated image that's being stripped.  So it's not even like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dude, it's on the internet.  It's not real anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying people get turned on by it as drawing versus like a photo.  A drawing versus a photo, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One's 2D, one's 2D.  All right.  Actually, the drawing could be 3D.  All right.  YouTube and Digg unblocked in China this week.  Not sure why.  I'll tell you, if I wanted to suppress a population, I would make sure they couldn't see YouTube.  I'd make sure they could see Digg though.  That'd make you hate Western civilization real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it censored versions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was the rationale behind blocking Digg?  I don't know.  It's just because Digg represents like a web democracy in news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe there were a lot of posts about Chinese incidents and they just automatically...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess I don't...  Well, maybe I don't...  They also blocked collegehumor.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I understand.  I wish I could block collegehumor.com.  They still block Google News and Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe they're on the right path now.  Maybe it's just a matter of time.  They're probably working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're just doing it because the upcoming Olympics and they need to put on  a better face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's allow YouTube.  We'll allow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want those YouTube clips of the Olympics to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AOL and CBS have decided to dump their high-def online programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm going to excuse myself from this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  You work for AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm happy to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a very indirect way.  I love hanging out with AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's one of my hobbies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you actually deal with AOL in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what do you mean?  I am an AOL employee.  My paycheck comes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  It says AOL on the paycheck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It says AOL on the paycheck.  My boss is an AOL programming VP.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can recuse yourself.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm fine.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do this thing.  Let's do it, man.  Well, I actually think you can justify it.  IQ was the service, right?  I never saw it.  Video.aol.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I used it a little bit.  It worked out all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did it work at a regular...  Did it suck bandwidth?  It's high-def.  How does it do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when I used it at my parents' place, my dad has a P3 or a P4 list.  It worked.  But you have to wait for it.  Right.  Windows Media Player.  I would walk away for a while and then come back to start playing.  It wasn't like...  I don't believe any on-demand online service actually works like on-demand.  There's always going to be some waiting.  Cue it up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But apparently people are watching.  Yeah, I don't know.  I got a beta invite on Hulu, and it works really well, and there's no waiting.  You like Hulu?  Yeah, but it looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Hulu Flash?  How is Hulu doing it?  Hulu's Flash, yeah.  It's the NBC's new platform for showing The Office after you've downloaded it.  Yeah, NBC Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks really good.  It's much higher resolution than almost any other web video service when you do a full  screen, even when you're sitting really close to it.  I wrote about this on my personal blog because it's not really gadget kind of material.  But yeah, it looks really good.  Surprisingly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My problem is I don't want to sit in front of the computer to watch The Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I completely agree.  That's one of the things I wrote about is that there's still this fundamental disconnect  that people have where your computer is for, I hate because I feel like it's such a cliché,  lean forward activity.  It's engaging, it's interactive, and then you're leaning back, you're relaxing.  Your TV experience you want to have on the couch with your TV.  I think if they do this as a plugin in Windows Media Center or get a content deal going with  Apple, with Apple TV, devices like that are perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole point for this was to get away from Apple and to get away from iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they developed a client that worked on the PS3 or Xbox 360, they would have something.  It's got to be on the TV.  You've got to get it on the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could do that if you had an Apple TV.  I don't think anybody bought Apple TV.  I love my Apple TV, but I just don't think anybody bought one.  But if you were buying these things, buying The Office as I was on iTunes and playing  on an Apple TV, it was perfect.  It was exactly what I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And now you can get that same experience.  On your computer.  The video quality is roughly, I mean, it's not quite as high as what you would download  from iTunes, but it's almost there.  I mean, I think iTunes is VGA, like 640 by 480.  The Hulu experience, I think, is like 560 or something like that.  So it's pal.  It looks really good.  It's not bad at all.  Oh, no, I'm not saying it's not.  I'm just saying it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny because on iTunes, it's not super high quality either.  And I put up with it even on a big screen TV.  On program material like that, not movies, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't really care.  So here's the hidden content deal that I think Hulu should make that hasn't really been discussed  yet is Hulu should get in tight with Sling, who have a forthcoming device that we've been  waiting to get our hands on for a really long time called the Sling Catcher.  And the Sling Catcher is basically the Apple TV, except it's a little bit more extensible.  Supposedly, it's three months ago.  Formats.  And it's basically a lot better for moving video from the outside world and from your  PC onto your TV instead of just moving video from iTunes onto your TV.  And I think the Sling Catcher is actually a perfect venue for Hulu to get going with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was supposed to be out in the spring, though.  What happened to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was supposed to be out in the summer.  They delayed it to the fall.  And I guess now they're probably delaying it to the winter.  They announced it to CES, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I remember.  Two hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was pretty sweet.  It's still pretty sweet if it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy to write something down that looks sweet.  It's harder to make it, I guess.  That would be the...  I mean, Apple TV works for me, but I would love something that were more general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, the problem with Apple TV is there's no plug-in architecture there.  I mean, there is a keyword packet, but nobody has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have to convert everything to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the other thing is, if there was a set top box that would allow you to play  multiple formats natively with all of this conversion transcoding process, I think that  would help a lot.  I mean, think about all the different sites and sources you get your video form from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and that's what the goal of the SlingCatcher was.  Or I guess I should say is.  I mean, it's not out yet.  But that's the intention there, is that they want to support as much as possible to do  that.  And there are some devices out there, like the Netgear, Entertainer, and a few of them  out there that do support a lot of different formats.  But I don't think any of them are really good enough to, you know, let's slap a lightweight  browser on there with Flash and do, you know, web video stuff.  I think that's kind of where this SlingCatcher is supposedly going to be going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many of us mocked Hulu when NBC announced it and mocked NBC for moving off of iTunes.  But you're not alone, Ryan.  A number of people are saying, hey, this isn't that bad.  Old Malik gave it a rave review a couple of days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see nothing bad about it.  I mean, there are some definite problems if you're used to downloading your video, for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've never been more wrong.  I mean, that's pretty strong.  That's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  the expectation that when they're going to roll out a new product like this, it's going  to be so ham handed.  And I mean, you know, they've had such a hard time getting getting, you know, fitting in  the digital era in general.  I think this one kind of proves that these guys can look at it from a different perspective.  And I really like it.  I do hope that they do things that they're never going to do like add DRM free downloads.  But for the time being, in terms of watching premium content on the web, I mean, it's an  amazing solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter will watch TV shows on the web.  She will watch it and on the network's websites.  She was watching Pushing Daisies the other day and I thought, what?  But she says she's fine.  She's comfortable doing that.  So it may be a generational thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't mind watching stuff in front of the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  It depends on what it is.  If it's like a two hour epic, I'm definitely going to watch it.  But if it's if it's something 30 minutes or less, I'll watch it in front of the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When does Hulu go public?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me?  I don't know.  So don't bother asking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I got no invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been getting a lot of people be like, oh my God, you're in Hulu.  Can I invite you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you can go to Hulu.com and sign up and they've got a little form.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll invite you.  You little person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know why they invited me.  I didn't actually sign up.  I don't know why they invited you for just what you just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  That's exactly why they invited you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have invited me.  I like to talk about stuff like that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know I hate it.  Curses.  They're not going to invite me.  A couple more stories.  We'll wrap things up.  Apple security may be a little bit less secure these days.  Intigo reporting a new OS X Trojan horse.  You have to agree to download it.  You have to agree to install it.  You have to give them your password.  But once you do, they can steal your passwords.  Hey, it's a Trojan horse.  Do you think Mac users are as gullible as Windows users or more so, maybe?  Both.  Less and more.  Well the key is, of course, don't open.  Don't accept it.  Don't open it.  Don't give it your password.  Also some complaints about the new firewall system in Leopard.  It does sound like it is not as secure as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not a fan of it.  That's the best of us.  Not even necessarily from the security standpoints.  I just think that it took a really Vista-like approach.  And not that that's a bad thing.  There are a lot of things that Vista does really well.  But the Vista firewall is not one of those things I think that is really necessarily  beneficial.  Is it because you can...  Per application, firewall settings is in many cases a bad idea.  Well, by the way, it lets stuff through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I don't mind.  You know what I said is block everything except what I say.  But apparently even with that setting, it lets stuff through.  So it's, by the way, whether you like its interface or not, it's not working.  So that's a larger issue.  The security firm that discovered this issue said Apple is basically the complacent Microsoft  of four years ago.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Might be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you sleepy?  Me?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard Roger yawning earlier.  Roger's been yawning like crazy.  You got up late working on DL.TV.  What's going on here?  I did not yawn once.  You yawned like three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger, we've been taping this.  I've got bad news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's replay that tape.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  So Roger Chang, DLTV's going strong.  DL.TV, you and Robert doing a great job with it.  Thank you.  Anything coming up you'd like to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will have a holiday guide coming up.  And then we actually, last week we just had a review for Hellgate London, which, you know,  if you're into those, I don't know, it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you played Crisis yet?  Anybody played Crisis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I played the demo.  It's pretty sweet, but it feels like Far Cry.  And the cool thing is there's a hack, supposedly, that allows you to get around the whole DX10.  You can enable features that are supposedly DX10 only in a DX9 XP box.  It's like a script or something that you gotta plug in.  But if you got enough CPU and video horsepower, it'll supposedly make things look ten times  better.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan, you played it yet?  You're a gamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not so much that kind of a gamer.  I'm more of a console gamer.  I like to kill things.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
