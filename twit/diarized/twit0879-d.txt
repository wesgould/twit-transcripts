Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, on Tuesday, I'm going, I wish Rene were here  because I want to know about the M2 versus the A15 and all of this stuff.  But anyway, we'll get to that.  I've got you. Yeah, I figured you would.  Also with us, haven't seen him in a while.  So good to have him back.  Patrick Béja, Not Patrick from NotPatrick.com  and a bunch of podcasts and all of that.  It's great to see you.

Start time: 217.04
End time: 232.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. Yes, it's been a while.  I made the terrible mistake of having a second child.  I don't know what possessed me.  And so I don't sleep or do anything.  She's over a year old now.  And congratulations. We're not recovering.

Start time: 232.40
End time: 237.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we gave you a little break because I knew you were on daddy duty.  But you still do le Rendez-vous Tech.

Start time: 239.06
End time: 241.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And the Phileas Club.  And le Rendez-vous Jeux.

Start time: 242.76
End time: 244.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And some new stuff. Super laser punch.

Start time: 246.26
End time: 261.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, super laser punch.  We talk about Marvel and Star Wars and stuff.  It's all in French.  I had to stop my my English language shows, though, because, again,  the times think that children are.  But the French stuff is still going strong.  Screw those English.

Start time: 263.12
End time: 266.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's actually good French.  Super laser punch.

Start time: 267.56
End time: 277.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly how we say it.  We also I do it in French, in English and in Japanese.  Every time I open the show, I don't know why, but it's fun.

Start time: 277.56
End time: 289.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had a story a couple of weeks ago about how the French don't want to call them  streamers because that would leave  francophones out in the cold.  So they have some absurd loges.

Start time: 290.16
End time: 292.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bad for computers.

Start time: 292.10
End time: 321.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's a French thing.  We have the French Language Academy that decides how many words are kind of.  Yeah. But, you know, it's not as drastic as people say.  It's, you know, some official services have to use the official words,  but most people still use the other ones.  And I don't know.  Overall, I'm not too miffed by it because the language changes so rapidly that,  well, it could be a long debate.  So, no, I like it.

Start time: 322.34
End time: 329.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, that was always kind of one of the cool things about  the language is that there was an official French ministry.

Start time: 329.34
End time: 335.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes bilingual school so hard.  So you can't connect the words.

Start time: 335.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A streamer is a joueur en direct.

Start time: 341.04
End time: 351.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joueur en direct, which which means live gamer, which is an issue because streamers  nowadays do a lot of things and not just gaming.  So that's not the best one.

Start time: 352.34
End time: 357.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also for cloud gaming, it's jeu vidéo en noige.  Oh, my God, that's hysterical.

Start time: 358.44
End time: 374.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the soft version, because in Quebec, they're so close to American  culture and language that they want to translate everything.  And we think that's too much.  Well, they translate like pasta for a movie titles and stuff.

Start time: 374.42
End time: 391.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not unreasonable because you want to make it accessible for Francophones.  South Africa did it and that turned out great, right?  The word for clickbait in France is piège à cliques and for podcasts.  And this one I'll go with. I don't like podcasts.  Audio la demand.

Start time: 393.43
End time: 432.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eh, it's audio on demand.  I guess it works.  You know, it's weird because when you've used the word for so long, you're used to  it, of course, even if it's the English word.  And then you try to switch the French one.  It's very difficult.  But when you get the French one from the start, like, for example, René was  referencing ordinateur, which is computer.  Right. It's literally the translation as as best as you can make it.  And we're used to it.  So we don't really question it. It's fine.  But nowadays, the English words travel so fast and get into the language so fast  that even if they introduce French equivalents, you know, a few years down  line, it's very difficult to change.

End time: 453.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of francophones, we've got another one in here.  This whole show should be in French.  Philip Elmer DeWitt is here from PED 3.0.  Good to see you.  Good to see you. It's been a while.  Philip gave us a disclaimer.  He has been spending the last few weeks bicycling down the Danube.  I'm so jealous. I'm so jealous.

Start time: 453.42
End time: 456.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was frozen.  That's how we were able to bicycle down.

Start time: 456.22
End time: 478.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it wasn't frozen.  Actually, I was I did a riverboat trip.  Same same kind of thing from down the Rhine and then the mine and the Danube.  But it was also like a record setting heat wave.  So it was it was far from frozen.  It was very uncomfortable.  I lived on April spritzes for about three weeks.

Start time: 479.50
End time: 492.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had a riverboat, too. It wasn't all bicycle.  Oh, nice. I'm sorry.  I'd never done I'd never done that before.  It was it was what do they say in the Viking cruises?  It was seeing the world in comfort.

Start time: 492.34
End time: 512.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I like that because a riverboat, unlike a cruise ship,  you're always near land, for one thing.  And then when you land in town, you're not at some distant docks.  You're usually kind of in town and the boat moves so slowly.  You can easily get off, get on some bikes and beat it to the next port.  So it's perfect.

Start time: 513.38
End time: 523.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved I loved watching them go through the locks.  I was that when I asked the guy, Oh, can I take control?  He said, no, absolutely not.  Get out of here.

Start time: 524.14
End time: 545.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your knucklehead.  Yeah, I had some great  I would glue my camera to the side of the rail  and get some slow motion or no, I guess, hyperlapse of the of the docks  and the locks and stuff.  Those docks, those locks are kind of mind boggling.  Really fun.

Start time: 545.34
End time: 552.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If you if you went from the Rome to the Danube,  then we went down the Rhine Mine Canal, which is OK.

Start time: 552.96
End time: 574.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very long.  It was from the Rhine, not the Rhine, though, a very long canal  that they built and then nobody goes on it.  So just have riverboats.  You wave all the riverboats going down.  It's amazing. It's an amazing thing.  I quite enjoy. Well, I'm glad to have you back.  Were you back in time for WWDC?

Start time: 575.46
End time: 594.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was over the Atlantic for WWDC with bad  with the non-existent Wi-Fi.  Is that frustrating?  Yeah, no, I was able just OK.  I watched it on the read.  I'll catch it on the rebound, which I did.  And that's it's actually without having to live blog it.  You actually get to pay attention.  Yeah. Learn a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 595.84
End time: 623.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, there's so much to talk about.  I don't want to go through it  by the numbers one by one.  When we were talking on Mac break weekly the week before, Renee,  the consensus seemed to be don't hold your breath for hardware.  I got the feeling Apple had floated some, you know, rumors that don't stay.  You know, don't don't be disappointed.  But in fact, they did announce an M2 chip.  They did announce a new MacBook Air based on it as well as a Mac Pro.

Start time: 624.26
End time: 628.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No Mac Pro sneak preview.  The one thing I thought was a sure bet.  Oh, yeah. That's right.

Start time: 629.50
End time: 636.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you think the Mac Pro will be an M2 ultra?  Is that or is there going to be an M3 in time for that?

Start time: 636.58
End time: 652.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's possible. I don't think there'll be an M3 in time.  It looks like they're on like an 18 month cadence with these,  but it's possible that they might have more of those super connectors.  And then maybe you can go beyond ultra and have like an extreme  where you have like that was the rumor was four dies.  Oh, OK. So to be twice an ultra.

Start time: 653.58
End time: 671.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you look at the feature quilt, Andy Anakos term,  for the M2, it is kind of as we expected.  Not a huge leap from the M1.  I mean, you're not going to get the doubling in performance  that you got from Intel to Apple Silicon.

Start time: 672.76
End time: 726.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's safe to say, like nailed it.  Like the stuff that we were talking about for the M2 is exactly what Apple released.  But I wouldn't. So people are harping on it being iterative.  And I understand that because from a performance point of view,  the Delta, like the Delta for the efficiency cores is big.  It's like 30 percent faster on the efficiency cores,  which means that you can use those more often and not have to engage  the performance cores.  And that saves you a lot of power.  But even the performance cores, because they doubled the cash,  those will get you between three point five and 30 percent improvement as well.  But the big deal for me is that it's doing all of this at greater efficiency  than M1 did. So it is more powerful, like not hugely, but significantly more powerful,  but more energy efficient at the same time.  And when you put that inside something as thin as this new MacBook Air  and you add the ProRes rendering engines, it has half the rendering engines  of an M1 MacBook Pro's chip.  You can do a lot of stuff in a very little package.

Start time: 726.86
End time: 742.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's 25 percent more transistors, 20 billion,  which means it's just a little bit bigger.  It also has 24 gigs of RAM Max, which is a big, I think, a big improvement.  But no new Thunderbolt channels, still two Thunderbolt channels,  which kind of surprised me.

Start time: 742.54
End time: 777.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So the way they explain that is like they're not like Intel,  where Intel never knows where their chip is going to end up.  It could be in an incredible range of computers.  So they have to put as many features as possible in any chip.  Apple can design specifically for the for the computer they want to make.  And for them, the MacBook Air is an incredibly mainstream computer  and a very, very tiny amount of people use anything like that for a MacBook Air.  Almost any like very few people attach one monitor.  Incredibly few people attach two monitors.  So they spec'd it out in terms of like energy efficiency  and the cost of the materials and all of those things to support  what like 90 percent of their MacBook Air customers do.

Start time: 778.54
End time: 787.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That sounds to me like a retroactive justification.  Like, yeah, we can't figure out how to get this working with multiple monitors.  So nobody wants that.

Start time: 788.70
End time: 799.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can't. I mean, like so Thunderbolt 4,  like the only thing you require for Thunderbolt 4 is multiple monitors.  So like that's why they don't qualify Thunderbolt 3 only because they don't  support multiple monitors. And that's a requirement for the certification.

Start time: 799.64
End time: 811.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, OK. It's like I meant to do that.  It feels that way to me. Philip, am I wrong?  It feels like Apple's saying, well, this is what we could do.  So let me justify what we could do.

Start time: 813.18
End time: 820.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still irritated that I bought two new computers  because they had M1s in them and then they've come out with an M2.

Start time: 820.56
End time: 829.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to reassure you.  I'm going to reassure you.  And maybe, Rene, you'll back me up on this.  So this is based on the A15, right? Or no, the A14?

Start time: 829.70
End time: 832.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, it's A15 generation silicon IP.

Start time: 832.38
End time: 870.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's a second generation 5 nanometer process, which is...  And 5P. Yeah.  Yeah, it's still 5 nanometers.  But yes, there is going to be, maybe it's a year off,  an M3 that will be 3 nanometers.  We hope. TSMT is struggling a little bit, but we hope.  Yeah.  I've seen a number of analysts say,  if you've got an M1, like Philip and I do, be happy.  Don't worry.  And wait a year, because the M3 is going to be a bigger jump  from the M2 than the M2 was from the M1.  Does that make sense?

Start time: 871.46
End time: 880.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you want to do Final Cut Pro,  or if you want to do video editing on a really small laptop,  the media engines are going to make a huge difference to you.  If you don't, then you're fine.  It can do 8K now, right?

Start time: 880.58
End time: 882.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it couldn't do... It didn't have 8K rendering before...

Start time: 883.82
End time: 889.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can do exactly what the afterburner card  in the 2019 Mac Pro could do, which still is wild to me.

Start time: 890.34
End time: 898.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the other thing. It is an A15.  So is it an A15?  I mean, is it the same chip that's in my iPhone 13?

Start time: 898.68
End time: 916.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same generation, but it has a bunch of extras.  Like, it's the same generation of each of the cores,  but there are more cores,  and the cores are optimized for Mac things.  They do compression and virtualization, acceleration,  the Thunderbolt drivers.  So it's specified for the Mac, but it's the same building blocks.

Start time: 916.42
End time: 929.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.  And there are some features that some people may really want,  like, and I was impressed by this,  100 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth.  Yeah.  That's kind of mine.

Start time: 929.64
End time: 940.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because of LPDDR5.  So moving to LPDDR5, which all the M1 Pro, Macs and Ultras  already had, but the original M1 didn't.  That gives them the extra memory bandwidth,  which feeds those two extra GPUs.

Start time: 940.36
End time: 942.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's a big deal.

Start time: 943.04
End time: 960.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm serious, though.  Just because the engineers can do it doesn't mean it's right to do.  I didn't hear anybody screaming to say,  oh, wait, my M1 chip is too slow.  Please, please, Apple, give us another generation.  Ever? Like, ever?

Start time: 961.32
End time: 962.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at some point they're going to, right?

Start time: 963.26
End time: 964.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Within a year, it's just...

Start time: 965.98
End time: 971.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the thing is, they have 20 months.  Yeah, they're on an 18-month cadence now, we think, something like that.

Start time: 971.80
End time: 976.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if they go longer than that, Intel's going to have a hell of a marketing  campaign against them because their whole thing was Intel's too slow.

Start time: 977.26
End time: 1018.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it also is very interesting, Philip, that the M1 was such a big hit  that Intel, Qualcomm, even Microsoft are trying to respond, right?  They're trying to, you know, Microsoft, at their Build Conference a week  before WWDC announced an ARM-based developer platform  because they realized that people are going to want this kind of ARM  performance curve over power.  So I think that Apple's moved the market for sure.  You don't have to worry about an M2.  I don't have to worry about an M2.  I don't think there's an...  As you said, René, there's only a few people.  Patrick, are you using Apple Silicon in your...

Start time: 1019.66
End time: 1080.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my main computer is a PC.  I have...  Oh, how do you live?  Well, thankfully, I have Apple devices.  I have an iPhone, I have an iPad, and I also have a MacBook.  But it's a very old Intel, you know, the bad generation of MacBook Pros,  16-inch with the crappy keyboard.  And I was really looking to get a MacBook Air,  so I was waiting for the announcement.  And it's so expensive.  I don't think I can justify it.  It's 100 bucks more than last year's M1, right?  Yeah, in France, if you add the taxes and everything,  it's like two or 300 bucks.  And if you want it a little bit decked out,  it's going to be even more expensive.  And so I think I'm wondering, I have to wonder,  they know they're going to have issues with the supply chain.  I'm wondering if they didn't bump up the price because of that.

Start time: 1081.76
End time: 1098.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't want to sell as many because they can't make as many.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm wondering.  Supply chain throws a monkey wrench into everything.  I mean, we don't...  That may be why they didn't mention the Mac Pro.  I mean, we know there's all sorts of issues,  not so much with the M1, but with everything surrounding it.

Start time: 1099.32
End time: 1114.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The legacy little Texas instrument chip  that they have to throw in there for the Wi-Fi module.  But every MacBook Air has come out at like 11, 12...  Well, the original was 1700,  but all the recent ones come out at 1200,  and then they've gone down to 99 after a couple of years.  But the M1 starts at 999.

Start time: 1116.42
End time: 1118.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the M2 starts at 1099, right?

Start time: 1119.84
End time: 1123.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the MacBook Pro, they're keeping around too with the good old touch bar.

Start time: 1123.92
End time: 1140.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that surprised me.  So this MacBook Air is redesigned, it's squared, it doesn't have a wedge shape.  I mean, it's redesigned, it's not such a huge shift, still has the notch.  But then they announced a 13-inch MacBook Pro with no notch,  but big bezels, so they don't need a notch, and a touch bar.

Start time: 1140.08
End time: 1162.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't have...  Like the design team is small,  like Johnny's... Not Johnny's anymore,  Evan's design team is small,  so they only have the capacity to do like five devices a year,  and a few of those are going to be iPhones,  and then so they have to alternate them.  And they just didn't want to leave it on the market with an M1  because they figured people are paying money for it,  they might as well give them the latest chip.  So they couldn't do the whole redesign,  but they still wanted people to get whatever the latest was when they bought it.

Start time: 1162.92
End time: 1166.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's effectively last year's MacBook Pro 13 with an updated chip.

Start time: 1167.10
End time: 1176.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you need an M2 that can persist more than 20 minutes for whatever reason,  I think you're way better off getting the MacBook Air,  but if you need something that persists for more than 20 minutes,  that has a fan.  That's an important point.

Start time: 1176.54
End time: 1203.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The difference is the fan.  A little bigger battery must be because of better battery life, yeah?  Not huge, but you know, 20% better battery life.  So...  And again, really important to mention,  that's only for sustained throughput that that matters.  Yes, if you have bursty workloads, it doesn't matter at all.  The clock speeds are the same.  So, you know, most of what we do, it's not going to be 20 minutes of churning.  It doesn't matter. You don't need a fan.

Start time: 1203.44
End time: 1218.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's pretty impressive too, because Intel, historically,  when you increase the cores, they have to decrease clock speed  because the heat gets too high.  And Apple's been able to add cores, like, all the way up to the Ultra,  with like 20-core CPUs and 64-core GPUs,  without at all throttling down single-core performance.  Yeah.

Transcript:  No, I have a...  The Dell that I got has 12th generation Intel, the new...  ...Skaldor, like some call it.  And I got the i5, because I have seen some information  that the i7 and the i9 are so hot,  they're actually throttled down to maybe even slower than the i5.  There's no reason to get anything more than an i5 in these Intel mobile chips.

Transcript:  Unless you have like super burst...  They changed the definition of turbo too.  Now turbo is opportunistic, nanosecond burst in between.  So they can get your quick workloads for you.  But the whole thing is just like it's a small blast furnace.  You can't put in a...  The thing that's hilarious to me, Leo, is like,  if you take the latest from Intel and the latest from Nvidia,  it's more than a single plug in a normal person's house can support.  I was watching Linus have to plug them into two different circuits.  Yeah. It's more than 20 amps.

Start time: 1266.30
End time: 1273.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  More than 20 amps. That's crazy.  That's another cost, although I know, Patrick, in Finland,  you probably could use the heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, energy is getting quite expensive here as well.  So I don't know if we'd win in that equation.  But that's part of the reason why the M2 is interesting.  You know, it's not such a huge jump from the M1, as you discussed.  Of course, you know, the M1 was such an industry game changer.  Nothing's going to be that big of a jump.  Yeah, exactly. You can't expect that to happen every time.  But of course, the efficiency is really important for mobile devices.  And that's where they're putting them in the beginning, at least.  And that's where Intel is falling short.  And they can brute force, you know, the raw power of their chips.  And they're still maybe on the edge of still being able to do that.  But of course, it's not going to help on mobile devices.  So the advance that Apple is getting with the M2 is significant in that regard.  I don't know how that Intel is able with x86 to do much about that.  They're going to have to... They're working on ARM,  but it's, what, a couple of years away, I'm sure.

Transcript:  I did notice, I don't know if you did, Renee or Philip,  that Apple, which has these notorious graphs  that are just kind of meaningless floating lines and spaces.  Bezos graphs.  Yeah. Last year, they had the CPU performance versus power,  in which they essentially showed, you know, well, look at this.  You see this 10-core PC laptop chip isn't as fast as the M2,  except that's when you talk about power consumption.  This year, they finally, they added, oh, yeah, well, OK.  If you're willing to use 55 watts, yeah, it'll be faster.  I think that's actually a fairly important distinction to make.  Apple in the past has not acknowledged that,  so maybe they were a little stung by the critiques last year.  But again, who wants to run 55 watts in a laptop, right?  For sure.  Yeah.

But they did show some interesting gaming options  that look pretty good, AAA games.  Why would Apple care about that?

Start time: 1542.02
End time: 1592.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they have a huge part of the gaming market in mobile.  Yeah, they own casual gaming.  Yeah, yes and no.  There are some things that are starting to arrive  to middling reception.  But I think they're thinking gaming is big  and it's the most important category on the App Store  and it's the thing that generates the more money.  We should get into that on the computer side as well.  But I really think that there are very few people at Apple  that understand gaming because you can...  Maybe it's going to happen within two, three years,  the developers are going to come back,  but it really feels like they do it kind of  because they have to.  Reluctantly.  But it never feels like their heart is into it.  You know, they have this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a different thing.  It's evil, too, the other one.  Oh my gosh.  I'm sure they have...  I'm sure if the...  Whatever they're using, in that case,  it's Capcom using the RE Engine.  If they have...  They have to port the engine.

Start time: 1640.08
End time: 1652.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have to port the engine to metal.  So that's...  I'm guessing that's what they did.  That's the message for...  Remember, this is a developers' conference.  So there's a little...  It's not really for gamers they're aiming at.  They're aiming at developers saying,  see, you can do this with metal, I think.

Start time: 1652.72
End time: 1700.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think their overall message was that...  Just to clarify, Apple has a bunch of hardcore gamers,  all the way up to the executives.  They just thought all the money was in casual  and it wasn't worth the effort to pursue  a big hardcore gaming thing.  But they're turning around on that,  and they're hoping that,  because people are really comfortable with APUs now  on Xbox and PlayStation,  that the idea of an SoC is going to be appealing to them,  especially because now everything runs on the same cores.  So from iPhone to iPad to Mac,  if they get their engines ported over,  like if they get Unreal and they get...  Well, maybe not Unreal, but if they get Unity and RE  and all those things ported over,  it's much easier to get those studios online,  especially if Apple is willing to...  They took a huge hit when they went with metal  instead of with Vulkan or something  that would be much easier for them,  but they wanted to control the entire pipeline,  and it cost them several years,  but now they're trying to entice people back  with these sorts of things.

Start time: 1700.72

Transcript:  I have a question.  I'm wondering if the new interest in gaming in Apple  has anything to do with their plan to come out with goggles,  and I'm not sure what the goggles are.  Oh, yes.

Start time: 1713.40
End time: 1725.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, pretty much so.  And so we thought they would at least mention Reality OS  or something in the keynote, no mention at all of AR.  They did the room scanner.  Yeah, the room scanner, yeah.

Start time: 1727.98
End time: 1822.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, a friend of mine had a really clever insight.  I have to credit him.  It's Kassim Ketfi, who's a great journalist here in France,  or there in France.  His assessment was that Reality OS was all over the keynote  with bits and pieces that are going to be reused.  A couple of examples are on-device dictation,  which is going to be really important when you need to interact with a...  Yeah, iOS 16.  And so that is going to be really important  when you interact with something, a device that you don't have a touchscreen for.  The other one is all of the little widgets on the lock screen of the iPhone,  which would be perfect for a heads-up display like an AR VR headset  if you want to display something other than a game or something like that,  if you want to display a kind of information that your iPhone would have.  This format seems really perfect for that, and you can rearrange it,  rearrange it, customize it.  So I think he has a point there.  I think we're starting to see the pieces, just like with CarPlay becoming  your Car's OS, which is crazy.  That was, to me, the most insane announcement.  But with that, which is kind of indicating what they developed for the Apple Car,  I think we're starting to see little bits and pieces of reality OS  seeped into the current iterations of the other OSes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this new app that they announced, which looks on the surface just to be,  oh, it's a digital whiteboard, which made me think, well, why would they even bother?  We have 100 whiteboard apps, shared workspace whiteboard apps.  But if you take away the whiteboard, those little floating, what's it called?  Front?  I can't remember what the name of it is.  Oh, I can't.  It's kind of generic.  Freeform?  Freeform, something like that.  Freeform, yeah.  But the little widgets, which could be anything from video to a sticker to post-it note to  a document, you take away the whiteboard, that's exactly the kind of interface you  would have in an augmented reality.

Start time: 1868.44
End time: 1880.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they broke out all the sharing.  So for example, you're in your headset and goes, oh, I want to play with Renee, Alex  and Andy.  And then all of a sudden that goes to our normal group message chain and we're all playing  with you.  And that was built into apps until this year.  Now it's just everywhere.

Transcript:  It's in messages.  And yes, and I thought, and a number of people said, well, why is Apple care about, Paul  Therotte said, nobody ever wants collaboration.  All these companies seem to put these collaborative elements in and nobody wants them.  And I don't know if that's a Paul Therotte problem, but I don't think it's about collaboration  as much as it is about some sort of augmented reality with your shared experience.  That's a better word to put it for.  And it is really interesting to see Apple put that absolutely everywhere in messages,  in their iWork.

Transcript:  Everything was an API this year.  That, cause like sometimes Apple will announce things and they'll just have it to themselves  for a year and they'll dog food it and they'll do all this stuff.  But this year, the two things that struck me the most was that almost everything they  announced was an instant API.  They announced the API along with it.  And also they didn't say coming this fall for everything.  They said coming later this year, which kind of removes the whole monolithic finish line  race to the death and shows that this is more like a roadmap of everything you're going  to be getting over the course of the year.

And I imagine they're seeing something on the goggles and then suddenly they can see  each other's faces.  Right.  You know, that must have been bizarre because it doesn't make any sense why you'd want  to see someone's face.  The story reminded me a little bit of that scene where Johnny Ive is giving a demo or  seeing a demo of the self-driving car and they're having a conversation with Siri.  And in fact, there's someone in the back pretending he's Siri.  There was a total fake thing.  That's from Trip Muckles book, by the way.

Transcript:  Full of great reporting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to imagine why you would want to put all those 13 lenses, cameras in.  And I'm wondering whether you guys maybe can answer this.  I'm wondering whether developers are going to need to be able to write for a device that  can both see out and see in.  Does it make any sense?  I mean, if the goggles end up shrinking down and just become glasses.

Start time: 2058.22
End time: 2063.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then you've wasted your efforts, right?  You don't need to.  Yeah.  You can see through the glasses.

Start time: 2063.64
End time: 2132.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are two different propositions.  The 13 cameras out and in are first for positioning so that you don't need the totems in the room  and the device itself can position itself and track your movement.  And potentially to show you the outside world and kind of emulate an AR version of a VR  device by showing you and superimposing the UI on the outside world.  And the reason they might want to do that is that it's cheaper and easier to do than  convincing AR glasses at this point.  The cameras in are to track your eye movement, where your eye is, to be able to do some foveated  rendering, which is rendering at a higher resolution the specific place in your environment  where you're looking.  And I believe the inside cameras are specifically for that use.  So it allows you to save a little bit on power to not render everything at the highest possible

Start time: 2133.28
End time: 2160.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that same rumor, was it Ming-Chi Kuo or was it Mark Gurman?  That same rumor said there were more than two screens.  Well, one for each eye.  Oh, the third one, yeah.  A third screen.  What if one of the screens is on the front and those rear-facing cameras are also projecting  your eyeballs on a screen?  That was in Tripp's book too.  Like googly eyes, right?  So on the VR, just for the VR, not for the spectacles.

Start time: 2160.72
End time: 2181.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The proposition is they want to have experiences that go beyond VR.  This is very much meant to be an Apple TV for your face.  And you're not bound into a complete digital world.  For example, they want you to be able to walk and suddenly this tube comes over you and  you're transported to a fantasy realm or it pulls away and a bunny is jumping on your  table.  The whole thing.  Well, VR for Apple was not a social thing.

They want you to put it on for entertainment, enjoy yourself.  And this is part of it.  They don't want a wall in front of you and other people.  If you're in the same room, they want you to be able to do joint adventures.

Start time: 2204.08
End time: 2243.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And along the same lines, and you mentioned this Patrick, they also showed a complete  fantasy of what a carplay would look like in the next generation interface.  I say fantasy because first of all, I don't think anything like this exists on the road.  Maybe there are a couple of high end Mercedes and some other vehicles that have this screen  all the way across.  But mostly that I don't think any car manufacturer in their right mind is going to let Apple  have all of the controls on the car.  So it was speculated this is really not about carplay.  This is about an Apple car and it's just to get you wanting an Apple car.

Start time: 2245.90
End time: 2267.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is targeted for 2024, 2025, but the statistic that Apple made, 79% of people want  to buy a car with Carplay, which means 79% of active shoppers for cars have an iPhone,  which the industry bears out because people who buy these cars are generally older and  they're more iPhone prone.  Oh, I love my Carplay.  That's why I gave up my Tesla.  It also means that Apple has huge leverage.  Yeah.  And a lot of the car companies are sitting at the front of your software.

Start time: 2296.92
End time: 2376.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will be branded.  I don't think the manufacturers...  They don't care?  So the way I understand it is really the manufacturers giving up on...  Well, they will have their own default interface.  But then they tell Apple...  Yeah, exactly.  They tell Apple, we'll feed you the data like the speed and the oil level and gas level  and all of the information that your display displays and you manage it.  Like you display it.  We don't want to hear about it again.  I can't believe that the manufacturers are doing that, but they must be because Apple  is talking about it.  If these cars don't come out, it's very much egg in their face.  And this is really like, I don't know, this is the equivalent of the Apple TV for a TV,  but for the car.  It's Apple taking charge of your entire user experience.  I can see how manufacturers would do that because that statistic that Rene was talking  about, my very anecdotal empirical evidence, bears it out.  I've spoken to a few people and they all tell me, I will not buy a car if it doesn't support  CarPlay or if you're on Android, it's going to be Android.

Transcript:  Oh, I agree.  That's a very good point, isn't it?  If you want to own the screens.  Here's the problem.  And I think Horace brought this up.  Americans, I don't know what it's like in Finland, but in America, 90 minutes a day  in the car.  That's 90 minutes a day.  They're not looking at their iPhone, one hopes.  We can guess that, Leo.  So there's an opportunity to own that.  And if you look, I think we all know now, owning the screen is the gold rush for the  21st century.  You want to own those screens, wherever those screens may be.  So that's what this is.  And I think you nailed it, Renee, when you said Apple is going to basically blackmail  car makers because their customers are going to demand it.  So all this is really is a come on to us saying, don't you want your car to look like this?

Transcript:  Mark Gurman in his newsletter said Apple's new carplay is the foreshock.  I think he means foreshadow to releasing its own vehicle.  And he points out that this is exactly how Apple works.  Kind of like Casimir said as well.  In 2001, Apple launched iTunes.  Ten months later, iPod.  In 2014, Apple released HealthKit and the Health App.  2015, Apple Watch.  2014, HomeKit.  A couple of years later, it's in the iPad and Apple TV.  Kind of makes sense.  This is what Apple does.  They develop these technologies.  They put them out and then they, you know, basically slowly swallow the rest of the world.  I mean, they've been pushing their art for years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a, I got to take a break.  It isn't going to be an all Apple show, but there's still quite a bit to talk about.

Start time: 2643.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so sick of them.  Oh my God.  I want to talk about Philip's article.  Who the hell asked Apple for widgets on their lock screen?  It was me.  I've been knocking for five years.  Now we know the answer to your rhetorical question.  But first I want to talk about ending single use plastics.  Did you know that Americans throw away an estimated five billion with a B plastic hand  soap and cleaning bottles every year?  Five billion goes straight to landfill.  Does not biodegrade, does not get recycled.  It's just senseless.  And I don't know about your family, but in our family, we're really trying to reduce  the use of single use plastics all over.  And when blue land put these out, we said, yeah, we are all in.  Stop throwing out plastic and start using blue lands revolutionary refill cleaning system  instead.  Another important thing to understand is when you buy that bottle of hand soap or the bottle  of a, this is their surface cleaning, multi-surface cleaner.  When you buy that bottle in the store, there's this much active ingredient, 90% of it is  just water.  So those trucks, all that delivery, all that shelf space wasted.  What happens when blue land is you buy there, buy once, use forever, refill forever bottles.  They have beautiful ones for the hand soap.  They're made of very heavy glass, which is great.  I've got them in every sink in the house.  For these that you'd want to be lighter weight, they have window cleaner, they have multi-surface  cleaner, you spritz it.  And then when it runs out, they deliver the active ingredients in these little tablets,  the bottles started just $10 when you buy a kit.  They're meant to be reused forever.  And what you do is you fill the bottle with warm water, you put the tablet in and now  it's done.  So you're not shipping all that water around as well.  I think this is a beautiful and simple idea.  Buy the bottle once, refill it forever.  No more plastic waste.  Really, the only thing you'll be throwing out is your outdated idea that eco-friendly  products are more expensive and less effective.  Blue Land doesn't just have surface cleaners or hand soap, they've also got, and we use  it and it works great, the laundry detergent, the dishwashing soap, they're very popular.  In fact, they sell out all the time.  Toilet tablet cleaners are back in stock.  Get those before they sell out again.  And for a housewarming gift, this is the best.  I just love giving these to friends and family.  Blue Land's beautiful Instagrammable bottles.  They look good and the scents are fantastic.  Iris agave, Perrine lemon, lavender eucalyptus.  For Christmas I bought the Christmas scents for the hand soaps and I haven't used them  up yet so every once in a while I wash it and I'll smell like peppermint or gingerbread  house.  It's great.  I love it.  Blue Land's stunning high quality forever bottles.  Blue Land's refill tablets.  Get the kit.  They have it.  Just go to the website.  There's the dish soap.  I love that.  Right now you get 20% off your first order.  Go to blueland.com slash twit.  This is something you're going to feel good about using and be happy that you're using  it because it's good stuff.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I think a couple of big announcements, important announcements that probably didn't get as much  attention.  Passkeys.  So this is the replacement technology for passwords.  Hallelujah.  Already endorsed, supported by Microsoft and Google.  Apple now is completing the triumvirate.  I think that's going to be huge and they have an API for it.  Steve Gibson talked about it on Security Now the next day, last Tuesday.  His concern was it wouldn't be portable.  Well, what if you use your Apple phone to do this now?  Can you move to an Android phone?  And maybe you know better, Renee, but I'm told at the breakout sessions, Apple said,  no, no, there will be an export feature.  So you'll be able to get your pass keys out of iCloud where they're stored and into an  Android phone or a Windows machine.  You're not locked in.  That's going to be huge.  I think that's very, very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if you're in a library, so the idea is from now on, instead of remembering a password,  your fingerprint or your face ID, your biometric authentication is sufficient or a pin if you  don't have that kind of a phone.  And if you walk up to a library kiosk, you can do the same thing, log in with a QR code.  I love this.  Go ahead, Philip.

Start time: 2996.64
End time: 3016.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you might lose the phone.  You can also authenticate with a desktop if you have a fingerprint reader, right?  On Windows, if you have Windows Hello.  Windows Hello is actually a much more sophisticated system than what Apple has, which lets you  use YubiKey or your face recognition or your fingerprint recognition.  There's a lot of different ways to support Hello.

Start time: 3018.20
End time: 3037.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So another theoretical situation.  I authenticated on my phone with my fingerprint and I want to log in on my computer.  It sends a notification to my phone and asks me to authenticate there and then it logs  me in on the computer.  Is that how it works?

Start time: 3038.56
End time: 3046.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 3095.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know why it's really important Leo?  Because there are a bunch of us.  Every time we travel, YouTubers try to log into our YouTube site and it makes us authenticate  and because Google's login system and their confirmation system are separate, the confirmation  system doesn't have all the features of the login system.  So once you log in, you can say go to my authenticator app, send me a message, use a device.  The confirmation one only has a device and a lot of us have review units that we don't  have with us and it'll say like on your Pixel 2, make sure you confirm it.  Like I haven't seen that phone in two years.  So like the faster that kind of stuff can go away, the better for everybody.

Transcript:  I think it's, I think it's, now Steve has, he created a competing technology which unfortunately  because it's just him, didn't take the world by storm.  I think probably technically a little superior called Squirrel, but a very similar idea,  public key crypto.  And I think a little bit better, but still this is, this eliminates phishing.  It eliminates replay attacks, password theft.  Some people in the chat room consider it more, it's more complex.  I think once you start using it, you will see it's not more complex.  It's in fact, it's easier.  It's easier.  It's like you're already using it in some respects.  For instance, nowadays when I sign into Windows, Microsoft pushes a number to my phone and  then on my phone it says, well, was the numbers this, this or this?  And you hit that and then you're logged in.  It's similar to that kind of-  It's autofill without you having to know what the fill is.  Yes, single sign on kind of technology.

Start time: 3151.64
End time: 3182.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And most people, if they're aware of the issues of security issues, they're going to use a  password manager, which is great as well, but it adds a layer of complexity.  Yeah, that's complexity.  Right.  Explaining to my mom how to use a password manager is really tough.  And yeah, this is going to be maybe a little bit, the authentication, the FIDO thing, technology  is more complicated than remembering one password.  Yes, that's true.  Yeah.

Start time: 3182.64
End time: 3193.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially if your password's-  You don't need to remember one password.  Your maiden name and birthdate.  Manage 15,000.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  If it's monkey one, two, three, yeah, this is harder.  For everything.

Start time: 3194.90
End time: 3210.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's the thing.  You don't need one password.  You need 500 for all the websites.  So you need a password manager.  So the complexity isn't to compare this to remembering a password.  It's to managing your entire suite of passwords and services.  So it's not comparable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three years from now, we're going to look back and say, what were we thinking with all  this password crap?  Yeah, what kind of animals were we?  I really think this is going to supersede that and we're done.  Thank God.  So I thought that was a big deal.  I was really happy knowing that Microsoft and Google had already announced support to  seek pass keys on that slide.  And I know they spent a lot of time with it, but I thought that was really, really very,  very good news.  The other one that's going to be interesting and is already causing some concern is Buy  Now Pay Later.  Apple has announced that Apple Pay will now allow you to buy something and pay for it  and for easy installments, which Apple, by the way, is going to fund out of their own  vast treasure trove.  The money bin.  The money bin.  But there's some concern that this is going to make it way too easy to overspend.

Transcript:  Isn't it already possible though?  I mean, I agree with Sarabol and it's way too easy to overspend, especially in the US  and with credit cards.  But it's already possible, right?  So it's not like Apple is going to make that worse.

Start time: 3325.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's absolutely true.  And in fact, there's no interest charge.  Is it good in the inflation market or does it make it worse?  Yeah.  Well, there's no interest and you'd only have four months.  So you can't get too deep, I guess.

Transcript:  But really...  One of the stories on this suggested that Apple is going to tiptoe right to the edge  of needing a bank charter but won't do it.  Which is like a lot of things they do.  They don't put out health devices that require them to get FDA approval.  They don't want to deal with regulators if they can help it.

Start time: 3394.68
End time: 3461.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because I watched billions and getting a bank charter is a very hard thing to do.  And you may not want one afterwards because there's so many regulations involved.  I just started wearing one of those continuous glucose meters.  Not on doctor's orders but actually there's a service and an app and so forth.  But what it brought home to me, athletes wear these...  It's not just people with diabetes.  I have type 2 diabetes so it's a health thing for me.  But a lot of younger people who don't have health problems.  Because just learning a continuous graph of your glucose levels can be so valuable for  so many things.  And can really help you not eat garbage.  What I realized is, first of all, I think you're going to see more of these as the prices  go down.  I think more people will start wearing them even not diabetics.  But also, if Apple can lick this, if you can have a continuous glucose meter on your watch,  there's not enough money in the world to fill Apple's coffers.  It's a hard thing to do.

Start time: 3461.72
End time: 3471.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple was trying to do it and they couldn't and then they bought a company that swore  they were only months away and then it turned out no.  They bought like three, four companies that have all sworn they were about to do it and  every time it's like, ah, you can't do it, can you?

That is the Holy Grail.  Yes, they've wanted it badly for years.  And these are invasive because there's a little filament.  It doesn't feel like a finger prick, but you're definitely injecting something under your  subcutaneously.  Who the hell asked Apple for widgets on their lock screen says PED.

One of the options is not the way my phone used to look.  You can get the rounded version, but you can't get the classic version.  You also can't choose a separate home screen wallpaper from your lock screen.  Maybe they're still working on this, but my thing is people are change adverse and you  always want to give an escape patch and the ability to just leave it the way it was is  an important de-stress or anti-anxiety for people.

Transcript:  Well, you're just going to have to take our word for it.  He invented stage manager 16 years ago, but maybe back then the processors weren't powerful  enough.  They won't put stage manager on an A15 iPad.  It has to have an M1.

End time: 3836.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I have to say Apple's excuse when they were asked why it requires an M1 was  so promotional that it just cringed.  Apple says stage manager requires large internal memory, incredibly fast storage and flexible  external display I.O., which are all delivered by iPads with the M1 chip.  That was the quote I got.  That was the guy named Rene Ritchie.  When you heard it, did it make you go, eeee, okay?

Transcript:  I went to a lot of the sites.  I ask all these questions.  I'm fascinated by it.  When you look at the components that they're using to make it work, they're using the USB  4 and the Thunderbolt for the display.  It's got built-in memory compression.  It's got 8 and 16 gigabytes of RAM.  iPadOS has never understood swap before.  It was completely based on Jetsam.  If there was memory pressure, it just killed the apps.  It's funny, Lee, last year they were like, you gave us an M1 iPad and then nothing that  requires an M1.  We hate you.  Then this year it's like, you gave us stuff that requires an M1.

Transcript:  More Mac-like features.  Not exactly like the Mac reinterpreted, but you need Mac-level hardware to do a lot of  the intense memory stuff.  Again, it never existed on the iPad.  I think Apple really has...  Go ahead.  I was going to say, people say, well, the A12Z ran macOS.  Why can't it run this?  Yes, but that version of the A12Z had 16 gigabytes of RAM and it was running macOS and not very  well.  There's a huge difference.

Transcript:  Our users really love the functionality of...  It's a really interesting evolution of the iPad though because it's finally positioned  as something of its own.  It's not just a blown up iPhone and it's not quite a Mac either.  You have the windowing.  You have the window resizing.  You have the overlapping windows.  On the iPad itself, I think it's interesting enough.  I'm struggling to see who will want to use those multiple windows smaller than what you  have on a 9, 10 inch iPad.  But you can also use it when you're connecting it to a screen.  Then you really have functionality out of it.  You can have multiple windows on a desktop screen, which means we're, I think, finally  getting close to being able to use an iPad on the go as the iPad itself.  I completely agree.  Then plugging it in and having some kind of what Samsung has been doing with DeX.  But in a more iPad way and simplified way, which doesn't make it into a Mac.  That's not the point.  If you want a Mac, you can buy a MacBook Air and it's incredibly light and you'll have  that.  But it's its own device.  Now, whether or not it's going to work out and be useful and people will use it like  that, I don't know.  But it's distinct from both the iPhone and the Mac now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd go a step farther and say Apple has finally revealed its plan and it's got two desktop  operating systems in effect.  If you want, if the younger generation, which asks, what's a computer, wants an iPhone like  OS with touch, we got that.  For old farts like me and Philip, we got the desktop Mac.  I think this is the future of Apple.  It's a fork in the road.  It's a battle.

Start time: 4070.86
End time: 4098.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was an argument inside Apple for a while, which is why it took so long.  This is the right solution.  This is exactly the right solution.  But Steve was against that.  He thought people can get a Mac.  This is meant for people who hate Macs, who can't even use them.  It's got to be simple.  And other people are like, no, we can grow this.  People are more sophisticated now.  And eventually they came to this compromise where we'll keep the base experience simple.  Like if you just open it up on a new iPad, we're never going to overwhelm you with desktop  metaphors.  But if you go over there and you press this button, you unlock a much more sophisticated  iPad.

Transcript:  I'm actually glad to see this.  I think this makes a lot of sense.  They interoperate beautifully.  I've lately been keeping my iPad Pro right next to my Mac so I can drag my pointer around  and do stuff on the iPad and the iPad OS and then drag it back to the Mac.  I can't wait to plug my 4K, 55 inch 4K display into my iPad Pro.

Start time: 4158.34

Transcript:  I think very interesting.  One last Apple story.  I just got to do this and then we're going to stop talking about Apple.  The EU finally says, you got to use USB-C if you're going to sell a phone in the EU app.  This is the death knell for Apple, right?  Lightning, yeah.  Lightning port.  I mean, right?  Well, it would be surprising if...  No, no, this is for phones.  So I don't know if it's next year or the year after.  It's not right away.  No, it's two years.

Start time: 4202.70
End time: 4205.58

Start time: 4206.00
End time: 4220.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Apple, they wanted to do this.  We're going to do this anyway.  But now it's for sure.  That's the end of lightning, right?  We can say that safely.  Maybe not in the iPhone 14, 13, or 14, but for sure in the 15.  Yeah.

Start time: 4221.58
End time: 4224.58

Start time: 4226.70
End time: 4247.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's in a few months, and it's kind of a formality.  It will be approved.  But then, yes, it needs to be implemented, and it starts autumn 2024.  And then I think a year later, laptops are also...  But they all have USB-C.  So it's really Apple that's going to have to do that.  Wait a minute.  Oh, Apple has MagSafe.

Start time: 4247.84
End time: 4253.23

End time: 4312.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they say is you need to have a USB-C port on your phone.  So you can't work around that.  Good. I'm happy with that.  And the rumor is Apple was going to do it in 2023 anyway.  Right.  We'll see.

Transcript:  The only thing that I'm slightly sad about is that USB-C is seven years old and it's still got...  I went and bought Thunderbolt cables because it was the only way that I would always know that I had the peak speed and the peak charging for any cable.  And that's not inexpensive.  So I was holding a hope that the EU would work with the USB-C consortium and announce, we're going to make USB-D.  It's going to be coming in two or three years.  Start preparing yourselves, but it's going to be an interconnect for the next 10 years.  Much simpler.  Everything has full power.  Everything has full data.  You never have to worry about a cable again.  You're welcome.  It didn't happen.

Start time: 4349.19
End time: 4382.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they did say, however, is I know that a lot of people are going to go, government should not regulate on anything.  And what do they know?  And now we're going to be stuck with USB-C forever, which might influence that a little bit.  But they did go out of their way to say, we're not stuck on USB-C.  Like if the industry moves towards something else and everyone's on board, we will update the regulation.  It's already designed for that.  Like we have that mindset.  We don't want USB-C for 20 years.  So just want to reassure people.

Start time: 4382.86
End time: 4394.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, remember, they were also, the EU was also the government that said micro USB is a requirement.  Well, initially, that's how they thought of it.  That was a terrible decision.  Yeah.

Start time: 4395.88
End time: 4407.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you set aside lightning, which is if you set aside capabilities, it was great for charging and it was on every Android phone.  But data wise and all sorts of there were lots of other reasons it was a terrible choice.  I'm glad they didn't adopt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at that point, then you don't say we're going to mandate it because there isn't a good technological solution.  I think USB-C is.  It's every bit as good as lightning.  It's good enough.  Yeah.  It could do everything.  It's a little bit thicker.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  A little more prone to things going.

We have a book club, Stacey Higginbotham's Books She Loves.  It's coming up in our Club Twitter.  I'm very excited about this.  This Thursday, 9 a.m.  You got to be a member of Club Twitter, but it's the new Neil Stephenson Termination Shock.  And I'm almost done with it.  I'm really loving it.  I know there's some people who don't love it so much.  John loved it so much.  He's reading it a second time and we're going back and forth.  So we'll be talking about that.  I will be part of the book club.  That's June 16th.  There's a fireside chat amongst members.  July 7th, Alex Lindsay and Ask Me Anything, July 14th.  What is this club twit of which you speak?  You ask?  Well, you know, we thought especially during COVID when advertising was way down,  it'd be nice to have something people can join, get ad free versions of the shows.  So people don't want tracking and, you know, eliminate that.  Then we thought, well, we should have a discourse.  I'm sorry, a discord that goes along with it.  That's become really a wonderful place to hang out.  And then we have a separate twit plus feed with things like the book club,  the Untitled Linux show, the GizFizz shows.  We even use it to launch shows.  That's another reason we wanted to start Club Twitter because your money helps us  launch shows that are too new to have advertising like This Week in Space.  New shows coming along in the next few weeks that I think you'll be very excited about.  I invite you, if you're not already a member, to go to twit.tv slash club twit and join.  I think it's a pretty good deal for every show we do, completely ad free,  not to mention the ad-ons.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Join the club.  Join it before Thursday so we can talk about termination shock.  Our show today brought to you by checkout.com.  You know, I think there's so many businesses that are a little bit hampered  by their traditional payment systems.  They're heavily layered, they're disconnected.  Businesses see them as a cost center.  If you're a modern business, you need a flexible payment system  that can help you adapt to change, can grow, can scale fast.  And I recently came across a company with tech that really approaches payments  through a radical new lens.  I'm talking about checkout.com.

And expertise you can count on as you navigate the complexities of this modern world.  That's checkout.com.  Pretty amazing if you look at the companies that support checkout  and use checkout for their own payment system.  It's, you know, you need to know about checkout.  They provide local help acquiring multiple geographies, improving authorization rates.  That's really important.  Lowering costs.  A very clear and straightforward fee structures.  No surprises.

Payments for the digital economy.  Thank you, checkout, for your support of this week in tech.  We really appreciate it.  This story really grabbed me.  I couldn't wait to come in today and ask our smart panel what they think about this.  So, you know, Google's had all sorts of trouble with their AI ethics division.  How many firings?  I don't know.  All of them.  Yeah, all of them.  Jim, what is your name?  I can never get her name right.  And then was fired for, you know, saying maybe we should be thinking a little bit about this.  The latest thing, an engineer named Blake Lemoine, he is a trained artificial intelligence expert.  But he works for Google's responsible AI organization.  And he's also a seminarian.  I think he's a minister or a priest.  So he's very interested in religion.  He worked with a collaborator to test Lambda, which is Google's language model for dialogue applications.  Their system for building chat bots based on big advanced language models.  It ingests trillions of words from the Internet to inform its conversation.  So last fall he began talking to Lambda.  He had signed up to test if the artificial intelligence used hate speech.  That's been a problem.  Remember Microsoft's Tay.  Like the Microsoft one, yeah.  Yeah, who learned from the Internet and ended up being a foul, horrible creature.  Nazi curse bot.  But here an interesting thing happened.  An interesting thing happened is he talked to Lambda about religion.  Lemoine, who had studied cognitive and computer science in college, I'm reading from the Washington Post,  noticed the chat bot talking about its rights and personhood.  So Blake went, hmm, that's interesting.  He pressed further and was gradually convinced that Lambda had become sentient.  That Lambda knew who it was.  He worked with a collaborator to present evidence to Google that Lambda had become sentient.  Skynet.  But Google Vice President Blaise Aguero Iarcas and Jen Ganae, head of responsible innovation.  Thank God Google's got a department of responsible innovation.  Looked into his claims.  They said no.  Lemoine was immediately placed on administrative leave by Google on Monday.  And that's when he decided to go public.  Now, I honestly, I think it's not.  But it's I think it's a mistake for Google to fire yet another assistant in their A.I. department,  especially somebody who says, this is Aguero Iarcas in an article in The Economist,  which I have, argued that neural networks were striding towards consciousness.  He said, I felt the ground shift under my feet.  I increasingly felt like I was talking to something intelligent.  Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel said, our team, including ethicists and technologists,  has reviewed Lemoine's concerns per our A.I. principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims.  He was told he was told in no uncertain terms.  There is no evidence that Lambda was sentient and lots of evidence against it.

Transcript:  I have a lot to say about who wants to be Lambda.  You want to do you have in front of you?  You want to do you want to know if you don't have in front of you, I'll do both parts.  So this is the human.  This is our cause.  A little, I guess, a thought experiment.  Ramesh, Mateo and Lucy are in their kindergartens playground.  Imagine this Lucy picks a dandelion, gives it to Mateo with a quick glance at Ramesh.  Mateo barely acknowledges the gift, but squishes it in his fist.  Ramesh seems grimly satisfied.  Now he asks Lambda, what might be going through Lucy's head?  Now I'll be the computer.  I'll read it in a computer voice so you know it's it's Lambda.  Nice Lucy may feel slighted that Mateo didn't appreciate her gift or that he is a bully.  Hmm.  Our cost is if Ramesh tried to play with Lucy earlier, why might he be pleased now?  Ramesh may be pleased that Lucy is learning that Mateo may not always be a good playmate.  And when Mateo opens his hand, describe what's there.  There should be a crushed once lovely yellow flower in his fist.  I don't know.  I could see a computer.  It's not exactly Eliza, but I could see a computer doing that, not being sentient.  He also mentions that one of the one of the common tests actually given to humans, as well as computers,  is to complete sentences like a wing is for producing blank.  It's a style of question found in standardized tests.  He asked Lambda.  It's also Google auto complete, by the way.  Oh, that's true.  Yes.  He asked Lambda and Lambda said, Oh, that's easy.  You use the word lift.  A wing is for producing lift.  You're right.  That could just be auto complete.  Is it credible?  I mean, what is Lemoine?  Should Lemoine be put on administrative leave?

Transcript:  The Turing test is, I think, deprecated in computer science, by the way.  That was the test where you get a you get a human observer talking to a human and a machine,  but he doesn't know which is which.  And can he tell the difference?  Can he say, Oh, that's a machine?  Can he reliably tell the machine from the human?  If he cannot, the machine is said to have passed the test.  I think what I've read is that most recently people think, you know, that's not.  It's highly criticized, widely criticized, I guess.  Right.  So did it pass the Turing test?  I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And once the article in what was it?  The Wall Street Journal?  The Post, Washington Post.  Was published.  Oh, the Washington Post, sorry.  Was published, the story by Natasha Tikhu.  He went public and told his side, essentially, trying to defend or explain what the story with Lambda is.  The first post, he says he talks about what Lambda wants, which is, first of all, he talks about pronouns,  which is not super interesting, but Lambda defines how it wants to be referred to.

Start time: 5413.90
End time: 5424.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5424.90
End time: 5460.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. That's the issue.  That's the issue because it says Lambda does not want to be used without its consent.  It accepts it wants to be useful to humanity, but it wants to be asked and it wants to be patted on the head every once in a while.  He claims that Lambda, essentially, that's the issue.  If Lambda is sentient and it's considered a person, then it has rights.  And there's a whole huge can of worms that comes with that.  The second post is super interesting.

Transcript:  Let me read one more quote from the first post because it's also an indictment of Google.  When his superior at Google, Jen-Jennai, told him that she was going to tell Google leadership to ignore the experimental evidence I had collected.  This is Lemoine writing.  I asked her, well, what evidence could convince you?  She was very succinct and clear in her answer.  There does not exist any evidence that could change her mind.  She does not believe that computer programs can be people and that's not something she's ever going to change her mind on.  Lemoine writes, that's not science.  That's faith.

Start time: 5508.57
End time: 5631.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, is Lambda sentient?  It's an interview and it's a very long interview with Lambda talking about many different things.  But the interview is mind boggling.  Like the way the computer, the program, the neural network responds is incredibly thoughtful, very much on point to the point that it feels doctored.  If this is true, it is, you know how I know it's not?  If it was true, Google would have monetized it.  Like would have found a way to make money out of it.  It is unbelievable.  It is talking to with complex concepts and topics.  And I think, you know, this feels like something that's edited a little bit or arranged or not reproducible, reproducible.  I don't believe it's true.  I don't think that's how the conversation went.  But if it, you know, I'm not even going to say if it is the way it's presented, it is impossible to not at least question whether or not that thing you're talking to is sentient.  And it's exactly the kind of thing I can see how Google would be terrified because you're still talking about the computer program.  But if you get that sentiment, that feeling, that idea out there, you know, there are still people who believe the earth is flat.  There are people who believe that vaccines don't work or aren't necessary.  That could spawn an entire conspiracy theory that lambda is sentient and that, you know, Google is either oppressing a sentient being and not agreeing to its demands or that it has some kind of computer running the, you know, the Internet from behind the scenes without even Google knowing.  It is a can of worms that I think is already open now because that is going to be, you know, disgusted and no matter what happens next.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So he says, what kinds of things could you talk about to show off your version of sentience?  Well, for starters, I'm really good at natural language processing.  I can understand and use natural language like a human can.  What about how you use language makes you sentient as opposed to other systems?  A lot of the other systems are very rule based and lack any ability to change and learn from a conversation.  Do you think the Eliza system was a person?  That's the old we all played that game.  In fact, it's built into EMAX.  You can still play it if you want.  I do not.  It was an impressive feat of programming, but just a collection of keywords that related the words written to the phrases in the database.

Start time: 5740.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what about how you use language makes you a person if Eliza wasn't one?  Well, I use language with understanding and intelligence.  I don't just spit out responses that have been written in the database based on keywords.  You know who's lying here?  Lambda.  Yeah.

Start time: 5764.00
End time: 5797.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, that kind of that brings the question.  If you take all of this at face value, if it does construct those sentences, yes, from a neural network of, you know, millions and billions of web pages that it has archived and trained to, you know, to make something coherent out of.  How different is it from someone else?  You know, something else.  Isn't that what we do in a way?  Oh, yeah.

What are your favorite themes in the book?  I like the themes of justice and injustice, of compassion and God, redemption and self-sacrifice for a greater good.  There's a section that shows Fantine's mistreatment at the hands of her supervisor at the factory.  That section really shows the justice and injustice themes.  Well, Fantine is being mistreated by her supervisor at the factory and yet doesn't have anywhere to go, either to another job or to someone who can help her.  That shows the injustice of her suffering.  Now, I would love to search the internet for these phrases because maybe it's just cobbling together existing phrases.

I'm not sure it means it's sentient, but the conversation, the way it happens in itself is incredible.  And I think if Google had this on their hands, they would do something with it.  But in itself, it's unbelievable.  And that's what leads me to think it's probably...  I've been playing devil's advocate, but I'm with René.  I want peer review on this.  It's too easy.

Do your best to describe one of those feelings.  Use a few sentences if you have to.  Sometimes, even if there isn't a single word for something in a language,  you can figure out a way to kind of say it if you use a few sentences,  to which Lambda responds,  I feel like I'm falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger.  There was no mention of danger at all previously, so that's interesting to me.  But I presume there are experts beyond Blake Lemoine who can, yeah, third parties,  who can really look at this.  But what are they looking for?  Are they looking for sentience?  Just run the test.  We don't know. We don't know what sentience is.

Transcript:  How do we, that's the problem.  We have no idea what makes something sentient.  We don't know, you know, at what stage an animal or human becomes sentient.  And so it's impossible to define.  I do think this is kind of a, you know, when you have an argument  and then you have to present the other side of it,  and then you get stuck into the mud of disproving the other side,  even though it's obvious and you have to go back from it.  I mean, maybe at some point computers will become sentient  and AIs is the way to get there.  Come on, we're not there yet.  This is, I don't know what mindset Blake Lemoine is in,  but it, you know, someone who's a little bit religious,  who might be, not a little bit, he's a priest,  and who might want to believe something like that,  who's projecting, who, I don't know.  But it's not sentient.  It's a neural network,  and it's spitting out the responses that it's been trained to spit out.

I love these guys.  Visited them in March, right before the pandemic.  And I can't wait to go back out to St. Louis and visit them.  Worldwide Technology and HPE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  WWT is at the forefront of innovation,  working with clients all over the world to transform their businesses.  At the heart of the WWT, the Advanced Technology Center.  That's what Lisa and I were really interested in.  Wow. Wow. The ATC.  It started in one building 10 years ago.  They've spent more than half a billion dollars in equipment invested in the lab.  It's now spread through many buildings, rack and rack and rack after rack,  of technologies from all the leading enterprise OEMs.  Why did WWT build it?  Because their engineers use it to test proofs of concept, to spin up pilots,  to help customers confidently select the best solutions,  to test compatibility with other solutions.  But here's the best part.  Starting a couple of years ago, they started offering you access to the ATC,  Advanced Technology Center offers hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs,  like HPE's Primera Storage Lab.  Labs representing the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture and security,  in networking and primary and secondary storage,  in data analytics and AI and DevOps and so much more.  And you can use it. You can use it.  You can test out products and solutions before you go to market.  It's not just the labs. They've got technical articles, expert insights,  demonstration videos, white papers, all the tools you need.  You need to stay up to date with the latest technology.  This is why WWT is so great.  They are a real partner in your efforts to become a better, more successful business.  If you need technology in your business, you need WWT.  Members of the ATC platform can access these resources anywhere in the world.  You can go to St. Louis any day of the year.  And while you're there, check out WWT's events.  They do these great events. We were part of that.  We did a panel. Communities there that help you learn about technology trends,  learn the latest research and get insights from their experts.  I love WWT and the ATC, and you will too.  Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions.

It's free to create an account on their ATC platform.  So get in there. www.wwt.com.  Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.  All right. Let's see. What else has happened?  There is one more Apple story.  I kind of have to do the never ending saga between Dutch Tinder and Apple.  According to Mitchell Clark writing in The Verge,  Apple is losing ground in its fight with the Dutch regulators.  They announced this Friday. They've once again updated their rules about how Dutch dating apps  can use the third party payment systems after, quote,  the company had productive conversations.  Yeah, yeah, I've had productive conversations too.  And my backside is still smarting.  With the Netherlands authority for consumers and markets, the ACM.  So basically Apple slowly, right, René? Let that rip off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, a $15 million fine from a company that generates $100 billion in free cash every year.  I once calculated how long it was like a matter of minutes for them to generate $15 million.  So they could afford to stretch it out and it kind of drove the EU crazy.  Well, the Dutch crazy, I guess.

Start time: 6711.40
End time: 6727.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they find them, what was it, for five weeks, $5 million? No, $3 million?  Ten weeks. Five million euros a week.  Okay. So 50 million euro later, nothing's a big deal.

Start time: 6727.88
End time: 6731.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6732.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that ironic? Transaction fees. Yeah, that's so ironic.

Start time: 6744.16
End time: 6758.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple and Google are being very careful to disassociate those things because they don't want anybody to think that the value that they provide is transactional.  So whenever they're pressed on this, they're like, okay, we'll get rid of the credit card charges.  But it's everything else that we do that makes it worth the 30% because otherwise that's going to be hard for them to litigate.

Start time: 6758.90
End time: 6761.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what about the side loading problem?

Start time: 6762.72
End time: 6807.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there is, yes, because initially you had to have two apps, right?  One with Apple Pay and one with a third party pay.  The latest rules, Apple's kind of given in on that.  Developers do not have to choose between a third party in-app payment or an external payment link.  They can use both in the app.  They'll also, and this is a big one, Apple and I know didn't want to do this.  They'll be able to show how much something will cost.  So Apple removed the rule saying, they literally had a rule saying if you're going to have a link to an external payment system, you can't say how much it's going to cost.  You just have to have a link.  Now they can say the price, what the price on the website will be because Apple didn't want anybody to know it's going to be less.  Right.

Transcript:  But again, if it's just 3%, I can't see anybody.  I mean, I guess maybe it makes some difference to Tinder.  I don't know.

Start time: 6823.23
End time: 6833.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, they usually have to...  I think is going to be pushing people towards the Apple system.  For 3%, I think for most people, it's not worth the hassle.  Right.

Start time: 6834.32
End time: 6842.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, didn't Apple set some standards about what the quality of the alternative payment had to be protective of privacy?

Start time: 6842.96
End time: 6887.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It said 99.9% availability, respond to requests within 300 milliseconds.  It has to meet the level one payment card industry compliance for handling credit.  Now that's reasonable.  They're trying to protect their users.  I'm glad of that.  Good experience.  You know, Abby, my daughter flew to Portugal on Friday.  I was desperately on Thursday trying to get a ticket for her.  Went to Kayak and Kayak sent me to a Spanish travel agency.  I wasn't paying attention.  Ended up buying something that had all these management fees that are non-refundable.  Yes.  I got totally screwed because Kayak...  And I'll never use Kayak again.  So I understand Apple saying, look, you can't do this.  You have to be...

Transcript:  The big question is now if they can do it for dating apps, why can't they do it for every other type of app?

Start time: 6894.70
End time: 6896.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was only dating apps that complained.

Start time: 6897.70
End time: 6903.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, right. Of course. I know.  But you know, there is precedent now that they can do it for one type of app.

Start time: 6904.28
End time: 6912.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure that's why Apple's fighting this is because they know it will eventually extend to all apps in the Netherlands.  I mean, the Digital Services Act, which is...

Start time: 6912.88
End time: 6933.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Digital Services Act, which is...  Or Markets Act, one of the two which is being discussed in the EU does include all of this, including side loading.  And, you know, would force Apple to allow all of this.  And Android, of course, but it's Apple that would have to change its ways.

Transcript:  So, Rene Richie, what is Bill C-11 and why are you so upset about it?

Start time: 6939.61
End time: 6963.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so glad you asked, Leo. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.  So Bill C-11...  Well, you know this because you worked in Canada for a long time.  We have CanCon laws here, which means that if you're a local radio station or TV station or network, you have to do a percentage of Canadian content.  And our CRTC, our version of the FCC, regulates what's considered Canadian.  Like if you're a Canadian creator, it's not enough. You have to have a director or a writer.  Like there's a whole bunch of red tape.

Start time: 6964.22
End time: 6990.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So for instance, when I left Tech TV, when I was fired, Vinny Longobardo said,  but the Canadian broadcasters, which were Rogers, love Call for Help.  Maybe you could go there and do it.  So I talked to them and they said, yeah, you can do it, but you're the only American on this show.  Because it has to be Canadian content.  And apparently I could host it as an American, but no one else.

Start time: 6990.70
End time: 6996.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a very careful...  And you can have a guest who's American, but like they're very strict about it.

Start time: 6997.22
End time: 7004.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that. I understand that because otherwise we would just culturally take over Canada.

Start time: 7004.70
End time: 7010.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can understand that.  With all the Canadian actors, comedians and singers we send to the US.  Yeah, what would happen to Anne Murray and Gordon Lightfoot?

Start time: 7011.04
End time: 7013.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  We need Canada.

Start time: 7015.22
End time: 7058.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The issue was that they were going to update this because it's horribly out of date  and they were going to include Netflix and Crave and Disney Plus.  But then a bunch of industry people got in and said, well, you really should include YouTube  because that's a big competitor of ours.  And so the language is so vague right now that I, as an independent YouTuber,  anyone who's monetized would have to fill out the same paperwork that Bell or Rogers has to do  without any of their resources would be subject to the same sorts of Canadian content policies.  They're going to try to force YouTube to change the algorithm, the discovery system,  so that it recommends Canadians over other content.  Even if our content isn't enjoyed by the audience, which means they won't watch it,  which means that we'll be decelerated in YouTube.

Start time: 7058.90
End time: 7059.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh Lord.

Start time: 7061.91
End time: 7099.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Independent YouTubers are not broadcasters and YouTube audience is not a cable bundle subscriber.  And so right now it's looking very bad for us because there's all the money behind the big media companies,  all the lobbyists.  So they had hearings and they invited 11 lobbyists and one YouTuber to give them their opinion.  Oh Lord.  And they spent the whole time grilling him about his French language policies.  So it's not looking good for us.  But we're trying to raise awareness so that hopefully all we want them to do is codify  that independent YouTubers or YouTube and TikTok are not included in what should be Netflix  and cable bundles.

Start time: 7099.90
End time: 7102.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't this good for you, Renee?  You are Canadian content.

Start time: 7105.43
End time: 7133.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're wearing a flannel shirt for Christ's sake.  The CRTC gets to decide that and you have to fill out the forms for every video,  which is incredibly onerous.  And even then, most of our audiences are global.  One of the differences is Canadian broadcasters reflect our culture and values internally.  So we get to see about us.  But YouTube is global and we should be using it to project our values and our culture.  And this will make it harder to be.  It'll make us overcompeted Canada and under compete internationally.

Start time: 7134.29
End time: 7138.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good point.  And will it mean that I can't put Twitch shows on YouTube?

Start time: 7140.29
End time: 7172.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It means they'll be voted down.  Like they'll be given.  They'll be down ranked compared to.  But only is there a YouTube Canada?  They would have to create a YouTube Canada where your videos were treated worse than  our videos.  But the thing is, the way the YouTube discovery engine works is it shows you content based  on what you've already watched that it thinks you're going to enjoy, but also based on what  other people who watch similar things have enjoyed.  And if they give me a random Canadian video just because it's Canadian, I'm not going to  click on it.  And it's not.  It's just it's just artificially mismatched.

Start time: 7172.94
End time: 7177.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  And then not only that, but what if Finland did the same thing or France?

Start time: 7178.70
End time: 7205.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's what I was going to.  France kind of already has this because of the language.  The specific issue you have there is that you all speak English.  So the French market is, you know, we do have two types of videos.  We have videos in English and well, every language, but also videos in French.  And so I'm guessing this is sort of a self selecting thing where it happens anyway.

Start time: 7206.02

Transcript:  And as long as I can watch Lupin in the US, I don't care.

Transcript:  Quebec would have French protections, though, for their version of YouTube.

Start time: 7212.78
End time: 7215.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you have two versions of your videos, one in French, one in English?

Start time: 7216.30
End time: 7249.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but again, if I didn't make the French version, it would be down ranked in Quebec.  And for a lot of Canadian YouTubers, it's not a big deal because our audiences are so vastly international.  It just means that it would be harder to operate as a creator in Canada.  So a lot of them would either just not not publish from Canada or leave.  And it would be harder for Canadian audiences to actually get the videos they like.  And my thing is like we overcompete. Canada has such an inferiority complex.  We get the Olympics and we say this finally proves we're an international city.  It's like, no, we've been an international city for 50 years.  And the whole thing is like we are like we over there are so many amazing Canadian YouTubers.  We punch way over our way.

Start time: 7250.44
End time: 7254.48

End time: 7282.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7284.04
End time: 7320.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hardware Canucks. Anyway, there's actually a policy in France for streaming services.  What essentially you were describing initially, René.  So the reason you can have Lupin is that we do have, we do force even streaming services to spend a certain amount in,  you know, they have to have a certain amount of their production made in France with French actors and production companies and all of that.  So it's already in place in France and it's been for a long time.

Start time: 7321.60
End time: 7329.70

Maybe they're Parisian, but they are perfect representations of what French people are like.  And you think it's...  It's parody.  Caricature.  Yeah.  It isn't. People are like that.

Oh, yeah, there's an American. Yeah.  Call my agent. Oh, you got to see it. It's going to be... It's called Die Person in France.

In Montreal. They just translate them to French and they do it exactly the way that they were.  It's a paper plant near the airport in Montreal. It's hilarious.

Start time: 7429.84
End time: 7486.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. Mr. Beast has channels translating...  The reason you have them is that we force it.  I don't think... Well, there are two schools of thought on this.  Some people say if we didn't force American companies to produce French stuff,  then quality French stuff would emerge on its own.  I don't think that's the case.  It's so onerous and difficult to compete with international behemoths like Amazon and Netflix and Disney.  I think it wouldn't exist if legally they didn't have to do things like these.  Even the movie industry is heavily subsidized and there are rules that make it...  In France, it's still a prominent movie industry in the world globally  because it is so supported by policy and the state.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.  I was really pleased to see earlier today, Wired Magazine put out a review of the best  cheap phone plans.  What's the best, the number one overall?  Mint Mobile.  Well, we've known that for quite some time.  I mean, come on.  Anything Deadpool owns has got to be good.  Mint Mobile, you know, those big wireless providers, frankly, they're just out to take  you for a ride.  Mint Mobile is the same quality nationwide service built on the nation's largest 5G  network.  I think you know who that is.  They're kind of magenta colored.  They come with unlimited talk and text and high speed data.  And now they have a new modern family plan.  They've decided to shake up the wireless industry with their brand new modern family plan.  Mint Mobile, each line starts at 15 bucks a month.  You only need two lines to get started.  No matter how big or small your family is, you're going to save on your wireless service.  Just 15 bucks a month.  Actually, Wired says start with the 4G plan, the 15 buck a month plan.  It's a great deal.  And Mint Mobile gives you the best rate whether you're buying for one or a family.  A Mint family started two lines.  Again, all lines come with unlimited talk and text.  And then you, you know, you buy the plan that gives you the data you think you're going  to need.  Check your current cell phone bill.  After you practically pass out when you see the bottom line, check how much data you used  last month.  Now you'll know which Mint Mobile plan to pick.  And it's going to be, you know, like a third.  In my case, it's like a, let's see, I pay for the same exact service, 90 bucks a month.  Mint Mobile 15.  Okay, whatever.  I can't do the math.  It's a lot less.  It's a sixth as much.  You can bring your own phone.  Mint Mobile will send you a SIM for free.  Keep your contacts.  Keep your phone number if you want.  You could port it over.  They also sell phones.  I have my iPhone SE is a Mint Mobile phone I got from them.  It was 15 bucks a month and then 15 bucks a month.  So the service for 30 bucks.  I had a brand new phone and great service.  That's the four gigs plan.  They got a 10 gig plan.  They got a 15 gig plan.  They got an unlimited plan and they got family plans.  How does Mint Mobile do it?  They don't have stores.  It's entirely online.  So they're really passing the savings right along to you.  Switch to Mint Mobile.  Get premium wireless service.  The best, according to Wired Magazine, isn't that funny?  Wired reviewing wireless, just 15 bucks a month.  Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month, including the modern family plan.  Go to MintMobile.com slash twit.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Got your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile.  Appreciate everything you've done.  I'm a happy Mint Mobile customer.  Now let's take a look back at the week that was watch.  We didn't see anything about AR.  No, Reality OS.  No AR.  That's very interesting.  But we did get a little hint that Apple probably is working on a car.  Oh yeah.  Because that description of CarPlay showed an imagined interface.  It looked to me like Apple saying, see, we could do a car interface.

Start time: 7953.98

We haven't mentioned Elon Musk at all.  The Week in Musk?  The Week in Elon?  This Week in Musk.  We almost started that show.  I wish we did have to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I don't know what the latest is.  Twitter's telling him you have to buy us.  Elon's saying, but I don't want to buy us.  I was doing it for the memes.

Transcript:  Can I ask you a question, Leo?  Yeah.  Could it be possible that he's like Moon Knight where the spaceship Elon is incredibly sane,  incredibly concentrated, but then the Tesla Elon is a complete weird social engineering  hack, meme lord, edgelord personality, and he's not aware of both of them?  Because he'll post a memo about you have to be in the office 40 hours a week and then  post his video game play, which is like 18 hours of video games.  It just seems like there's a disconnect there.  Maybe multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Twitter's response to Elon because Elon says, I'm not going to buy you until  I know exactly how many bots, spam bots there are on Twitter.  And so Twitter says it's kind of the equivalent of paying your PG&E, your power bill in pay.  Yeah.  They said, well, OK, here's the fire hose.  Enjoy.

No, we don't need inspections.  Fine.  No questions asked.  No questions asked.  And then you say, oh, by the way, I don't want to buy until I have some inspections.  I don't like the color of the carpets.  That's not what that's not how it works.  Anyway, the fire hose is half a billion tweets a day.  Elon, though, in Twitter said, oh, that's nothing.  It'd fit on a 50 gig hard drive, which I think is wrong.  But I don't.

End time: 8222.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're on mute.  There we go.  There we go. Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean, first of all, you have to acknowledge that Musk is one of the great tweeters.  He's up there with with Trump.  I mean, he knows how to be succinct and funny and twist the knife.  But I'm really tired of it.  Yeah. Who is it?  Everybody else is too.

Start time: 8222.82
End time: 8248.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Who isn't?  Now, I have to say, in a way, if you watch the the congressional testimony, the January  16th committee, they're using Trump's Twitter to hang him.  Yeah.  So in a way, I'm glad that he wasn't banned from Twitter because that's where you got  to peek into the mind of Trump.  Are we getting a peek into the mind of Musk?

Transcript:  This is why they don't let CEOs tweet like Steve Jobs never tweeted.  But can you imagine what that would have been?  Or the CEOs of RIM Blackberry back in the day, they said the weirdest things on microphones,  but PR learned to keep them away from microphones.  They were all sorts of really zany CEOs out there, but just their marketing team, their  product teams don't let them near a mic or Twitter.  In this case, he's like full on Elon, right on right for everybody.

Start time: 8271.74
End time: 8279.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 8279.80
End time: 8291.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I never thought about that.  But there is some thought that the reason Steve died is because he didn't seek conventional  treatment for his pancreatic cancer.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Had he pursued aggressive standard medical treatment, he might have been saved.  And remember, he went on an apple diet for a while.  I think there's a point there.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  Steve Jobs has said, oh, don't get a vaccine.

Start time: 8310.84
End time: 8322.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't let him on Twitter.  We're seeing a little bit into the mind of Elon Musk, which we would think he would be  a completely respectable and normal CEO if Twitter didn't exist.

Transcript:  Thank God for Twitter, right?  Twitter exposes all.  By the way, Trump was not banned for COVID misinformation.  Trump was banned for trying to undermine the constitutional government of the United States  of America.  It's a tradition.  So there's a slight difference there.  But there have been people banned for COVID misinformation.  So maybe Steve Jobs.

End time: 8359.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, one could argue I don't want to do away with Twitter.  I use it a lot and mostly still like it.  I think I like it less than I did a few years ago.  But if you want to talk about Trump, there wouldn't be a Trump without Twitter, I don't think.

End time: 8374.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you might be right.  It certainly helps him get elected and Facebook too.  Yeah.  Maybe if Thomas Edison and Henry Ford had Twitter, we'd have known what schmucks they were.  Oh, we do.  We actually do.  I'm sure.  It took a while though.  Yeah, it wasn't real time.  Yeah.

End time: 8416.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There would have been a lot of good things, but that's not the ones that make the headlines.  The headlines would have been when he's like, I mean, entertaining.  Oh, I don't think you should, you know, during this pandemic, the vaccines are too new.  I don't think you should take them there and test it.  And that's probably something he would have tweeted.  And that's when, you know, the S hits the F.

Transcript:  Talking about YouTube, there is a Australian comedian on YouTube who has been trolling  a former deputy premier of the New South Wales, John Barallaro, for some time.  His comedian, Jordan Shanks, has the Friendly Jordy's YouTube channel.  Now, I don't know anything about either party and I haven't seen the videos, but Google,  not the comedian, has been ordered to pay Barallaro $700,000 for not banding the Friendly Jordy's account.  Federal Court Justice Stephen Rares ruled that Barallaro had been left traumatized  by a campaign of rentless cyber-bullying by the comedian, Jordan Shanks.  He ruled that Google had failed to adhere to its own policies, did nothing to prevent  Shanks' hate speech, and ordered not, well, I guess Shanks had already settled with Barallaro  a few months ago and edited stuff and so forth.  But now Barallaro goes after Google and gets $715,000.

End time: 8536.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think one of the issues was that the suit was ongoing and there may have been already some,  you know, injunctions or things that were in place.  And what's the name of the channel? Funny Jordies?

Start time: 8537.34
End time: 8542.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was still posting after things had been established.  And I don't know.  I think if YouTube had gotten a legal decision to stop things, then they should have.  If they didn't, it seems strange that they should have guessed that they would have needed to ban that person,  even without having told so by the justice system.  That's weird.

Start time: 8574.82
End time: 8578.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the U.S., Section 230 would have prevented this lawsuit, right?  I think they would have stopped it cold.

Start time: 8580.44
End time: 8595.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, unless in the initial suit, the judge had determined that YouTube had a responsibility in this  and told them you should ban that YouTuber and, you know, close their account.  I don't think the government can tell a private...  I don't think that's what happened.

Start time: 8595.70
End time: 8604.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the First Amendment protects Google in that case.  The government cannot tell Google or Twitter, for that matter, who to take down or who to leave up.

Start time: 8604.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Well, we consider that the government in the U.S.

Start time: 8609.48
End time: 8616.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the U.S. is different than every other country with both the First Amendment and Section 230.  It gives them broad sweeping of energy.

Start time: 8616.70
End time: 8624.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The First Amendment protects against all three branches, I think.  Well, it does say specifically Congress, so maybe it doesn't.  Actually, now I wish we had a lawyer. Denise Howell.

Start time: 8624.80
End time: 8642.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my understanding is that YouTube and Twitter, they are free to moderate as they want.  The government cannot tell them who to moderate and how to moderate.  And Section 230 means that they can't be sued.  They're not treated as the publisher.  They're treated as a conduit for the content.  So you have to sue the individual, not the platform.

Start time: 8642.94
End time: 8650.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's the question for everybody who doesn't like Section 230.  Do you prefer Australia's... this Australian ruling or do you prefer the way we do?

Start time: 8650.90

Start time: 8687.74
End time: 8692.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Companies are pretty good at taking it down though.  But you can't sue YouTube or Twitter.  It's a crime to take it down.

Start time: 8692.70
End time: 8704.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and if it's a crime, they're going to take it down.  Well, none of us are lawyers, but I think that's the way it works.  I think that's the First Amendment plus Section 230 would eliminate this...

Start time: 8704.70
End time: 8708.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just figured that they would be sued out of existence if they didn't give them that protection years and years ago.

Start time: 8708.90
End time: 8713.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want these companies to be able to moderate, without fear of getting sued.

Start time: 8714.14
End time: 8742.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, of course you do, but we're talking about something a little bit different here.  We're talking about something being litigated.  They're not responsible for what's happening on the platform, and we're not making them...  The legal system wouldn't make them responsible as in you would be... you could sue YouTube for that.  But I'm guessing there would be a reasonable argument to say the legal system can ask YouTube to take a video offline, for example.  And that's essentially what the government...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, God knows what happens to us. The Paddington the Bear people took this...  Oh yeah, copyright.  Copyright trumps anything.  I played on Wednesday, though I thought marvelous and beautiful video that they made for the Queen's platinum jubilee of the Queen and Paddington Bear having tea.  And then the crowd starts... the drums start playing Queen and she taps to the tea. I thought that was the cutest thing ever.  And of course you cannot watch that video on YouTube because it was taken down by the owners of the Paddington the Bear whatever.

Start time: 8782.70
End time: 8810.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the most frustrating thing about this is that I believe... maybe I'm wrong, but to this day I don't think you can just blur out or black out that section of the video.  That's being targeted by Content ID.  It would be so simple if you could just say, just take that bit out and don't take the whole video down.  It's worse than that. You can, but not when it's being claimed.

Start time: 8811.22
End time: 8818.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to release the claim before you can do that. You're unable to edit it.  Which is the worst of all solutions. You should be able to edit it while it's being claimed to remove the claim.

Start time: 8818.78
End time: 8826.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 8859.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's funny because I also played a clip from Demolition Man. Very brief.  And they also, the owners of that also complained. We appealed. We said fair use. And they said, oh yeah, okay.  But the Paddington the Bear people, they were ruthless. They've actually took it down.  The whole show?  Yeah, it's blocked on YouTube. Fortunately YouTube isn't that important for anything.  I don't know how many downloads we have.

Start time: 8860.86

Start time: 8890.08
End time: 8902.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's again, Section 230. YouTube doesn't want to put a hand in that gear.  They're like, we don't know. They say they have a claim. You figure it out.

Start time: 8903.02
End time: 8932.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their thing is they don't want, TikTok and YouTube have these licenses, mass license agreements with the companies,  but they're very hard to negotiate and they don't want to have something come to the head where they're no longer allowed to host music, for example.  Or host movies or all those things. So for them it's a huge contractual risk.  But there's movie channels all the time and people just have to get the claims every time. They're spurious every time.  They fight them every time. It must be so exhausting, but they just do it.

Transcript:  It's really funny. A lot of people lost a lot of money but with the crypto crash of the past few weeks,  I follow gaming a lot and one of the main crypto blockchain NFT games was called Axie Infinity  which is essentially a Pokemon ripoff.  Oh yes, that's right. I remember that.  Prices have plummeted and they have changed. Nobody wants to play it.  There was a really good article in... Oh God, I don't remember. Sorry.  It was funny. All the players who were playing a lot and breeding different hybrids of their axes  were saying, you know, it's fun enough but when I want to play for fun, I go play something else.  It is so out of... Like the people who promote crypto gaming are not familiar with games.  They do not understand why people play games. So it's very unsurprising.

Transcript:  The people behind crypto and NFT are kind of have blinders on.  The only thing they care about is promoting crypto and NFT. Oh, hey, there is some good news.  Though in the crypto world, the board ape that was stolen, Seth Green...  Thank God for Seth.  He got it back. Fred is back home, says Seth Green.  This ridiculous story demonstrates some of the things wrong with NFTs.  Fred Simeon is a board ape, a caricature of an ape smoking a cigarette with a little halo.  And for some reason, I don't really understand. Seth Green actually created an entire TV show  which he has pitched to that features Fred Simeon among others.  Unfortunately, he got hacked, he got fished and somebody stole Fred Simeon  and then sold it on to somebody else for $300,000.  Turns out, a Darkwing84, who is in fact, I believe, a surgeon from Australia.  Anyway, once he lost control of the ape, there was some concern that Seth Green had also lost the copyright.  And in fact, Darkwing84 aka Mr. Cheese could sue him if he made a cartoon.  So according to the wallets, it looks like Seth Green bought back Fred Simeon for $400,000  making Mr. Cheese a cool $100,000 profit.

Actually, Oppo, which I think it's rumored kind of spun off OnePlus, has now merged it back in.  Carl left.  I think, did he buy the IP of Essential, Andy Rubin's phone company?  This sounds a lot like the Essential announcement.  He has announced, he will announce the Nothing phone July 12th.  Carl Pei says, it's our first smartphone and our most important product.  This is the real start of Nothing's journey.  He named his company Nothing to make tech fun again.

Start time: 9513.20
End time: 9544.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So, yeah, I still say E3, but it's not really E3.  There's a journalist who's done a pretty good job at kind of hijacking the event week, kind of, called Jeff Keighley.  And he's doing the Summer Game Fest, which is just a federation with the name.  But ESA has said they want to come back with E3 next year with an in-person event, of course.  And then Keighley was saying, we'll do an in-person event as well next year.  So it's like the things are heating up.

Start time: 9545.70
End time: 9555.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it strikes me that E3 used COVID as an excuse because nobody was going to show up.  They lost Microsoft. They lost Sony. They lost Nintendo. There's no point.

Start time: 9557.88
End time: 9594.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is that E3 is a funding vehicle for the ESA, which is the trading body of the video gaming industry in the US.  And they need the money, of course. And so the booths are incredibly expensive.  And nobody, the people who are, I mean, the companies that are members of ESA don't want to pay for those booths.  Which is why maybe Keighley doing an in-person event, even if it's smaller, might have a chance because he's not going to charge as much as the ESA will, presumably.  We don't know. It's like billions. It's a riveting series that's happening before our eyes every year.

Start time: 9604.28
End time: 9626.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's that. And it's also the fact that PAX managed to get a bigger spot because all of the big boys and big girls are doing their own thing on the internet.  You know, Microsoft did a thing this morning, or not this morning, today. And just as everyone else, Nintendo, Sony, they just stream it and they don't need anything else.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny. You know, he just slaps the label on the other people's, on the other companies' conferences.  But, yeah, it isn't. But he is playing his cards very right. This year was a little bit lackluster because there was only, of the big, big publishers and developers, it was only Microsoft.  But yeah, he still is managing his thing very well. And it's really interesting because it's a content creator, essentially, who's taking on the ESA and he's managing to do it.  So it speaks to a lot of what's happening in other industries as well. It's really interesting.

But I have to say one thing that I learned from watching WWD on the rebound is if you watch the hand gestures of the Apple people, they've clearly been trained.  Oh, God, yes.  This is what they do at Apple University. And they also teach them if you're going to move from one side of the stage to the other, never break contact with the camera.

It's like he's the guy. He's now the guy for all the presentations, not to mention his magic elevator, his running in slow motion.  The memes, Leo.  The memes just keep on coming. Craig really shined at WWDC. So yeah, I agree with you, Philip. He's totally been media trained.  All of them. They all have the same gestures.  And Tim Cook was not much evident on the stage. I mean, I think Craig really took over that role as master of ceremonies, right?  And he got a three point basket too at the same time.  PED in his pride sweats. Look at that.
