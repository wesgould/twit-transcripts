Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when we'll talk about the event this week, Thursday, Google announced their...  This was kind of surprising.  I had to kind of remember this is their first Android Wear watch.  They've made Android Wear for years, but they finally made a watch to go with it.  They also announced the Pixel 7, which is just kind of the logical successor to the Pixel 6.  Talked a little bit about... I was surprised actually, a little bit about the tablet,  which they say won't come out until next year, and showed a kind of cool little feature of the tablet,  which is it will magnetically dock to what looks like a Nest speaker to turn it into a Nest Hub Max, kind of.  Your thoughts?  A couple of people said that the Google event was kind of sunambulistic, and it certainly is compared to...  Good word.  Yeah, do you like that? I made that up all by myself.  Compared to what Apple's kind of hyper frenetic show off things are, or even Samsung's,  Google seemed kind of, yeah, we got a phone. Here it is.  What do you think? Even Rick Osterloh, it's hard for him to kind of get excited, it felt like.

Start time: 423.68
End time: 496.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, maybe it was a jet lag, since it was in New York, maybe when everyone just kind of jet lagged,  and still kind of feel like they were on 5 a.m. California time.  But yeah, I mean, I feel like Google events generally tend to have this kind of feeling,  where there's maybe just that engineering earnestness, which maybe kind of bit sunambulistic. Is that what you said?  Yes, sleepwalkers.  Sleepwalkers. I don't know, I generally feel like the one thing I like is that they kind of just tell you about the product.  And I think as I get older, I get a little bit less patient with a lot of pizzazz and show and marketing.  And maybe that's also just because my day as an engineer, I just like literally just tell me what the cool stuff is,  tell me the specs, and then let me kind of get back to my day job.  But yeah, I mean, I actually was pretty excited.  While you were live streaming with my co-host Ron Richards for the actual show, I did preorder both the Pixel 7 and the Pixel Watch.  So it worked.  And so it worked. I mean, it's actually kind of interesting because I am not generally a wearable person.  I do have a fitness tracker, but I use a whoop. So it's kind of a very specific whoop.  Oh, yeah. I'm not wearing it right now.

Start time: 497.38
End time: 501.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. See, serious athletes use the whoop.

Start time: 502.32
End time: 539.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's all about data. There's no interface. There's no nothing.  It's just this like heart tracker that does. And their big thing is data, data science and everything like that.  So they're there. And it also has a subscription, by the way.  So but this is like pretty serious, but it does a lot of things that Fitbit does, like the sleep recovery workouts and things like that.  But I like it because, you know, it's focused.  I've never I used to use, I think, like a couple of the withings watches I had where I was for a while, but I think it didn't quite match my style.  And so I dropped it for a while when I found whoop, which is kind of like I'm a bit of a fitness nut and kind of like analytics.  I've seen your Instagram. I know.

Start time: 539.36
End time: 540.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very impressive.

Start time: 541.34
End time: 565.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa and Ant are like two of my like most consistent cheerleaders on Instagram.  So I love the Twitter fan for that. But I kind of like that this is so focused.  And what's really interesting to me is that I really like the whoop so much that the fact that this device is integrate with other things that normally I would drag a device on for not integrating with like Google Fit, kind of like other like popular fitness things.  Oh, my gosh. Yes, there's me.  There you are.

Start time: 566.14
End time: 569.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Start time: 576.44
End time: 591.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I actually haven't been that, you know, attracted or feeling the need for a smart watch.  But I think partly because I do all about Android.  Yeah, I'm into running a lot right now.  Oh, my God.  This is so embarrassing.  But hey, there's Lisa.  Right.  Lisa liking me.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 592.08
End time: 597.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I would like you.  But it would look like I was macking on you.  So I just pretended I don't actually see these.

Start time: 671.53
End time: 679.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 681.23
End time: 702.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm with Ben on this.  I was back in the UK a couple of months ago.  My mom gave me my grandfather's watch.  I'm getting that thing restored and strapping it on.  That's neat.  It's just like I don't like smart devices.  I won't have them in the home.  I don't like the smart watch because I'm just a bit of a little light that way.  But yeah, an old fashioned watch.  Yeah, I'm going for that.

Start time: 703.68
End time: 716.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's one thing that these are never going to be heirlooms.  I mean, I'm never handing my I did.  OK, so when I got a new Apple watch a couple of years ago, I gave it to my son who promptly gave it to his girlfriend.  It is not it does not have the same cache.

Start time: 717.04
End time: 721.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has resale value.  You know?  That's the thing with technology over time.  It dies like a year later.

Start time: 722.36
End time: 723.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, well, that's old.

Start time: 724.20
End time: 742.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, you remember the the Apple the gold Apple watch when it first came out that they stopped supporting.  He is a thousand dollar edition.  Exactly.  You know, it's a slight way to tell us you've got too much money.  But I mean, at least Google is getting this right with a new smartphone extension policy.  But, you know, it's just yeah, that was a big deal.

Start time: 743.20
End time: 758.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And redundancy is ridiculous.  Day before or a couple of days before the Google event, it came out that, oh, if you have a Pixel 4, you just got your last update.  That that three year old phone is out of date.  It's done.  Thank goodness.  It still works perfect.

Start time: 759.45
End time: 759.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect.

Start time: 760.99
End time: 766.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, how frustrating is that?  This time they announced what, five years when?  Yeah, five years.

Start time: 767.00
End time: 798.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, three years for OS updates and then five years for security updates.  Which is all that matters, really.  A little better.  But compared to like iOS, where I think I looked it up, I mean, I'm not an expert on the iOS phone.  So you all can correct me if I'm wrong.  But I mean, even the iPhone 6 in 2014 is still getting 12 updates.  So yeah.  And then, of course, like Samsung is still eating.  Well, I was eating their lunch is a little bit extreme, but at least Samsung kind of recently committed to four years OS and five years security.  So Google just feels like they're just not keeping up.

Start time: 799.04
End time: 813.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're sleepwalking through the whole thing.  I saw a stat since 2015, they've only sold something like 27 million pixel phones, which sounds like a lot, you know, but it's less than the Apple or Samsung sells in a quarter.

Start time: 813.54
End time: 850.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just it feels like the battle lines are already really drawn now in the mobile phone market.  I remember like a decade ago, you know, covering like iPhone and Android launches.  It was like blow for blow.  Right.  A battle to the death between Apple and Google.  And now it's kind of like, OK, we have a status quo.  Apple is number one and then different Android players combined are number two.  And then can anyone even name a number three?  Everyone has tried.  No one has done it.  Well, Samsung, I consider part of the Android center, you know, and if you look at manufacturers and you look globally, if you look in the US, it's a little different.

Start time: 850.32
End time: 889.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you look globally, Samsung's number one.  Right.  And then Apple with the iPhone, probably some Chinese manufacturers next.  Google's way down the chart.  But Google, to me, what they what they kind of were establishing by getting making a watch, announcing kind of the more speaker stuff.  They talked a lot about the Google Assistant, some voice recognition on your phone and so forth is the ecosystem play.  And that's what I took away from this is that it is now there are now three ecosystems.  There's Samsung, there's Google and there's Apple and Google wants to play in that game.

Start time: 890.60
End time: 911.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to say I'd add Amazon into that because, you know, I don't have a phone.  They don't have a watch.  They don't have a phone.  They don't have a watch, but they do have the data.  And I think looking, looking, looking at Amazon.  Which would you rather have?  Yeah, looking at Amazon's recent plays, they're not going for the hardware side of it necessarily other than the home assistance.

Start time: 911.80
End time: 925.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the robot, the iRobot Vacuum Cleaner, which I think now they're saying is I suspect maybe a little bit in jeopardy because of regulatory issues.  How interesting.  Yeah, you're right.  Amazon has the data.  But I mean, this is to me.

Start time: 927.77
End time: 929.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When it comes to day to day handsets.  Yes, you're right.

Start time: 930.12
End time: 957.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But well, then this is why I think Google has a hard time because I think normal people, I don't know.  I don't know any.  But if I knew some normal people, well, you know, they say, OK, I could get a Samsung.  I could get an Apple or I could get a Google almost.  I would guess universally say you bet the Google.  They're going to spy on you.  And I think Apple's really trying to create that environment where they go, you want a privacy, you want security.  Don't go with those guys.

Start time: 958.18
End time: 966.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but Apple are being utter hypocrites about it.  It's not necessarily true.  Yeah, we're all about privacy.  Should have a little asterisk there saying offer does not apply in China.  Right.

Start time: 967.06
End time: 973.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I mean, anywhere else, they're doing ads now.  I mean, Apple has plenty of first party data.  There's no lack of it.

Start time: 973.98
End time: 989.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have done incredible branding around like its market, privacy and the yeah.  And like opting out.  And those are good things.  But there is definitely still.  Yeah, they want to do more ads.  They're, you know, taking away market share specifically from Metta.  That is the one who's really getting punched in the face because of it.

Start time: 990.40
End time: 993.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Metta does not have an ecosystem play for sure.

Start time: 995.17
End time: 1020.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oculus is what is been their go for it.  But we're not yet at the point and we never may never be at the point where VR headsets or even AR headsets are anywhere close to mainstream to the phone.  You know, Mark made that bet years ago that he could build a whole new hardware ecosystem and it hasn't panned out yet.  But what other choice did he have?  He saw what was going to happen with Apple years ahead, but there was almost nothing he could do.

Start time: 1021.36
End time: 1024.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't do a Facebook phone.  Amazon tried and failed.

Start time: 1025.00
End time: 1041.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tried to do a Facebook phone.  I was there.  It was like an HTC phone.  I was there for the launch event and it flopped.  And it's the same thing.  Amazon tried to phone and it flopped.  There's just a whole pile of flopped phones.  I'm sure we could find like there's got to be museums.  Just flop phones that fail.

Start time: 1041.20
End time: 1068.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Throw the Microsoft Kin in that pile.  And you'll.  Oh, yeah.  So does it make what I'm saying?  Is it makes sense that there are right now three big eco?  Yes, there's a huge market for cheap Android handsets.  But among the premium buyers and the premium phones, there's three ecosystems, Samsung, Google and Apple.  When do you think Google has a perception problem?

Start time: 1071.31
End time: 1191.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they have.  I think they're trying to figure out how to find a niche.  So with Apple and with Samsung, right, they kind of have like the big three devices that we tend to think of.  So Apple with its amazing kind of integrated ecosystem.  You have a watch, you have a phone and you have a tablet, right?  All kind of like super well integrated.  And I think Samsung is kind of competing and is in more position to compete with Apple because of their market share, right?  With a watch, a tablet and a successful phone.  And I think I can't help it.  Google must know that there's no way that they're going to ever catch up to Samsung.  It just does not make sense with Samsung kind of already being ingrained as like the reason that Android is the number one mobile operating system in the world.  And just their market share and just the fact that, you know, they got in there early with like kind of going through carriers.  I just don't think there's any chance for Google to conceivably compete with them and to get to the level where Samsung and Apple is.  But I think kind of going to what Ian said, I think maybe they need to shift their ecosystem a bit and kind of with the home and the Pixel tablet,  and especially with the Pixel tablet, not necessarily being an iPad or an S8 tab kind of level where the footwear, you know,  there's a lot of appeal to media productivity, you know, kind of high in creators where it's more of a home device.  And maybe and that's where kind of maybe the Venn diagram of ecosystems kind of starts to circle with Amazon is like maybe they're trying to make their ecosystem  something a little bit unique because I just feel like they kind of were in this space and it's like, huh, yeah, the numbers aren't working out.  So what can we leverage? What are our strengths that we can kind of make our ecosystem a thing and actually have it be successful?  I don't know if it's a perception problem. I think it's like they're in a weird spot.  Like because Lord knows Google has been begging developers, third party developers to make amazing flagship, like showcase large screen apps.  And we're not doing it like that's like a whole other rant aside about that was another pitch when they're talking about the tablet is, oh, and we've been working for years to get developers to do tablets.

Start time: 1192.08
End time: 1195.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why tablets have never succeeded. They just don't have the apps.

Start time: 1198.34
End time: 1208.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a chicken and egg problem. And like, you know, back when I think around honeycomb time when tablets first came out, people were really excited.  Honeycomb was a tablet. It was. I had some of them. Yeah.

Start time: 1209.34
End time: 1218.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have my next. So many dead Android tablets around the house.  Actually, you know, I've got two Google Glasses. What was the seven inch tablet that Google did? That was the next seven.

Start time: 1219.08
End time: 1229.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Because not that Google's close to death store Facebook, maybe, but not Google.  But they and that's only because they make so much money in search that they can fritter it away.  This money out. Yeah. There's a there's a branding thing.

Transcript:  I don't trust them. Yeah. Google really missed a trick on this one because you remember when the first Nexus phones came out, they were the stripped down Android operating system.  No, no bloatware. Nothing else. Yeah. But I don't know if real people love them.  Yeah. But I mean, if you get a Samsung phone, it's got so much crap where on the horrible cannot remove.  And people love it. That couldn't they could have made that a unique selling point for the for the Nexus and then the pixel.  But then they decided, right, let's check out the pixel price and put a skin on Android.  And they haven't really decided what they wanted to do with it. It was just like, be like Apple, just be like Apple and get people to pay a lot of money.  To some degree, that's not going to work. Samsung's the anti Apple.

Transcript:  I think a lot of Samsung owners are actually buying it because it thumbs its nose at Apple.  It's certainly that's their ad campaigns, right? Even today, they still do ad campaigns mocking, you know, that I've been seeing this ad where the woman's on the bus with in love with her iPhone.  And then she sees the flip phone and then everything and she has to have it.

Start time: 1347.66
End time: 1382.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But seriously, that's that's how Samsung, I think, sees itself.  And I think probably that's market research says, at least in the U.S., the people by Samsung are buying it because they don't want an Apple phone.  They want something of perceived similar quality and value.  And yeah, you and I noticed that there's two different messaging apps with the same name, that there's two different everything apps, browsers, everything.  But we noticed it. But I don't think normal. I think normal people love their Samsung's.  Every time I meet somebody who has a Samsung, they love their Samsung's.

Transcript:  I have to admit, I've actually been using a Z Fold 4.  See, see, see.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. OK. So I actually so so I've actually had a very long and I think a lot of Android data developers have a long love.  Well, not even love, hate relationship with Samsung.  And a lot of that has to do with with Samsung and their custom flavor of Android and it not kind of conforming to stock Android.  So I think so my view is incredibly skewed by being an Android dev because deving for quote just stock Android is the easiest and most straightforward thing.  Samsung ruins our day half the time with kind of these weird bugs.  And then so around June or July, I dropped my Pixel 6 Pixel 6 Pro on my sister's ceramic floor and it cracked.  So I had a Pixel. Yeah, it was not. It was that sound, you know, when it drops and you hear it.  I told you like, oh, this is going to be expensive.  And then you look at it. OK. So I actually had a full fold Z Z Fold 3 that I got from a Google thing.  And I was like, well, crap, I don't have any other option.  I started using it and specifically with a foldable.  And I I kind of had to deal with it because you got to get something something about the Google care or something with Pixel 6.  But I kind of get it now.  I do. And a friend of mine who works at Tonal, Gabriel, what once told me, like, look, if you kind of get past the bloatware,  if you start really put the effort into setting up a Samsung, you'll love it.  And I think Michelle Raman, who is also a co-host on all about Android, has said that, you know, Samsung is great for power users.  So once once you get to that initial set up period, there's a lot that a power user can do with Samsung.  And I totally get it.  I kind of feel like I'm betraying my Android native brethren a little bit, but I can see why people end up liking these phones.  And certainly in terms of the hardware, especially this foldable device, I get it.

Aficionados go, oh, yeah, once you get that and Bixby ain't so bad.  Look, I'm able to use it and it does great things.  Once you get to that point, you've invested Bixby ain't so bad.

And I do think that this is that Samsung aficionado speaking.  People buy into it.  It's the Ikea fact.  Right. People look Ikea furniture is a miserable experience.

It is for power users and power users do love the thing.  That's why they love it. Yeah.  Yeah. It has a place that Google has not been able to find that niche, which I feel like is the conclusion that we've all come to.  And I hope they figure out a specific niche.  It's not like that they don't have their fans, though, and that they're not people are not buying it.  But I can't see a big moving market share.

But because I like the pure Android experience.  But we live in a bubble.  It's very clear we're in a bubble.  Yeah, this is it.  We think everybody loves a Pixel 6.  Nobody even knows it exists.

They built an ecosystem where people want to go and build the things there first.  And then Samsung built an ecosystem where everyone like builds everything else.  It's just you can only build for one or two things.  And if you hit those two, you hit almost everybody.  And you can just do most of the work for Samsung and then, you know, a little bit of additional work.  And it goes over to Google because it is they're both.  I mean, honestly, the Zions territory.

It's kind of the anti Apple.  Same thing with Mary Jo Foley on our Windows Weekly show hates Apple has a Pixel six.  They they honestly I think Apple just sucks you in and you it's hard to get out.  That's the that's the point of an ecosystem play.  Right. Lock in. Right.  And once you make a choice, I wish I mean, the ideal world would be everything be open and interrupt operate.  And you could choose the best watch.  You could choose the best earbuds.  You could use the best phone, the best laptop.  And it would all work together, but it doesn't.  It doesn't work that way.  You get the phone, then you kind of want the watch.  You cannot go.  You cannot leave.  Am I right?  We're also we're also at the point.  Yeah.  That we're at the point where, you know, parents are like in Dr.  D, their kids in two years.  And they're like, oh, I'm going to go to the doctor.  I'm going to go to the doctor.

By the way, most fifth graders, sixth graders in affluent areas anyway have phones now because  it's the it's how you keep track of your kid.  Right.  It's how you how you know they can call for a ride or you know where they are.  And the school said, no, you can't.  I must have been some hippie school.  No, you can't have an iPhone.

Wasn't there a memo?  This is a discovery and we're going to talk about discovery and the problems with court  cases discovery in a bit.  Discovery can be a nightmare for these companies.  And the Epic Apple event, this court action, which Apple won hands down, but they lost  in discovery because an email came out, I think it was from Craig Federighi or Eddie  Kew saying, we can't put messages on Android because then parents would buy and cheap Android  phones for their kids.

Back in my day, my mom gave me a watch and said, if you're not back by 5pm, I'm going  out looking for you.  It will be bad for you.  That was the 80s version of an iPhone.  I was going to say, this is not the world we're living in right now.  I can understand Apple's point because obviously they want to shift hardware.  These kind of child tracking things are incredibly popular.  They're also, as I've learned after looking into it, incredibly insecure.  If you're buying a kid tracker with Android, you are trusting that a third party manufacturer  has not just copied a software stack and isn't updating it and you could just be leaving  this wide open.  There are real problems with these kind of things in terms of you might think you're  making your kids safer, but maybe you're not.

These are little kids, maybe 8 to 12, maybe a little older than 8, 10 to 12, 13.  They're all paying with their iPhones.  None of them have cash.

Yeah, you have to have every piece just to kind of be like table stakes in the game.  And I don't know, I feel like Wear OS has kind of been like, again, not dissimilar from  tablets, but I think a little more successful than large screen story has been like kind  of a weird space for Android and Google as a company.

Transcript:  You know, they don't want to be part of that Drake song or whatever.  They want to get bullied.  Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting because I think that Google, in a sense, like especially  as an Android developer, a lot of times we take a lot of cues from Google first party  apps for better or for worse.  And I think that, you know, for something like Wear, we kind of, and for large screens,  it's kind of hard to convince us to put time and effort into it.  Like, having a Wear app, having even a large screen version of the app takes additional  design and development time.  And so we often look to Google as like this kind of North Star, like, hey, look, y'all  really, really serious this time.  We promise you this time we're super serious about Wear OS and we're super serious about  large screens.  And so not saying that they're doing this for developers because I don't think so, but  I think that they need to put, you know, their toe in the water to make Wear OS successful  to kind of showcase maybe what it's about and what they can do.  And I don't know why that's important.  I keep thinking about this a lot, especially with questions about, you know, even like  the Pixel phone, like, you know, we're talking about whether they're ever going to catch  up and beat Samsung or Apple.  And to me, like, it's weird because I think the Pixel phone itself, even itself has kind  of a muddled identity, right?  Because...  Yeah, what is the Tensor 2?

They had a lot of amazing examples of like cross device and computation of photography  and you know, machine learning and like natural language and all that kind of stuff.  It's like they have all that, but they somehow still want to keep one foot in that in that  flagship box and create, you know, a high end phone that people want to talk about,  that reviewers want to review, that people like us want to talk about.

Google was consciously killing RSS that they didn't want an open standard that they  they so what they did is they made Google Reader to dominate and then killed it.  Like, let's put it out of its business, just as they did with XMPP.  They didn't want an open standard.  They wanted a standard they controlled.  And I think RCS is probably their attempt to control it.  And it's going to die, too, because it's I'm just frustrated with Google.

And I will submit and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago  that honestly, if it weren't the only thing they make money on is search and search ads.  And if it weren't for that, none of this would have flown.  They are now realizing that and killing stuff like Stadia.  They should they had no reasonable launch in the first place.  They had no expertise in gaming.  Ben Ben Thompson says basically that they kind of knew how networking,  you know, at cloud work.  So he says the business side of Stadia was lazy and stupid.

Transcript:  But not for them.  There's a lot. There's a lot going on there.  There's a lot to say about that.  I just want to point out that Google freaked out  because everybody thought the future of search was the Facebook social graph.  Remember that?  And so Google created Google Plus, another fine Google product.  Actually, to be honest, like most other Google products,  it was really good, but they couldn't.  They killed it.

Transcript:  It was great. I loved it.  So Google's flaw is not that they make bad products  because I think the Pixel 6 is a great product.  Pixel 7 is going to be a great product.  But they can't follow through.  There's something wrong.  Well, and there's there was one contention that the problem is  the mismatched incentives at Google.  And this you could blame Sundar Pichai for,  which is you get promotions at Google for coming up with a new product.  You don't get any support for supporting that product.  Google and that's why Google invents a lot of stuff.  And it all flops in the long run like Stadia  because they don't incent people to be on the, you know,  the team of the long term product.  They incent people to invent the next thing.

Start time: 2610.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a big problem at a lot of tech companies.  And I've been at large tech companies where that is exactly the case,  where, say, for example, you have a team and their job is to make,  you know, features that end up on like the front page of Gizmodo.  And then the rest of us, you have to do the hard work of keeping,  you know, a service or a software scalable, maintainable.  And all these very unsexy words don't get as much recognition.  So, yeah, the incentives are way off because when you move fast  and break things, someone got to fix it.  And so I totally agree.  And it's it's kind of messed up as someone who works on this side of it.  And presumably it also kind of results in kind of mixed business results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know. I think sometimes I think a lot of times it is structural.  And again, I am just an engineer.  So this is like the perspective from which I would say just an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the way you keep it going.  That's the way it feels at times.  And I think that, you know, a lot of times they think that,  especially in tech, a lot of people are chasing.  And I think that's exactly it is.  What is it that will get the verge and what is it that will get wired  and Gizmodo and will cause like a tweet to go viral?  And I think because of like the history of the way that tech has exploded,  that's still a a, you know, a bar of success.  And so I think a lot of companies tend to chase that quite a bit.  And it kind of seeps into like, you know, OK, ours and like  like goals and strategies.  And then it kind of trickles down to the fact where, you know,  like certain things that are not sexy, but that are really important for people  to, you know, to kind of for customers and for for users to be both happy  and, you know, safe and secure in your service and your software.  You know, don't get as much attention.  And I do agree that that that causes eventual issues in terms of incentives.  I mean, certainly I do.  And then and like speaking for certain people,  there are a lot of people on the Android team just want to shout out  that are very good at this kind of thing.  But I think when you have a big company, I've been at a couple of companies  that aren't just a product, but a family of products where things like  cross selling and like, you know, how do we integrate like this product  in this product like that?  Like Ron Richards on on Triple A always says, like the left hand  doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  And that that generally seems to be the case a lot.  And so all of that kind of gets mixed up.  And I feel like there's some lack of follow through because of all these  like different things going on and these like mismatched incentives.  So, yeah, a big tech. Yay.

Start time: 2762.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it may. I mean, honestly, as an engineer, I'm sure you know this.  It's much more fun to create a new product than to maintain legacy code.  And I and I'm sure that there are all sorts of incentives,  but that ultimately comes down to the leadership  countering that notion and saying, no, no, no.  It's really important that we make sure that our legacy products  are well maintained and work and perform because that's where we make our money.  And, you know, I know maybe you don't want to do this when,  but you've got to maintain your product.  That's leadership.  That's that's called good business.  That's called running the company properly.  And so ultimately comes down on Sundar Pichai's  shoulders and the executive team, I think.  Yeah, engineers are always going to want to invent.  That's I mean, I it's why I'm not a code monkey, because  I don't want to maintain legacy code.  I don't want to look at anybody's code base.  I want to do my stuff.

It just it just is more fun.  It depends on a whole bunch of things.  I it depends on your personality.  I really like the early part of building.  I also like, you know, building teams.

Transcript:  I think an awful lot.  I think a lot of the problems with Google have been because they've hired  far too many managers and not enough innovators.  Do you think it started with Eric Schmidt?  No, I mean, Schmidt was needed because otherwise Google wouldn't have been  the success it was without Larry.  Call it adult supervision.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that worked out.  Yeah, no, it worked out perfectly.  Yeah, well, not perfectly, but it worked out very well.  But Google stopped creating, you know, I mean, where where are the big announced?  I mean, do you remember when Gmail first launched?  It was a bombshell on the email front.  They launched it on April the 1st, which is a journalist we really resented  because it was like, is this an April Fool or not?  Is this another Google toilet internet or what?  Yeah, but I mean, that Android, the photos, the whole thing, it used to create things.  And right now, with the particularly with the, you know, the made by Google,  there's just like, hi, here's something which everyone else has been doing for a while.  And some minor software tweaks.  Yeah, yes. You know, I wasn't actually at the event, but I understand they did.  They've copied Apple's practice of having cheerleaders in the back of the room  who, you know, will woo every single event.  And it's just like once you've done that, you've lost your central tech argument.

But at the same time, it's really nice to have a head of state  who's not political, who's just there to kind of reassure people.  And she was very good at that.

I mean, we forget that the royal family can actually veto  legislation if it affects them personally.  And considering he owns Cornwall or owned Cornwall,  you know, that was a fairly wide remit.  But I don't know, his his first address was very well done.  I liked it. We'll see if he grows into the role.  As I say, the the very idea of a birth monarchy is just.

And now is a good time to mention, I think, Wealthfront.  Wealthfront's goal is to make building long term wealth,  long term underscore wealth easy,  offering both high yield savings and automated investing accounts  to do just that beautiful interface.  You'll love the app.  If the bank's keeping money, that could be yours.  If you're earning less than Wealthfront's 2.55 percent APY.  Yeah, find out what your savings account's getting.  It ain't that, I guarantee you.  Federal interest rates, of course, they're going up this year  and they're going to continue going up.  That means banks have been earning more on your savings.  Have their interest rates been going up?  No. According to the FDIC, the average US bank  has only raised their rates to 0.17 percent this year.  Do you hear that? Wealthfront's now offering their clients  a rate that's about 15 times higher.  And that's just the Wealthfront cash account.  Don't let your bank keep interest you could be earning.  Join nearly half a million people  or use Wealthfront to earn 15 times more  than the average US bank savings account.  It's easy to sign up.  You'll get unlimited transfers that are completely fee free,  up to $1 million in FDIC insurance through partner banks.  And get this, there are no account fees, no minimum balance.

And of course, why?  Because passengers have been publicly shaming Lufthansa  with the location of their lost bags.  It is better if you do not know where your bag is.  Lufthansa says, well, we don't ban them,  but you do have to take the battery out of them  before you put them in your bag.

I talked to pilots about when that first mobile phone ban came in.  I was talking to a pilot about it.  We know when someone's got their mobile phone on in the aircraft  because it's usually one of us.  You know, you can hear it. It doesn't interfere that badly.  This whole Lufthansa thing strikes me very much  of we don't want the PR problem rather than there's an actual  genuine physical danger here.

You're even just trying to track when it's going to go and get come in.  And so I had to do a disclosure years ago.  I sat on the Innovation Advisory Board of Lufthansa.  So this is fascinating for me. I have no context or anything.  So I will I will straight up say I am surprised that I'm doing this.  I will straight up say I am surprised that they're taking the stance.  It's definitely from probably a more conservative group of Lufthansa.  It is not the stance that I would take by any way, shape or form.

But also, I mean, my wife tried the air tag in the luggage thing on our last trip.  And it was actually quite stress inducing because we were sitting on the plane.  And she's like, this is still showing up as being in the terminal.  Where is my luggage? Where is my luggage right now?  And then when we landed, of course, it was all all right,  because it was just a delay from the actual signal getting through.  You don't want to pay too much attention to it.

It's a little it can be annoying.  And I had the same problem with bags.  You know, you you I keep an air tag in my bag and I will on Lufthansa.  Good luck finding it, Lufthansa.  But when you then get to the hotel and you go for a walk,  your phone says, you just left your bag behind.  And it's like I I'm sure there's a way to fix that.  I don't know. It's it's a little annoying.  I'm just saying. But also, if you've got travel,

They do have a word for it.  It's called fasciated.  It means someone who is incredibly smart in one or two areas  and an absolute idiot in others.  Fasciated. That's right.  Yeah. And I think my other favorite.  Yeah. I mean, also, after what he said about Ukraine,  it was just there's another German word, which is, I think,  Becherschaft, which is a face made for smacking.  And I think I think the Ukrainians would really feel feel that way.

Transcript:  And then that's the that's the deeper question.  We always ask this question about Donald Trump is like, what what is his motive?  And honestly, sometimes I do think Elon's playing 12 D chess.  It just he's doing it drunk or something.  He's doing it on Molly.  So this week, he wrote a letter saying, OK, OK, fine, I'll buy Twitter.  Uh, thereby putting the trial off for a month, also,  maybe more importantly, putting off his deposition,  which was scheduled for Thursday for another month.  Also ending discovery.  And then we were talking about discovery earlier discovery.  These trials, you might win, you might lose,  but they're almost always bad for the participants because stuff comes out.  That's embarrassing.  The text messages.

Transcript:  This is like, you know, I know.  OK, just a couple of things I have to say here.  One, like Elon's mindset, and you can see it through the text, is  he is never wrong.  And it's not like it's because everyone is fawning over him.  Right. And no one's really as kissers in his.

Transcript:  What do you say? I can carry your sword, boss or something like that.  He volunteered to be the CEO of Twitter, pestered Elon over and over again.  I remember Ben, you probably got this email.  I got the email.  Elon said, we're going to get together a consortium of investors to help Elon  buy Twitter and would you like to put some money in?  And Elon eventually had to say, and it's in these messages,  which did not get off. This is embarrassing.  Elon actually did not look like a doofus in these messages.  It was all the people  messaging him that looked like dopes, I guess.  But what's Elon, I think, was afraid of.  And I think that there's also a case to be made here.  There is evidence that Elon was talking before  the whistleblower.  Was talking with Peter's Zatko Mudge.  There is a message where he said, let's go to a more secure platform.  There are apparently some evidence they moved to Signal  and those messages have now been deleted.  But there might be a problem there with Elon talking to Mudge  before he blew the whistle, do you think,  that Elon doesn't want that to get out?

And none of us really want to go through that.  That is not a fun. Yeah, especially on Molly.  Whichever drug of your choice, you want to have your depositioned.  That is up to you.  And then and then you can keep on saying that in the jail cell.  But for Elon, you know, like he's he's stuck, you know, he's stuck.  He's going to have to buy it.  He's going to have to buy it.  Like, I'm sure he's trying to figure out every single way to like weasel out.  But I think the truth is that he's going to buy it  and then he's going to have that chip on his shoulder to try to prove everyone wrong.  Like, I can actually make this like worth more money  and I can implement what I'm saying.  And it won't break all of Twitter.

Transcript:  Well, he could have he could have kept the due diligence portions in  in that deal, and he didn't.  And that's part of what's screwing him over, because it had the due diligence portions.  He would have been able to get out after due diligence pieces.  He rushed it is like what he did, because it it felt  probably felt like he had to rush it.  And like, I get why he wants to own, you know, a central source of media.  But it is an over value.  It is an overvalued piece.  But be like, there's no way out.  And Twitter's not going to let him get out of it.  The shareholder is not going to let him get out of it.  I don't know. I cannot think of a way he gets out of it.  I'd be curious to see.  But I'm starting to already move on to like, what does Twitter look like?  Yeah. After he owns it.  Do you call it Musker? Do you send Musks?  Yeah. Is there going to?  You press Elon's head when you send a Musk.  I would. I would.  How do people feel about this?

I would guess they're not compelled, right, Brian?  Ben, they're not compelled to go through with it, or maybe they are.  They're looking at huge losses.  He has to convince the investor because if he doesn't get money from them,  he's selling a lot of Tesla stock.  That's going to be a big business problem going down the road.  So he has to convince investors.  He has the genius plan.  That's why he tweeted Twitter is what does he say?  Just accelerant for the everything app X the everything app.  So that's a great question, Ian, for when.  Why isn't there an everything app?  He's likening it to WeChat in China.  Why don't we have a WeChat in the US?  And could you make one?

Start time: 4304.64
End time: 4476.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, no, this is insane.  So I think part of it.  No, this is too easy.  No, no, sorry, sorry.  So I think it's totally missing a lot of things.  So just like a lot of other things, like kind of something  succeeding depends on a lot of different things, timing,  luck, just like a lot of different things.  And so I think I'm not really an expert.  So as far as I can tell, it's just an engineer is that, you know,  we chat, I think, grew organically, you know, as a chat app and like kind of just  like the kind of reflecting back on the whole RCS problem messages,  I messages, whatever is that, you know, chat is such an interesting, you know,  kind of function and like app category within our mobile space.  It kind of makes sense that WeChat is what it is because of this kind of organic  nature, especially with chat apps being very country like heavily country country  based, like outside of the US.  There are a lot of chat networks are by country.  So you like a cow talk in Korea, WeChat in China, Line in Japan.  And so especially given what I understand of like Chinese design and everything,  it kind of makes sense that, you know, they started with WeChat,  which was this kind of like great platform for communicating with everyone  over apps, kind of building on top of that.  And so in our country, we have a different we have this whole like plethora of chat  apps and as well, not to mention the other things that X is supposed to do,  like freaking finance transactions and purchasing like that.  That function has already been, you know, taken up by various things  like Venmo, Google Pay, cash, whatever you have.  And to, you know, and kind of like one of the problems facing app  developers in the year of our smartphone in 2022 is the fact that you already have  so much competition, so much like embedded, you know,  user bases that trying to come up with the new thing, just to plant whatever exists  is a is a hard challenge in any individual industry, in any individual segment,  any individual vertical, whatever you want to call it.  So the idea that Elon Musk is going to take Twitter, which is a social media  network or social network of, you know, its own very wide swath of problems,  political, sociological, security, everything else, and then build, you know,  the big app on top of it and get not just Twitter users to use all these things,  but try to bring average people that don't like Twitter or that aren't that  aren't kind of like doom scrolling every day to bring this on is is just is just  kind of fighting against that kind of internal entropy that people tend to have  with the things that they like.  It's like the IKEA problem.  Once you have something that works, it takes a lot for people to move on from that.  And so that is like kind of a lot of the problem that people are navigating  in the app space. So I don't see him replacing everything with X app.

And, you know, he was successful as a software founder with PayPal, of course.  I would not be I have make a prediction.  I would not be shocked if Elon put Twitter and X.com together  and turn it into some combination of Twitter plus like a financial app  and use Twitter as a basis for that.  Added some crypto go to it.  Will it succeed?  I don't think so. I think that's extraordinarily difficult.  But I think he's wanted to do something like this, actually, for a very long time,  at least the X.com thing. He wanted another shot at it.  Now he could use Twitter to go and like make another shot at it.  I can see that being what's in his head right now.

I mean, I, you know, it's hard enough to build one good financial app.  It's hard enough to build one secure chat app.  It's hard enough to do one thing.  And, you know, we've already talked about millions of examples, say,  for Google example, where even just individual products and kind of brand  and vision coherence is just it is apparently very hard, unsurprisingly.  So I don't it's just the technical  and like logistics of doing all of this in one app  and trying to supplant every other app is just insane.  I go as an engineer, I bet.

And one of the things from the tweets came through was that, you know,  several people were saying once you take over,  you can do a really good call of headcount because all the people  that don't like you are going to leave.  And that gives you an instant production, a headcount and sort of fixed costs.  But honestly, I just don't see it.  I really don't.  Which is a declining social network platform anyway.  Important with the older guard, but not with the younger.  Turning this into some kind of, you know, ex platform, which does everything.  It's fantasy land.

Here's Chris Anderson, the guy who does Ted talks.  Amidst all the sneering, I'd like to offer a prediction for how  the Elon Musk acquisition of Twitter will play out.  First of all, I think the deal will indeed go through now  backed by an impressive roster of co-investors.  Oh, get ready for some.  Next, the company will undoubtedly experience a period of significant turmoil.  Yes, there's a lot of change ahead.  Many won't like it, but it will gradually become clear.  That a lot of the changes are actually quite exciting.  First of all, fears of all content moderation being abandoned will prove unfounded.  I agree with Chris on that. You can't.  It just be make a cesspool.  It becomes 4chan if you don't keep content moderation going.  Instead, he says the algorithm will be adjusted to avoid giving  so much amplification to political divisiveness.  Is that is that the problem on Twitter?  He says the debate that matters is not about who is on or off the platform,  but what type of tweets get amplified.  If that can change, everything changes.  You know what's interesting in this?  We saw this in the messages to Elon to everybody  who's anybody in tech has an idea of what Twitter needs to survive.  What Twitter what you could do with Twitter.  And this is Chris Anderson's idea.  Next steps will be put into place to verify all human Twitter accounts.  That process will lay the basis for those accounts to be used  for transactions a la WeChat using a Twitter crypto coin.  Oh, boy. Or USD.  There will be crypto. There will be crypto.  You're right. There will be crypto.  For example, people may be offered paid subscriptions and receive usable tokens.  This could bring the company significant revenue plus create its own economy  on which goods and services can be transacted.  The sheer scale of Twitter can rapidly bring this to critical mass.  About a year from now, growing numbers of people will be attracted to Twitter slash X.  It will be far less prone to robo spam and algorithmic fueled outrage.  Instead, it will offer lots of new functionality.  There's plenty Elon can be legitimately criticized for his own use of Twitter.  Can seem ill advised.  He can give the impression of being more political than he is.  And there's no question there'll be many bumps along the way.  But this is the key point as a tech entrepreneur.  He is without peer in 2013.  No, no, no giggling.  Oh, shit.  In 2013, Chris Anderson goes on, I predicted he could become the world's  richest man within a decade check.  The next decade will be even more spectacular.  Fixing Twitter may be as hard a job as converting Teslas into robo taxis  and proving the viability of a monster rocket capable of taking humanity to Mars.  But within three years from today, I predict Elon will have accomplished all three.  To which Elon says, yeah, you're right.  He was very happy with his tweets.

They're at the forefront of innovation,  working with clients all over the world to bring technology to business,  to transform business.  But one thing I always love about WWT, they know business.  At the heart of WWT is this notion that your business strategy  and your execution go hand in hand.  And they're very aware of that.  So they work to support you in achieving your business goals  by using great technology.  And it all starts with their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center.  When the magazines got rid of their testing labs,  I remember the great Ziff Davis testing labs,  Worldwide Tech took over.  They built this amazing thing, started about 10 years ago.  It's a research and testing lab with half a billion dollars in equipment  from the leading OEMs, all the enterprise technologies.  I remember going to visit in St. Louis right before COVID,  we went out rack after rack, building after building  of some of the most amazing technology.  Why? Because, well, their engineers use it to build proofs of concept,  to pilot new programs, to design something for your business.  But now what's really cool, they offer to you access to this lab,  hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs,  featuring solutions that include technologies  representing all the stuff you want to know about,  the newest advances in cloud and security and networking,  primary and secondary storage, data analytics and AI,  DevOps and on and on and on.  So you can now get in there, test out products and solutions  before you go to market.  Yeah, the engineers and partners use it all the time,  but you can also use it.  Not only the labs, where you can access technical articles,  expert insights, demonstration videos, white papers,  other tools to help you stay up to date with the latest technology  and get ready for this.  It's free.  You don't even have to go to St. Louis.  It's a physical lab space, but it's virtualized.  You can visit it anywhere in the world,  any time of the day or night, 365 days a year.  All you have to do is join the ATC platform.  And by the way, while you're exploring the platform,  when we were out there, we did an event.  They do great events at WWT, and they have wonderful communities,  places to talk about, to learn about technology trends,  to hear the latest research and insights from experts.  It's a resource you've got to take advantage of.  Whatever your business needs, WWT, Worldwide Technology,  can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailored solutions  because WWT brings strategy and execution together  to make the new world happen for your business.  Learn more about WWT, the Advanced Technology Center.  Gain access to those resources free.  Again, free.  All you have to do is go to www.wt.com slash twit.

You get this sort of sharp uptake,  and then there's a long tail.  And then the next generation goes, that's boring.  That's the stuff the older generation uses.  Let's try something new.  And in the past, Facebook was able to buy up Instagram  and various competing products,  but it can't do that anymore.  And yeah, I agree with Ben.  I think TikTok is the next thing,  and TikTok will be taken over by something else eventually.  It's the competitive ecosystem  these products have to work in.  Let's ask a young person.

It was a great place for me to post photos.  I really liked that idea of sharing photos  with friends, family,  and eventually my larger social network.  It's not that so much anymore.  Do you still feel like Instagram fulfills you?

Start time: 5823.48
End time: 5843.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, but I think they're going to change  my opinion of it pretty soon.  Like I keep, yeah, and as Ian said,  like the flailing, the kind of introduction of Reels  was pretty ham-fisted and a little bit confusing.  Them adding more ads to make my, you know,  like the explore tab and like the feed even more confusing.  They're putting more ads in.

Start time: 5843.54

Start time: 5844.32
End time: 5856.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're putting more ads.  And also in places that you, you know, I kind of,  to be actually, to be perfectly frank,  I am actually a sucker for Instagram ads.  I'm a very good Instagram customer.  Oh God, yes.

Start time: 5856.54
End time: 5857.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're too good.

Start time: 5857.38
End time: 5902.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. They're too good.  Especially in the, when you're going through stories  and I'm just like, oh, what is that?  That's really awesome.  Or through your home feed.  That's amazing.  But I think they're starting to push it.  I think that the ads within the profile feed,  which is when you click through to an individual,  you know, user's feed and not the grid,  but when you actually are kind of like having a feed  of individual users, throwing ads in there  is absolutely ridiculous.  That's kind of a little bit experience breaking to me  and a little bit confusing.  You never want to confuse users.  And I sure as hell been confused as F quite recently.  And then also, I think, I don't know if this is like,  is that the Instagram stories where they're adding the,  what is the loop, the end of loop or the loop,  they're adding some kind of functionality to add looping ads.  They're called, so we have post loop ads.

Start time: 5902.42
End time: 5915.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four to 10 second skippable ads  and standalone video ads would play  after you watch your reel.  Yeah, just, you know.  I'm sure it makes sense from an ad sales perspective,

Start time: 5915.84
End time: 5916.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but for users, who wants that?

Start time: 5917.24
End time: 5950.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do that because most people  don't watch a reel only once.  Yeah. Right?  You watch it again and again, just like on TikTok.  You watch again and again.  So they figure if we put,  because normally a post-roll ad is like a throw away  because people have seen the video.  Why are they going to watch the ad?  But because on reels, you watch it again and again.  So the ideas are going to stick these four to 10 second ads  in between before you can watch it again.  Which means to me that maybe people might abandon.  And if you're a creator,  this might not be a good thing, right?

Start time: 5950.92
End time: 5983.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's just, you know, with TikTok,  you have like a better alternative as a creator  to going viral really quickly  to an audience you don't have access to.  And that really matters.  And I'm, you know, with the octane side of my life,  we work with a lot of people,  a lot of brands that do TikTok ads.  And they're really sophisticated.  Do they work as well as Instagram ads?  If you do it right,  they can work incredibly well for incredibly cheap.  Because there's still lots of time for arbitrage  because it's still not figured out by a lot of people.  But if you could like really nail the storytelling format.

Start time: 5983.88
End time: 6024.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good to get on the next platform before it gets big.  Before it gets expensive.  Yeah, before it gets expensive.  Yeah.  So,  I mean, yes, Instagram ads work,  but they work because they're part of the scroll  and the feed and they like another post.  And they're very clever because they don't put ad  until the bottom of the post.  So before you know it, you're looking at it  as if it's a post from your friends or family.  And I don't know, they also much better than,  well, I haven't used Facebook in a long time,  but I think they're much better than Facebook ads  and targeting you, right?  Because they seem to know exactly what I wanna buy it for  in the morning.

Start time: 6024.56
End time: 6138.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how it is.  Oh, it is creepy.  It's crazy. It is really creepy.  It's creepy how well Instagram knows me.  But I think that it's a limit  because they're in places where they're kind of acceptable,  where there's like a feed where, as you said,  I might think, oh, is this like a post  from this other creator that I'm listening to?  Oh no, this is very adjacent content.  It makes sense.  I get sucked in.  Oh shoot, I'm following this person now  and then buying their things in the Instagram shop.  That's fantastic.  Or it's in stories where kind of by nature of it,  you're kind of flipping through things  and like waiting for something to catch your attention.  And that's actually, I think a very decent spot for the ads  because especially if they're done well,  they really do catch attention and they feel not obtrusive  because of their skippability.  I don't know why.  I mean, I understand why that they're trying to offload  some of the lost revenue from Facebook onto Instagram,  but I just feel like it's kind of like a lot  of different things, I think, especially again,  with large companies with a lot of products  in order to kind of counterbalance products  that aren't going well,  they try to leverage the products  that are still doing half well.  And instead of really leveraging it well,  there's more just like putting an anchor on it  and like letting it slowly sink to the bottom,  slowly but surely.  So yeah, I don't see myself.  I mean, as much as I love Instagram  and I've personally, without getting too fluffy about it,  I've gotten a lot of benefit out of Instagram,  like creators, like fitness, makeup,  all that kind of stuff.  And of course, again, wildly susceptible to Instagram ads.  I don't think this is the way to go to offset.  And I think that trying to catch up and trying to play,  follow along with TikTok and whatever social network  comes up is a losing proposition.  It's just kind of, they're on the Titanic  and they're just kind of like got a little bucket  and they're just like, what's the word  for when you like bail out?  They're just like bailing out the Titanic  with about three dozen people  on their little Instagram ads.  Like somebody, okay, come on, come on, come on.  That is so visual.  That's loop, loop, loop.

Transcript:  It sounds like Ben, you pay attention to this space  pretty closely as part of your business.  So if you were advising somebody to buy ads these days,  is, are you telling them TikTok?

Start time: 6166.56
End time: 6263.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am definitely, like you have to diversify.  So last year, Apple released iOS 14.5 and iOS 15.  It made it possible for people to opt out of data tracking.  That is probably the single most consequential decision  to all of online advertising in the history of ever.  And any business that is heavily reliant  on online advertising, this is like e-commerce brands,  basically everyone, it really, really affected them.  Like conversion rates dropped by 40%  while the raw prices skyrocketed.  And so now it's a whole different era of strategy.  You have to experiment with new things.  And we've seen that the companies  that are experimenting with TikTok ads  and using that to bring new people traffic  are doing really well, but it's not this exact same.  You can't use the same stuff you used in Instagram  and bring it to TikTok.  TikTok is just a different kind of storytelling  and you have to warm them up a little bit more to buy  than say Instagram.  I feel like in Instagram, they are more ready to buy  just by the nature of the thing.  In TikTok, they're less ready to buy,  but you can really get them there.  You just have to really follow the format.  And like, I've seen people develop these  like super detailed cheats on how to do TikTok ads.  And they follow those to the letter and those work.  It's a crazy, wild west in other words  for everything right now.  This is why you're seeing just huge stock drops with meta,  huge stock drops with Snapchat and everything else.  And you're seeing like some social networks  have to be the beneficiary of even that turmoil.  And a TikTok is a beneficiary of that turmoil  because that's where audience is.

Transcript:  I vote we stop calling them social networks.  I think one of the things that's happening  is the old idea of, oh, it's a network of your friends,  your family, it's a social network  is giving way to that we're just watching TV.  They're creator networks, YouTube proof this, right?  People aren't going to YouTube  to keep up with friends and family.  They're there to watch content.  People go to TikTok to watch content.  So meta, which, you know, Instagram used to be  a social network, Facebook did too.  Both are moving more towards that creator space  where it's content you watch and you get engaged with.  Isn't that what's going on really?  Is the socials dying?

Transcript:  Just like.  You're so right.  It's actually funny because just two days ago,  Signal added stories to their beta.  So to your point about.  What is that all about?  What are they, what is that?  I was doing show prep and my husband and I were eating  like lunch and I look over and I'm like,  dude, do you have stories?  I don't know, I don't know.  I don't know.  And I'm like, dude, do you have stories  at the bottom of your signal?  Cause he's in the beta.  And it's, I mean, to your point though,  I think that's, I mean, it's kind of silly, right?  The idea that, oh my gosh, not everybody's doing stories  because Twitter added it with their,  I forgot what they called their version of stories, of course.  So it's kind of interesting though,  that maybe that is kind of a sense of where it's going  because maybe like because our social networks  have become so much more for better, for worse,  probably for worse, that people want that connection  with their friends and family,  that kind of old, like intimate, like, you know,  sharing stuff like that Facebook used to be,  that all these other networks used to be.  And maybe like the private chat apps were gonna pick it up  because yeah, now I'm like, oh, well, I can share  all my ridiculous like workout videos with my family now  on Signal.  Do you think that's why Signal's doing that?  I feel like it's-  I don't honestly know.  That's bizarre.  It's kind of silly, but it's unexpected.  It's a weird move.

Start time: 6466.40
End time: 6484.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it was a really weird flex for Signal  cause they were all about, under Moxie,  they were all about, you know, let's keep it pure,  let's keep it simple.  And now-  Moxie's gone, maybe that's just what happens.  I like the team that's gone in after him.  I just don't quite know what they're doing with this one.  Yeah.

We kind of, all of the tech savvy among us were kind of like,  I guess, auditioning different chat alternatives.  And I think weak Slack came up and everything like that.  But I think finally everyone settled on Signal.  So I actually don't mind because I think it's interesting  that a lot of my family,  and I don't know what that says about my particular bubble  or demographic or whatever,  but that a lot of my family just completely avoid,  probably for the best, Twitter and Instagram  and all that social media.  But we have Signal, so I don't know.  I might actually post a workout story to Signal  and see if my fam appreciates it.  I don't know, it could just then,  no one will ever say anything else,  just embarrassingly stop.

Transcript:  So we were actually talking about this yesterday,  and I think my husband made a really good point,  is that it's a really difficult thing  to do the Mario voice.  Hey, it's me, Mario.  So, exactly.  So either Chris Pratt is doing that voice  and being a bit offensive to Italian American folks,  or he's not doing the voice.  It would be a stereotype.  And people don't, yeah.  And then there's no fidelity there.  So honestly, he cannot win.  So I will probably watch and just try to not judge  Chris Pratt either way,  because honestly, that's a no-win situation for him.

There's a guy in the chat room said,  I used to love drugs, and then I became a pharmacist.  It really, I think it really, it can take the fun  out of something for you.  Ian Thompson is also here from the register.  Ben Parr, we're gonna ask you in a bit  about your new podcast.  I can't wait to hear about it.  First, I know you've been wanting to hear  about my mattress, so I gotta tell you about my 8 Sleep.  I love my 8 Sleep.  Our sponsor, 8 Sleep, makes both mattresses and covers.  So if you have a mattress you love, we did.  We got the Pod 2 Pro Cover, which goes over your mattress  and does an amazing thing.  It turns your bed into an amusement park, in effect.  It turns your bed into the most comfortable, cozy,  wonderful place in the world.  What does the 8 Sleep do that's different?  Well, it both heats and cools.  Okay, you ready for that?  It heats and cools.  It goes down as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  That's cool enough on a hot, hot summer night  when you're sweating.  You go to it and you just feel, oh, it's refreshing.  It's like, oh, I feel like I'm going for a dip.  It's wonderful.  Or as hot on a cold winter night as 110 degrees.  Toasty warm.  And that's what's so cool about the 8 Sleep.  It senses the temperature in your room.  It senses how you're sleeping.  And then it adjusts the temperature  to make you sleep better.  Good sleep is nature's general nurse.  It's the ultimate game changer.  We all are looking for it.  Still more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.  One of the number one reasons people don't sleep well,  they're hot at night, they're sweaty, they got covers.  This is so much better.  Fall asleep in record time.  Wake up refreshed and feeling great.  So the way I have it, and everybody's different.  In fact, with every 8 Sleep,  you can have two sides to the bed, right?  So Lisa likes her bed really nice and toasty warm.  I like it, and I think I would recommend this.  I start in the evening at about 10 o'clock  when I'm going to bed.  It's a little warm.  You know, it's a two on the 8 Sleep dial.  And then as I get into a deeper and deeper sleep,  the temperature go down and starts to cool  because that's kind of the natural way  your body goes into deep sleep.  And getting more of that critical deep sleep is so vital.  8 Sleep offers the only sleep technology  that dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed  to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature  for you and your body.  And then in the morning, my bed warms up again  and wakes me up.  They even have a little vibration alarm you can use,  but I don't even need that because it warms up  and I'm feeling good, I'm toasty and roasty.  And I jump out of bed going,  wow, that was a great night's sleep.  Clinical data shows 8 Sleep users experience  up to 19% increase in recovery,  up to 32% improvement in sleep quality,  up to 34% more deep sleep.  Those restorative deep sleep stages, 34% more deep sleep.  That's vital for physical recovery,  hormone regulation, mental clarity.  They just launched, and I think we got to get it.  We have the Pod 2 cover.  They launched the next generation, the new Pod 3,  which has double the amount of sensors,  so even more accurate sleep and health tracking.  You wake up in the morning and this bed is adjusting to you.  The sleep doctor will actually automatically adjust.  It's not magic, but it sure feels like it really  has made a difference in my life.  We've had ours almost a year now.  So we've been through winter and summer.  And I can tell you, it's just great.  And I'm excited as the temperatures start to cool off,  we're going to sleep so cozy this fall.  You can too.  8sleep.com slash twit, E-I-G-H-T, spell it out.  8sleep.com slash twit.  Sleep cozy this fall.  Save $150 to check out on the Pod.  8sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK,  and select countries in the EU and Australia.  8sleep.com slash twit.  You go there, you get $150 off at checkout on your new Pod.  I think you're going to love it.  It's transformed our experience of sleep.  Kevin Rose told me about it and was just raving about it  on a twit episode.  And he was on with Amy Webb and she got it.  And she's been raving about it.  So I had, you know, when your friends get it,  I had to get it and I am so happy we did.  Lisa loves it too.  8sleep.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support  for this week in tech.  So you may be wondering, you were mentioning  how you're hearing from President Biden a lot, Ian.  You may be wondering, you know, a couple of years ago,  didn't the FCC announced stir and shaken  and you weren't going to get as many robo calls  and you weren't going to get as many...  I'm sorry.  You weren't going to get as many text solicitations.

Transcript:  Well, they've heard from you, Ian, and they say,  oh, okay, we're going to finally crack down.  Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.  Actually, it's been hard.  They don't have, you know, there is a missing commissioner.  The Senate has blocked President Biden's choice  for the final FCC commissioner.  So they don't have a majority,  a democratic majority on there.  The chairman of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel is great.  She was a commissioner for a long time.  She's chair since Biden got inaugurated  and has been, I think, very good.  But it's been hard to get this solved.  Finally, the FCC says they are...  So the whole, let me explain how this works.  Stir and shaken are authentication techniques.  Stir is used on one side, I think the receiving side,  and shaken is used on the sending side.  And hand in hand, it means that a phone company,  your carrier, for instance, can authenticate  that a phone call is coming from the actual person  who's placing the call and from a real number,  not a number spoofing your area code and your exchange,  not a spoof call.  And that by itself, if you just said, for instance,  I only want to accept authenticated calls,  or your carrier said,  we'll only accept authenticated calls, would handle it.  Because of course, with the exception of political,  and free speech, First Amendment,  they can't stop the political calls,  but all the other calls they can bar.

The first stage was, if you don't have a facility,  if you're a telecom company without a building,  by the end of June, you were supposed to be,  no, you gotta do stir and shaken.  That hasn't happened.  Next year, even if you have a building,  you gotta do it.  The FCC says, at least today,  that they're gonna ban seven companies.

They got fined and this was,  I got the press releases,  this is a historic wheel,  and then actually went through the last financial data.  That's 11 hours' profit for them.  You know, this is an administrative cost.  And much said the same in Congress.  There is no...  You should start shifting to  charging people on revenue, not profit,  and then you'd start to see some really big changes.  Because until these financial, you know,  things bite, we're not gonna get anything better.  And RoboCalls is the perfect example.  We've been talking about this,  I've been writing about this for six years now,  and nothing gets done because there's money to be made.

And 75% of the time, my congressman was in the outside office  to where they are allowed to do phone calls to raise money.  And all he was doing was raising money,  because he had to.

And he kept getting texts like,  you got to pay your student loan, dude.  You can't.  And at the same time, you're the number one mega fan.  And for just another $50,  you too can meet with the president.  And it was mind-boggling how active...  This guy was receiving 20 or 30 text messages  from Republican candidates a day.  Obviously, he'd given money once they bite into that.  But the thing is, you can't stop that  because that's political.  And so the First Amendment protects that.  And so no matter what we do, no matter what the FCC does,  you're still gonna get robocalls from political candidates  and solicitations from political candidates and parties.  However, you shouldn't be getting...  Soon, you shouldn't be getting any more  car warranty robocalls or IRS robocalls.

To be careful, there are at least...  This is kind of stunning.  400 apps on iOS and Android in the Google Play Store  and the iOS App Store that purport to be  nice little helpful things like horoscopes and VPNs  and photo editors.  And really, they have very few features.  All they really do is say,  oh good, now log in with Facebook.  Because we're all used to that.  Log in with Facebook.

I mean, never ever criticize British food after this.  But yeah, Papa John's was using a technique  that Intel and various others have used.  I think a lot of websites do this though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, you have to opt in.

Transcript:  So it's session replay software,  which so of course a website knows you're there.  They know what you click  because the clicks are getting sent back.  But this software watches the mouse move,  watches what you type in, sends it all back.  If for instance, you order a pizza, then change your mind.  They still get what you typed in as an order.  A lot of sites-

Transcript:  I mean, Wynn, I don't know if you've been involved in this,  but this is very common in websites like heat mapping,  just to kind of get an idea of where people get lost,  what features are working, what features are never seen.  It's a normal process, I believe.

Start time: 8457.74
End time: 8563.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think about this.  So even on mobile, for example,  whenever you click a button,  whenever and what screen you click that button,  and I guess what options you pick in a radio group,  it's very common to send those events out.  So it's a spectrum, right?  So with the session logging,  it's like they have the play-by-play.  It's like a continuous amount of information  on exactly everything you're doing.  And normally the way I have done it,  and yes, I have implemented tracking events,  it's pretty common to see like, yeah, hot spots,  like what are people clicking  or people not clicking this new feature.  And so it's an interesting spectrum  because in regards to what I am used to doing for my job,  it takes someone on the product side  or some really smart data person to kind of take  these individual events, like, okay, they click this button  and then they click that button,  but then, and then try to piece that together, right?  It's more like in that case,  there's a lot of different pieces of the puzzle.  And then it's kind of like our job to put that puzzle together  and try to create like user behavior and patterns out of it.  Whereas this is just literally just like,  you know what I mean?  It's like being able to tell blow for blow  what a person is doing.  And so it's actually making me question it.  So at what point between the spectrum of,  we're recording exactly what the user is doing  to this kind of more puzzle PC,  like, you know, build your own like user adventure,  you know, style where it becomes unacceptable.  You know what I mean?  Like, and like at what point is it really obtrusive?  And granted, yeah, like people opt in,  but I think it's also, you know,  user understanding of what they have opted into.  So yeah, I mean, it's very common  and often a very important feedback loop  for like developers to know whether a feature,  whether a user interface,  whether something actually works.  And like,  there is a difference though,

Start time: 8564.16
End time: 8585.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  between collecting stuff that's typed,  even if it's never posted, right?  Yes.  In fact, I've seen companies getting trouble for that.  It's not at all uncommon if you fill in a web form  before you even submit that that information,  those keystrokes are sent back to the site.  And I think that's often considered a violation.  In any event, Papa John's is being sued for doing it.

Papa John's actually, I think it's a class action  or it's intended to be a class action.  They're trying for a class action suit, yeah.  They got a guy in San Diego.  But what's interesting is they accused Papa John  of violating the wire tap.  Yeah, that's a great headline.  It's fun.  And the California Invasion of Privacy Act.  So that will be interesting to see what happens with this.  I think a lot of these class action suits  are just lawyers looking for ways to supplement their income.

We've got to the stage where the first internet generation  who've grown up knowing nothing but the internet,  trust it by and large.  And you need that kind of requirement  to at least try and tell the truth  and try and tell people what you're taking.  Are you a fan of the cookie consent banner?  I know you hate it, Leo.  I know you hate it with a passion  that burns like a thousand suns, but I like it.  What? I like being able to choose what,  I will go through and say, no, you can't have that data.

Transcript:  Do you accept him tracking you?  Area Man is arrested for parody.  This is the first, I read, this is a sense of humor  coming through the New York Times, I have to say.  The Onion, so the Supreme Court docket,  this is first Monday in October,  the Supreme Court says what cases they're gonna be taking,  and they're argued, and then come June,  they'll tell us how they feel.  Quite a few of them will impact the internet,  Section 230, things like that.  But this one, I think, I hope, is a no-brainer.  A man was arrested when he put a parody  of his local police department on Facebook.  The Parma, Ohio area man spent four days in jail  over a Facebook page he created  that mocked his local police department.  He was charged with using a computer  to disrupt police functions.  A jury found him not guilty.  And he says his civil rights were violated.  He's trying to sue the city for damages.  A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit earlier this year  saying, I love this one, the police had qualified immunity.  That's, of course, the doctrine that lets police shoot you,  and not have to go to jail.  But apparently they can also arrest you  because you embarrassed them and annoyed them.  Appeals Court upheld the decision.  He took it to the Supreme Court there,  reviewing his request to take up the matter,  and The Onion decided they wanted to get involved.  And this is perhaps the funniest briefing  in all of Supreme Court history.  Have you guys read this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They hired somebody to, probably a lawyer, maybe not,  to really spend some energy on this one.  Let me pull up some of the highlights from this.  For instance, they call the Supreme Court justices  Latin wonks.  Their point, we should probably start with their point,  which is that parody does not need to announce itself.  That it's not even very good parody if you have to say  the following is parody.  As somebody who works for the register,  I think you probably agree with that.

Transcript:  We assume that people read us knowing  where we come from, but I mean, this is surely,  I mean, America loves to bill itself with,  we're free, we're free, we're so free,  with the land of the free, whatever.  But the very idea that criticizing  your local police department isn't,  in any, is unacceptable and should result  in four days in jail, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Argument number one from The Onion, let's not forget.  Parody functions by tricking people into thinking  that it is real.  Tu stoltus est, you are dumb.  These three Latin words have been The Onion's motto  and guiding light since it was founded in 1988  as America's finest news source.  The Onion's motto is central to this brief for two reasons.  First, it's Latin and The Onion knows  that the federal judiciary is staffed entirely  by total Latin dorks.  They quote Catullus in the original Latin in Chambers,  they sweetly whisper starry decisis  into their spouse's ears.  They mutter qui bono under their breath  while picking up after their neighbor's dogs.  So The Onion knew that unless it pointed  to a suitably Latin rallying cry,  its brief would be operating far outside  the court's vernacular.  And it goes on, it's great.

Transcript:  The lawyers that got to work on this probably had just  like the greatest time ever working on this.  And I'm like, look, this one has multiple purposes,  like so brilliant of The Onion.  One, like obviously now it's in the news.  Two, it's putting into the news this ridiculous case  that would have an impact on it  if it created more precedent.  And three, it's just hilarious.  Just the entire thing front to back.  Like lawyers can write really hilarious stuff  when they really want to.

And I got picked up by Forbes  and run as a legitimate news story.  And I put all the clues in there.  It was about a computer virus spreading through VCRs,  which resets the clock to flashing zeros.  And I even included a quote from Dr. April Una,  but Forbes ran with it.  And this was back when Forbes was actually quite serious  rather than the clickbait radical.  Now it wouldn't mean anything if they ran with it.  Oh yeah, no, now I mean it.  But this was 2006.  So it still had some credibility.

It doesn't mean that anyone else has to listen to your BS  or host you while you share it.  It doesn't shield you from criticism or consequences.  If you're yelled at, boycotted, have your show canceled,  or get banned from an internet community,  your free speech rights aren't being violated.

If you wanted to, could you build a drone  which could autonomously launch its weapons and kill people?  And the lab said, oh yeah, certainly.  Just give us the parameters, we can do that.  And he's like, no, no, no, you don't say that.  You say, obviously, that's something which  company people will be looking at,  but we would never do it ourselves.

We pledge, says Boston Dynamics,  we will not weaponize our advanced mobility,  general purpose robots,  or the software we develop that enables advanced robotics,  and we will not support others to do so.

And this stuff is gonna happen,  and how we deal with it is gonna be a bigger issue.  You think the same thing about,  God, we're going back to politics,  but tactical nukes is another example of a thing  where that's hard to stop,  and that's a thing that exists,  and it's easier and easier to make things like that  as time goes on.

She didn't disclose she was paid  a quarter of a million dollars for the hashtag.  And it turns out, and I did not know this,  but federal security law requires that any celebrity  or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security  has to disclose the nature, the source  and the amount of compensation they received.  So it's not enough to say hashtag add.  You have to say hashtag,  I was paid a quarter of a million dollars  to plug this bogus investment.  Wow.  So it cost her.

Transcript:  Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange,  confirmed Thursday's hackers stole.  Two million BNB tokens worth five hundred sixty eight million dollars.  Oh, my God. That's half more than half a billion dollars.  Blockchain security company Slow Mist.  Not a great name. If you if you want my opinion. Why?  Slow Mist says the attackers only managed to take about 110 million  because they suspended the BNB chain.  And so they, you know, they could only transfer that many before they got,  you know, they got shut down.  How the hell they only got a hundred million dollars in this.

Transcript:  Programmers are people.  And this is kind of like the point I always make where things like where  there's there's always like this whenever something new in technology gets open,  there's this Pandora's box and you cannot trust developers  to put a good lock on that box.  I think I kind of talked about this a little bit back in the show  when it came to like the Android version of air tags and things like this,  is that we're we're humans.  I mean, and you you're trusting us to write software for self-driving cars.  You're trusting us to write, you know, this very, you know, complicated  cryptographic, you know, and block chain technology.  We're still people.  And there's no such thing as bugless code.  And it's it's it's scary because it's to the degree  to what degree when you make a mistake, is it going to hurt people financially  or physically in the in the purchase of self-driving cars?  And so as and like I don't want to talk about the other person  that we agreed not to talk about anymore, but  as as clever as call them the Prince of Darkness.  It's OK. The Prince of Darkness.  And as clever and as intelligent and as technical as the Prince of Darkness  might be and other other engineers of that make, they're still human beings.  And being incredibly smart at one thing does not mean that you're incredibly good  at every other thing and every other corollary or ancillary  and adjacent thing that goes with it.  And we'll make mistakes. Absolutely.

Oh, the attacks, not the bridges. Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  The actual attacks and thefts.  A large proportion of this is propping up the North Korean nuclear program,  not actually feeding their citizens because they've got plenty of those.  But let's get the nukes done instead.

Transcript:  Oh, that's not that's actually not a good thing.  So, according to TechCrunch, cross-chain bridge hacks  have become a common occurrence in the past year.  So if you're coding a cross-chain bridge,  you might really want to think about getting it right.  In June, a hacker exploited a vulnerability to steal  100 million dollars from Harmony's Horizon Bridge.  In August, attackers drained 190 million dollars worth of crypto  from the Nomad Cross Chain Bridge.  And earlier this year, hackers stole 625 million dollars  following the attack on Axie Infinity's Ronin Bridge.

Well, OK, we do let banks do this stuff, but they've got better lobbyists.  But I mean, if you're a five-eye company and you're getting hacked this easily,  you shouldn't be in business.  You really shouldn't.  But this money is not going.  Yeah. Yeah.  Because it's the Wild West and no one wants to be seen to be anti-competitive.

So I guess he'll be sentenced at some later date.  He when the  Uber hack happened,  he arranged for the hackers to be paid  one hundred thousand dollars in Bitcoin so that they would sign  non-disclosure agreements so that no one should know of what has happened.

Transcript:  Yeah. And better that you get paid by the company or by Hacker One  than by Zerodium, who's going to give you a million bucks for the bug  and then sell it onto the Saudi government.  So much, much better that these companies pay these bug bounties, I think.

Transcript:  As a journalist, I have to say, pay not paying the Saudi government  to get me to cuss up with a bone saw is a pretty good idea.  Yeah, pretty, pretty good idea.  But the bug bounties are great on this.  But I'm curious, what does an as an Android developer?  Most people, it's most coders, it seems, when it comes to this sort of thing.  Would prefer to sell it to the company for a reasonable price  rather than go to someone at Zerodium. Is that correct?

Transcript:  I would think so.  I mean, if we assume that many developers have some sense of  responsibility and ethics towards consumers and  and the people that they're finding bug money for, for sure.  I would I would as though let's just be assuming good intentions.  Like, I would say yes.  But I don't know.  What's the quote from The Dark Knight?  Some people just want to watch the world.  But I mean, I really don't know.  I really do feel like there is a good legitimate business for bug bounties  and for developers, especially that are security experts.  But I mean, people are weird, man.  And I do.  I mean, this kind of reminds me of Uber's just having not a very good year  for security between this and then the social engineering attacking there.  But, you know, I I don't know.  I mean, I've never personally I'm not that is not my forte.  I've never really participated in any bug bounties.  But I can't help it.  So especially for repeat business and also kind of for a longevity of career  for bug bounties, you would want to be more of a legitimate actor.  But I don't know.  There's actually a don't trust us.

Transcript:  A fascinating story we talked about on Tuesday with Security Now.  There was a pretty severe  poisoning attack on the Akamai CDN.  And the  white hat hacker, Jacopo Taddeosi, who found it.  Didn't, you know, gave the bug to Akamai and hoped for a payout, right?  Hope for a bug bounty.  Akamai sent him a greeting card and a thank you, but no money.  So so it turns out there was a mitigation.  So they went to Akamai's customers and gave them the mitigation.  They end up making $50,000  in bug bounty because the companies were so grateful.  Not Akamai.  Akamai didn't even give him any swag.  But the companies were so grateful that they paid them.  He wrote, we are white hats, but we're still not willing to work for free.  This vulnerability was very critical.  Our skills are rare, complex and sought after.  We think they deserve to be valued.  So while Akamai was patching following our report, but not paying for it,  we chose to race against time by asking for bounties from single Akamai customers.  It actually worked out well for them.  So, you know, they got $25,000 from PayPal,  $14,000 from Airbnb, $4,000 from Hyatt Hotels.  Steam only gave him 750 bucks.  Cheapskates.  So Mada only $400.  But I love this one.  Goldman Sachs sent him a Franklin $100 bill.  That's it.

But that just shows you, you know, I think people like that who are responsible  white hat hackers, you got to give them a bug bounty.  Apple for years did not.  And then they realized that, oh, they're bad guys who are just selling this to  the Israeli company.  And, you know, what was the name of the Israeli company?  NSO Group.  Yeah, I forgot the name because they have they disbanded and started a new company.

I mean, there are companies who think that giving a t-shirt is an exposure is a good  response to someone finding a serious bug.  And it's like, yeah, does that t-shirt pay my mortgage?

And, you know, it seems companies have they're taking security very much end of life rather  than right at the start.

Transcript:  It depends, founder to founder.  I will say our co-founder CTO is very serious about it and made sure that there was a lot  of like there was a lot of additional security measures.  But even then, you know, like a smaller company can only invest so much when they have to  do a lot of other things.  It just it sort of depends and it depends a lot on the industry you're in.  Like if you are in fintech, you have to have that security because a breach early on could  kill your business.  So just like everything else, it's fine.  It's incentivized based off of like the financial incentivizations of the business.  But having an attack for certain businesses will kill you.  And for others, it won't.  And that kind of like like if you get hacked at your e-commerce that sells candles, like  you're not going to invest in that in the same way as a security crypto company or something.  Yeah.

Top VCs, a couple of Hollywood celebrities who built amazing businesses, people who've  sold their companies. The person coming on, I think, tomorrow sold his business for 200  million dollars. So super interesting people.  But we're getting lessons from them and then we're using that hopefully as a way for  everyone else to learn actual, actionable advice for like, how do you sell your company?  How do you start a company? How do you ideate?  And we'll go through things like, oh, we got to figure out email marketing.  Let's go get an expert. We got to go figure out PR.  We got to go get an expert.  Like the actual act of building a business as a mechanism to learn stuff.  And Greg and I have known each other for forever.

A little plug for Club Twit because it makes it possible for us to do so much more.  For instance, that interview we did last week with Cory Doctorow, Rebecca Giblin about his  new book Choke Point Capitalism.  New shows we've launched like This Week in Space coming out of the Club.  And there's shows in the Club that aren't yet public but are really great like  Micah Sargent's Hands on Macintosh, Paul Thuratt's Hands on Windows,  Jonathan Bennett's Untitled Linux Show, Stacey Higginbotham's Book Club,  The Giz Fizz with Dick DiBartolo.  Plus, of course, you get access to our Discord,  which is really a great place to hang out.  It's a real social network.  And the Twit Plus feed with material that just doesn't show up anywhere else.  All the shows ad free.  All of that.  Seven dollars a month.  Man, we're not charging enough.  It's really a good deal, I think.  And I want you to be in the Club.  Please go to twit.tv slash clubtwit and join us.  We would love to have you.  And thanks to all of our Club Twit members who make a lot of what we do possible.  Keep the lights on.  I think it's going to get harder and harder, to be honest.  And keep the lights on as we head into a recession.  Advertisers getting very, very skittish.  A lot of people sent me a link to a video from the Lincoln Project saying,  don't use TikTok.

Has affiliations with the Chinese government.  And whatever security measures they say there are don't really exist.  So you have to figure out how to work around that.  I mean, I guess you can also straight up ban it.  But I don't know what the consequences of that would be.  So yeah, I don't expect that anyone's going to be banning it.  The closest it could have been banned was last administration and they did not do it.  So it's not going to happen.

Remember the Saturday Night Live skit when they brought in influencers  to meet with the president to talk about the Ukraine situation.  They just did it again for the infrastructure.  I'm sorry, the Inflation Reduction Act, which actually was the infrastructure act.  Last month to mark the passage, 20 influencers, content creators with devoted  followings on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube came to the White House, met with the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in the Redge Carrizone. We've done it for 25 years.  And we punch well above our weight.  But in terms of plugging stuff, I would like to say an ex-Redge journo  who left us last year is now a director on Nominet  because he ran a number of serious articles  pointing out how they were trying to turn a domain,  a nonprofit domain into a profit center for private equity.  He exposed that. He's now been elected by the members.  So that is fantastic.

Start time: 12036.28
End time: 12040.40

Start time: 12040.48
End time: 12129.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it runs the dot dot co dot UK domain.  And it was one of those stories which really warmed the cockles of my heart  because everyone says journalism doesn't do anything anymore.  And the rest of it, Kieran spent four years researching this stuff,  this move from the domain used to run dot co dot UK as a nonprofit  and any excess profits went to charity.  Then a new bunch of people took over.  They wanted to make it to a profit center.  They set up a private equity firm to buy it.  They stopped doing charitable donations.  He reported on all of this.  Sadly, we lost him because he wanted to move back to the UK.  But he's now he was elected by the members  and now we're going to get some serious oversight.  But this is something that domain holders really need to watch out for  because private equity is moving into the sphere in a big way  because these are these are basically established industries.  If you're running a dot org, for example, or a dot co dot UK  or a specialized URL, you are tied into that.  You've been into it for 10, 15 years.  And when a company takes this over and says, right,  we're going to charge you 5% more each year for for what?  It's really good domain is easy.  So just watch out for this.  If you're running a domain and your domain is getting taken over,  vote, get involved, get sorted.
