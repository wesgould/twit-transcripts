We always love having Lou on. And boy, welcome back to our microphones. It's been a long time.  You may remember Alan Malventano from this week in computer hardware. He was a PC perspective, a storage expert.  He was my source for all things SSD for so many years.  Still are. You still are. Former submariner, submariner from the you were a Navy guy, right?  Yep.  And retired. USNRET. And he currently is working at Intel. You filed Ryan Shroud over there from PC perspective.  He's a storage technical analyst. And just like Lou, Alan's thoughts are his own.  He does not speak for Intel, but I'm glad they let you be on the show. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's that's that when they announced its tri X.  Was that the original name of the three cross point cross point?  That's right. It was three three D RAM.  And I remember when they announced it, we thought this is going to transform it.  In other words, it's it's basically an SSE.  It's fast enough to act as RAM or is it a RAM that's non-voluntary enough to act as an SSD?

Transcript:  And I see you have a bobblehead, which is me.  No, you don't. Oh, you have that.  I have the coaster. Who has the bobblehead?  You have the coaster. Who has the bobblehead?  Yeah. But I'm just glad because apparently the bobbleheads have been making it  to places other than, I don't know, places that we would like.  Here is an image of this is alive in Palm Desert.  Photographer thrift store junkie can't believe what I found in the thrift store.  The Leo bobblehead. But, you know, it is in pristine condition.  So worth a lot of money. I made a mistake.  I should have made NFTs, not bobbleheads.  There was my mistake.  All right. Let's start with the hacking because you're here, Alan.  Tell me what your hacking credentials are.

Transcript:  Leo discovered it might be one of the best spittakes Leo ever did on a twit  because it caught him right when he was drinking.  Is that what you had? Did you know I was in the NSA there, buddy?

Start time: 402.68
End time: 406.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I didn't do was that pre-Navy or was that part of your naval service?

Start time: 407.40
End time: 409.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Part of that's related. OK.

Start time: 409.94
End time: 444.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Because there's NSA commands that are joint service commands  where you'll have all the other branches of the military.  They'll come and they'll join some civilian folk that work,  you know, they'll work alongside the civilians that work at the NSA.  Wow. Wow. So my job there was well, you're an analyst.  I did the NSA job.  I was in Virginia and I was doing network defense there.  Oh, wow. Well, then that wasn't NSA, but that was still network  related and like hacking related.  But then, yeah, the NSA side,  they do some more offensive, I will say, things, of course.  But when I was there, I reverse engineered malware.

Start time: 446.00
End time: 491.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're still kind of we've been talking.  I mean, look, we talk about, you know, security all the time,  not just in security now, it's a common subject.  But it's really become a hot topic since the Russian invasion of Ukraine  because and there's a lot of speculation about this.  I think many of us thought Russia would use their cyber warfare  capabilities initially against Ukraine.  There were some at the beginning of the invasion.  They shut some things down, which came right back online,  including the financial system and some satellite reconnaissance systems.  But then we've also been worried a little bit about cyber warfare attacks  in retaliation for sanctions against the West, especially in the US.  None of this really has panned out.  What is your sense of it, Alan? Is it?

Start time: 492.38
End time: 494.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it? I have a theory. Yeah.

Start time: 496.42
End time: 571.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So part of the job that I was doing when I was there was reverse engineering malware.  Well, where do we get the malware?  We get it when one country, a attacks country B.  And then we see it.  And then what do we do?  We pick it apart and we figure out how to defend against it.  Right. How do we protect us being the United States from,  you know, those other foreign countries who might happen to be fighting  amongst themselves at the time. Right.  But then we can learn from that and protect ourselves using that information.  Right. So I have a suspicion that either Russia just didn't have,  you know, they're not up to snuff on their hacking ability.  Maybe it's sort of in line with their, you know, other abilities.  Their military capability seems like, yeah, it seems like they haven't been panning out that well.  That's option A. Option B is they don't want to play their hand. Right.  If they do have those exploits that they know that people can't yet defend against,  why would you lay them all on the table, you know, against Ukraine  when everybody else is going to be listening, so to speak. Right.  And they all have their ways of trying to catch that stuff coming across the wire.  So that would then make, you know,  subsequent attacks against anybody else Russia wanted to go after harder. Right.  Because everybody the cat's out of the bag once they try to do  once they try to use those exploits.

Start time: 571.98
End time: 581.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why those NSO group exploits are so are millions of dollars,  because once the nation state uses it, the risk is now the cat's out of the bag.  It will be defended against.

Start time: 581.98
End time: 605.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you say less that long, though.  They don't last that long. No. These types of exploits, your days are in and out most of the time.  So I don't like sitting on them for too long is going to be, you know,  they'll end up being plugged and then they'll have to go  and do a whole bunch of other work to figure out another other exploits.  So I think I kind of think that I feel like this this whole thing,  you know, announced by the by the current administration around this.  Yeah, Biden actually gave a speech warning last week saying,

Start time: 607.46
End time: 641.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity.  It's part of Russia's playbook today.  I'm reiterating those warnings.  This was a week ago, Monday, based on a vote.  This is the important line, evolving intelligence.  The Russian government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks.  If you go to the CISA page, big sign on the front page.  This is the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency.  It says shields up.  They want everybody to protect themselves.  So it's what is it?  So Lou, what do you think?  Do you agree with Alan that it's the Russians are reluctant to use these  because they don't want to waste them?

Start time: 643.42
End time: 686.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think that they're either reluctant or they're holding back.  But I do think that, you know, obviously, when there's a war going on,  obviously, this country is like Russia, like China will go and do exploits  and do hacking and cyber threats around the world just to to pull the eyes off of their war.  And I feel like they're going to start doing this no matter what.  Traction as a distraction.  And I feel like organizations, if they're not aware of this, of this threat already  and haven't taken the steps even before the president's warning, you're already asking.  You're already kind of in a world of hurt.  So I think, you know, I think the it's nice that the administration  put something out there and said, hey, there's a threat.  I think it's kind of a little bit kind of like propaganda, so to speak.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of like a risky thing to do because it's going to scare people.

Start time: 686.48
End time: 730.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get calls now on the radio show.  What are they going to attack?  Right. Yeah. And we certainly were vulnerable.  Our electric grid is very heterogeneous, which means,  you know, there's no one central authority.  There's no one governing.  In fact, often is privately owned.  We know it's porous.  We've seen malware and a lot of electrical grid installations.  Our financial institutions are entirely computerized.  Hit them. That could be devastating.  Forget sanctions. Bring down the financial system.  Our food network is very vulnerable, not only electric, you know, completely  electrified, electronic sized.  But there's only five days worth of food at any given time in the supply chain.  That's just what happened.

Start time: 731.36
End time: 746.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We saw what happened in it was last year or 2020 when they attacked  a company, a gasoline distribution pipeline, a colonial pipeline,  a colonial pipeline, and they didn't actually take down the pipeline system.  Right. The billing system, their IT system. Yeah.

Start time: 747.74
End time: 769.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a dark side, which was, in fact, a Russian malware operation.  In fact, I know CISA estimates about 75 percent of all ransomware  comes out of Russia, whether it's the Russian government or independent  operator. My sense is I don't know, Alan, what you think, but my sense is  it's independent operators who are tolerated, if not sanctioned  by the Russian government because of their use.

Start time: 770.00
End time: 785.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a it's it's as far as like attack vectors.  It's always like the silliest thing.  Like that like that example that was just given about, you know, like  they got into their IT network and they messed up their billing.  Right. It's always the always get into the weirdest.  Oh, and how did they get in? Expecting place.

Start time: 785.76
End time: 804.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got in through a what was it?  It was a reused.  It was a password was a conventional stuffing attack on a password  for somebody who didn't work there anymore. Right.  Who had a VPN access, had used a reused password left.  They never deactivated the account.  It was just sitting there. Right.

Start time: 805.22
End time: 854.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now with so many people working from home and also using VPNs for work,  potentially on that same system that they might be using for personal stuff  when they're not on the clock and they've shut off the VPN. Right.  You're off the VPN.  You're not under the umbrella of the corporations network  and their firewalls and whatnot. You're under your own router.  You potentially get exploited there, not even be a prior employee,  potentially a current employee. Right.  Like your personal or your work machine can potentially get hacked,  you know, when you're not on the clock and then you get on the VPN  and now if you if your AV had not picked that up yet,  now you have a vector into, you know, potentially into the work system. Right.  But that applies across all sorts of industry. Right.  Not just Intel or Microsoft or any other kind of those kinds of companies,  but like any any other company where you have some remote workers.

Start time: 854.74
End time: 856.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even implied in the NSA.

Start time: 858.94
End time: 864.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those guys don't do like work from home VPN.  No, yeah, not not like the NSA contractor.

Start time: 865.94
End time: 867.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you remember this?  Take something home on a thumb drive.

Start time: 868.04
End time: 896.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tuck something home on a thumb drive.  He was running at a malware,  any malware program called Kaspersky on his home system.  It detected the malware, which was an NSA exploit  and uploaded it to Russian servers where from which it was  apparently exfiltrated somehow.  We don't know how maybe the FSU and and released.  Yeah, that would never ever happen.

Start time: 898.94
End time: 911.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will say this, like despite the fact that Kaspersky is, of course,  like Russian affiliated, like they they have a history of being a  reasonably good reputation as far as anti virus.  Not anymore. Not anymore.

Start time: 911.46
End time: 956.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. In fact, Dvorak used to swear by it.  He said that's the only one I'll use.  But I know knowing Dvorak that that was probably because he'd had drinks with Eugene.  In fact, Eugene Kaspersky was a well liked, beloved guy.  He'd go to Davos, he'd go to conferences, he'd buy drinks for journalists.  And I can't tell you how many times over the last five years  I've asked the question, well, should we still be using Kaspersky?  And people say, oh, no, no, Eugene's cool.  He's cool. I would never. Well, maybe his  is golden aura has worn off because this week the FCC  added Kaspersky's anti virus to its  restricted list the first time anybody but China has been put on this list,  the first Russian company on the security risk list.

Start time: 958.10
End time: 967.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, even even if Eugene Kaspersky is a good guy  and didn't do anything wrong, you know, he's it's a big company.  He's probably got thousands of employees.

Start time: 967.60
End time: 972.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and he's in Russia where there is a law that says  if the FSU wants your data, they get it.

Start time: 973.88
End time: 1025.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like China, right?  Kaspersky said they were disappointed with the FCC's  action, by the way,  they call themselves the world's largest privately owned security company.  They have 400 million users globally.  Quarter of a million companies.  They said they were disappointed saying, quote, it was a response  to the geopolitical climate.  Well, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity  of Kaspersky's products and services.  But Kaspersky's always said that.  US government banned them in 2017 after the NSA breach.  And now the FCC says, which means that no federal agency can can  or anybody's using federal money can buy a copy of Kaspersky.  What do you think, Alan, do you have an opinion on Eugene and the company?

Start time: 1026.18
End time: 1083.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's there's no way to know for sure what influence there is,  what level of influence there is, right, which is seems to be  what has led to those decisions.  So it's just, you know, but we just we just can't condone it  to this degree where we want, you know, where we're recommending  our government employees to go and use this antivirus.  If you're going to use one, just don't use that one.  You know, regardless of how good it was, there are still ways like  if you wanted your file to be scanned by that particular tool,  there's still places online where you can submit a file for analysis  and it'll scan it, it'll bounce it across, you know, 20 different AVs  and give you a result.  I think it's a virus total is one of them, if they're still up.  You know, there's ways to get them scanned.  But like, you know, those folks are doing it in such a way  that whatever does get scanned by any of those tools is a system  that is not going to then talk back to any of those companies.  They sort of isolate it. Yeah. Right.  So it's just it's only it's only in and not out sort of sort of a box.

Start time: 1084.00
End time: 1093.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And there are plenty of antiviruses.  So, you know, why take a chance, I guess?  Although Kaspersky is very good.  I mean, it is a very good antivirus.

Start time: 1094.18
End time: 1102.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know. It's just it's just that, you know, it's just  are they talking, you know, to what degree are they talking back  to their government? Right. Right.  That's that's that's the question mark.

Start time: 1103.70
End time: 1125.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FCC. Yeah. Well, and that's the thing.  They're not going to tell you why they say this.  It could just be the political climate, I guess.  I would hope they'd have a technical reason.  They say they're relying on findings from DHS  and the Committee for Assessment of Foreign Participation  in the United States Telecommunications Service Sector.  Calf putts.

Start time: 1128.70
End time: 1170.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this this could legitimately just be down to potential risk  and not actual risk like there might not there might not be a shred  of like direct evidence that Kaspersky has done whatever.  Right. Right.  But the potential is there. Right.  There's nothing to say that tomorrow that couldn't happen.  And you don't want a bunch of government employees all having it on their system  and then have to do that damage control and say, oh, everybody, quick,  uninstall your Kaspersky right away, because now somebody flipped the switch  and is now has some attack vector via that tool.  Right. Because that's that's the worst thing for an exploit  style attack vector is the virus tool itself. Right.  That's the one thing you're trusting on your system.  You don't want that to be the thing that's hacking you.

Start time: 1170.48
End time: 1185.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly and we have you know, we use an antivirus here.  We use ESET on our editors computers because they are compelled to use  Windows 8.  Do we we rebuilt we got new Dell workstations.  Do we put Windows nine on their way?

Start time: 1186.42
End time: 1187.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nine. We put ten on.

Start time: 1188.16
End time: 1228.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, good. We're putting ten on.  But you know, that's very common in a business where you don't  if you've got a stable system, you don't want to really know you.  So you got to upgrade.  That's normal for normal users.  But you don't just want to say willy nilly upgrade.  But at the same time, we run ESET just to be sure.  But normally, I will tell normal people on the radio show,  don't you don't need an antivirus.  Microsoft has a very good antivirus.  Anything you anything you put on your system  is has the potential for making your system more vulnerable, less reliable,  slow down your CPU and all that stuff.  So don't install anything unnecessary.  And an antivirus is.  Do you agree, Alan, for most people unnecessary?

Start time: 1230.32
End time: 1237.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To install an additional antivirus, an addition or alongside  defender. I personally just use Defender.  Yeah, Defender is fine.

Start time: 1237.78
End time: 1253.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't run one on a Mac.  I think Apple's protections, they're not they're not really an antivirus,  but Apple's protection is sufficient.  But to be honest, I don't run it on Linux either.  I just don't want to put another program on there with deep hooks into the kernel  that could not be reliable.

Start time: 1254.24
End time: 1336.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the key is to like having an OS running an OS like Linux,  which also applies to what's most likely on your home router as well.  Right. Most of those are forms of phone.  If you're an Android user.  I sort of envision like nobody's really taken this to heart yet,  but I envision this as remember those pictures back from World War  Two, where everybody had to sort of chip in and you got people making ammo.  And, you know, everybody's everybody's doing their part to whatever piece  of the effort that they can contribute. Right.  What I think people really should be doing now, which I don't think  enough people are paying attention to is there's an awful lot of people  with routers with multiple year old firmwares on them.  Right. Like it's just something that nobody thinks of.  If it's not something that automatically updates on its own.  And there is basically a Linux machine sitting at the gateway to your house.  Right. The way into your house.  And there's there have been exploits over the past years.  And those apply to those routers as well.  There's ways in potentially.  So, yeah, people like you want to chip in on your war effort sort of thing.  Update the things in your homes.  And if you're a guy helping out at a small business or whatever,  like make sure the routers update.  That's probably the easiest thing you could do to, you know,  stave off potential ways in from anybody, not just Russia,  but like, you know, anybody.

Start time: 1336.76
End time: 1367.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what shields up is.  It's not just for big businesses, for all of us.  I've seen this on Twitter, too.  Do you want to do your part in the war effort?  Patch your freaking software. Yeah.  Yeah, it's true, because if you have a  Steve was talking on Tuesday about micro tick routers,  which have firmware updates, but people never update them.  And so there's this vast hole.  They can be co-opted and used for DDoS attacks without your knowledge.  If you apply the update, you'd they're vulnerable to be gone.  So do it right.

Start time: 1367.74
End time: 1375.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's and that's the kind of thing that it doesn't necessarily need  to be a zero day for something that a country like Russia may have something  that they that's a good point.

Start time: 1376.12
End time: 1379.94

Transcript:  Well, no, it's it's not that it's that if they have X number of systems  in the US that they own right effectively,  a botnet, they're not going to.  Yeah. In effect, a botnet.  They're not going to flip the switch on that until it's something  that's really juicy that they want to do.  They're not just going to do it willy nilly.  They're not going to send US botnet machines trying to attack Ukraine right now  because the US people would figure out what those were in the meantime  and have weeks to get those machines offline or, you know, attention  would be drawn to it at that point. Right.  And people would fix it.  And you wouldn't want that. Right.  So that's the kind of thing you need to make sure when it's dormant  and not being used yet, but potentially could be used,  update the dang devices and, you know, shut those security holes.

Transcript:  Last year, the FBI was the strangest bulletin sent out a bulletin  say reboot your routers to everybody.  Yeah. Reboot your routers, because these in this particular  the mallet we're talking about wasn't persistent.  It sat in memory.  So if you just rebooted your router,  this was 2018, May 2018, FBI's urgent request, reboot your router  to stop Russia linked malware.

Start time: 1450.64
End time: 1477.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it would go away.  Yeah. And it was probably a matter of it couldn't get back in  because they had, you know, taken over whatever that DNS entry was  or whatever something they had to do or that IP address.  Right. Usually it's whatever that vector is.  They'll figure out some other way to sort of cut it off  at the head elsewhere. Right.  And yeah, just just protection in that case could just be a matter  of rebooting the router.  I'm sure there was also something where you should update your firmware also.  Yeah, you might just so you don't get reinfected.

Start time: 1477.78
End time: 1513.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. But at the time, the FBI said  Russia has a botnet of hundreds of thousands of US routers.  And when he said when they say Russia, they're talking about Fancy Bear,  which is, you know, apt-28 is another name.  They always have these strange names, which is a Russian group  run by the GRU, Russian Military Intelligence.  And they said they had a global network of hundreds of thousands of routers  under control. I said, please reboot.  Wow. So update your router, kids.  That's a good thing. Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, question for you.  You know, I have I use a Nest Wi-Fi mesh system at home,  which updates itself.  And I know I think most mesh systems, Aero and so on, update themselves.  But do most other mainstream routers today, the ones made today, do they  are they now being set up to automatically update their firmware?  Because I know in the past, updating the firmware on a router was a real pain.  And for for an average person to do that, you know, I mean,  they're more likely to brick it than successfully update. That's true.

Start time: 1547.68
End time: 1557.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And many of them, like  I think a lot of the ASUS routers, they have the capability to do automatic  updates, but I'm not sure that it's the default.  So you have to go in there and tell it.

Start time: 1557.28
End time: 1604.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The real problem is the cheap  fifty four dollar Linksys routers or Microtik routers, Tpeak Link routers,  where they didn't put that capability.  You're right. The Aero, that's but that's an expensive router.  One of the reasons I recommend it is because it auto updates.  In fact, there was a flaw that was exposed.  It wasn't a zero day, but  was reported in the Aero router two years ago.  And by the time it was reported and we were able to tell people about it,  we also were able to say, don't worry, because Aero has pushed out an update  that everybody has gotten, everybody has.  So, yeah, auto update is is a big deal.  I feel like we should require stuff like that.  I mean, if we're going to take the security seriously,  it should be kind of a requirement that all IoT devices have auto update facilities.

Start time: 1605.20
End time: 1624.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's there is a flip side to that, and that is sometimes updates are known to break things.  Right. So there's some, you know, for the sake of, you know,  I knew I was about to be on your show today.  Do I want my router auto up in this moment? Right.  Like there's some you have to have some sort of limitations in place sometimes,  depending on your your uptime requirements.

Transcript:  Also hard to convince people if it's not going to affect them, like they're not going to get  they're just being used as a DDoS  router. It's not going to affect your personal security.  It's harder to convince people. Right. They need to they need to fix that.  I want to take a little break when we come back. I want to talk about Lapsus.  This is the hacking group  that broke into Okta, broke into Microsoft, stole source code, apparently Nvidia,  Samsung, the list, a long list, LAPSUS dollar sign.  Wonder what their well.

Transcript:  I'll give you I'll give you a hint. Not a Russian.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  And actually, I want to give these guys a huge plug.  Not only do I believe in this product and use this product and Lisa uses this product,  we talk about it all the time, grammarly.  But this is one of the big Ukraine companies that is struggling  during this war.  They do. I love Grammarly for many reasons.  They're also written in Lisp, which I really, really like.  Really, it's a writing tool.  For instance, Lisa's spelling is great.  Her grammar is pretty good.  But what Grammarly does, and this is very useful,  is as she's writing emails to employees, it'll sometimes say,  you know, that's a little brusque.  Maybe maybe you'd like to soften it a little bit.  And she always laughs.  She says, well, yeah, I mean, I'm just very straightforward.  But she'll add a little please and thank you.  And thank you, Grammarly, for doing that.  Grammarly has a free version and a premium version.  You can even use it on the website, which is really cool.  The thing I'm talking about is the tone detector.  That's free.  It helps you say what you mean in the appropriate tone  and never never misinterpreted.  Nowadays, as we use a lot of texts, especially email to communicate,  it's very easy to miss the tone in email.  So it's really important when you're writing your emails  that you express it in a way that is not going to raise  somebody's hackles on the other end.  They have premium tone adjustments.  They go even further.  This is what Lisa uses to help ensure you're being clear  and assertive in your emails.  Persuasive. They help you be persuasive with a confident and polished tone.  They'll suggest more decisive phrases and word choices.  I really love that.  Grammarly also has a premium feature called full sentence rewrite  that will take a sentence that's maybe a little run on or a little convoluted.  And I'm always impressed.  Come back with a sentence.  If you said it this way, it'd be much clearer.  And it's true.  Rewriting those hard to read sentences.  They also have clarity suggestions in the premium version  that simplify sentences and get your point across faster  by cutting unnecessary words and jargon to make your sentences easy to follow.  I wish everybody in business used this.  The business jargon drives me nuts.  And you use it because everybody uses it.  It's unconscious.  It's nice, though, to get a little nudge.  And you know what? It's not a human.  It's just on your computer, a little nudge saying,  you know, you shouldn't really say run this up the flagpole to see who salutes.  You might want to try another way of saying that.  And it even gives you a one click replacement that you can just it saves you time.  It's free to use.  You download it, integrate it into your daily life.  It works wherever you are in Gmail, for instance,  to help you work more efficiently on any of your projects.  I just think it's a great solution.  And I really want to support these guys, because as a Ukraine based company,  I bet you they would love a little extra love from our audience.  So go to Grammarly, G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y,  Grammarly.com slash twit.  Sign up for that free account.  Get through those emails and your work quicker  by keeping it concise, confident and effective with Grammarly.  Go to Grammarly.com slash twit to sign up for a free account.  And when you're ready to upgrade to Grammarly premium, you'll get 20 percent off.  I think Grammarly is a great choice.  At least get the free version and show them we care.

Multi-millionaire cyber criminal in his mom's basement.  He lives at home.  He allegedly has amassed a 14 million dollar fortune.  Now, you don't want to piss off your fellow hackers.  Apparently, he's been named by rival hackers and researchers.  The city of London police say they've arrested seven teenagers  in relation to the Lapsus hacking, but they won't say if he's one of them.  The boy's father told the BBC.

And I think, like you said,  security is not necessarily about the source could go look at open source.  Right.

But one of the big reasons they don't is some of the source code is patented  and covered, not just by Microsoft, but by third parties.  So you can't just willy nilly say, here's the source code.  You don't you know, you don't have the right to release the source code  for some of this stuff. Right.  So and as I said, nobody, even if you got the full thing,  nobody's going to build Windows.

Start time: 2328.18
End time: 2385.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lou, so Okta, when they're they have this thing called the warehouse  workforce, so workforce identity solutions layer, which is basically  a bunch of organizations store their keys to the kingdom on their network.  And so if that type of data was exfiltrated,  that means that all of those organizations are open to attacks.  And so I think that's why Okta was such a big thing,  because they're an identity provider.  They're they're basically, you know, the the first line of defense for  for most organizations, obviously, if you've been enabled other things  like MFA and other things, you're in you're in better shape.  But in the same sense, these types of keys allow for like  services to talk to things. Right.  So you can have special certificates and keys that can have services  talk to, you know, to your data and so on and so forth.  So Okta manages all that.  And so people were worried about that.  It looks like they said, hey, like this wasn't this wasn't  this wasn't affected at all.  So don't worry. But again, it could have been.

Start time: 2386.36
End time: 2428.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. According to Okta's chief security officer, David Bradbury,  the hackers had accessed.  This is just what you were talking about, Alan, the computer  of a customer support engineer working for the sub processor  over a five day period back in January.  The attack had been, quote, analogous to walking away from your computer  at a coffee shop whereby a stranger has virtually in this case  sat down at your machine is using the mouse or keyboard.  It was contained quickly.  It did not. The guy did not have so-called godlike access.  So Okta itself not breached.  However, however,  worst case, they said 366 clients were affected.

You would hope that the people with the higher access  would have better safeguards in place.  But that's that's what I was just saying before, where it's  it's the silliest thing where you don't expect, you know,  a particular kind of kind of exploit.  I mean, there was there was a the closest that my network here  ever came to being compromised was I was about to get it from my computer  and my mouse moved. Yeah. Right.

You know, you may have you can have some stuff from Okta, some stuff from  Microsoft, maybe some Nvidia stuff somewhere in the stack.  And, you know, if you start finding holes in different parts of it,  you know, I think you talked earlier about kind of, you know, working,  you know, finding, you know, that, you know, starting off with,  you know, an unused VPN account and then finding your, you know,  kind of just kind of worming your way through the system.

Oh, absolutely.  I'm not saying it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so when I saw I was running reactors on subs  and then I transitioned over to do the network stuff,  they don't necessarily teach you how to be a hacker right away.  You know, you have to sort of move into the positions  where you would have to do more and more of that sort of thing.  And then you sort of get trained along the way.  But just in order to make that first step and be in that that rating,  which is like a job description in the Navy to do the network jobs in general,  there was a school like a couple of months school with the final exam  was actually here's these few sheets of paper of network traffic  that you happen to have sniffed come across a network.  Draw out the diagram of all the systems on the network.  That's right. Yeah.  And so and that's where you were talking about earlier, where it's like  for some people, this is fun.  And I mean, that final exam, even though it was arduous  and took me a few hours to do, but it was, you know, it was a pain.  But it was fun and interesting. Yeah.  Yeah. So, you know, I took I took just this, you know,  some network traffic of somebody that was like, you know,  outputting a config of a router.  And I turned it into an entire network diagram, you know,  just from some lines of, you know, addresses and whatnot.  But that's not, you know, that's mostly for defense  or just understanding networking, right?  That's sort of baseline fundamentals, which you would then build  if you went and worked somewhere where they were doing more hacking style things.  Then you would have to go to more schools and build up your your knowledge more.  Right. All the schools that I went to were more along the lines  of reverse engineering and like defense, things like that.  But we did have red team, like people in the building.  They call them red teams.  And that's a that's not just in the military.  I mean, there's civilian companies that do red teaming.  And that's the kind of thing where those where those kids would do great at.  Right. Like go work there.  You could potentially make a heck of a lot of money.  You know, not maybe not the exploit of levels of money  that those kids were making sort of blackmailing people.

And in those cases, you would be doing it legally with the permission  of the companies who you're contracting with, you know, where they basically say,  look, we want you to attack us.  You know, here's the where's the window of time where you're allowed to do it.  Here's the boundaries where, you know, we don't want you to like  shut all of our servers off, please.

Transcript:  The early guys were into  the system that they were looking at was the phone company, the the the,  you know, Ma Bell was a fascinating kind of network problem,  kind of like that piece of paper problem you were given,  where they were trying to figure out how it works.  And I remember John Draper, better known as Captain Crunch,  telling me that they used to dumpster dive behind the phone company looking for manuals.  And when they found the manuals, they would they would pour through them.  I mean, stuff that you and I would look at and go, good Lord, who cares?  And they would pour through them.  He's the guy who figured out that a 2600 hertz tone  would would trigger the switching equipment to give you access  to the long distance phone calls for free.  That's why he was named Captain Crunch, because it turned out  that was exactly the tone that the crunch whistle came in a box of cereal put out.  But but they had that same kind of mindset where  somehow they were fascinated by complex systems and deducing how they worked.

Transcript:  Right. Yeah, there's there's some there's a certain subset of folks  that just have a really high aptitude for that sort of thing.  And some people just just kind of love it.  Yeah. You know, just it's a challenge. Right.  Like I had to learn an awful lot of layers of knowledge  to understand all the stuff of reactor theory to run reactors on submarines.  Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, there's there's all sorts of I mean,  you must be a noble series. Yeah.  They sort of touch on like all the complexities of how did this reactor  meltdown and what were all the things that led into it. Right.  And that was, you know, that was like a half hour discussion  that they did at the end of that series.  And that was a super oversimplification. I love that.

Transcript:  It was they you know, those are all the exact principle.  Everything was correct. Right.  That's exactly how all that stuff works.  Xenon is a thing that tries to shut the reactor off and all that.  All those things are, you know, they they pronounced it  the way Russians pronounce it and Zenon, which threw me off.  But  but yeah, I mean, all that stuff.  And there's just a certain type of, you know, people with a certain type  of mentality who just really enjoy the, you know, technical something  that, you know, something that has technical manuals, right.  The reactor plants on the sub had just, you know, entire cabinets full of books.  Right. For you to study and learn all parts of those systems. Right.  So imagine you have this black box of a system like the Ma Bell thing.  And you're like, well, I want to really know how this works. Right.  Again, it would be great if they worked there.  I'm sure there would be amazing employees and probably do great things  for the company. But from the outside in, you just dumpster dive the manuals  and try to learn how the system works and then figure out ways to,  you know, do creative things with it.

Transcript:  There was a great game I played on the Atari.  I think it was called Scram.  It was a classic simulator game where you had you had to scram  a reactor before it melted down.  And I'm sure I mean, it was primitive even compared to the description  of how a reactor works in Chernobyl.  I don't I don't think we had any Zenon in there,  but it was really fun to try to keep the reactor running  without boiling off the liquid.  It was really cool.  Yeah. Yeah. But I never I don't think I had that because when I first met you,  Alan, you were you were talking about, you know, the the controllers  in these SSD drives and the variations.  And I think even I saw that even then, that kind of fascination  with complex systems and how they work and how they interact.

Transcript:  And that was very much the same sort of thing, right?  Outside looking in, this is a black box.  It's it's misbehaving in some way.  How do I find out just by poking at it with, you know,  asking it to do different types of requests?  And then does the performance go up or down after I've done those?  Right. That's the same sort of thing. Right.  You're poking at it with a stick.  See what makes the thing tick. Right.

Great to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by Streak, not Scram.  Streak Streak is actually a CRM for Gmail,  a customer relationship management tool that you need.  You will love if you use Gmail in business as we do.  We use Google's workspace.  You know, I mean, it's a great tool for business, but there are some things  maybe you could have a little help with.  Streak is has been awarded Google's Technology Partner of the Year.  Seven hundred fifty thousand users, entrepreneurs, small business owners,  founders love the idea that you don't have to leave Gmail.  To get to your customer information and email, it's all in one place.  You save time, you get more responses by tracking emails,  sending email merges with automated follow ups.  You ever remember the days of doing a mail merge with,  I don't know, Microsoft Word?  Hey, it's a lot easier. Let me tell you with this.  You never have to leave your inbox.  It takes 30 seconds to get started.  Send out your mailings.  Keep track of your customers.  All you have to do is add Streak's extension to your browser.  You're ready to go.  Keeping track of your customers is, I think, the most, you know,  just the best way to serve them so that when you're in contact with them,  you know the story, you know the history, you know them.  It is huge.  And Streak will let you do it so easily, so transparently.  It's easy to run your business and all within Gmail.  And when you try it, you're going to love it.  Get started right now.  It shouldn't take you to maybe less than a minute before this ad is over.  In fact, if you go to streak.com slash twit,  and right now for a limited time, 20% off the pro plan.  S T R E A K. Streak dot com slash 20% off the pro plan.  If you're managing customers, support tickets,  if you're doing job searches, buyers and sellers,  there's nothing like it. Streak dot com slash twit.  And we thank them so much for supporting our show.  Not yet a law in the EU, but boy,  I think Apple and Google both lobbied hard against this.  A law that would force Apple and I guess Google, anybody who has a store,  you have to be a company with more than 75 billion euros value,  annual sales of seven and a half billion and 45 million monthly users.  I think Google and Apple both qualify.  Then you have to offer third party payment options in your steady your stores.  This is something Epic sued Apple over and lost,  although that's on appeal right now, saying we don't want to pay 30% to Apple.  You will, you could, and I think even more important to me, I don't, I'm not,  I don't care so much about that.  That's something maybe developers who don't want to give Apple 30% companies  like Netflix and Amazon and, and Epic might not like,  but I think the thing that is more important to me,  and actually I think would be a big improvement interoperability with Apple's  messages.  Apple would have to open up,  I'm quoting here and interoperate with smaller messaging platforms if they so  request users,  smaller big platforms would then be able to exchange messages,  send files or make video calls across messaging apps,  giving them more choice. This,  I think it's really the crown jewels for Apple. In fact,  we saw in the Epic versus Apple discovery emails from Apple CEO,  Tim Cook, Scott Forstall at EQ and others saying,  we don't make messages on Android.  That's the only reason parents are buying Apple phones for their kids so they  can be green bubbles.  Apple would also have to allow users to uninstall Safari and other stock apps.  And this would be a good one to replace them with third party alternatives as  they so wish. Although iPhones lately have allowed you to use a third party  browser instead of the default Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you use any third party web browser on Apple devices,  you're you're you may be using their sort of shell of a browser,  but the actual thing doing the rendering that accessing the web pages is still  web kit.

Start time: 3633.68
End time: 3659.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a perfect example of I'll I'll take this position why government maybe  shouldn't weigh in on these technical issues.  I think the EU legislators say, well,  you just make them uninstall Safari, make that an option. Don't understand.  That's not a solution. Right. You'd have to say, Oh,  you can use some other rendering engine, chromium or whatever. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 3660.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which, which I would, which now there may be some downsides or maybe Apple doing  some, you know, power efficiency,  test all stuff with web kit that makes a better experience on an iOS device,  regardless of which browser you're using with it. Fine. But I don't know.  I really, my personal belief is that if I do, if I put Chrome on an iPhone,  it should be Chrome. Right.

Start time: 3682.06
End time: 3726.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. And in case of the iPhone, it's not, it's web kit with a Chrome,  Chrome on top. Right. Right.  Gatekeepers again, Apple, Google companies, I guess Facebook would qualify.  Although Facebook, if Facebook value keeps going down,  pretty soon they'll be low enough. They don't have to worry about this.  We'll have to make it as easy to unsubscribe from services as subscribe.  Yeah.  For the most important software, for instance,  web browsers not require this software by default upon installation of the  operating system, ensure interoperability of messaging services,  basic functionalities. I think that would be,  doesn't mean that Apple would have to make messages for Android. However,  it just means, I think, I think, this one might be,

Start time: 3726.84

You know,  I think, and I think he has a point that the way Apple does it, admittedly,  to Apple's benefit, it's lock in, it's proprietary, it's a silo,  but the way they do it also makes it easier and cleaner for users.  And, and that's a good point. Is that's a, that's a good point,

Start time: 3798.82

Transcript:  There's nothing, there's nothing stopping people from using things like WhatsApp  and telegram though. I think, I think that's the big problem with all,  I have it with all of this is that they're not going to go stop these, these,  they're not going to make them be interoperable,  which means then people are just going to move to those.  I just don't understand this, this line of thinking, unfortunately.

Start time: 3839.57
End time: 3886.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem with that, you know, and particularly for messaging apps,  probably more so than anything else is, you know, you really are that,  I mean, that is probably the one place where the network effect is the biggest  factor. You know, you can, sure,  you can switch from Apple messages to WhatsApp or, or, um,  you know, anything or anything else or signal or whatever you want.  But if you can't get all the people you communicate with to come over as well,  then it's useless to you. So, you know, you should,  you should have the ability to go from WhatsApp or signal or telegram to Apple  messages or to WhatsApp or to, you know,  to go back and forth between any of these from any of these,  it should be a many to many relationship, not a one to one relationship.

He says,  there's only one kid with Android and, and he's the blue bubble. He, we,  he's left out of all of our group conversations. Uh,  there's huge pressure as a result to be an iPhone user.  Apple knows that.

Transcript:  And also to some degree, like I kind of want there to be more interoperability  just to try to reduce,  not that I want everybody to end up settling on iMessage necessarily,  but I remember way back in the day when you had to use like I,  or not I see you Trillian for I see you and like MSN and pigeon, right?  Where you had to use. Yep.  And I still remember my stupid ICQ number even right now. I don't know why.  It's crazy. What's your ICQ number? Go ahead. Tell me 169 6682.  You guys remember your ICQ numbers? See it. It doesn't,  it doesn't matter if somebody spams me because I haven't logged into that.  It's been like 10 years.

Transcript:  but we used to use those apps that would tie all those together because there  were so many dang different pain in the butt. Right. And you know,  and nowadays it's sort of the same thing, right?  I have family overseas to talk to them. Oh,  I got to use WhatsApp or I got to use whatever the other thing that they use

Start time: 4007.24
End time: 4028.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  over there. You have to have all the apps basically. Yeah.  Because this guy uses messenger. This guy uses WhatsApp. He uses telegram.  I wish I could use signal for everything.  If signal didn't tie to a phone number, I would use signal for everything.  And I would just say, you know, everybody has to signal me, but you can't,  because you asked one per phone. Yeah. Yeah. There's,

Start time: 4028.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they use another thing. I mean, this is, this is the beauty of email.  This is why email works so well, because it didn't matter what, what system,  I mean, at least once we got past MCI mail,  you could use whatever mail app you wanted and it still went through.

Start time: 4045.38
End time: 4052.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how come we were able to solve it with email, but we can't,  we went in the exact opposite direction with messaging. What happened?

Start time: 4052.52
End time: 4062.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Standards. It's a protocol. I mean, email is a protocol. I mean, it's,  lack of standards. You develop a protocol.  It's more agnostic versus these specific platforms that are tied down and,

Start time: 4062.78
End time: 4118.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and, and it was, because it used to be, if you had the source,  you couldn't talk to people on CompuServe. And if you had MCI mail or genie,  these were all, they were not interoperable. These were like,  like it is today. They were siloed. Right.  The difference was you had to have a paid account with those.  So if I were, I had an MCI mail account,  I bet I could remember my MCI mail number,  but you couldn't email me from any of the other services.  So if you didn't have MCI mail, you literally could not email me.  That was a bad situation.  And internet mail solved all that.  And eventually everybody kind of conceded today, you've got companies that say,  no, no, no, this is, this is my business model.  I'm not going to let iMessage interoperate with anything else or Facebook  messenger. So I, I, in that respect,  I think the EU is not wrong. It would be nice.  I don't know if you can have a legislative solution, by the way.

Start time: 4119.00
End time: 4146.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think,  I think the key to a legislative solution is it needs to be technology  agnostic. The legislature,  the regulations can't specify that you have to do it a particular way.  They just have to, you have to specify what is the end result that you want.  You want any messaging system to be able to talk to any other messaging system.  That's, it needs to be results oriented,  not specifying a particular technology solution.  And if you do that, then...

Start time: 4146.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're kind of targeting them. They're kind of targeting the big ways, right?  They're saying that you have to make certain amount before we start targeting.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  So they're kind of targeting those specific applications.

Start time: 4163.96
End time: 4233.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of a form of antitrust.  And the EU's view of antitrust is very different than our view of antitrust  in the United States.  But although I have to say it's going in this direction as well in the US.  By the way, this is not a light fine.  Again, this is provisional.  As I remember, it's a complicated system,  but every country has to ratify it before it's the rule of that country.  If the gatekeeper violates the rules laid down in the legislation,  the EU says the fine can be up to 10% of its worldwide revenue.  Billions.  This is not that slap on the wrist, five million euros  that the Irish state authorities charging Apple every week  for a repeat offense, up to 20% of worldwide revenue.  Yikes.  So I guess the overarching question for the three of you is,  should legislative bodies do this kind of thing or not?  Are they the right people to do this, Lou?

Start time: 4234.70
End time: 4257.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I know, I'm probably the odd man out here.  I just think that maybe it's the way they're going about it is just wrong for me.  I think that they're doing it.  They're targeting specific large companies and technology that they make.  In order to do this, when in fact, I kind of think that's almost anti-competitive.  So I don't know.  That's just my personal opinion there.  What do you think, Alan?

Start time: 4259.50
End time: 4278.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see both sides of it.  I know, it's hard for me to say where the other.  I get where Lou's coming from, but I also feel like, OK,  if they don't do it, who will and how will they?  Like, it has to be somebody big enough to actually have an impact  if it's ever going to happen.  Not necessarily that I support how they're doing or how they're going about it.  So that begs the second question.

Transcript:  The only mechanism we as a society have for this kind of thing is government.  That's the whole that's in theory, maybe not in practice,  but the theory is that society's voice saying, no, no, companies, big tech companies.  I know you're there to make a money, make profit.  That's your that's your mantra.  That's what you're doing.  But we as a society want you to do something that maybe isn't your best  business interests, which is make your messaging programs interoperable.  And we as a society say if you want to operate in our society,  you need to adhere to that rule.  In theory, that's the way to do it.  And that's the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I think the big issue that comes about from like,  take this example right now, and there's even some other examples  that the EU also has done right there.  He was pretty aggressive about doing this sort of thing  where they want to step in about some particular technological thing.  My sort of beef with it is the same thing that's making all of us  collectively roll our eyes about the WebKit thing, for example.  Right. It's like, well, these guys didn't know the whole story  like technologically, right.  They didn't have their their minds fully wrapped around the issue at hand  and how to address it and all of the little caveats that, you know,  might come along with it.  So, of course, once they make the decision and the requirement comes down,  it seems boneheaded to those who actually understand.  It's like, well, you guys didn't make an informed decision, right?  Like they made there was some decision like a year ago or something with respect to.  I think it affected Tesla the most, but it was it was targeted at like  if a car has like a some autonomous type feature, then it can't like turn  at this exceeding this number of G force. Right.  That sounds like a good law.  Well, no, no. But but it was such a low number  that it was like you basically had to make a turn like a grandma.  Yeah. Right. So it was like you couldn't even make a turn like a normal. Right.  And it was like it was to the point where.  Yeah. And it was to the point where if you as a regular person  tried to adhere to this restriction, just driving normally,  you would have piles of pileups behind you. Right.  Because you're just that's it's to the point where it's hazardous.

You it's it's not a done.  This is it done in final.  There's a process and it can evolve.  The Constitution has many amendments.  I don't think that that's a strike against it, that they chose a bad number.

Transcript:  To defend to defend the regulators a little bit.  The regulatory process is not something that happens quickly,  which is both good and bad.  It's a process that often takes years.  And I'm not quite sure exactly which one you're referencing there, Alan.  But generally, they'll put out and this isn't just for  for vehicles, it's for everything, every regulatory process.  They put out a notice of proposed rulemaking.  Here's what we're thinking about.  You know, you got 90 days, six months to give us comments.  We'll evaluate that.  And even before they get to that point, they've usually done years  of research and analysis before they even do that NPRM.  And then, you know, then there's the next stage.  They go, they iterate through that, you know, sometimes several times  before they finally come up with a final regulation.

Start time: 4538.90
End time: 4546.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4546.40
End time: 4565.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And and, you know, and, you know, most certainly most big companies,  you know, have people that are keeping an eye on this, you know, and they do.  They do respond and comment on these notices of proposed rulemaking  before they before they ever get to that stage.  So on the other hand, if you're Elon, you might be tweeting

Start time: 4630.38
End time: 4635.90

When I get below, I think eight miles an hour, I don't have a problem with that.  It also has and there's a lot of actually Mustang owners who don't like this.  There's a backup beep like a truck.  Is that Sam? Is that why?

Start time: 4661.48
End time: 4688.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's again, that's part of the same set of rules that are all cars.  Is it just going to have backup beeps now?  Well, for not necessarily a beep for the backups, but some sort of sound  when backing up for anything that's operating in electric mode below 20 miles an hour.  Oh, it's just because it's electric. OK.  Yeah. And it applies to hybrids as well.  So, you know, if you if you're driving a hybrid and I don't  the Mustang doesn't make a beep when it's backing up, does it?

Start time: 4688.28

I can see what's going on.  But I still I don't want to hit a kid that's too small to see or whatever.  So that's fine. Yeah, that's fine.

Start time: 4710.04

It needs it needs to be relatively standardized, you know, so you have  you start to build up, you know, a community understanding of,  you know, what a particular sound means. Yes.

So those sounds are.  Yeah. If you ever listen to those, they're like the  they've done some Tesla hill climbs or even like the Volkswagen EV.  I forget the name of that. The IDR.  He knows. Yeah, the IDR.  Like when that thing is doing a hill climb event, it is like the most obnoxious  sounding thing where you'll watch a video and you kind of have to turn the volume down  and you don't get to you don't get to hear the cool EV sounds because you just  the sound coming out of the sound maker is so annoying on the car.

Transcript:  Well, you know, it's it's funny.  Last week, I was flying home from South by Southwest and I ran into a former  colleague of mine that I used to work with about 10 years ago.  And he used to be in PR at GM.  And he now works for this company that does sound design.  It's an agency.  And they they work with a lot of different kinds of companies  creating sounds for different things, whether it's the sound of an action  or something that can be used in ads.  They're working with some automakers on sounds for EVs.  BMW hired Hans Zimmer to create the soundtrack for their EVs.  And last week, when I was at a Volvo event, they were talking about the sounds,  how they do some of the sounds.  It used to be that when you turn on your turn signal, you know,  the turn signal switch was tied to a mechanical relay.  You know, that's what the clicking sound was of your turn signals.  It was actually a relay switching back and forth. Wow.  And now they don't have those relays anymore.  It's all electronic.  So they had to come up with a sound for that.  Still sounds like the relay, though, doesn't it?  Well, not not in the Volvo.  It's still a click, but it's different.  And, you know, they showed it showed us a video of some of their  their sound designers walking through a forest in Sweden,  recording various sounds.  And one of the sounds they happened to catch was as he as the guy  stepped on a stick and the stick snapped and he recorded that sound.  And that's actually in modern Volvos.  It's so Volvo that when you do the turn signal,  that sound is actually the sound of a of a twig snapping.

Elon Musk speaking.  We'll do the Elon Musk segment, then we'll move on.  Speaking of speaking of Elon had a poll  given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square.  Failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.  So he asks free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.  Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?  What do you think the results would be if you had a poll like that on Twitter?  You think they'd say, oh, no, no, no, free speech.  Definitely a big part of Twitter.  No, of course not.  70 percent said no.  So then Elon being Elon, he smoked another doobie and said,  is a new platform needed?  Is Elon Musk going to create his own Twitter, by the way,  after the doobie wore out, he tweeted, sees the memes of production.  So I don't know how serious he's.

Alan Malventano from Intel, not speaking for Intel,  not speaking for Microsoft, but of Microsoft, Lou Maraschke,  also hosted this week in Enterprise Tech.  I don't know if you've noticed, but my weight goes up and down quite a bit.  I finally found a weight loss program I can live with for a long time.  I am a fan of Noom. I know you've seen the ads.  Lisa is also a big Noom fan. I have to say, I am so impressed.  I started Noom a year ago because I've seen all the ads, went through.  There's a question and answer process where they kind of identify your,  you know, relationship to food at the beginning.  Went through that. Lisa was kind of interested.  She said, you know what? I'm going to support you.  She never needed to lose weight. She's always been very slender.  I'm going to support you. I'm going to do it with you.  I said, thank you. That's great. We'll do it together.  It's very helpful when your spouse does it with you.  She's lost like 10 pounds, kept it off.  She looks fantastic.  Still a little yo-yo, but I love Noom.  Noom weight is all about better health through education.  It's a psychology based approach that helps you change the way you think  about food and health rather than demanding you change your entire lifestyle.  One of the things Lisa loved and I love is there are no bad foods.  You know, a lot of diets say, oh, you can't eat that or you can't eat that.  And of course, my elephant mind, that's the thing I want.  Can't eat cupcakes. I'm going to eat cupcakes and I'm going to eat them.  In excess, Noom doesn't restrict what you can eat or you can't eat.  It gives you the knowledge and wisdom you need to make informed choices.  You log what you eat, which, by the way, just by itself is very helpful  in understanding what you're doing.  And then they have these lessons in which you learn about your relationship with food.  For instance, I'm a fog eater.  I eat unconsciously.  And so they gave me a lot of tips that helped me be very conscious  and mindful as I'm eating. Lisa and I will do that together.  She said, oh, turn off the TV.  Let's put your fork down after your first bite. Taste it. It's fun.  I love doing it.  Noom understands building long term positive habits can be hard.  And it is filled with ups and downs.  It's about progress, not about perfection.  And everybody's journey looks different.  But I have to say Noom works. I love it.  I feel better. I've lost weight.  My clothes fit. Lisa looks great.  It really works. In fact, 75% of users finish the program.  That's unheard of.  And it's I think because it's based in science.  It's not it's not airy fairy.  It's not made up.  Science is at the heart of everything they do.  They've published 30 peer reviewed scientific articles  that inform users and practitioners and scientists and the public  about how Noom works and about how effective it is.  It's proven with Noom.  Taking care of your health is empowering instead of stress inducing.  I know you've seen the Noom ads and you've seen the, you know,  all the publicity about Noom.  I just I'm here to tell you it works.  It worked for me. It works for Lisa.  It works for so many people we know.  And it's it's not punitive.  You don't have to fear.  You know, you get a bad day, an off day.  You know, you haven't ruined your program.  Noom helps get back on track.  Noom weight fits beautifully into your life.  Five, 10, 15 minutes a day,  however much time you want to spend on the app is up to you.  It is not judgmental.  You get a coach who works with you.  You get a group, which is for a lot of people, very healthy  and helpful to have other people doing in the same journey.  I think they've really figured this out.  I am a big fan.  Start building better habits today.  Sign up for your trial.  Noom.com.  And I believe in this.  This is so great.  Noom.com.  Start that trial today.  I think you will thank me for it.  I really do.  In fact, I have already talked to many people who have.  It's really it's very exciting.  Let's see.  We're going to move on to our quick takes section.  They don't have to be quick.  Nothing we do here is quick.  Roku has updated its OS, OS 11, personalized photo screensaver.  Finally, I know.  Although I still think Roku probably.  I know. Who do you who do you like, Alan?  Who has the best software, in your opinion?  Was it you said finally or was it Lou?  I think it was you.  I said finally.  Oh, Lou, what do you like?

This the big box.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  They kept it up to date.  They have a Tegra in there, which means it's got a lot of processing power.  I've been playing the G-Force game now games on it,  and it's got plenty of power for that.  But there's not enough.  At least in my neck of the woods, Xfinity will not let me run HBO now on it.

Transcript:  No, but OK, and this is a really messed up situation.  The cable, these channels, none of these channels  want to screw with the cable companies because if without  without if HBO or ESPN or anybody weren't on a cable system,  they would die on the vine.  We're not yet at the point where cord cutters can support you.  So for most people, people like me, I pay for a cable subscription.  I'm not a cord cutter like you, Lou.  I get HBO now, I guess they call it, free  because I pay for it through my cable subscription.  But that's on an Apple TV.  They only recently made a deal with Roku and it is not on the shield.  So that and that's only because Xfinity is my cable provider  and they haven't made a deal or some.  I don't know where the buck stops.  It could be HBO, but I think it's knowing Xfinity is almost certainly them.  So HBO Max, that's what it is.  HBO Max, I can't use.  I think Showtime Anytime doesn't work either.  So it's a limited number of apps I can run, not because they don't run.  They're available on the Android TV app,  but because the stupid cable company won't let me.

We use Chromecast with Google TV.  You know, we did Roku back in the old days.  I like that new Chromecast.  The old school Chromecast and then the new one.  I love the interface on there.  Yeah. You know, the night it's a nice little remote.  We got them on all our TVs and it works great.  Are you a cord cutter?  You have a cable.  Yeah, we haven't had cable TV for like six years.

Transcript:  We we tried the YouTube TV trial a couple of years ago.  And after about three days, we realized, wait,  we have to watch ads and we can't skip them.  It's like this was like after three years of having no cable.  It's like skip them.  In fact, I mean, just just the fact that they're there at all,  you know, was a nonstarter.  And we said, forget that.  Well, it's getting ads because it's broadcast.

Transcript:  You're getting the full broadcast channel, for instance.  Right now, the Oscars are about an hour off.  I've got the red carpet and I'm not I'm recording it on YouTube TV,  not on my TV.  There's another thing I spent money on.  It's a lifetime lifetime subscription to TV on my cable.  But I'm doing the YouTube TV because it's very easy to DVR it.  In fact, before I left in the morning, I said, get the red carpet  and get the Oscars is one button click. It's great.  And what I'll do is because I'm I watch it on Apple TV.  You can then press the Siri button and say, skip ahead.  And you have to know how many minutes  this commercial break is.  And you learn skip ahead three and a half minutes  and it skips right through and goes to the next thing.  It's great.  So that's the trick.  You have to you have to do it on an Apple TV.  Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

If there's something you're not watching, if there's a service,  you know, that there's nothing on you're watching right now.  Yes. Just cancel them.  And it's so easy to do now.  You know, I can go in and I can cancel stars or we just canceled Hulu  a couple of months ago and we'll bring it bring it back in a few months,  you know, when there's stuff we want to see again.  And, you know, we just stuff gets on and gets turned on and off.  And so, you know, the whole bill, the bill, the total bill stays fairly manageable.

He's going to actually rub off the thermal paste.  OK, so there it is.  So that where that where that is.  That that same footprint, that footprint, that's yeah,  because that's where the thermal paste is.  The rest of this dive, the chip is filled with RAM.  And the, you know, the  pro res playback stuff and the stuff and all of that stuff.  But he does later put a rise in next to it.  Let me see if I can get to that part of the video.

Start time: 5847.34

End time: 5907.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's one on the top and the bottom, which is kind of interesting.  These I don't think they're trying to run quite as cool  because I think they really want to maximize the the the output of these things.  So they the fan is always on on this.  It never I ran a process that was very CPU intensive, pegged the CPUs all.  Let's see. This is the Max Studio.  There it is. It's the rise in next to it.  I have the ultra at home.  Lisa has the ultra.  I pegged the CPUs for a long period of time as a photogrammetry project.  Alex Lindsay gave me and it never even got appreciably warm.  The air coming out the back was no warmer in it.  And the fans didn't ramp up or down.  They're just on nonstop.  And the thermals were very good.  I was looking at the temperatures.  Thermals are very noticeable as the fan blowing.  They don't hear it at all.  It's just but it's on the minute you turn it on.  It's on. And it's a it's this weird thrusters.  And I think they're very big and they move a lot of air.  So I don't think you hear them.

End time: 5930.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, not even that.  You have to put your ear next to it. Right.  But I have to say, I compared it  processor wise on this photogrammetry project  to the same project running on a PC running Linux  with a radio or Nvidia GTX 3080.  And it was much faster  than the ultra.

Transcript:  Well, I think the software, it's called Metashape,  which they write for Windows Mac and Linux.  I was running on a Linux machine.  I don't know how well tuned it is for the M1.  It was M1 software, but I don't know how well tuned it is for the GPUs in the M1.  So these are system GPUs.  They're on that chip.  And I don't know.  It didn't look like it was using the GPUs as much.  On the other hand, on the PC, it was pegging the 3080.  It was really using the GPU.  And the GPU bound stuff was like three or four times faster.  But that's important.  What it means is that just going out and buying the ultra  doesn't guarantee you a faster process.  You know, you need to have software that's tuned for it.  And in fact, you know, Apple shows the graph at 200 watts,  how, oh, we're just as good as a 3090 at 200 watts.  What they don't mention is the 3090 can go to 400 watts  and will in fact outpass the ultra.  If heat and power are not a concern, which they're not on a desktop,  then it's going to then you don't have the fastest chip on the block.  And Apple really obfuscates that, I think.  So I'm happy to have these, but I think you really need to know what you're.  First of all, you don't need one of these unless you're using something  that's going to use all these CPUs, which is nothing.  You know, just a handful of things.  And secondly, you need to use a tool that is tuned  and the hardware that is tuned for the job you're doing.  And it's not obviously the Apple always.

Chances are you're not really going to upgrade it after the fact.  Right. Those are. Oh, this is not upgradable at all.  Right. That's those are just the bounds that you sort of buy into.  If you go that route, you know, if that's your cup of tea, then fine.  But, you know, if you're the flip side of that is PC  enthusiast style folks who just want to build the fire breathing rig to do.  You can do whatever that's right.

I was really I really thought that this was what Google,  Microsoft and video and others were doing to test out the ability  to stream software and ultimately was to stream  an entire computer operating system.  That that was the real that that's that's fine,

Transcript:  See, and that's, you know, and in some cases, that's an awful  depending on how it's optimized.  But in some cases, there's an awful lot of bandwidth  that you would need to go back and forth to redraw whatever the thing is.  Just to just for something where locally on the system,  it would barely use any resources at all. You're right.  Yeah. So depending on what the thing is, sometimes it's actually less efficient  to stream it versus just have it locally.

So like if you have your home machine, your remote worker,  you use it as you kind of jump box into it.  And those machines are highly patched and they're highly regulated.  That's why I thought it would take off.

What happens is it slowly builds.  It adds the places of interest in the in the streets slowly.  You see it all building.  I didn't realize that.  So it's it's actually gets any commands down.  Draw this here, draw that there.  That kind of thing. That's interesting.  Do you follow Alan?  Do you follow the Nvidia's?  I know I know you do, Sam.  In fact, we hack stuff.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 6602.72
End time: 6612.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  in yet. They have an API and that's all that we need.  There's there's a well, there's an API.

Start time: 6617.34
End time: 6713.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't have that other API, but there's the API to get  the stuff off of the SSD quickly and to bypass some  portions of the what's historically a very long stack  of code that a request to an SSD normally has to go through.  So the idea is that, hey, I'm doing these types of things.  I don't need to worry about X, Y and Z in the process.  I can sort of optimize this code path so that I'm using less  CPU resources just to request something from the SSD  just to do a request. Right.  And then there's some other things in there in terms of like  batching. So they're trying to and part of this is actually  wouldn't be necessary if not for game developers.  Just generally speaking, not necessarily optimizing around  SSD. Just the fact that you have fast storage.  Right. Many of the games that exist, the game engines that  exist today, when they load things, they're doing it, you  know, not optimally. You could get much better speeds out of  an SSD if you requested things in a diff in a slightly  different way. And so part of the direct storage API is  encouraging this thing called batching, which is where don't  just ask for 4K 10,000 times in a row, you know, four  kilobytes of information over and over again. You know, you  should do larger requests. You should do them in batches.  Right. Ask for, hey, I need this one gigabyte of data from  this file. And so the idea with direct storage is you just  make that request as the game engine and then direct storage  takes care of all the smaller requests. But it's able to do  them in a much more optimized way that the SSD is going to go  closer to its full speed. Right.

End time: 6800.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  once. Is that for some for SSDs, especially for NAND, right?  Optane less less. So has this issue. But for NAND in  particular, you can't really get, you know, you have a Gen 4  super fancy, you know, fire breathing SSD like top of the  line right now. And it's supposed to go seven gig per  second in a straight line. Wow. Sequential sequential  throughput. Right. And we're about to move. We're about to  move to 14 when we do Gen five SSDs when those start coming  out. But because it's NAND and each request has a certain  turnaround time, you can't actually hit that seven gig per  second if you only ask for one little thing at a time. Right.  Right. So you have to do that. Turnaround time. So yeah,  there is a turnaround time. So if you ask the SSD say, hey, I  need, you know, give me 128 of these 32 kilobyte chunks at  once. Right. You'll still have that turnaround time. But once  the time is up, you'll start getting a firehose of all of  those requests will start coming in. Right. And overall,  you'll get much closer to that seven gig per second that you  could get theoretically from that thing. Right. So this is  a matter of how do you ask for the data. This was G D as in

Start time: 6801.98
End time: 6822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  developers conference as opposed to G T which is the  Nvidia conference. I understand the confusion. Right. But they  both happened. Sorry. They both happened. And this is actually  a huge deal. Although ours technique Andrew Cunningham  writing said that some of the improvements that you might  expect were slowed down in the real world because of CPU

Start time: 6822.12
End time: 6898.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bottlenecks. Yes, that's the other piece of this, which is  all of those requests as they're going to the SSD. There is  a slightly different code path that you can take through the  operating system. Right. Because realize operating systems have  various layers of obfuscation to get to the storage. Right. For  example, me doing my SSD testing, I know that I can only  get so many requests per second from an SSD with like one  thread, just like one application thread running on a  CPU. Right. There is a top end of that. And that top end is  based on the CPU pegs because it's repeatedly running this  code for each request. It has to go through the kernel and go  through all the different hardware abstraction layer and  all of that. Yeah, it has to go through all those layers. Well,  there is a more direct path that can be taken by using the  direct storage API, which bypasses some of those layers.  Right. Because again, the context is that you're not  doing regular computer stuff. You're actually just loading  game textures and data and whatnot. You don't have to do  all of the other things you would normally do for a generic  multipurpose I O request to disk. Right. You don't need to  update the last time the file was accessed. You don't need to  do all these other things every time you do one of those

Start time: 6898.46
End time: 6915.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  requests. So once now, right now it's in gaming once and  particularly on the Xbox Series X, but once it comes to  Windows, would you notice a difference in improvement in  performance? I mean, a lot of what we do in Windows isn't  loading giant textures. It's small chunks. Yeah. So it's

Start time: 6915.78
End time: 6987.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to have bounds. First of all, the thing has to call the  API, right? So the game developers will have to update  their code, their game engines to use this. Right. And then  once they're using it, it may not necessarily be used for  every single point of the game. So like, so in other words,  if you launch the game, it might launch more like a regular  application with regular API calls. And then maybe it's not  until you're in the game that it's actually using the direct  storage stuff to just sort of transition between levels,  faster. That would be the gist of that. And the reason for  making it more CPU efficient for all those requests is that  that leaves more CPU horsepower available for the game to run.  Right? You're making the storage piece more efficient.  Right. So then the game developers will, at least in  theory, be able to move more towards the same sort of thing  that the Xbox is doing, right? Where you have seamless  transitions between what would have been a loading scene in a  game, right? Just turns into you just go right into the next  thing because it's able to load all of that stuff faster and  more efficiently in the background and not impact the

Start time: 6987.98
End time: 7013.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  performance of the game. Yep. And let me add to what Alan's  saying too. It actually has a cascading effect too. So think  about a device like, let's say a HoloLens that needs to be  able to produce graphics quickly on. If it can bypass the  CPU, it actually will run at a lower amount of power usage,  which means that device will be able to implement these  features better and be able to be more power efficient. So I  think there's a lot of advantages to doing this. Right.

Start time: 7014.10
End time: 7046.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the other piece that's not fully baked, or at  least it's not in Windows 11 yet, and that is don't only read  it from the storage faster and more efficiently, but also the  CPU doesn't need these textures just to go directly to  the GPU and let the GPU decompress it or do whatever it  needs to do. So then potentially the CPU, yes, it's kind of  still in the middle, but it's not really doing stuff in the  middle anymore. You're literally just going right from the SSD  to the GPU, or at least with as little CPU overhead as possible.

Transcript:  let me talk a little bit about our newest toy here in the  studio, our TriCaster 2 Elite from NewTek. You know that when  I first started to it back in 2005, I was looking for a  switching solution that would let us have multiple cameras to  kind of do like a TV style production, but without the big  cost. And we chose NewTek because I talked to everybody.  Everybody agreed the TriCaster was the way to go. Of course,  it's been 15 years, 17 actually, and the TriCaster has gotten  better and better and better. And now, thank you, NewTek.  We've got the TriCaster 2 Elite, the most complete live  production system on the planet. And I will be honest, we use a  fraction of the capabilities, but sure is fun for us to play  with. NewTek has a full line of TriCasters. You don't have to  select the top of the line like we do. There are some very  affordable choices too. Churches, colleges, broadcasters,  podcasters all love NewTek because it gives you  solutions you can afford that give you capabilities you could  only dream of. The way we use it is, of course, is a live video  production system, but NewTek can do so much more. It could be  an entire digital media solution, creating content for  the internet, mobile and television distribution. There  really is a great time for that because of local sports, local  TV stations, national stations who want to create streaming  solutions. Late in last year, NewTek unleashed an updated  version of the TriCaster 2 Elite. This is what we're using  today with so many new features. Really exciting. The live call  connect feature supports Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and  FaceTime. That could be an input to any production. Selectable  audio and video return enables TriCaster 2 Elite operators to  view and audio return like any other output, allowing greater  flexibility. There's a new, have we ever used this John? Neural  voice isolation tool, which takes the audio, uses AI and can  cancel or reduce background noise, automatically detect  voices. Incredible, especially if you're doing a show with a  noisy environment, a racetrack or a conference or a worship  service, you can really clean up the audio. You get so much  power, flexibility and simplicity as always with all of  NewTek's products. You've got variable support in macros. We  use macros a lot. John's always writing new macros for us. A  dynamic and powerful tool that allows operators to nest macros  now, deliver complex productions more easily. That's mostly how  John uses the macros to make it easier for me in my studio so I  can press a button, it'll take care of it. That's awesome. I'm  doing all my own switching when I'm in my office, but it's  mostly thanks to macros from TriCaster. TriCaster 2 Elite  supports encoding of three channels and anything from HD to  UHD simultaneously. They brought live panel builder into  the TriCaster. This is always a nice post-production tool. Now  you can create bespoke user interfaces, customize each preset  within the user interface, making your distributed workflow  simpler, more cohesive, never compromising on quality. I can  go on and on. I can rhapsodize for hours and I'm not even the  primary user. Our team loves our TriCaster. We especially love  NDI, the network distributed interface. We have an NDI camera,  pan tilt zoom camera above me, that NDI means it doesn't have  to have an HDMI connector or an SDI connector. This camera is  controlled by John on the control surface and the only  thing plugged into it is a network cable. Is it PoE as well,  John? Yeah. So we don't even have a power cable. The whole  thing is controlled by a network cable. The video goes over the  network into the TriCaster. That's awesome. That's awesome.  The NDI Genlock tool, that's TriCaster 2 Elite customers match  outputs to a common sync pulse. So you know exactly everything  synced up exactly when to send a frame of video. Incredible  accuracy, especially needed for a remote workflow. You can send  an alpha channel through one of the mix outs. You can bring  post-production closer to live. Users can use the keying on the  TriCaster to feed graphics or real-time 3D creation tools. We  don't use the keying, but boy, the TriCaster's key is get  it's better every single time. It's mind boggling. Since its  arrival in 2020, TriCaster 2 Elite has offered an incredibly  powerful live production system. These very latest updates  put even more power in the hands of storytellers. We only  scratch the surface. Take a look at the TriCaster and see  what you can do with it. It's literally better than broadcast.  It makes me feel like really good about choosing TriCaster  all those years ago. The TriCaster 1 Pro, another great  choice for producers, content creators, publishers. It's got  great future ready capabilities. It's a streamlined live video  production system with live call connect, 4K UHD switching,  live streaming, recording. That's just really impressive  what they've done.

Just go because it's fun to  browse and dream and think about all the things you can do  with TriCaster. Every time I look at what we can do, I'm  thinking, you know, why aren't I in Mount Rushmore right now?  I mean, there's so many things we could do with that. It's  just so cool. And I know John is always excited. We got a new  control surface to go with it, right? And we just, it was a  big upgrade for us. Go.newtech.com slash twit dash TV.

But last  performances coming up. It's been a good 20 years Asimo. The  inventor of the GIF and I'm going to say GIF from now on as  past Steve Wilhite. He invented the GIF on CompuServe. We were  just talking about that in the 1980s and spent the rest of his  life trying to convince people that it's GIF, not Kif. In fact,  when he won the Webby Award about 10 years ago, he very  famously his acceptance speech, you know, you only get five  letters here. I'll play it for you.  Was it's pronounced GIF and the crowd goes wild. Not GIF.  I can never remember. Hey, you invented. You get to name it. Is  that true though? Really? I mean, what's for me? I guess. Yeah,  I never really wanted to call it GIF because that made me think  of peanut butter. In fact, remember when GIF peanut butter  sent out a peanut butter jar? We probably still have it  somewhere with a label that said it's pronounced GIF. We're  GIF. So there's a little, little, you know, tension between  them. Also passed away. Speaking of vintage computers, the  former CEO of Tandy Corporation, who pushed out the original TRS  80. A lot of people got their first taste of a personal  computer in the $600 TRS 80 in 1978. I think it came out 77.  And it was John Roach, who was the CEO at the time. They  shipped, he says, the Apple one had been introduced the year  before Commodore and other companies are marketing their  own home computers. But the TRS 80 became for a time the most  popular computer on the market. Mr. Roach said that Charles  Tandy blew a little smoke and said build 1000. And if we  can't sell them, we'll use them in the store for something, the  battery club or something. We were finally able to ship some  machines in September, shipped 5000 that year. That was all we  could make. Our competitors ship none. $600, which you know,  in 1978 was a lot more, you know, dollar was worth  something. But it was still a lot cheaper than anything else  out there. So John Roach passed away at the age of 83. Steven  Wilhite at the age of 84, a couple of the pioneers of the
