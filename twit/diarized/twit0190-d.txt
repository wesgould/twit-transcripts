I'll start with our in studio guest just one but I'm so glad to have her Neha Tawari is here.  It's good to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neha I just found out was an intern in the last days of tech TV.  She actually was the band that played nearer my god to the as a ship sank.  And then went on to revision three hosted pop siren produced texilla and we're so glad to have you welcome back from three months in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes a little bit of a break from life tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can give us the perspective the Indians perspective on tech although you were saying that where you are in northern India wasn't that wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.  I mean sometimes you would see people on the trains using laptops and stuff like that.  The cyber cafe is still very very popular.  That's where people go in India and that's where I mean having a home computer is is not something that that's widespread other than the metros and others and other cities not as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh the Internet Cafe.  That's kind of like that in other parts of the world I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so too when I was in China I saw some internet cafes there but they weren't as frequent.  I didn't see them as frequently as I did in India.  So you know but it was it was interesting because I'm one of those people that wakes up and gets on their computer and is just glued to it the entire day.  I'm sure a lot of you are the same way.  So in India I wasn't able to do that and it was just interesting to go outside and get some fresh air and interact with real people.  So very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah speaking of fresh air and real people from Oxford England our good buddy Mr.  Will Harris long time no see he's got his he's got a little glass of Sancerre there.  Hey Will.  Oh no he's lost his audio unmuted thyself.  Sorry you know it's great to be here.  It's great now that I can practice and I could see you via Skype a source.  Not only do I know you're speaking or not hearing but I could see what you're drinking and when all the way through John won't let us do that.  Also here from Port Angeles in the northern western most part of the United States of America for the continental US John C.  Dvorak.  Hi John.  Hey there.  Great to have you.  How was your Easter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you hide eggs for the little ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't actually have any little ones but we did hide eggs and of course now the eggs have money in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh that gets the kids going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So everybody's glad to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gold coins the leprechauns have been here.  Wow that's a great idea.  I was trying to hide eggs for my kid my 14 year old.  I said Henry can I hide some eggs?  He said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put a couple bucks in each one or five version you'll see he'll change his song.  You came up with a very good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People like how John sounds when he is in Port Angeles when he's up in Washington State and the reason is John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I'm using the fabulous PR 40 from a Hile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Hile PR 40 isn't that warm and luscious and delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I like about it is that in fact I think people should consider this when they're podcasting.  It's not condensed so that saves you typically a hundred dollars for a little preamp and it doesn't need a compressor.  So essentially you save like two hundred dollars right off the top for a least.  I mean you could really rack those numbers up if you want to and the mic I think is around 400.  So it's the equivalent of a two hundred dollar expense overall as opposed to when you know the mic I use.  I use an AKG cost about the same but I need these two pieces of equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's easier way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how do you get that?  I don't understand though.  You're getting that because it's it isn't a normal mic in the sense that it I mean it's it's a professional mic.  So you just can plug it in right into the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I have it.  I have an M audio.  You still using an audio.  Yeah, I just bought a second one for up here and the funny thing is is I decided to get it online.  So I scrounged around and I found some source.  I mean these things cost about I think about 150 bucks or something like that.  And so I found a source that they were like forty nine dollars.  I'm saying you refurbish they say so I get the thing and it's exactly the same exactly.  And it looks like it's never been used or touched and it's got these big labels on the box saying be stock, you know, not for retail or something like that.  And so so if you I'm happy with it, it's just you know, it's exactly the same as the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think we can thank I don't know if it was the California State Legislature or the courts for this because Dell I think it was was selling computers that have been returned.  You know, if somebody bought it and opened the box and then wanted and returned it as new and somebody sued and the court said no, you can't sell that stuff as new.  And as a result, all these companies have to say sell this stuff that isn't really used.  It's just returned or boxes open.  They can't sell it as new.  And so they we get this great benefit, although for 50 bucks is a big cut.  I mean most of the companies Dell sells this stuff and doesn't give you that kind of a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this and I have to recommend this thing.  I mean people when I first started working over at Mevio to get up to speed on all this stuff, I remember then this was like a couple of years ago.  I remember everybody saying now.  Now you can't use the USB.  You can't go through it under any circumstances.  It sucks.  You have to somehow go through.  This is what this does.  And I think it sounds just as good as anything.  I've heard that goes fully digital.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really a question whether you get good mic preamps and that thing and I think it has good mic preamps.  We're using it to send my audio to you and we use an M audio slightly higher in M audio just because that's what they had in stock and your audio is coming out that way.  So it works fine.  So you brought up a Will Harris.  You brought up the first story of the day and a surprising story.  The guys who created Skype, which we used to do this show.  You're on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John's on Skype and you make it look like Will Harris is John C.  Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know I have to type a new lower third form.  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that John's watching the video, he's not so nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone's a critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they're there.  They want to buy Skype back.  What's the story there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, according to the to the New York Times anyway,  Nicholas Sendham and Giannis Fris, who are the guys that actually started Skype,  of course, sold it to eBay for gosh, what like two, two and a half billion, three billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It ended up being three point one billion after all was said and done.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then and now, you know, eBay is kind of originally bought, I think, to integrate it with eBay so you could chat to the dealers and sellers, etc.  Never really sort of did it.  It's costing them stupendous amounts of money allegedly to keep it running.  Yeah, why did they buy them in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would make no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they wanted to do was have it so that if you were if you were on eBay and you wanted to ask a question of your seller,  which is like the number one impediment to buying something is you want to know something is that you could just easily call someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the number one thing sellers didn't want to do is talk to the customers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's a slight slight disaster.  But so they're now looking to buy it back and eBay, you know, according to this story, analysts say that eBay is looking for one point seven billion.  So they're looking to get back half their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they want a lot of money for it.  They're not going to let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  However, you know, saying they're saying that one point seven billion.  That's the value of Skype on the eBay balance sheet in 2007.  So you've got to imagine that the difference between the price in 2007 and the price today in the current market is going to be looking a little bit different.  These guys could get it back for less than a billion and probably flip it again in another three, two or three years.  Boy, talk about profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're going to have a two billion dollar profit out of this.  They're one and a half billion dollar profit out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder. I mean, their new project, Juiced, or their semi new project.  I mean, it seems to be doing OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no money in that. Do you think there is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think there's money in it.  But I think that, you know, they have good partnerships with networks and things like that.  And they have some decent content on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I wonder what their model is for making money on that.  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the model for making money is always on Juiced has always been to put ads in the content and then rev share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe they have I think they have pre-roll if I'm not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they do pre-roll and overlay and that kind of thing.  And they wanted to monetize the community to start generating chat around TV and then to start monetizing that kind of community.  Actually, they've they've kind of got nowhere.  It's kind of an open secret that nobody's buying ads.  The content is all the kind of stuff you can get everywhere else for free anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of junky. It's like Duke's a hazard quality.  I mean, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And they had, you know, the desktop client that was supposed to be the future of TV,  but nobody really wanted a desktop client.  And so they change it to Flash.  But then they've had to go and raise hundreds more, you know, millions of dollars to keep the thing going.  And I, you know, I think most people can see it tanking pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when it comes to that model, I think Hulu just has it going on.  I mean, a lot of people really like Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Hulu and I would bet Hulu is not making money either.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you say that, but of course, Hulu isn't actually available anywhere outside of the United States.  That's a difference.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, you know a little bit about this, Will, because as the guy who runs Channel Flip,  you're trying to make money in IPTV as well.  Absolutely.  Do you see Juiced as a competitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not really.  You know, Juiced come and sort of ask us for our content.  And the general line is, you know, well, how much is it going to be worth?  And the general line is, you know, we might be able to pay you a few dollars every month,  which is, you know, absolutely ridiculous.  So we don't really see them as a competitor at all.  You know, they're not making any content.  And that's what it's all about in the current day and age.  As you well know, it's all about making the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jamie's saying in our friend feed conversation that he believes Hulu is making money.  Do you think so, Will?  I mean, you know what it would take to make money in that case.  Oh, for sure.  You think they're making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the reason Hulu can make money is because they're basically selling ads on what's already like a sunk cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good point.  The only cost to them at this point is bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So the cost of making the content is like zero to go online because they've already sunk that cost for TV.  So anything they can make out of it online is just covering bandwidth and making profit.  It's incremental profit.  Yeah.  Now, whether you can maintain that going forward when there's less money in TV budgets is a kind of different question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I love Hulu, but I have to say I don't know how many ads.  I mean, there's not a lot of ads in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's again, I mean, with every show that you watch, there is the 30 second pre-roll.  And I've even seen, I think they also employ mid-roll too.  Yeah, they do.  They're interstitializing.  I mean, I would almost say that it's heavily advertised.  Compared to other networks that are doing content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will, how is the ad sales going at Channel Flip?  Are people buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really interesting.  I mean, without getting sort of too inside baseball, it's really interesting that TV spend in the UK is down drastically.  Online spend is up drastically.  And in particular, online video is really the only area where the market is holding up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been our experience too, our advertising.  We can't place it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you see is that generic media, the sort of MSNs of the world see their CPMs tanking because you have no idea who the audience is.  But where you can connect with a specialist audience and you know who that audience is with your podcast,  you know all the kind of people that are going to be listening to this, you know, all the demographic data, you do all the surveys.  And that audience is really, really valuable.  Whereas, you know, a generic 10 million people turn up to MSN.  It's like, well, who the hell are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to come back in just a bit and talk more about hitters been, hitters been twacked.  I mean, twacker has been hit.  I shouldn't have had that wine before the show.  Twitter has been hacked twice by the same Brooklyn kid who says, yeah, I did it.  It was me. I was the guy.  You know, we kind of knew because he sent everybody to his site.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Also, they're closing the pub on the Microsoft campus and the employees are getting together to save it.  Before we do that, though, I want to mention our friends at audible.com.  Audible is a great place to go to get your audio entertainment.  You love podcasts. You're going to love audible.com.  Audio books, 50,000 plus titles.  It's the world's greatest library of audio books.  And I, you know, I think it even does them a disservice to say audio books.  Audible is really, these are performances.  Some of the best readers reading some of the most amazing literature.  It is a wonderful resource.  You can learn while you're, you know, doing things that normally be completely time wasted  like sitting in the car driving, going to the gym, working out.  Give it a try right now.  You get the audible platinum account by going to audible.com slash twit two.  Audible.com slash twit two.  That's what you sign up for platinum.  That's what I have. You get two books a month.

Since we're eating wine, I'm drinking wine right now.  I think we should be talking about a little bit about food.  And I'm going to recommend a wonderful book.  Actually, this is a TV program.  Have you ever seen this splendid table?  They have TV shows on here too. The audio from the TV shows.  This is Lynn Rosetto Casper's incredible TV show.  And this is the one where she interviews the author of Julie and Julia,  365 Days, 524 Recipes, and One Tiny Apartment.  This is... I actually got to recommend that book,  because we recommended it before on Jumping Monkeys.  But what a story. This is a woman who ended up deciding to cook every recipe  in Julia Child's famous The Art of French Cooking.  524 recipes in one year.  And it's her story of doing that.  But these are just an example. I mean, it's everything from soup to nuts.  I mean, you can business, classics, education, fiction, history,  young adults. It's great for the kids.  Mysteries, thrillers, even romance.  And of course, lots of science and technology and sci-fi and fantasy titles.  I want you to try it right now. Go to audible.com slash twit2.  Sign up for the platinum account.  You're going to love it. Audible.com slash twit2.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  There's an example of an advertiser that just can't get enough of podcasts.  They're buying a lot of podcasts.  They supported us now.  They're in our second year of advertising with them.  I think it's what you said, Will. I think that it's almost a contrarian market.  We're doing better than we did when the economy was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, exactly. Everybody likes a good bit of specific advertising.  And you know, when you guys are talking about Audible, you know, it's really useful.  You know, I've got a plan and plan which I signed up for through this.  That's great. I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, of course. That's awesome. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm listening to a little Terry Pratchett.  I met Terry Pratchett last week. You did?  I went back into a Terry Pratchett kick. Oh, I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld books.  He is one of the best, funniest fantasy writers.  Huge fan. Suffering from Alzheimer's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terrible, terrible, but still very, still very worth it.  I'm going to horrendously name drop Bing.  And just go that when I was at the exclusive screening of the new Red Dwarf last week,  he turned up.  Bobby Llewellyn was there. Did you say hi to Bobby Llew?  Absolutely. I got in on his ticket.  Congratulations. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Congratulations on the relaunch of Red Dwarf.  That's such a fantastic job, I thought.  Really? You like it? I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We haven't seen it here yet.  No, you wouldn't. I hear you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to get on the ball and start downloading somewhere.  I'll find it. Yeah.  That is great. Yeah.  So how was Sir Terry Pratchett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very well. He was giving red carpet interviews all night, even though it was nothing to do with him.  He sort of turned up, I think, and saw the sort of red carpet where the camera crew was like,  ah, red carpet. I must need to be on that.  I'm Terry Pratchett.  I am. I proceed to spend the whole evening giving interviews and things, which is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw a weird article about him and some helmet that he's a brain helmet that he's wearing.  Did you see this? The magic light helmet that he's hoping will let him write?  Because despite the Alzheimer's, he's still writing, but he says it's very slow going.  He might write a sentence a day.  So he's using this bizarre light helmet that Dr. Gordon Dougal invented it,  and it's supposed to slow Alzheimer's.  I think it sounds pretty, pretty wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen, if listeners at Jones and if you've read Terry Pratchett,  Audible has a great selection of Pratchett that's read by a guy called Nigel Planer.  Yes.  And Nigel Planer is very famous for being in The Young Ones,  which was this kind of seminal British comedy of the 80s.  I didn't know that.  Nigel Planer does a very, very good disco book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's the light helmet.  You know what? This is a joke.  It's got three muffin fans from a laptop computer on it.  It looks absolutely insane.  But anything that helps Terry write, I'm all for.  Yeah, I listened to, in fact, I have, boy, I probably have a dozen Audible Discworld books.  The first one's on there, The Color of Magic.  That's the one you should start with.  Yeah.  You'll meet Rincewind and I love that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also Mort.  Mort is my favorite actually.  Love Mort.  The introduction of death and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I like Rincewind because he's kind of, he's like a Merlin,  but he's completely inept and terrified and goofy and it's just great.  He's like a bad, bad wizard.  Like a wizard is no good.  And just, it sucks.  Incompetent.  Incompetent wizard.  Let's talk a little bit about, I don't know.  I didn't, I'm kind of sandbagging you with this because this story just came out.  The Spitfire Club was going to open on Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division campus.  They were going to open a pub and they, for Microsofties to go to,  I guess because they're afraid of going out in the real world.  I don't know.  And they pulled the plug on the project.  The owner, Jonathan Sposato says,  I'm completely stunned and disappointed by the decision.  I'm confused by the sudden change of heart.  Spitfire apparently is a pub also in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood.  Ever been there, John?  The Spitfire Pub?  No, never.  Is this a good idea to have a pub on the campus at Microsoft?  See, companies do this so you'll never leave.  I think yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure a lot of the people who work at Microsoft spend a lot of hours there.  So it might have been a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been doing this, developing this for more than a year.  There was a competitive bidding process just weeks before it was open.  He had a fire.  The 22 employees he'd hired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's crazy.  I mean, I find it bizarre that Microsoft can have a gun club but not a pub.  They have a gun club?  Well, apparently there's a video on YouTube that has Microsoft Gun Club April 2009 finale.  From their Second Amendment Day.  It's hysterical.  So, go Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's a piece of news that's kind of interesting that's not being under covered.  Yes, sir.  These cables have been clipped down in the San Jose area.  Yes, this was sabotage.  And so I did a call them and market watch on this and then I got a note from someone saying South Carolina also had a similar situation.  None of this has been reported.  And then Eric, you know, of our channel, the VORAC, Eric, my son, he mentions that there was apparently a clip between Washington DC and some, I guess, some part of Virginia.  And so it looks like somebody's out there.  I have a theory on this.  To see what the results are, I guess.  I have a theory on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So for those who didn't know, because it was kind of a local story, San Jose, South Bay, the Silicon Valley's phone service, including cell service, completely died, was out for most of the day, tens of thousands of people without any service.  Fifty thousand actually.  They discovered that it was intentional sabotage.  But get this, this is where the fiber cables are.  The person would have had to open, move a fairly hefty manhole cover.  First, they'd have to know where they're going, right?  I mean, there's a lot of manhole covers.  They move the right manhole cover, climb down.  It's about two feet of water.  They'd be standing in.  They'd have to know which cables to cut.  They and they did.  They did all of that.  This is this is not just random vandalism.  Right.  So I bet you think in the same thing I'm thinking, John C. Davarack.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Terrorists.  Well, I wasn't.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, actually.  But the it seems like I don't know what kind of terrorists it would be.  I mean, it could be blackmailers or extortionists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, you'd have to know.  I mean, this is not I would not do this.  Nontrivial, nontrivial.  You say you have why would you do it?  I think it's a rehearsal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, what's the benefit?  It's a rehearsal. It's the same reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bad guys put software on the electrical grid.  We discovered this last week.  Wall Street Journal published a big story saying, you know,  there's software designed to shut down the electrical grid on many computers  on our electrical grid never used.  It's sitting there.  So my theory is if you're look, if you're bad guys,  if you're either terrorists or foreign nationals and you and you're planning,  you know, warfare, you need to know how this stuff works.  What you do is you try it out.  You do a rehearsal.  You see if it works.  And and, you know, you hope that it's three isolated incidents.  It's nobody's going to put two and two together.  You got to hope that I hope the Department of Homeland Security is at least as smart as John C.  Dvorak. But I think that's what's going on.  Why? I mean, who else would be doing this?  You think it's blackmail, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's doors that there are extortionists out there that pull this kind of thing.  And, you know, they do it with oil refineries.  They do it all. You know, we're going to do this and that if you don't give us money.  Although, you know, and we're probably would never find out if that was the case  because who the heck is going to tell us that, you know, somebody paid somebody off.  You know, in the situation like this, I'm not sure what what.  Yeah, we don't know. I guess it could.  You know, what the things I'd like to get a call out anybody has any if this is  anybody sees this happening anyplace else in the country, I think these are all  typically locally reported and nobody seeing it as a national story.  I did write it up in Market Watch is what I thought was a national story is a national story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the fact that they were able to cut this fiber, they knew where to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were able to. Well, I also pointed out the fact that like, for example,  we have a lot of fiber up here and it's very clearly marked.  I mean, it does say cut here to disconnect phone service.  Well, I know they tell you where the cable is because they don't want people with backhoes ripping it out.  And so, you know, we can it's not doesn't take a genius to find this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The outage affected some cell phones, Internet access and about fifty two thousand  two hundred Verizon household landlines in Santa Cruz and San Jose counties.  Cell phone networks by Verizon, Nextel and Sprint and some AT&T networks were also out.  I mean, this pretty effective was a little too easy if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really what the problem is.  And I think it's yeah, I think people think it's vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ATMs knocked out.  San Jose, St. Louis Regional Hospital in Gilroy canceled elective surgeries.  Wow. I mean, it's it's a big deal when this kind of thing happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it can be devastating to any community when something like this goes down and people don't understand  the magnitude of how how important it is to address these things.  You know, there's I think people see this not as a direct act of maybe something like terrorism.  And therefore, they don't address it as that or as a major issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think I hope, John, that you hear from somebody, because I think that this certainly raises that specter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some other outages here and there that we just haven't been reported  because it's always seen as a local thing.  But I mean, the idea would be just getting that you'd want to take a kind of map the the fiber network,  see which are important and find ones that intersect.  In other words, you'd have a whole area that could possibly be blacked out like a whole city,  or let's say by two cuts someplace because everything's you know, the network is not so I mean,  it used to be well, the Internet's supposed to be redundant.  You know, when it was designed for taking a bomb and all this stuff, that's not true anymore.  I don't know if it was ever true, but it's certainly not true.  Not ever true. But whatever the case is, it's not that redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. If you can knock it out by clipping a couple of things.  Speaking of bad actors, Mikey Mooney is a name you might want to keep in mind.  Mikey with two Y's. He's 17 years old.  He has a little website called stockdaily.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S-T-A-L-K. Don't go there.  Don't go there. Don't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He created a cross site scripting exploit that took advantage of a flaw in Twitter.  How many flaws are there going to be in Twitter?  How complicated is Twitter and why is it that it keeps getting hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do they keep adding weird stuff?  And then only when you tweet something you get a drop down that says,  you know, the thing has been updated and it goes back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't seen that because I haven't used Twitter in a while.  I'm ready to leave.  You hate Twitter. I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's been a little wonky.  It's really wonky.  Fail whales and fail whales and over.  I get a lot of over capacity. Twitter is over capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it happens, but it can be really frustrating too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's what's his name?  Ashton Kutcher.  It's the Ashton Kutcher phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tweeting pictures of Demi Moore's butt.  Yeah, that'll bring a site down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Ashton Kutcher effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the A plus K effect.  So this guy Mikey says, I am aware of the attack and yes, I am behind the attack.  Mikey described how he carried it out to, I think it was to see.  You think that's his voice?  Well, what do you think his voice sounds like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi.  No, I don't think it's high.  He's got a much of a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's 17, so the voice must have dropped by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Mikey doesn't get out much.  I think Mikey is a fine citizen.  You're just berating him for no good reason.  Mikey, Leo, you know where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just don't want to get hacked, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So wait a minute.  What does Mikey's virus actually do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Mikey says, I am the person who coded the XSS, that's a cross-site scripting exploit,  which then acted as a worm when it auto updated a user's profile and status, which then infected  other users who viewed their profile.  I did this out of boredom, to be honest.  I usually like to find vulnerabilities within websites and try not to cause too much damage.  But, you know, start a worm or something to give the developers an insight on the problem.  And while doing so, promoting myself and my website.  Mikey, not too bright.  Mikey pointed everybody to his website.  Mikey basically said, I did it in big red letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mikey expecting a knock on the door from the get-her-ons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Frank is more like, he's going to be Professor Frank when he grows up, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Infected users passwords were not compromised, according to Mikey.  Anyway, although I do notice that Twitter said change your password.  You might want to change your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's only if you were affected by it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they also suggest, you know, killing cookies, clearing your cache, changing your password.  Right.  And deleting all those messages saying, go to this site.  Go to stalkdaily.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But when I read the story, the first thing I checked though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you go to stalkdaily.com?  No, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank God, like I had no such hacking done.  Nor did any of my friends that I saw on my feed, at least.  I didn't get hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this a some sort of a felony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be it.  A felony.  It's against the wire.  What do they think?  They probably still have this.  The wire fraud rules.  I think that's what they use to prosecute people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some wire fraud rules that keeps people free.  But anyway, why would he get hacked if you actually went to Twitter.com?  If you're just using my channel.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  One at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Finish your thought, John, and then I'll let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is, why would he admit to this?  He apparently doesn't know it's a felony, maybe.  But the second thing, the bigger question, and always is the bigger question.  Why hasn't somebody knocked on his door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody must have by now.  We know he lives in Brooklyn.  We know his name.  We know his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's plenty of information about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says, I also I have run iloveads.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, he's using, you know, the media now to still promote what he's doing.  He hasn't stopped.  No.  Mikey Mooney is still at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and of course, our law enforcement is doing what exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hear there were some lines in San Jose that were cut.  I don't know.  Is that related?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The tweet that you would get.  Here it is.  I'll go to stalk daily so you don't have to.  It's got looks like it's got a picture of Elmer Fudd.  And here's the here's what he posts on the site.  I have came clean and accepted the responsibility for the worm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Read the interview here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have came clean.  I have came clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He looks like he completely stole the code from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's even got the same.  Let's see if it's got the Twitter terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it basically was.  It's like a clone.  I think he stole the stole everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see the privacy.  Stalk Daily provides this privacy policy.  I bet you it's exactly the same as the Twitter.  Privacy policy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know if his terms of service require that users of  this website accept the worm, I mean, I think you can get  around the felony thing with the terms of service based on  the way case laws been going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's a particular when you use this site you accept the  installation of software on your system to perform any deed  whatsoever.  Click here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  You think you could wave?  I think you could with the way it's being done.  I mean the way they say well, you know the shrink wrap law  the terms of service and all this other stuff the courts  uphold it.  Yeah.  So the question is well, what if you put it in the terms of  service that you're you're just going to you know hack people  so, you know, if you use this website, we are allowed to take  your credit card number.  Why not?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we could we could do anything we want to you.  Wow.  You think he's that smart that he might have written that in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I'm always waiting for somebody to do that.  I haven't seen it yet.  Maybe interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that the courts would say well nice try.  But all right.  Let me see.  Yeah, he'd probably play up the whole I'm a kid thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just a kid.  It's a harmless worm.  I'm 17.  What are you going to do?  All you have to do is change your password.  I didn't do any real harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see first paragraph Twitter provides his privacy  policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding  this collect their collection use disclosure personally  identifiable information.  Stalk Daily's privacy policy Stalk Daily provides his privacy  policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding  the collection use disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just did a search and replace on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This site is not directed to persons under 13.  I would be really great if we could find in here a clause  that says and by the way, we put a worm on your system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, you've been hacked.  You've been hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's exactly the same.  It's pretty that's pretty that's pretty bold of Mikey.  It is Mikey has a weak grasp of jurisprudence,  but he is a bold young man.  No one's knocked at the door.  Well, we don't know that he might be in custody.  I'm pretty sure we can guess where the fate of Mikey Mooney  lays Jackson Pollock not his real name says in our Facebook  page that standard did it in high school got everybody's  it's learning accounts.  Basically just edit all the dur dur to help to a Twitter  dur dur and the code and implement it change user password  boxes scripts to save and put redirect to Twitter.com.  It's easy.  Simon Jackson Paul, I hear voices voice.  That's my that's my nerdy.  That's your real name Jackson.  All right.  He says is his real name Jackson Pollock.  Yeah, didn't know the painter was also a hacker.  Amazing what you learn on Twitter these days.  What would you like a little cup of coffee some some anything  anything we could do for you here.  See John if you were here though the headphones.  Oh, I didn't know you couldn't hear the headphones are  actually not connected to anything but you can listen  all you want.  Yeah, you're hearing anything.  Those are terrible.  Are you hearing anything?  I can't hear anything.  No, they're not connected to anything over there for  reasons.  Tell me if you can't hear I'll turn it up then I could  probably hear better.  I didn't know you couldn't hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was a little hard for me to hear the boys on the  phone.  Men on the phone rather boys to men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you hear him now?  They're being very quiet.  How's that Sunsare is that delicious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was weird because John spoke but but Will's mouth  moved.  I'm very confused now.  Willie, I think you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's not back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  It just does connection stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Both of your connections aren't too good.  You know, it's ironic is you're using our 15 up.  I know I don't understand it because you're breaking up a  little bit too.  And you're on our very fancy new ethernet in the first mile  connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, really you have ethernet in the first mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's always got these new things.  This is every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is mental.  But you see with Skype of source, you don't know about  Skype of source.  Well, we have four different computers each running their  own instance of Skype and so we can have each one has its  own, you know video so we can see all the video and then  we got ethernet the first mile 9 megabits up and down true  actual rock solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like yeah, it's almost like being back in college.  I remember being in college and I had 100 meg in my room.  Oh man, and it was and you could get 100 meg up and down  the academic network in the UK.  I remember I remember getting like the entire open office  disk ISO in about 45 seconds.  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Front page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday Steve  Jobs maintains grip at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That headline sounds like so evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't say it sounds like he's not losing his grip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like it immediately sounds like Darth Vader doesn't  it when you see it when you hear like holding your grip  you immediately think of like I have you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's like evil sounding.  It's like it's like he's a Sith Lord and he has hold of  Apple still, you know, it's not it's not maintain control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not maintains influence is not continues to brand.  It's holds grip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well you just see the fist and I thought Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was the evil Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say they say insiders say that jobs is still running  the show that the board is in direct contact with jobs  and his doctors that they all anticipate Steve will come  back at the end of June John.  Do you find that credible?  No, but but but I do only because if they said that and  it didn't happen wouldn't we've talked about this before  but wouldn't that be kind of bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that the lawyers if let's say that this is not.  This is not 100% accurate.  What if it's disinformation?  I would suspect that the lawyers have been consulted before  they say anything about anything I would think and wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the lawyers say well to avoid exposure.  You should only tell the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will you say that but how often have they told the truth about  this whole harsh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they aren't telling the truth.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Well for now, you have the exact comment that we can look  at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, you want me to read the this is the you know  what?  Maybe we could parse the quote.  Maybe that's maybe that's the issue.  Maybe it's a question of getting the exact right sentence.  So let me let me pull up the Wall Street Journal.  I hate it when they make me want to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's actually really strategic for them to publish  something like this even if it even if it's not true  because if something happens or let's say if his health  fills further then it's not like someone's gonna say but  you said but you said you were going to come back and that's  why I invested more money in your stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the risk is that a stockholder lawsuit if they  say he's going to come back and the stockholders, you know  Apple stock is going up right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it did take a hit when you know, he was stepping down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but there seemed yeah, but it's but it's back like quite  a bit.  It's had in fact if since December Apple stock is up  considerably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're they're trying to ride that wave by just like  fueling the fire with this news.  Well, that's but I'm not saying apples like evil don't get me  wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's it seems like that would be a very risky risky  thing to do.  I'm sorry.  I'm still trying to pull up this article.  You know the walls I subscribe I actually pay for the Wall  Street Journal and I have a login and I can read these  article in full but it always wants me to log in again and  I don't remember my password and it's just a pain in the  took us you know, it's weird if you do a Google News search  for these stories.  Google has a link to the full story on Wall Street Journal  somehow.  Yeah, it's like a weird loophole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've noticed that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't understand it.  So let me go through Google News.  Venture Beat is saying well, I guess they're echoing the Wall  Street Journal.  Let's look at the Wall Street Journal article this it may be  that you might be right John if you parse it carefully, they  may not be saying anything.  Mr.  Jobs didn't respond to requests for comment Apple spokesman  Steve Dowling said quote Steve continues to look forward to  returning to Apple at the end of June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes absolutely no guarantees that he will he's  just looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very yeah, it's very carefully worded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Let's see what the let's see what the other quotes are.  Phil Schiller says we're just trying to do what we do every  day and that doesn't say anything does it maybe maybe the  journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really you know, that's informative.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably one of those things that's designed to sound  reassuring without actually giving any results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now they're quoting insiders also who say the jobs has still  is closely involved in key aspects of running the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Insiders who are not named and therefore cannot be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  viable in court insiders.  I'm trying to find there is a quote in here that they are  in touch with his doctors.  Let me just see if I can find that or like that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  working with his doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're they're constant touch.  Here it is people familiar with Apple's operations.  Oh again, you know unnamed say they still expect to see Mr.  Jobs return in June.  Some of these people also say members of Apple's board of  directors are monitoring the situation directly communicating  regularly with Mr.  Jobs physicians.  The author of this article is Yukari Iwatani.  Iwatani Kane.  I think the Journal has pretty good reporters, but do you  think that Kane got?  Suckered by Apple insiders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it wouldn't be the first time Apple has rolled out  unnamed insiders to not confirm or not deny any rumor that  may or may not be the case.  I mean we've had so many cases where you know like this, you  know, the famously, you know, what you call it Goldman on  CBS.  Jim Goldman just got completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jim worked at Tech TV as our business reporter and I have to  I be honest with you here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He always had a fondness for the public relations report,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, the press release.  Yeah, he kind of had a fondness for that.  Which is not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talking about talks which might not be talks which might not  be reassuring.  Did you see that allegedly the Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz and Steve  Omer had a face-to-face this week to discuss possible search  partnerships?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Once again, they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, according to sources closest to Yahoo, the  discussions are not about acquisition but are about some  kind of partnership that will involve Microsoft taking all  the value in Yahoo without actually paying any money for  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that is that your quote or is that actually what I made

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the last like that that might be the most honest quote I've  heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, why buy the company when you can do a search partnership  which is all you really want anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually very smart.  Yeah, I mean you're just getting what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not actually what they really wanted was the ad  network.  Wasn't it wasn't the ad network what they really want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well same thing search and ads and same thing these days.  Oh, they are absolutely.  What's the point of search without ads?  What's the point of ads without search you might argue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know search you're looking for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the only way to monetize a search is with an  ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if they did it, okay, well, I'm just saying that when  you say a search deal like, you know, Yahoo for a while had  a search deal with Google where it was Google search wasn't  Google ads.  So you're saying if they're saying a search deal, they  mean a search and ads deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only way you'd ever make any money.  Otherwise you'd just be paying money to get people to search  using your search engine, which I can't see would be that  interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I just this is the story.  This is the vampire of tech stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just will not.  This is the next one developing is the IBM Sun story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that was dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well now they're you know, now they're wondering with me  if he's going to come back and take over the company and  things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the story was that McNeely wanted to sell to I know no  Schwartz wanted to sell to IBM McNeely did not right.  This is his baby and Schwartz who's the current CEO realized  the writing was on the wall and said let's take the money  and run.  So you think Scott McNeely will kick Jonathan Schwartz out  and take take the company back.  That's what a lot of people think interesting.  Now this is very similar.  Isn't it to the the Yahoo deal where Jerry Yang didn't want  to sell?  Right Founders remorse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and a CEO when you're pushing hard for a second.  Opposite situation because you got the guy who did want to  sell being no matter what you do you can't win.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard to be tenable as a CEO when you're pushing really  hard for a sale and then the sale doesn't happen.  It's like we're going to be fine anyway, and it's like  we're going to be fine anyway.  Why are you putting for sale so hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't heard a lot from Carol Bartz.  This must be your first.  This is her first action going to talk to Steve Ballmer.  They probably know each other from the good old days.  Let's take her.  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back and talk about the Palm pre rumor  has it it might be coming sooner.  Then later which would be a very good thing not just for  the Palm but for people who are trying to decide well,  should I get an iPhone or should I get a Palm pre we  can expect a new iPhone in June?  What should the timing be for the iPhone killer from Palm  before we talk about that though?  Let me mention our friends at Squarespace.com.  Squarespace is a great place to do your blog.  I'm moving my stuff over to Squarespace.com.  It's a hosted blogging solution that is just fantastic.  If you go to Squarespace.com slash Twitter right now,  you can see a little bit.  In fact, you can actually try it free for two weeks.  No credit card or anything.  Just the instant create an account instantly.  See the hundreds of templates beautiful templates,  but once you've got the template then how customization  works is beautiful.  They're using a lot of Ajax to make it you could you  literally can drag and drop column widths,  you know, you know slide it over but that's for beginners  if you're a CSS expert you can get right into the CSS  and customize to your heart's desire.  A very great administrative UI.  I've used them all from all the blogs.  This one's the best I've ever seen and it comes with now.  I don't want to say blogs because it's not just blogs  it has a blog module which by the way supports import  and export for WordPress for blogger for movable type  and for type pad.  So your data isn't locked in.  It's easy to move in and easy to move out should you choose.  There's a forum great forum software and imagine your website.  You have all of this functionality photo gallery a form  builder.  There's Google Maps integration.  There's Disqus integration.  I use Disqus as my commenting system like that was my concern  when we were talking about moving over.  I said, yeah, I'd love to move over.  I like everything but I want to use my I want to continue  to use my Disqus comment system.  They said no problem one line of JavaScript.  It's easy.  The cloud architecture of the design makes it very speedy  and very stable and should the traffic suddenly ramp up,  you know, you got Doug or tweeted.  It handles it.  It's and that's one of the reasons I want to move it over  there because every time we send a lot of traffic to Twitter  it kills Leo Phil and vice versa.  They're on the same server great website tracking built-in  search engine optimization.  Give it a try.  It's free Squarespace.com slash twit and then if you decide to  buy use twit as the offer code, you'll save 10% no credit card  necessary to try it Squarespace.com so article in after dawn.com  which was for a long time a great site for kind of information  about ripping DVDs and so forth.  They're saying it may be out the Palm pre may be out in May  according to a bright hand sprint employees have been granted  no vacation time in the month of May.  This is that same story that we heard at AT&T when the iPhones  come out the expected release date May 17th.  May 17th that would be very interesting and interesting strategy  too because I think everybody agrees that in the June time frame  you're going to see a new iPhone which is better for Palm is it  better to release the pre before or after Apple updates its iPhone  everybody's very interested in what Apple is going to do with  the third generation iPhone that 3.0 software is very popular.  Will you still using your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I never put it down.  It's one of those things where you kind of don't realize how  you could possibly have lived your life before it actually happened  before you got the iPhone like how did you manage to work or  exist?  So yeah, I still use it.  I think you know the Palm pre is going to have it hard because  it will have a really nice big market splash in you know,  I think May is looking like a pretty likely timeframe from what  I know and then it's just going to get I don't want to say it's  going to get blown away in June by the new iPhone but Apple is  going to have I think probably something pretty compelling for  the new iPhone in June and so, you know the pre might have a  really nice window.  It's better for the pre to come before the new iPhone I would  say rather than after the new iPhone because there's every  chance that it could you know, it could be dead before it's alive  in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the well let me think about this now, of course, you know  there are other iPhone killers was the Blackberry storm which  was terrible terrible and the Samsung instinct terrible.  So is it better for them?  I don't know.  I think you probably want to come out before the iPhone.  I think you're right.  What about Neha?  Are you an iPhone user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not I use your Blackberry.  I'm a Blackberry Pearl user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It comes down to that doesn't it's Blackberry or iPhone.  Those are the choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is and you know, I've been using it for a long time.  I I had a job a little while ago where they gave me an iPhone  to use.  So I used it for a couple of months and I liked it.  I was originally very anti iPhone because you know, it's  like you go out in a social situation and everyone just has  their their iPhone out and it's like this weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm any Twitter because it's kind of that,  you know, they're all Twittering.  That's what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's a little annoying.  I'm sorry.  I very annoying.  I just think it kind of takes out the fun of people do that  with Blackberry's to you can't and I know and I I Twitter I  tweet from my Blackberry as well.  And so that's just as annoying.  So I understand that but I'm curious like I wonder do you  think that some people who may have resisted the iPhone like  maybe, you know, really anti Apple PC people do you think  that they may really go for the pre versus I'm really interested

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the pre I'd love to if I would love to to and I think it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just looks really simplistic and that it was called the prey.  I'm sorry.  Is it pray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you'd name it.  Over the E so it's pre there's the line over the line.  Why would you get long if your company's going down and this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is your last hope right pre bankruptcy or pray for help one  of the two.  Why would you name the thing either one of those both of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  suck, but yeah, it's not the greatest name must be is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think marginally worse pray pray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We pray that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm great joy, which as far as design and everything just  from the gallery and things that you can just tell on a  very superficial level.  It looks it looks nice enough.  I like that.  It's kind of a slider phone to I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's got a nice touchscreen.  You still get a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's something that I mean you do you have  an iPhone.  Of course you do.  Do you miss having a keyboard?  No, like a real tough guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  You know, when I first got it, I kind of went back to the  Blackberry for a walk because I really couldn't type on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing that that killed me and you know what you have to trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the Steve.  You have to let the Steve flow through you and what happens  is as you type you're typing the all the wrong letters because  it's impossible because especially with my fingers you  can't but you just trust in the Steve and then at the end  of the word you will have typed x3419 l2 and it will say  hello.  It just knows what you meant and you just hit space and it  goes on you've got to trust you don't trust.  That's your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't I like the feeling of buttons.  I'm a very tactile person and I like having the buttons  for keyboards.  That's why I've stayed with with Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What John?  I'm just saying I got a message from someone the other day  that believes this to you know, the you know, believe in the  force and I couldn't read it.  It was just a bunch of crap.  I mean just like it was unreadable.  This reminds me a lot of that.  What was the what was the Newton remember that there was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  joke, you know, you remember the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish it.  No, I don't remember.  I remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many Newtons does it take to screw in a light bulb?  Farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Some exactly.  That's very good.  Was it for almost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what what so many of these sort of handset manufacturers  miss is that you know, the handset is really only three  quarters of the experience or half the experience.  The other half the experience is your desktop interaction.  And the fact that you know with mobile me, okay, so it sucked  to start with but now you have auto updating, you know,  synchronizing over the air 24 7 from your computer to your  phone.  You've got all your music back and forth really really easily.  You've got an easy way of transferring apps and getting  new apps and do it, you know, the actual phone hardware is  now like such a relatively small part of the experience  compared to the platform and the computer integration and  I just don't see the palm has like any plan for doing that  beyond some kind of open source or developer store, which  you know, which they haven't made any attempt as far as I  can see to integrate particularly well with any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you agree though?  I mean back in its day Palm pilots and stuff.  They did have pretty good.  Oh, they owned they they owned they own.  So, I mean, what's what's not to say that this too will have  great desktop integration and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots.  Well, where's Jeff Hawkins when we need him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All true.  He's off inventing a human a machine brain, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's the guy behind the whole thing and that's why they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rocked in the early days and but you got to say that they  what they what they did was smart is they went out and they  got John Rubenstein and all the iPhone engineers over to do  this.  So a lot of the guys who were instrumental in design of the  original iPhone are worked on the pre we'll see it'd be very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm reminded of that Blackberry clunker that you've got there  the storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a piece of junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was very disappointed by that.  I was thinking of getting the storm, but then when I played  with it, I was like, no, I think I'm just going to stick  with the Pearl.  The Pearl's still good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not a pearl.  I like the curb, but you know, I think the bold and the  89 hundred these the newer black phones do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bold is the daddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, well, I feel like I'm it's kind of you know, it's funny.  I for a long time.  I really resisted the whole phone thing and and I had one  phone but anytime I go anywhere especially because of the radio  show, right?  Anytime I go anywhere.  All of the radio station executives and salespeople all  they ever want to talk about is cell phones and I realized  for the non geek the cell phone is technology, right?  It's the one they're most into they're most aware of and so  as a result, I said I think I better know more about cell  phones and it's turned out actually to be a was a good  move, but it does require I have accounts with every carrier.  I know it's expensive.  But look at this.  Here's the Android.  This is the the Google the Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of like the Android just because it's kind of funky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  I guess here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's where and I thought I was sitting in the chair chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a giant no and and and and it's all right.  It says sorry process Android process.  A core is not responding.  I mean this happens all the time the battery life dies.  I mean, there's a lot to be said for it, but it's it's just  not a reliable.  I think it's the handset.  I don't think it's Android.  I think it's the the G1.  I really had high hopes for this one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot of hype surrounding it when it came out.  One thing I would like to know as far as the pre is is it  as fragile as the iPhone you think the iPhone's fragile?  I think so.  I mean, I've seen so many broken one.  I've seen so many cracked screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My son is my we did a father-son thing a couple of days  ago.  We jailbroke our iPhones together was really nice.  All that's so sweet touching moments.  He says dad.  I want to learn how to hack.  I said, well, let's let's start with Joe.  Good.  That voice.  Yeah, dad.  My I want to be Mikey.  I look up to Mikey.  I want to start a site and hack Twitter and make everybody  go to my site.  Can you help me?  You know what?  When he says that my kids by both my kids say that I say,  well, okay, first we got to learn bash shell programming  and that shuts him up right away.  That would you bash shell programming, but it's true,  right?  If you're gonna be a hacker, you got to know the bash shell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you say you could just be a script kitty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't not know kid of mine is gonna be a script kitty.  Anyway, so we jailbroke it and he found immediately an  application that puts cracks on your screen when you touch  it and it really looks realistic.  It looked so he totally he goes up to his friends say,  oh dude, I broke my iPhone and they'll go.  Oh man, it hurts you viscerally when you see that.  Oh, it is because it's shards of glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is just so painful to see that it's terrible.  Yeah, but I'm curious if this is if this would be  I don't think this is that vulnerable similar issue,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know glass screens glass screens.  You know exactly.  Let's see, you know, I just Jason Calacanis keeps bugging  me.  He's in Korea and he wants to show off his bandwidth.  So maybe we'll give him a jingle in a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bandwidth in Korea is overrated really because you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  were you came back singing its praises.  No, you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not really.  I was I think I was complaining.  Oh, I think they I think they talk a big game over there  and maybe at the University or someplace like that.  I have some speed but the funny thing was I had in fact Ken  Rutkowski took us over there.  He was complaining bitterly.  I have a video of him complaining about he says is  bogus and then just out of the blue of like about six months  ago, one of the guy the network analysts over at Mevio was  giving a presentation showing the various speeds on the edge  Korea was the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well edge is terrible.  You mean it mean they're talking about like at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Akamai Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh at the edge of the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh really that where you'd have all these, you know, you're  supposed to have all this boost and it was the worst of the  whole all the country internationally.  And then of course I asked him about that and they said well  it's possible that you know, because the Koreans don't don't  do this or that maybe it's just a fake number but I doubt  that the connection is going to be that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How interesting I you know, this is this was like the big  thing like they're the the wired most wired nation, you know  who really has a lot of bandwidth Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Sweden does have a lot of bandwidth.  That's first place I saw IPTV and it was years ago and it  was just like cable TV.  It was so good.  You could click click click right through any channels.  It was you know, you wouldn't even know you weren't on cable  TV.  Yeah, because it was 30 megs like everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many of our Swedish listeners say they've got a hundred megs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's 30 megs three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see.  I think Jason's on the let me see if I can get Jason on the  line here from here after I have to twist his knobs.  I don't even know which knob is probably like that.  Oh, it begins already.  Jason, can you hear me?  Oh, we lost this connection.  I guess that great South Korean bandwidth failed us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The irony key irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Irony connection lost.  I have no connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sweden just has it all going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny.  I don't know what happened there.  All right, moving on to yet another fascinating story.  Did you see the journal article about that?  Oh, I guess we already kind of talked about spies in the grid  didn't we that was our we kind of talked about that peripherally  at the very top of the show.  The Zune HD.  There's a good story.  Y'all excited.  All right.  This is this is a common topic for me something I've always  hated the cost of SMS messages.  I once calculated that at the typical cost of 20 cents a message  140 byte message you're paying $1,500 a megabyte.  Seems high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That seems high.  You guys have such a remedial SMS system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's terrible.  And you know the phone companies use this as a way to take  advantage of us basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  How do you manage your teenage girls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you might be right because Dina Christofferson of Cheyenne,  Wyoming got quite a surprise in the mail the other day.  She's a Wyoming 13 year old mom and dad thought that they had  turned off text messaging on her phone and as a result they  never ordered a text messaging plan.  Oh, that was a big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a bad idea to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dina sent or received 20,000 text messages in one.  How about that?  In one billing cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Does this girl speak or does she just text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's doing a 700 texts a day rate more or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember incoming counts as well as outgoing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could subscribe to Twitter for instance and say I  want all my Twitter messages to come in and out in and out  and boom, bing, bang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you want to take a guess at what her bill was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to go with around about $5,000.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bingo.  Were you reading the article?  You, you.  Cheater.  It was $4,750.  Her father Greg Christofferson told KUSATV in Denver that he  thought texting had been disabled on the phone.  When he got the bill, he took a hammer and smashed the phone  into pieces.  That's discipline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dina will text no more.  But I don't blame Dina on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I blame Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually I blame her parents for taking off text  messaging altogether.  That wasn't, that was just a bad idea.  If your child has a text messaging problem.  Do you text a lot?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not $5,000 worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  20, not 20,000 messages.  No, and I Twitter it like everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think I text that much and even you know, but  you know who does text a lot are Indian people in India.  Everyone is it's all about SMS in there.  There's no voicemail in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Brits too, right?  Everybody texts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually college kids in this country too.  Absolutely text like crazy, which I think is because we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  voicemail in the UK though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody uses voicemail, but most people will interact  with with SMS and it's because it doesn't cost you anything  to receive an SMS over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can and most and you practically can't buy it.  You can't buy a voice plan these days.  It doesn't come with with messages built in.  So you really really struggle to spend a lot of money on  texting.  I mean the iPhone comes with like, I don't know a thousand  messages a month or something just as part of the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I paid the 20 bucks a month for unlimited texting.  So I use it whenever I can.  Right Leo Leo Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you don't text you don't answer email.  You don't do anything.  You just sit there and broadcast like a spider in my web

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  whenever we can which is like, you know once a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I actually I do I use text messaging.  I text my kids and stuff kids really do.  You're right.  John college kids and even teenagers in the US have  discovered texting for a long time.  They did not text when I was in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't that and that was it's come on strong lately.  Now.  I think it's huge back then.  It wasn't as big.  Yeah, the whole SMS thing.  Well, I believe me I paid for unlimited for Henry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Abby told me she's in France right now and she  says because it's so expensive to make cell phone calls.  Nobody makes calls.  They text.  That's all they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I found this in India too.  I mean I had a cell phone there and it was is it pricey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it can be if you're roaming or if you're making an  out-of-state call it can be pricey.  It's actually cheaper to just SMS somebody right or have  them call you or something like that.  But there is no voicemail in India.  So SMS is like the way to leave them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't get that.  You mean you can't leave a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's no voicemail on landlines either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do people have answering machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure about landlines.  Most people there.  I mean most people that I knew there have mobiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't have landlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  That's interesting.  I thought they would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some people do but the mobile phone is much more common.  Like everyone everybody down to like my teeny tiny nieces  and nephews have cell phones there.  Wow, that's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think the one thing about texting that's interesting  is really a very efficient way to communicate.  You know, you have the text.  Nobody wants to crank out long messages, especially if they  don't have a keyboard.  And they but if you do have a keyboard even you don't want  to just keep typing and typing.  So it's really I think, you know, you set up an appointment  you go to meet somebody.  It's just real quick and easy and I think it's an outstanding  way to communicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I well that's exactly why I use it.  I prefer it to you know, Kevin Rose mentioned a few weeks  ago on the show that he is now sending out with all of his  emails this thing from three sentences is three dot sent  ten dot es and it says I only answer in three lines all my  email.  It's the same idea.  It's like if it's a hundred forty characters is enough for  text.  That's all you're getting for me.  And he says it saves him a lot of time.  I couldn't really do that.  I can't but texting is great in terms of efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the best hack that I found for that was that, you know,  if you're sending an email from a mobile device, most people  are quite happy, you know, for the fact you can be punctuated  badly.  It's going to be short.  It's going to be Kurt.  So someone suggested to me that you just put on your desktop  client as your signature sent from Blackberry or sent from  iPhone and then you can just send one line of place to  everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You will ever thought about I thought about that too.  I thought because I said why don't I just put that on there  as my signature because then I can don't do about the  misspellings, you know, but doesn't it still bother you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It still bothers me whenever I get like a really weird sms  or reason, but still it still bothers me.  Like I don't I don't like when people over abbreviate things  like it still bothers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what bothers me you like you just to letter you.  Yeah, and then they just start taking out vowels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's just Z's and I just don't even know how old are you  now?  You sound like a little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We use the whole word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I sound like a complaining old lady, but no really  I can't I can't handle it.  It just it's really it hurts my eyes to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're old-fashioned for such a young person.  I guess I rarely use vowels anymore.  I would say you were you and like all marketing people or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  products.  Do you remember John who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Number two was somebody we worked for at the Ziff Davis.  He was a young hot executive.  He and his wife worked there and they ended up in New  Mexico or Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was his name?  Oh Ronnie Sonnenberg and Jeff Ballew Jeff Ballew Jeff Ballew

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to prove how what a busy executive he was would never  punctuate never uppercase all his emails were all lowercase  with no periods and that bugged the hell out of me because I  knew that was a pose that was like I'm busy.  I don't have time to punctuate.  Yeah, actually Bill Gates.  I think Bill Gates does that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Balmer when I last time we got a note from  him.  It was kind of similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't either.  I don't like that at all.  If you don't have time to send me a message then just don't  send it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you don't have time spell it properly don't spell it all  what the cameras where they belong and please there's the  difference between it's with an apostrophe and it's without  keep your thoughts to yourself.  We've got grammar girl day hot to worry with us today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's annoying.  It hurts my eyes and like I've deleted messages.  My eyes.  I'm just like forget it.  I'm not reading this.  This is garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't like my kids.  In fact, you know one of the reasons Abby's very smart,  but one of the reasons she didn't do so well in her she  got a 750 on her SAT verbal, but she got like world knows  she's I'm proud of that.  That's a good very good, but like a 590 on the written  because she doesn't punctuate or spell because she doesn't  know how but I kind of blame this and it may I may be wrong,  but I blame this on the schools.  Yeah, there was a fad called whole language.  Do you remember that fad where they they they got kids  writing like in second grade very early and they said,  oh, I vaguely remember don't pay attention to spelling.  Don't pay attention to punctuation.  Is this like Montessori school stuff kind of Montessori was  a little bit.  You know, they taught in the public schools.  It was like it was a little touchy feel.  It was like, oh no, we just want them to write.  They don't have to worry about and so she never studied  phonetics.  They didn't study phonetics and then doing any of that stuff  and as a result, that's how she writes without punctuation  and spelling.  I think it was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was a all these experimental things turn out to be  miss.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, you know, it could be spell check.  That's that's ruining the youth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the things she says is that when they  didn't have spell check at the SATs.  What was I supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My mom used to say that when I used to do math was oh you  people with your calculators.  You'll never learn math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What she learned in albacus.  What did she use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I guess well because she was raised in India and  I guess they they're really big on teaching you like your  multiplication tables to like 50.  Wow, and she can like calculate and compute things in her  head that are amazing.  Like she's just like a math whiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big article actually in the Times today about Google.  This is that same article we've seen over and over again from  the tech sector saying we need more H1B visas.  There you know, there people in America kids are not getting  well-educated.  We need more students from India in particular China to be  able to come here to college and then we don't let them come  here to work and Google said we could hire, you know, we could  get the engineers we need but they won't let us they won't  give us visas and they highlighted one Google engineer  who did have a visa to work in the United States, but is why  they're both Indian nationals.  His wife did not so they live in Canada because he can't work  here's in the Google Maps division.  He works out of the Google sales office in Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you, you know something interesting when I was in Delhi.  We had to fill out some paperwork at the at the consulate  there and it was interesting because you know, you see lines  for every country there.  The longest line was for the United States.  I mean they had the UK they had you know, all kinds of random  countries are there.  They're all in the same area, but the very longest line was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the United States people want to come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want to study want to come here and everyone in the line  was very like young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say I think it's interesting because we do have  a I think a crappy secondary school system.  Yeah, but we have a very good college system.  We probably have the best University system in the world  oddly enough.  I don't know how that happened.  So kids they go to school in India.  They learn their math.  To the 50.  Abacus.  Yeah, and then they go to college in the States.  Yeah, but they're not allowed to stay here and work and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a cousin who's actually doing that.  He's getting his Masters in engineering and at the University  of Florida very and he's very smart.  But you know, he can't stay here after he's done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kiwi nerd who's a professor of physics at the University of  Toronto says very succinctly private wealth public squalor.  I guess that's true.  Although you went to University of California, which is a very  good public school.  Yeah, run school.  I I love the best schools in the country and I felt like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thought that education was was quite good and I had a lot of  friends who were in the EECS program or the electrical  engineering computer science program very competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a Cal fan, right John?  I went to Cal too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, all right.  He was in when I got my degree in history.  I bailed out of the engineering side of things.  I couldn't handle it and very competitive.  It's it's too competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very hard.  I was it like that social life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They come over here and boom.  They just kick your ass.  What are you supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were there were you know, you were there in this late 60s  mid-60s.  I was there back in the 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where are they?  They're there.  Take your buddy in the school back when I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were there a lot of Asian students there when you went  there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was all in the engineering.  It was all Asians all from China and they just basically  worked all day and worked all night.  They never went out.  They never went on dates and never showed up at parties and  never did anything.  He said, you know, work and study work and study work and  study and go back to China.  And the next thing you know, we're like getting these and  they're you know marching off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's still many students who are even in my in my day when  I was there.  There was there was a lot of that as well.  Foreign students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's worse now.  I thought I was actually surprised to hear it's that was  that way even back in the day.  I didn't know that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Always better.  It means now it's actually more Asian because they you know,  they've got sick of the white kids coming in there and then  causing riots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me let me I'm going to pose a question that I'm going to  take a break.  But the question you may based your lamb your leg of lamb John,  but the question I'm going to pose you is well if you were  going to graduate school today and you had your choice of any  anything you would like to study what would be the number  one the fastest growing graduate school profession the one,  you know that has the best future.  This is going to shock you.  We'll talk about in just a second.  But first I want to mention my friends that go to my PC.  These are the folks at Citrix go to my PC is a very very  cool remote access program.  It's really as far as I'm concerned the best remote access  out there go to my PC.com.  It has to be you know, there are free choices.  I know there are free choices out there for you for remote  access.  So how does somebody create a product that you pay for by  making it easier to use by making it faster by making it  work on any computer anywhere and absolutely securely.  There have been a lot of remote access exploits.  You might have read about in the last few months not go to  my PC.  These guys know what they're doing.  It is totally secure 128 bit SSL encryption.  The beauty of go to my PC is complete net traversal you go  to you.  The way it works is you if you can do it right now go to go  to my PC.com slash twit.  That's the website go to my PC.com slash twit and for free  you can sign up for 30 days.  Now.  Here's the beauty takes a couple of minutes to sign up.  You'll notice immediately what I didn't have to configure the  router.  I don't have to open ports.  No you may for the other guys you don't because it's using  full net traversal now anywhere you go anywhere you can get  online whether it's at home.  They go home early whether it's an internet cafe even a sketch  internet cafe in India and Agra whether it's airport or a  hotel you log on to go to my PC.com you have it a 128 bit  SSL encrypted connection.  They pass you on to your office computer.  You are now point-to-point encrypted to your office  computer.  You could do anything you would do if you were sitting there  you see it full screen so you can send and receive email run  programs access resources.  It's a it's a effectively a VPN by the way you could surf the  net to completely securely even in the most sketch of places  PC world gave it their world-class award for best  remote access software.  It's that good if you know sometimes people worry about  security in new technologies if you've been worried maybe  something example they use in the is online banking.  It took people a while to feel like it was safe to do that.  If you've been worried about that, let me tell you the  security on go to my PC is the best you can get and Citrix  knows this stuff fast easy secure.  It's a simple pitch.  I want you to try it free for 30 days go to go to my PC.com  slash twit and try it absolutely free.  So newspapers are going under magazines going under the blogger.  It's the age of the blogger.  So according to the Pew Research Center 5000 newspaper jobs  gone in 2008 since 2001 more than 10,000 journalists out of  work 47,000 unemployed and yet journalism programs cannot  cannot make enough room for new journalism students.  Columbia Stanford and NYU applications up 38% 20% and 6%  respectively from the previous year University of Colorado  up 11% University of North Carolina up 14% Maryland up 25%  what's going on people are spending it's the average price  for graduate school including living expenses $31,000 a year  the best they could hope for getting a job 40,000 a year as  a journalist and there aren't that many jobs.  What are they thinking?  Would you go to J school today?  Nehar did you what did you study in college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a confession to make what I actually applied to grad  school for journalism for J's to do doing it Berkeley.  Yep.  Why and I practically was like basically waitlisted and they  told me to reapply because it was oversold.  Yeah, and but you know what now I'm kind of like what was  I thinking do I really want to be that much in debt two  years from now like do I seriously what I mean why would  I why did I even make that decision and again, I think  grad school is a great thing and I think I did it because  at that time I felt like that would be the right thing to  do.  But you know, I'm not I'm not shocked.  I think what's happening here is I think a lot of people  feel like okay.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm like a journalist or I'm whatever you think it's bloggers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who do this who say I just want to get a okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I need I need a little bit more cred so I can go to  J school buy me some cred.  Okay at 31,000 31,000 be in debt that I'll never pay off  with my 45k job that I get out of grad school.  But you know, I I couldn't tell you what I what personally  I was thinking when I decided to apply to J school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's great.  I'd love to see bloggers and online journalists have that  training.  I guess why John what what do you think what's going on?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've taught at the Cal not as a professor but as a guest  lecturer with when Markov and Greg Zachary were teaching at  Cal and of course then then they began teaching at Stanford  and it's interesting because the students that come through  there are kind of generational every group is different,  but I don't know what the value of it would be to a to a blogger.  I mean, I think the I'm that you couldn't get elsewhere.  And the other thing is it's like there's nothing like on  the job training taking a bunch of graduate courses in  journalism is different than getting a job at a newspaper  someplace where you actually have people yelling at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no patience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like going to the Columbia School of Broadcasting  then becoming a DJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's not yeah, or even actually even the Paul Allen  School of Broadcasting was more valuable generally because  you were on the air for years.  And actually that's where I got my degree at the Paul Allen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  School of Broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I was just saying that you know, nothing works like experience  especially when it comes to writing, you know, the more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you J school copper.  I mean, is that going to count in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to do you any good at this.  What about ethics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about learning?  You know kind of the collected wisdom of journalists over the  years, isn't there something to be gained?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They teach you that in undergrad too.  I mean, I mean one of my core classes and my mass comm major  was an ethics course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear that.  You know, I mean that's one thing you could say bloggers  don't have.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would think that undergraduate journal.  I don't know what the point of the graduate school is.  I mean undergrad one or two courses in journalism, you know,  as an undergrad and working on the school paper and you can  always get it.  I mean I wrote for the Daily Cal and  is really all you really need from that from then on you can  just, you know, either pick it up on the job or whatever.  I don't you know, the problem is is that in the United States  that everybody wants to think of journalism as a profession  whereas in most of the rest of the world in England in  particular is thought of as a trade.  I'm a brick layer and it's like yeah, well, that's what it  is and it's not rocket science and I don't think you have to  be a genius.  It is a fighter.  It's kind of a dumb job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's completely skill.  It's a craft in that sense.  It's a craft in that sense, right?  It is.  Yeah, it's like being a painter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, I guess you're the wrong guy to ask here, Will Harris,  because you went to school to be a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of good thatchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The barrister Will Harris will now respond for the crown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, I think I think that it's a lot of the sort  of up, you know, because I see a lot and up taking people  wanting to do journalism.  I think it's because a lot of, you know, teenagers and school  kids are getting a taste for publishing online and for having  their stuff, you know, read and having their thoughts put out  there and it makes them think about journalism in a way,  you know, it's blogging and you know, the sort of social  media revolution and such has kind of made journalism a bit  sexier possibly than it was before, you know, a bit more  attractive to people to get involved with.  However, I absolutely agree with John that, you know, taking  a post-grad journalism course is is kind of mental at this  point.  You'd be far better off just going and getting a job getting,  you know, any kind of job any kind of freelance posting your  own essays to your blog and then using that to, you know,  get yourself a gig somewhere is far more valuable actual  experience and then going and getting a grad, you know, a grad  course for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let's well, I'm sorry, but let's mention one more thing  about journalism colleges schools or whatever like the Columbia  School of Journalism.  Originally they were they were brought into professionalized  the the the trade and it was done in a way and in fact you  most people that really take a lot of journalism to get a  degree in it.  It was designed to create cogs for cogs in the wheel.  So you'd have like a neutral writing style with no voice.  You weren't really a writer.  You were a journalist.  You were reporter.  You knew how to do it.  You wouldn't you could work at any newspaper.  You would fit right into the scheme of things.  You know, you weren't a columnist.  You weren't somebody trying to express themselves.  You were just this cog in the wheel.  You were trained and it like just like a lawyer to do you  know to be able to do a job anywhere and that was the idea  and so you end up with a whole bunch of people that are  overtrained in journalism and this is a controversial thing.  I'm saying some people will deny it.  But the fact is very few of them can do much more than report  or good reporters, but they're not, you know, authors are very  few of them become novelists.  A few of them can break away from it.  But generally speaking, they write in a voiceless style that  anybody can read.  It's fairly neutral and they're taught this, you know, the  principles of neutrality even though it's hard to maintain  and it doesn't apply anymore.  The whole world's changed.  This is not going to fly.  We think the probably partisan writing is going to probably,  you know, return to the fore which it was in the like the  1800s where you know newspapers used to be like the press  Democrat who used to be a you know on one side of an issue  and there were papers of the independent is you know, that  kind of thing.  Everybody had a political perspective in these papers and  that's where it's headed with blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also where it's heading with television.  I mean gosh you wouldn't start a news channel unless you could  figure out where you were right left or center right these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's interesting too because when I was talking to  them to see like what they were looking for it's not I mean my  experience is mostly in the kind of the internet spectrum all  the writing that I've done has been in that kind of blogging  creative style and ultimately it seems like the board or  whoever's deciding who gets admission into grad school.  They're looking for people who are like newspaper journalists  or people who are much more traditional which was fascinating  to me because that's not the future.  So here was that very within the last three years.  Wow.  Yeah, so that was eye-opening for me and it made me you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lucky you didn't get in to be honest with you.  I'm thinking so I just got a lot of money and can train in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a profession is dying exactly and I don't think that I really  need perhaps I did not I don't really need that training and  I got it working at places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know my daughter said she wants to learn the family  business by going to Emerson and studying the broadcast program  and I said that ain't this family's business.  I don't know what business it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think your dad is Johnny Walker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be fun to go to like I mean if I was you know thinking  about it and I had to go to a big school, you know, maybe  San Diego State which has a good broadcasting program or  UCLA USC for you know, maybe a movie career.  But you know, I would just say just go to you know for people  that just are floating around if they can find a good junior  college like see, you know College of San Mateo and just  go there for you know a year and just take broadcasting and  you know a few other things like that and work in the studio  because they're on the air.  I mean, this is that's the closest that station is as good  as almost anything going on around the Bay Area.  Yeah, actually surprisingly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really want to I mean we're in such a state of flux now,  but I really wonder if you have such an opportunity now to  get your chops in the in the actual environment whether it's  doing a podcast or a or video streaming or on a blog writing.  It's almost seems like that's the best way to learn and isn't  that how journalists used to learn it was a trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they used to be taken under somebody's wing.  It was an apprenticeship.  Yeah, but right here.  I mean, let's face it.  You're a little operation over there is not coming from some  guy who doesn't know anything who's never been around the  block has never worked in the business who doesn't have a  broadcasting background.  It's like extremely professional for a reason other people  I've seen I don't see anybody else bringing up, you know,  their game up to the level that you have that or that are rank  amateurs and don't have any help whatsoever for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right.  There needs to be more mentoring going on.  I you know, I've always mentored as much as I can and  invited people in and said here's how we do it and given them  feedback.  I mean, I think that that's important.  I remember when I got into broadcasting, you know, I never  went to broadcast school.  I just did it and I was pretty awful for the first five years  and I remember trying to get the years.  School is this five years.  No, no, I didn't go to school.  I mean, it was the school of hard knocks.  I mean, I you know, can I be honest?  I was terrible for the first 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was on the I was one of those guys, you know, hey, welcome  to the show.  We're going to have a great show for you coming up in just  a little bit.  We're going to play a little music from Steely Dad.  But right now it's the Doobie Brothers.  Jesus is just all right.  You have the total announcer voice.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should go back to that.  Maybe that was my future.  Anyway, I do remember when I was starting out that there was  this ethos and and that the people who are all we're doing  it right now would would it would take you under their wing  and teach you and bring you up and I think that that was  and and they always said to me, you know, I'm going to take  you under my wing.  I'm going to mentor you.  I'm going to show you what I know at broadcasting but you  got to pass it along.  You got to pass it pay it forward.  And I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very true.  And I think I mean I feel very lucky to have had mentors just  mentors that I made actually at Tech TV.  I mean like wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was walking around my underwear drunk by the time you  got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean like for example, like Sarah Sarah Lane has been  a mentor to me even well, I meant toward her so it all  works out.  Yeah.  And even at revision 3 she she mentored me as well.  I still I still look up to her is that spirit isn't there  there still is that spirit and if and there's been people  who are interns when I worked at revision 3 I tried to you  know pass on the torch and teach them whatever I know to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if the ShamWow guy has taken mentees on because  I'm thinking that might be my future.  I think you'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love to do that.  Hey camera guy.  Look at this.  I'd love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm kind of doing that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I am a pitch guy.  There's a certain amount of that has to happen.  You know Monster Cable is at it again.  They are suing a company called Monster Transmission.  I don't know why you would get confused once you trans  that when you go to Monster Transmission and performance  in Florida that you would think you're maybe buying high  priced over some say overpriced cables from Monster Cable.  Remember they also see well, you know, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I got the answer.  The cables transmit data and electricity and so Transmission  is a word that they could employ in their sales pitch.  And so someone might be confused by Monster Transmission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I learned a little bit about this.  We have we have a lawyer now because we there are a few  companies that are doing streaming stuff with the word  Twitter and while I you know, I the Twitter is, you know,  a different area, you know, they have a trade actually they  don't you know what else I found out.  They don't have a trademark yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they but it's been pending for a couple of years.  I don't know what's going on anyway.  So we want to stop people from doing any streaming media  or or podcasts or you know any audio entertainment or video  entertainment under the name twit of any kind even if it's  about Twitter.  So I talked to the lawyer and he said the only the only way  you can sue in this case is if people could be reasonably  confused about what they're getting, you know, yeah, so if  somebody does twit shoes, there's no confusion.  It's a different business.  Nobody's thinking they're getting twit the podcast or Twitter  the microblog when they buy it which shoes so I don't know  how Monster even can justify this.  It's just out of it seems far-fetched.  It's also bad PR.  The whole geek community is down on these guys now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not the first time though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What real what real geek would use their stuff is just expensive.  That's a good point.  It's it's overpriced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They apparently want to own the name Monster.  So you're not going to hear any monster podcast coming out  of here.  That's for sure.  The monster movie monster microblogging monster microblogging.  Yeah, I just go to monoprice.com.  They've never sued anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know the worst the worst for this is Intel Intel  is absolutely dreadful going around and trying to sue anybody  that has you know, the word Intel in any context in the  domain name or their company and of course, you know Intel's  really commonly used as like an abbreviation for intelligence  like for the intelligence community.  There's all kind of websites that are all about, you know,  next generation Intel or whatever.com and they get sued  out of existence by Intel interesting.  I didn't know that Intel is has some of the most hardcore  trademark and copyright guys around the you can you can  Google any number of websites that have got sort of kind  of valid Intel complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's let's see on that note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, there's a couple of more notes.  You want to go baste your lamb go ahead.  There's a couple more notes.  One is I don't think we talked about this last week.  Maybe we did actually did we did talk about Time Warner  lowering these caps introducing 50 gigabyte caps in some  countries are some counties or cities some regions in the  United States on which is a ridiculously low number, but now  it comes out that they perhaps are going to offer tier pricing.  So this is kind of a one-two punch.  They first tell places like Austin, Texas.  We're going to limit you to 50 gigabytes a month and then  they say oh, but if you're willing to pay $150 you can  have unlimited download.  We've kind of gone back and forth about this before John  you and I is that seem like a good solution to bandwidth  caps is just tier the pricing and that's your that's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  been your argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you've always wanted to do that.  So you know what you're trying to do is you're trying to  get me to drop my argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't want it to be that way.  But I think that if you're going to if you do if you are  going to offer caps you you've got to have some rational  tearing going on.  I mean 50 gigabyte cap is a is a is ridiculous John.  You couldn't watch you can listen all my shows if you had  a 50 gigabyte cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I have a cap.  I have a meter on my system and it monitors to my usage and  I think and I'm a pretty heavy user.  I don't listen to all your shows.  I mean I should.  Yeah, you should but I don't listen to all your shows either.  You do as many as I max 30 gigs a month max.  I can't make myself get more than 30 gigs a month.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Well, they're going to they're apparently they're planning  they say 30% of our customers use less than a gigabyte.  They're going to offer a $15 a month high-speed internet.  Well relatively high-speed download speeds of 768 kilobits  upload 128 kilobits for $15 a month.  I think that's great.  But if you go over that gigabyte, it's $2 a gigabyte  additional.  They will also have a 10 gigabyte 20 gigabyte 40 gigabyte  and 60 gigabyte caps.  And so you in a hundred for let's say you want a hundred  gigabytes 75 bucks a month 10 megabits per second uploads  at one megabit this this to me kind of makes sense.  I have to say this is the way to handle it.  What is your argument?  You think it should be unlimited?  Me?  No, you don't do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I thought it should be charged by the bit but that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's a reasonable solution instead of charging by the bit  just say, you know, here's here's your Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are people that don't use it a lot to just use email  that why are they paying these high ridiculous prices?  I think they should have fast access.  You know, everyone should have the same, you know blazing  speeds and if you're not going to use it that much, you  know, you don't shouldn't be paying for it.  I mean, why I feel sorry for people that you know, you  got one guy next door was just hogging bandwidth and  going crazy and downloading everything they can and then  somebody else who just does email.  I mean, why they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually coming around to your way of thinking your  position was well, it costs the company's money.  I don't think it costs them as much as they like you to  think it costs them.  It costs the company's money to offer better service.  So charge for better service.  I don't think that's such a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that people are going to get caught up in the  overages though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean I would worry about that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That can end up expensive depending on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's what happens with soft phone plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just hate I hate the whole concept of having an overage  and an overage fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want unlimited.  I would buy I would buy whatever the unlimited was because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just don't want to be limited by anything right and with  this you still even though it's tier and perhaps it's better  for people who just check their email are very minimal usage  but for those normal use it's well, you know, it seems to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  me the way it should be done if you're going to use tiered  is that if you have a low tier and you're subscribing  and blah blah blah and you all of a sudden jump to the overage  mark, you should just be billed for the next tier.  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there should it shouldn't be like a incremental overage  thing which which is what this is which would which and which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm describing is similar to my charge by the bit thing  because essentially you'd have to pay more because you were  you jumped over a some sort of a plateau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is the I think this is sensible.  So the top of the top of the line service is 75 bucks a month  for that you get a hundred gigabits and a hundred gigabytes  as I mentioned at 10 megabits per second down and one up  but a buck gigabyte extra per gigabyte capped at 75.  So now by the way, they say this is just we're trying this  out.  This is not the you know, this may all change but they say  so so if you pay so that's what I would probably get I would  get the 75 buck a month service.  That's kind of the top of the line service knowing it could  never go over 150 bucks.  Even if I just used a ton of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I recommend people go on the net and find some of these  meters that you can meter your own usage where to take a look  at what you know, where do you know I get on the other computer  at the other house.  So I like that idea.  Yeah, that's a great solution to that sits there and it's just  meters, but it only meters on that machine.  It doesn't mean you're the whole network.  Suppose of someone that would I'd love a meter that would

Transcript:  meter everything coming into this room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's probably something.  I mean if you look around there, there are meters and they just  you know, essentially counting bits as it flies across the  network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  I mean we use a ton of bandwidth here.  Oh, no bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You put this probably some sniffer that would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your internet cost you will will sinking way getting  lower and lower on the screen.  That's on Sarah's gotten to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  It's like 20 quid a month 20 quid a month.  I think for for 10 down one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  And is there a bandwidth cap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not bad.  If there is I've never encountered it.  It's one of those things where they call it unlimited, but  with like fair use and your fair use is never really quite  defined, but I download quite a lot as you might expect and  I've never really encountered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you and I are kind of in the same business.  We offer rich bandwidth content.  You channel flip is, you know, if people downloaded everything  you did that could add up.  So you must have a dog in the sun.  I mean you must care a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what I mean what we have over here that's kind of  interesting is that I mean, I don't have a bandwidth cap,  but routinely packages are sold on the amount that you can  download.  So most people if they buy the standard package from the  standard operator will have like a 10 gigabyte cap.  And that's just like, you know, they'll pay ten quid a month.  They'll get 10 gig and that's it.  They might pay 15 quid a month and get a 50 gig and that's  it.  And they might pay 20 quid and get an unlimited cap.  There's no differentiator in speed only in the amount that  you can download.  But we tend to not see any effect of that though because  the people who really want the extra bandwidth will just pay  the extra five quid and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Hey, I was just seeing Guardian 653 in our chat room.  He's using the tomato router, which is firmware.  We actually run the firmware on our Linksys WRT 54G and it  does monitor your monthly bandwidth use.  He says he listens to most of the shows, watches, rather  watches most of the shows live on Twitter 92 gigabytes a  month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's possible.  Get out of the house for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get some sunshine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look at the graphs of the data that we're sucking for  people watching on.  We have three channels now, Ustream, Stickam and BitGravity.  We're doing two or three terabytes a day now in video.  So if I had to pay for that, I'd be in real trouble.  That's a lot of video.  That's a lot of video.  A lot of video.  All right, I'm going to...  200 gigabytes at the warehouse.  Colleen says she watches, she meters you with the tomato.  You use the tomato, probably don't meter.  The warehouse and that's a bunch of users.  How many different users?  Where she lives?  Three different users?  200 gigabytes a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to know what you guys...  You're BitTorrent.  You're using BitTorrent, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's without BitTorrent?  Wow.  That's excluding the BitTorrent traffic, she says.  They do it, not her.  We want to make that perfectly clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Colleen doesn't use Torrents.
