Transcript:  Yeah, I had a little spot of surgery. And it's not that I couldn't have done it in Italy. It's just that because I'd just registered on their health care system, it would take 18 months for them to do it.  Yeah, because you just moved there.  Right, right. So they said, just go home, take care of it and come back.

Transcript:  I will say this, and this is not a spoiler, but for all the comic book fans who loved the original series in graphic novel format, they went in a completely different direction, which is awesome.  So you don't know what's going to happen.  You can't say, well, I read the book and said no, no, bear with this whatsoever.  Though I've learned three hours long.  Yes.

Transcript:  This is the weirdest thing.

Start time: 352.10
End time: 378.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can swing in front of you for your food.  But the only bad thing is almost universally in that theater, when you do press the button  to make the seat goes out, it goes does.  It's really embarrassing.  You got no, that was the seat.  It's very embarrassing.  And you can't even get in there.  And you can't even get in there.  You got no, that was the seat.  It's very embarrassing.  Am I wrong?

Start time: 379.00
End time: 386.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, you're perfect.  And you know what?  Those little slide out tables are a perfect place to put a little tripod for your camera  so you can tape the film.  Exactly.  It's very solid.

Start time: 387.00
End time: 388.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  All right.  That's the last you're going to hear about the Avengers in this entire episode.  I just had to get that in.  We might talk a little bit about the Game of Thrones.  No, no, no, no, no spoilers.  Although this is the big battle.  Do you follow that, Paris?

Start time: 406.49
End time: 413.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had followed most of Game of Thrones up until like the last season or two.  Whenever it diverged from the books, I got disappointed.  Oh, wow.  And left.

Start time: 414.35
End time: 417.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a higher geek.  That's like meta geek.  I respect that.  Yeah.

Start time: 418.10
End time: 435.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like.  So, really, because I feel like the dot, like it went from being like this very like long  buildup show, you know, where there was, it would take like seven episodes for somebody  to travel across the world and then all of these plot lines would kind of perfectly align  to total fan service.  But maybe it's changed in the past couple of seasons.  Please don't at me on Twitter.

Start time: 436.48
End time: 442.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is like the ultimate geek kind of humble.  Well, I stopped watching when it diverged the books.

Start time: 443.10
End time: 453.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Game of Thrones is one of the very, very, very few series that I actually  enjoyed it in a on screen version more than the book version.  It's almost universally.

Start time: 454.41
End time: 468.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the other way around.  Part of the problem, though, is I don't believe George R.R. Martin has finished the books.  No, and they know that they can't wait.  They can't wait for him.  Yeah.  It's like, dude, we're getting here to episode season six.  We got you got to finish the book, dudes.

Start time: 470.29
End time: 489.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm working on those for the rest of time.  No, the last book is going to end with the final chapter of the last book.  I already know what it is.  It's Jon Snow wakes up and the entire thing's been a dream.  Oh, and he actually lives on a space station.  It's Westworld.  It's just a tie in from HBO series.  Yeah.  Spoiler. Sorry.  Spoiler. Sorry.

Start time: 490.38
End time: 492.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, yeah, Jon Snow is actually Dolores.

Start time: 493.46
End time: 502.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a big night tonight, though, because I believe this is the longest battle in all  of like movie and television or something.

Start time: 502.59
End time: 504.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a battle that's going to go for three weeks.

Start time: 504.78
End time: 507.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're losing at least three main characters.

Start time: 508.06
End time: 512.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the last last week, it was like everybody's kind of basically saying goodbye.  Right. Exactly.

Start time: 513.06
End time: 515.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So honestly, better than Thanos can do.  It's more than half.

Start time: 517.00
End time: 528.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other cool thing about that is when they shot it, they actually shot it out of  sequence so that you couldn't tell today who was dying by who was leaving the set.  Oh, that's really clever.  That's actually that's a good idea.

Start time: 529.26
End time: 551.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you one person who we know died.  The Galaxy Fold.  Beautiful. I was prepared to go Friday against all best advice, because as we all know, the  Galaxy Fold failed in the hands of Mark Gurman, Marques Brownlee, Steve Kovac, Dieter  Bohn, at least four, maybe more.

Start time: 552.00
End time: 558.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just failed, but failed in different ways.  So it wasn't the same defect that was causing it.  It was there's a design problem with the phone.

Start time: 559.74
End time: 563.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just failed in different ways, but failed in different ways in two days.  Exactly.

Start time: 567.07
End time: 583.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not really.  And there were so many tech, like, I don't know, people who were supposed to be reviewing  this that just acts.  There was a like small film over it that looked like a screen protector.  But when you pulled it off, the total phone collapsed because that's apparently supposed  to just be kept on the entire time.  This tiny film.

Start time: 584.44
End time: 590.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, they didn't apparently in the box or tell the reviewers at any point, don't  take the film off.  They just thought they wouldn't.

Start time: 591.54
End time: 596.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But apparently it's like in the instructions somewhere in the book.  But you know, people are definitely.

Start time: 596.04
End time: 603.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense to me because for us Asians, we always keep the plastic on everything.  So, I mean, our phones are still working fine.  I don't know what's the problem.

Start time: 604.06
End time: 681.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably what I don't want to stereotype.  But that may well be what we're thinking.  South Korea is like, why would anybody remove that?  I know it's plastic.  It comes from the factory.  Why would you?  My Samsung Galaxy S10 came with a screen protector.  I don't like screen protectors, but it's pre-installed, factory installed.  I immediately peeled it off.  So I understand why reviewers who had already looked at the S10 said, oh, yeah, this is  like the S10.  Anyway, last week when we convened, there was some question about whether Samsung would  still sell it.  I actually pledged, you know, I'm going to go buy it because I was really curious before  it broke, in the few hours before they lost the phone, many reviewers reported this is  actually better than you think.  This is a very interesting way for a phone to work.  A small screen on the front that you could just do notifications or make calls.  But when you want more, you've got more by opening it up.  I think I remember one reviewer saying, I get it now.  And so I was prepared because I knew that they'd take it back if it broke.  But I guess I'm not going to get the chance.  The real question is, if we'll ever get the chance to buy a Galaxy Fold, AT&T weirdly  sent out an email saying, oh, yeah, June 13th, we're going to have it.  Samsung said, no, what are you saying?  But now I'm thinking maybe June 13th.  Maybe Samsung's smart and saying we're not going to say a day until we figure out what's  going on.

Start time: 682.30
End time: 699.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's still interesting tech and it's still something I'd love to get my hands on.  But I mean, the problem with the phone is what everyone thought was going to be with  the phone, which is durability of a folding screen.  Works great in the lab.  It works great when you have someone there who's telling you how to use it.  Now, take that out and misuse it a thousand ways.  And will it still work?  And of course not.

Start time: 700.12
End time: 712.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But taking that misuse it one way, it won't work.  Dale Poco in our chat room said, you know what they should have done is put another  film on top of that film saying don't take off the next film.

Start time: 713.55
End time: 766.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then you get to peel one thing.  Yeah.  One of the most interesting developments with this, though, that I think is the whole I  fix it saga.  So I fix it for, I guess those who don't know is this website where they do really good  teardowns of phones, devices, all sorts of things.  And they did a good teardown of it.  And one of my colleagues, Luis Matsakis, had written about it specifically because they  found some interesting things kind of like that there was a kind of notch hole in it  that maybe food or something could have fallen in eventually and messed up the phone.  But within a couple of days of posting this review and tear down, they took it down from  their main site and said that the person that I guess they had gotten it from had asked  them to remove it, that they can't really say anything more.  But that it is no longer going to be a published story, which I think is incredibly odd.

Start time: 767.08
End time: 821.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And certainly among among tech journalists, Twitter, I was seeing lots of blowback on  that. You know, you have like your first blowback where everybody's saying this phone is breaking.  It's it's going to get into people's hands and it's going to fail.  I saw so much criticism of Samsung and whoever this person was, you know, the partnership  there, essentially pulling this this excellent piece from my fix it.  And that's just like I think that Samsung has potentially done some harm for themselves  in not just one.  Well, another way, but also in terms of their relationship with journalists and particularly  those who consider sort of the traditional aspects of journalism and how we don't want to  censor these good pieces by saying, oh, no, we're pulling that because we are taking back  the phone. Not a good look.

Start time: 822.73
End time: 861.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I fix it.  Who, by the way, we should mention is a sponsor of some of our shows.  I fix it wrote, we're under no obligation to remove our analysis, legal or otherwise.  But out of respect for the partner that provided us with the phone, and we don't know who that  is. And that's who Samsung contacted, by the way, not I fix it, but the partner who made  the phone, whom we consider an ally in making devices more repairable.  We're choosing to withdraw our story until we could purchase a Galaxy Fold at retail.  That may be a while, but it had the Streisand effect because yes, something on the Internet  doesn't go away just because you take the link down.  It's already an archive.org.  You can read it.

Start time: 862.00
End time: 864.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thirty replies to that tweet with the link, the archive link.

Start time: 867.03
End time: 870.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the big thing you accomplished, except to attract more attention.

Start time: 870.28
End time: 906.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the big ticket items were that it got a two out of 10 on the repairability scale.  And the big, big item was the fact that they found there was no real way to keep dust from  ending up within the OLED enclosure.  And that's what's causing a lot of the problems.  You get any dust in there whatsoever.  When you fold it closed, the OLEDs tend to fold inward on themselves.  And if there's any particles whatsoever, you will cause damage every time you close it.  So, I mean, that was the big takeaway from the teardown, which is interesting system,  of course, not very repairable.  Everything is glued into everything else.  But the screen seems designed to fail.  It's not it can't last.

Start time: 907.44
End time: 916.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OLED screens are notoriously fragile, right?  So that's the problem.  And only an OLED screen can be bent in this way because it's not glass, it's plastic.

Start time: 917.12
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in order to keep that flexibility, you need a way to keep contaminants out of the  enclosure in which the OLED is sandwiched.  And they didn't because there's a visible gap.

Start time: 926.00
End time: 960.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I'm just a little bit now.  I'm just curious what you all think.  I have Samsung's the number one manufacturer of phones in the world.  Number two goes back and forth between Huawei and Apple.  But Samsung is big.  I am a big fan of the notes.  I was from day one.  I think this S10 is the best phone I've ever had.  So I have I feel bad for Samsung.  And I'm wondering, do you guys feel bad for Samsung?  Or do you think it serves them right?  I mean, I don't feel bad for or go ahead.  Your turn.

Start time: 961.44
End time: 1026.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I don't feel bad for Samsung, but I feel bad for or well, OK,  I can't feel bad for Samsung because I feel bad that the company has tried a new thing  and it is not, you know, this to be innovative, to try something new and for something like  folding phones, which we've seen these reviewers say there is something to this.  I feel bad that it failed in that way.  But when we see when I fix it, takes it apart and sees that there are all of these reasons  why it failed, that's the part where I don't feel as bad for the company itself and where  like a little bit of schadenfreude comes in.  But in terms of a company stepping out and trying something new.  Yeah, it's kind of like a person who doesn't normally dance getting out on the dance floor.  Yes.  And you want to give them a little pass.  Yeah, you're encouraging them and you do want to give them a pass.  Even if they're biting their lower lip.  Exactly.  At least they're dancing.  If there's dust getting into the outfit they're wearing, you know, and it's OK.  And I'm glad that they tried it.  And so Samsung, you keep dancing, honey.

Start time: 1028.51
End time: 1030.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Paris?  What's your reaction?  Yeah, I agree.

Start time: 1031.60
End time: 1068.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm happy that they tried this, but I'm also I mean, Samsung is a large company.  I'm more confused than anything that they would allow this to get to the stage where  they're giving phones to tech reviewers and the sense of going to roll it out soon while  the phone is clearly, I mean, as the I fix it review showed, has some serious issues  with it that I mean, if a team of just like bloggers taking it apart could tell that,  then I feel like all of Samsung probably should have seen this coming before they handed it  out to a bunch of people who have the power to point out all of these obvious mistakes.  You do wonder how this happened.

Start time: 1070.51
End time: 1076.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they had some interesting technology.  They thought they'd been working on this for at least five years.  But you feel like they never gave it to a human.

Start time: 1077.00
End time: 1089.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they gave it to a machine that tested the opening and closing was like very  carefully balancing the pressure along all the edges and, you know, give it to a three  year old.

Start time: 1090.95
End time: 1095.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly right.  Why is there no child trying this device out to see if it passes?

Start time: 1096.56
End time: 1141.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because no child should have a two thousand dollar phone.  OK, that's right.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  This is not going to affect Samsung all that much because they they're billions of phones  don't typically come from the top end that we deal with.  Yes, they sell all of the almost feature phones.  Right.  So this is this.  I'm with you, Mike.  I think this is a chance for us to see what might be possible.  I want Samsung to keep doing this, even if it does make mean more mistakes.  Two thousand dollars was a crazy price point, which meant that very few people were actually  going to buy it except the status symbols.  So, you know, yeah, should they have waited in hindsight?  Maybe a tiny bit.  But it looked like an interesting enough product that people would pay two grand to get one.  I would have.

Transcript:  know, pre-release stuff.  I usually turn it down because I don't want pre-production stuff for sure.  Sometimes it is.  And you can't really judge a product based on its pre-production.  You pay for access, though.  Yeah, you do, because they harass you.  They don't mean to, but the publicist call you up and say, how's that review going?  You like it?  And then after you review it, hey, what's the matter with you?  And yeah, I prefer not to deal with PR people.  It's actually even a step worse than that now.

Transcript:  And I feel like that's one of the major issues with the review-based world is that, I mean,  there was what the scandal with whenever the iPhone X kind of came out, I believe whenever  they did not give iPhone X pre-release models to certain outlets that had written poorly  about Apple in years past.  But of course, I guess that's Apple's prerogative.  They can do what they want, but it's ridiculous that this whole market is kind of, it depends  on the quality of your review and how much Apple or Samsung or whatever company you're  talking about is actually going to like what you produce.

Start time: 1244.16
End time: 1288.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there's always an undercurrent of that, but Apple is surprisingly unabashed.  And Microsoft in its heyday in the 90s was very much like this.  In punishing the people, the journalists it didn't like and rewarding the journalists  it did like.  Dvorak always tells the story of walking by somebody's office at Microsoft, a big, big  executive, and there was a blackboard with basically an enemies list.  These are the people we don't like.  And Dvorak was very proud that he was on that list.  Microsoft never was afraid to do that.  Apple now is really wielding its power, I think, to do that.  It's not you're right, Paris, it's they're right, but it's also wrong.

Transcript:  But to be clear, this is not unique to the tech world.  I mean, this is every journalistic venue on the planet.  Car magazines are notorious.  Car magazines.  Or you want to be in the financial markets.  Well, you have to play nice with the banks to get the information and then you have to  decide when you're going to spend that.  Washington, D.C.  You don't get access if you don't play nice.  You want to be a White House reporter.  There are certain rules you're going to have to follow.  You want to follow the beltway.  Well, you have to play by their ball.  So it's not just a tech thing.  We just notice it more because especially now it's the influencer culture.  Yeah, that drives me crazy.  I mean, it's it's fire festival in the Silicon Valley.

Trey, as probably most of our viewers know, because he's been a regular on our  network, is a fabulous photographer who was able to use Instagram and other platforms like  Google Plus and Facebook to build a great career.  But he says the influencers on Instagram have really just ruined it, not just real influencers,  but phony influencers.  There's so much money to be made as an influencer on Instagram.

Start time: 1379.32
End time: 1398.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is different. It's more kind of about the account like the spawn con economy in the influencer  world and how I guess because you just mentioned fake influencers are particularly damaging for the  Instagram world. And it kind of deals with that in the sense that the rise of spawn con, this is the  online version.

Transcript:  Inside the weird and booming industry of online influence.  And part of the problem is people are buying followers.

Start time: 1410.10
End time: 1464.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, basically part of the issue is that the metrics and ways in which we view and value  content or ideas online, we kind of view them as the equivalent, like as their real world equivalents.  Oh, if this tweet or Instagram post has thousands and thousands of likes and comments, then that's valuable  content. And people agree with that idea or maybe like that post.  But that isn't always true because all of these metrics can be very easily bought and often are.  And none of them hold the same weight as their real world equivalents.  Nor are there any real ways to check whether, let's say, these 10,000 likes are real or fake or the first  thousand were fake. And that's what boosted them to get 9000 more real ones.  And it's like, how do you even begin to balance the weight of content and the value of content or ideas online?  You can't really.

Start time: 1465.28
End time: 1520.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was an interesting paper by I believe it was MIT's Media Lab where they were able to show what  manipulated metrics look like versus organic metrics, because in an organic metric, let's say you've got a tweet  or an Instagram post that's particularly popular, you get a big boom at the start and then it just kind of tapers off.  And it does sort of just decline into obscurity. When you've got a boosted post, what you see is it actually starts low  and then it goes high. And then every time it starts to decline, it goes back up.  Wow.  But the problem with that is you can't just look at that chart and say, well, they're cheating and they're not,  because you get the same thing if you pay for it through Twitter or Facebook.  So the only difference is, do I pay Facebook or do I pay my army of bots to get that continually boosted post?  And part of the issue.  Oh, sorry. No, no, no, please, please continue.

Start time: 1521.34
End time: 1569.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. And part of the issue is now that the fakers and the people who kind of sell the, it's called like social,  like SMM panels is often where people kind of get these fake likes and everything like that.  They're now offering services that specifically exist to kind of counter that narrative,  where one place that I often kind of go to check the temperature of the online fake economy is this place called Social Media SM Garden.  And I've seen recently as they offer slow likes or slow YouTube views, no drops,  which means essentially that you would get if you buy 10,000 or 100,000 views on YouTube video,  they'll trickle them in every hour on the hour for a couple of days.  Right. And they watch all the way through.  You know, there are the other types where, oh my gosh, I got a million views,

Start time: 1572.90
End time: 1623.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but 90 percent of them dropped after the first 15 seconds.  And you can actually buy full engagement.  You can tell them, no, I want you to actually download and be active the entire time of the video.  So it's a cat and mouse game.  And there's a part of me that says we kind of did this. Right.  I mean, this is our industry. This is this is Twitter. This is online where we this is not Twitter.  No, but in the sense, in the sense that one of the big selling points when when you started this this revolution of where advertising dollars go,  is we said, look, we can tell you where your advertising money is being spent.  We can show you the engagement.  We can show you much better metrics than you can get off of the old Nielsen system.  So we created a system that looked more honest, but now it's being gamed in.  And there's no easy fix for that.

Start time: 1624.16
End time: 1639.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my question is, though, who is really harmed by this fake?  So it's not really readers, because if you're not if you don't really have a million followers,  they're not nobody's really seeing you, except a bunch of bots.  You're trying to trick Samsung. You're trying to trick the companies to give you money. Right.

Start time: 1640.56
End time: 1670.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes and no, because yes, they're fake.  But and and Paris, you alluded to this.  It might be fake at the beginning, but because of the way that search engines are weighed.  Yeah. Since since you've got so much fake popularity, now you're actually getting organic views.  Well, OK. Now, do we consider is that fair game now?  Is that table stakes?  Do I have to pay a little bit to get my post boosted above the noise in order to give it a chance to get popular?  Yeah. And I don't know the answer to that.

Start time: 1670.02
End time: 1745.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think of the where it where that ends up leading to is it plays into the content cycle.  Like, let's say one thing that I think about, which is a total hypothetical, but I think is a good example of this.  You remember after the Parkland shooting, there was a large news cycle about how one of the top the top video on YouTube was about  the crisis actor kind of conspiracy and everyone.  There were a lot of articles and reactions written to that.  And it was kind of a trending topic on Twitter for a while.  And I was thinking at the time I was like, how do we even know if all those views are correct?  Like, what if if somebody hypothetically buys a lot of views for a YouTube video or tweet that ends up becoming popular?  And it's, let's say, a polarizing exposing like a polarizing viewpoint.  And then people start using that tweet or account or I don't know article or video as a way to say, oh, this is what the right of the left is doing.  This is emblematic of a certain viewpoint.  We should react to that in this way.  Then this whole content cycle starts up that was originally predicated in a lie.  But because now people are engaging with it, it kind of becomes a partial truth in a way.  And I mean, there's no really there's no way to ensure that we are not participating in that or no way really to counteract against it.  It's just something that we're privy to.

Transcript:  I'm not sure in the case of SM Gardens specifically, but it could either be bots.  It could be.  I don't know if you've ever seen there are particularly dramatic videos of these things called Chinese click farms where they have a wall of smartphones, walls and walls of phones that are automated to click and watch things.  Or in some cases, if it's a particularly advanced operation, they'll have like a hundred people in a room just watching clicking videos of manning machines.

Start time: 1842.97
End time: 1860.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the idea of slow views is you don't want to trigger something.  There it is.  You don't want to trigger anything on YouTube that says, wait a minute, they got too many likes in too few minutes.  It looks more organic.  They maybe even do it in spurts and stuff like real people would.  Is it full?  I mean, YouTube must know about this.

Start time: 1861.71
End time: 1908.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  I mean, it's a constant kind of back and forth in YouTube in particular.  View botting is often what this is called or just buying fake views is something that YouTube has been fighting against since the beginning.  And it's interesting, I guess, to look at this pricing table now, because I was looking at it maybe in January, February when I was writing the print piece, which had mentioned this.  And there was maybe like five different YouTube options available then, because I guess YouTube had cracked down on a specific type of fake view botting.  But now there are like 15 or whatever available on there.  So I guess I mean, this kind of cycle and back and forth happens is where YouTube will crack down and win for a bit.  And then the spammers and fakers will adapt their methods and come back.

Transcript:  One holy site.  So the cheapest thing on here is mobile views on YouTube.  Only two dollars and sixty cents per thousand.  And it takes three hundred to six hundred a day.  So it builds up slowly.  That's pretty cheap.  Do you think this is I mean, honestly, do you think big YouTube stars are using this?  Who's this for?  Why wouldn't they, I guess?  Well, certainly wannabes.  But yeah, but if you make more money, if you're charging, as I would imagine, CPMs cost per thousand impressions or adding a few thousand impressions.  Look, it's only two dollars and sixty cents per thousand.  If you're charging twice that per thousand as a CPM, it's worth it.

Start time: 1976.60
End time: 2003.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, that's one big issue that a lot of companies have in regards to influencer marketing is there was some study, I believe, from maybe it was clear cloud.  One of these social media marketing and analytics firms, they said that companies, their number one problem right now is trying to figure out whether influencers actually have genuine stats versus fake stats because they don't know how much to pay them for any campaigns.  Right.

Start time: 2004.08
End time: 2017.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's who it hurts.  I mean, in the long run, I would imagine and I would hope since it'd be good for me, brands would turn away from this and go to places where they have, you know, they can really measure.

Start time: 2017.33
End time: 2033.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would hope that.  But I mean, put yourself into the mind of an advertiser.  You have to assume that if it's this easy to cheat, everyone's cheating.  Right.  And so therefore you just take 30 percent off of whatever quoted metric they give you.  And that's what you you pitch.

Start time: 2033.14
End time: 2050.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, advertisers don't have much better stats for TV or radio either.  So those poor.  Oh, I feel by the way, this is why Google.  This is why Google and Facebook have 80 percent of all digital ad sales.  Right. But there's a big problem with click fraud there, too.

Start time: 2052.45
End time: 2061.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually, yes.  Let's clear that up.  This is not a digital phenomenon.  And this was when it's been going on for years.  Does every newspaper that get printed actually get read?

Start time: 2061.40
End time: 2080.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, but they charge on print magazines and newspapers notorious for doing counting what they call pass along numbers where well TV guide we know has a million subscribers.  But we figure each TV guy gets read by 18 people.  So it's exactly how they do it.  It's kind of amazing.

That's the old system that the radio used was you'd actually write down and that favored a certain kind of programming.  It's one of the reasons Rush Limbaugh early on got very, very good ratings.  His fans were so devout they would just at the end of the week, nobody writes it in the ratings again at the end of the week.  Oh, I got a mail this in. I better write in what I listen to.

Transcript:  Our show today literally brought to you by our content delivery network, Cashfly.  You know what a CDN is?  Well, you're using you're soaking in it.  A CDN gets content to you faster by moving the content to servers closer to you.  Cashfly is amazing with servers all over the world.  Whenever you download a twit episode, audio or video, you're getting it from the server nearest you through Cashfly.  That means it's it's faster, about 10 times faster than the traditional you come to our website and get it.  And it's and Cashfly works so well, it's even 30 percent faster than other major CDNs.  It delivers rich media content right to our users without a hitch.  And and you know what?  I hear this all the time from people when I'm downloading podcasts, some other podcasts, sometimes a little slow to come in.  Sometimes I don't get it.  Twit always comes in fast.  You can thank Cashfly for that.  No matter what industry you're in, if your website is tied to company revenue, if your downloads are important to you,  give your customer the fastest downloads they need with Cashfly.  LG uses Cashfly.  Microsoft uses Cashfly.  Adobe and Ars Technica uses Cashfly.  We've been using it for a decade and not once, not once have I got a 3 a.m.  call saying the CDN is down.  Never get that.  We we go down, but the CDN is always up.  In fact, 100 percent uptime SLA.  And the reason they can do that is because they have all those servers.  If one goes down, they still have got another to serve your content.  No billing spikes either.  This I really like.  When we sat down with Cashfly, they tailored a plan on our yearly usage, not our daily, monthly, weekly usage,  because we have very spiky downloads.  As you might imagine, Sunday is a big day for Twit, right?  So I don't want to pay a lot more on Sunday or have to call and make sure that I haven't gone over my limit.  Don't have to worry about it.  They smooth it all out.  In fact, on average, customers who switch to Cashfly save more than 20 percent.  20 percent.  Look at all the companies that use Cashfly.  Right now, you can call Cashfly and get a complementary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends  and see how much you can save with Cashfly.  It's very easy.  It's a really simple thing to do.  And I promise you, no hard sell.  They're nice people that will give you the information you need to make the right choice.  Twit.Cashfly.com.  Twit.Cashfly.com.  We couldn't.  We really couldn't do Twit without Cashfly.  Twit.Cashfly.com.  I was talking about BitTorrent on the radio show earlier and it reminded me in the early days,  that's how we got Twit out, was we would do a BitTorrent feed of it and we'd ask our listeners to seed it all over the world  and then they would get that from...  That was a funky system.  Along comes Cashfly.  And now I don't have to worry.  So an interesting thing happening in Apple land and the plot has thickened.  Today the New York Times, or maybe it was yesterday, wrote an article,  Apple cracks down on apps that fight iPhone addiction.  What?  According to the New York Times, at least 11 of the 17 most downloaded screen time and parental control apps  are removed or restricted from the iOS store.  In some cases, Apple forced companies to remove features that allowed parents to control their children's devices  or that blocked children's access to certain apps and adult content.  In other cases, they just yanked the app.  The example the Times gives is OurPact, which is the number one parental control iPhone app,  3 million downloads.  Their CEO says they yanked us out of the blue with no warning in February.  80% of OurPact's revenue comes from the app store.  They're systematically killing the industry, said Amir Mosavi, the chief executive of OurPact.  So why is Apple doing this?  I think your answer to this question depends a lot on how you feel about Apple.

Transcript:  If you hate Apple, then you're going to say, oh, it's anti-competitive because they have screen time.  Screen time is not as draconian as many of these apps.  Apple, yes, pays lip service to you not using too much of your iPhone, but they don't want you to do too good a job.  But yeah, I don't buy it because in fact, Phil Schiller had such a good response that I feel like, okay,  maybe I'm on the side of Apple on this one.  So Schiller emailed, he got many emails, I think, from Apple fans.  Mac rumors reader Zachary Robinson emailed Tim Cook to express concern and got this response from Phil Schiller, the chief of marketing.  So, you know, take it as you will at Apple. Thank you for being a fan of Apple and your email.  I would like to assure you the App Store team acted extremely responsibly in this matter,  helping to protect our children from technologies that could be used to violate their privacy and security.  So apparently some of these apps were using something Apple calls MDM or mobile device management.  Installing an MDM profile as a method to limit and control use of these devices.  I'm not familiar with this. Maybe you are, Micah, because you cover this.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's what Facebook has done in the past with they they we probably talked to it's probably been talked about on the show.  But Facebook was letting these people install these apps and it installed a profile.  And then it was tracking everything that the person did on the phone.  And then they were getting giving like twenty dollar gift cards or whatever.  Facebook got in a lot of trouble for that. This is the same thing.  It installs a profile onto your device and that profile gives access to these apps to not only know everything that you're doing,  but then they can be controlled that way.  And I find it fascinating because I remember when the App Store guidelines said that you could not create an app that recreated the behavior of an app that Apple makes.  And that's what I thought was going on. The argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when I when I connected to the the Vatican's Exchange server, it installed a script, an MDM script so that I can remotely wipe the device.  Wow. And this goes above all the other security that I have on the phone.  So no matter what they try to do with it, if I should lose this phone, I could log into my Exchange server and say kill that device.  Interesting. Interesting. Yeah.  So it's a great feature. But here's and here's where I think I actually have sympathy for Apple.  If you have software that is using MDM, it has to be enterprise grade security, because what you're giving that software the ability to do is anything, literally anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Because if they have that, if they have not done their due diligence, the developer and they have not made the software so that it's secure, it means that I now have another vector that I can attack someone's phone.  And now I own anything that phone has MDM privileges over.  Because when I when most of the software, the way it works is you have the parent phone and you have the child phone and the child phone is slave to the parent phone.  So if I own the parent phone, I now own any phone that that phone has MDM access to.

We treat all apps the same, including those that compete with our own services.  Our incentive is to have a vibrant app ecosystem. Didn't mention anything about MDM.  That seems like a fumble on Apple's part.  But maybe the Times should have pushed a little harder to get something a little less namby pamby.

End time: 2874.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if this is true, if Schiller is accurate and they were using MDM, Apple has an obligation to do something about it as they did with the Facebook app.  So anyway, I thought you'd want to get both sides of the story because I knew I was going to talk about the Times story.  And then I saw Phil Schiller's response.

Transcript:  And I have to say, I think maybe I think there's something to be said to for the discussion of there was a I think it was a black mirror episode.  And the black mirror episode was about installing this little thing into a child's head.  And then you could filter out things that scared them.  And then the parent could watch over their pad, their iPad like device and filter things out and see things.  And the mom like put it away.  But then she ended up seeing it and like interacted with her child's life in a very controlling way when the child was older and was able to make responsible decisions on their own.  And I think that there's not an insignificant amount of discussion to have about the sort of surveillance state parenting that can sometimes come with technology.  And mind you, I say this as a person who is not does not have children.  And, you know, it's a whole different aspect.

I will say I never second guess a parent for doing whatever it is they feel like they need to do to responsibly raise their children.  But I do agree with you 100 percent, Micah.  Sometimes the tighter you grip, the more they want to slip through your grip.  And it's not necessarily the best way to handle this.  It's a tough thing.  I'd hate to be raising kids in this era.  My kids now are adults.  Thank goodness, because I feel bad for kids who have access to any kind of awful stuff.  Yeah.

But get rid of all the MDM talk, get rid of all the child parenting app talk and say, would you want Apple to get rid of poorly written backdoors?  Yes.  And absolutely.  Yes.  Everyone should say yes.  No question.  That's essentially what they did.  They saw this as really poorly written backdoors to children's iPhones.  And between the two, between having a device that maybe kind of a tech savvy person might be able to know what their child is using or having a device that I know is locked down as much as possible so that it doesn't get infected.  So really bad people don't have access to it.  I'm always going to choose to get rid of that backdoor.  Right.  I mean, that should be a no brainer.

Transcript:  My parents really had no idea how to use the Internet in the same way that I did.  I remember having a argument with my parents for many years in high school that they thought Google Chrome was a virus.  And I was trying to find something that was not.  And I still bring this up to this day and they're like, oh, no, we definitely didn't say that.  I'm like, I printed out sheets of research showing that Google Chrome is not a virus.  But I mean, I think it was very different in the sense that I was always the one who was fixing the tech problems as a kid and they were not.  But I.  So they didn't have a chance.  That's all you're saying.  No, they didn't have a chance to police my Internet usage.  But I don't know.  Now I'm increasingly concerned as more and more tech companies roll out products specifically designed for kids, which I guess is good.  It's in there more safety measures, but it's also like you are feeding children into this kind of content cycle.  The first thing that kind of comes to mind is Caroline Haskins, a reporter at Motherboard.  I think I tweeted this out the other day, but she was looking at the permissions on YouTube kids.  And to sign up, you have to enter in the child, the child is to enter in their age.  And the age limit is from like you could enter in the age of zero to the age of like 13.  I mean, it is insane that you could make an account for a zero year old child, hypothetically, in this world that I don't know.  Google is kind of setting up these sort of walled gardens for children of any conceivable age to consume content in.  It's quite a lot.

Transcript:  That's what I was rocking.  And I see it wasn't doing any video.  It was just single frame.  So maybe that's why mine works so well.  But I was just going to say my experience was mirrored with Paris in terms of high school or middle school on is that they would come to me for the tech problems.  And so I could have I could have and did do a bunch of things online that they would know the first thing about at the time.  And so now I think about folks growing up.  I mean, literally like I'm trying to think of sort of brands that I love and there aren't many brands that I love.  And I and I think about the access that folks have now to these things that play such a huge role in their life.  And so if you are zero and you grow up watching YouTube kids and you you tie that like dopamine cycle of of watching a show.  And, you know, falling in love with the little things that dance around on the screen.  You get the cycle built in.  You know that comes from YouTube.  You're 13 and you get to graduate to regular YouTube.  You're suddenly into Minecraft and all these other things.  You're never going to not be on YouTube.  You're never going to not be on Netflix.  You're never going to.  You know, I mean, these these services, they're so our connection with everything is so much now that it's you almost don't need like advertising  because these things are are again building themselves.  And I think our psychological reward centers now.  And so, you know, you got to have your YouTube, you got to have these things and they make you feel good.  And that's what's horrifying to me is that I can't think growing up like what that would have been.  You know, as I'm trying to think of it, I guess like Gerber baby food probably would have made me happy.  But like then I stopped eating it.  So there's not really a brand in that way.  But now you start from zero with your Samsung phone or our if you're an Apple camp, then you're going to keep going to those products over and over again or those services online.  I wonder.

So, I mean, is there anything wrong with them growing up watching Minecraft videos on YouTube or playing Fortnite to the wee hours of the morning or Instagramming or any of this stuff?

They're eating Tide Pods. Oh my God.  No.  But I mean, like the teens are talking about politics on Instagram.  The teens use YouTube to express social behaviors.  I'm like, okay, yes.

It hasn't just changed how people get information.  It's changed how people relate to one another.  And that is incredibly difficult to quantify what that changes because now that people are accustomed to having relationships with people that they've never met in person, that changes what kind of dynamic you have and what kind of interpersonal development you have.

It is that when interacting in the same way as you would offline online, there are extra consequences and ramifications that are powered by algorithms and increased polarization and a variety of other effects that you have to watch out for.  But it's not just the use of technology.  In this case is bad.

Transcript:  We did this large symposium of educators, high school, higher education, university, post grad, et cetera, et cetera, hundreds of teachers, professionals from around the world.  And one of the common themes was how education has changed.  It used to be education was about teaching you how to get the information that you wanted to have.

Start time: 3828.10

Start time: 3833.36
End time: 3843.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if education wants to stay relevant, what it has to do, it has to change from how to get you the information to how do I critique the information?  How do I know a good source from a bad source?  How do I synthesize new ideas?

Transcript:  Media literacy, I think, is going to be right now.  There are certain classes, depending on where you are, where the curriculum decides sort of you have to take this class in order to graduate.  And I think media literacy is going to be such an important thing and not just media literacy, but tech literacy, the whole kit and caboodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do hope and maybe it's a futile hope, but I do hope that this the whole fake news cycle, the whole 2016 election influenced by the Russians, all of this, that there will be a reaction to this that ends up the right response is not let's shut down Facebook or let's find ways to block.  Fake news, the right response is to teach kids literacy, to teach them how to understand what they're seeing and to teach them that there are people trying to influence you.  And so you should be you should think about what you're receiving, who's writing it and why and what their purpose is.  And if people can understand that deeply, that's going to be more valuable than shutting down Facebook.  Oh, yes.  I hope.

Start time: 3909.56
End time: 3932.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that the I mean, the prime example of that is that if there have been blanking on the names right now, but I know there have been certain studies where if you look at young adults or kids versus, I don't know, boomers or people who have less media literacy or time online, people perhaps, let's say in like the 50 or 60 plus era more often succumb to fake news or bloated information than people who have grown up on.

Transcript:  And there was that incredibly powerful Washington Post piece that I guess I'm blanking the name of right now where they followed some people.  I think they're in their seventies and then that shared posts from this one definitively fake news site that was, I guess, right leaning.  But it was actually run by kind of a liberal trollish person who was just creating satirical news.  It was a right leaning bent kind of it was supposed to be as a joke.  But even after they told the people who were sharing this news, hey, this is false.  It was made by this person who's doing it as a joke.  If you look on the site, it literally says this is a joke.  They shared it anyway because they it's still conformed with their beliefs.  And I think that's why this issue is so much larger than just media literacy.  It is also about looking at these sort of societal issues that we have and confronting these like internal and external beliefs that are held.  And in addition to that, also confronting the platform issue of all this in regards to polarization.

Transcript:  This is the Business Insider article from earlier this year.  Baby boomers share nearly seven times as many fake news articles on Facebook as adults under 30.  So maybe there's maybe there's hope.  Maybe there's hope for the future.  And I think Paris, I have to say, you're a poster child for parents not knowing anything about technology and letting the kid get into it.  I mean, you turn into and I say this in the most positive way, a geek.  Right. Yeah, certainly.

But they are definitely the sect of adults that fall for fake news at all times.  And that is the only thing they share.  And it has changed their beliefs radically.  But I think because of that, me and at least my sister, who's still, you know, in the Gen Z kind of stage of being obsessed with being online,  it has resulted in us adopting technologically driven strategies to make sure all our information is correct.

Transcript:  I'll learn that transition time, right?  Because I mean, when I was growing up, the whole idea was two primary sources for anything that you wanted to say was true.  You found two primary sources and then a couple of facts to back it up.  Well, it's really easy to find two primary sources now that are both fake or were both built off of the same fake kernel.  So what do I what do I tell a student now?  Because I'm actually still dealing with this.

I mean, this is and going back to many, many centuries of this.  Yes.  John McLaughlin of the McLaughlin group, a famous Jesuit, a good friend of mine was educated by him, and he was absolutely strict in his requirements as he should be.  And so I wonder, do you see any change in Jesuit doctrine and education in the Internet era?

Start time: 4158.34
End time: 4202.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And that's that was that the reason why we had that big symposium, which was they said, look, the universities need to change their focus.  We've been focused for so long and pumping out Ph.D.s.  We just want to get more people with more doctors who have published more things that will never be read because they're in a journal somewhere on a dusty shelf.  And we actually have to make them useful again.  And one of the ways that people said, look, we can make it useful if we actually start teaching people how to critique the information that they're receiving.  So the years of education was just about dumping as much info into someone's brain as possible are over.  Now it's all about I need to I need to make you a critical consumer of information.  And that's really very different.

It's great to hear that you that they're forward thinking enough to say, yeah, we've got to rethink how they're not hidebound.  They're not saying, well, it was good enough in 1922.  It's good enough today.  No, we got to rethink how we do this stuff.  And I think we absolutely, absolutely do.  Let's take a little break.  Lots more to talk about.  What a panel.

And then Ingress from Niantic, which was a Google company, spawned Pokemon Go, which became a huge phenomenon in 2016, July of 2016.  Do you still play?  I still play it.  Nice.  As do I.

And then Warner Brothers, which who owns the right to the Harry Potter movies and I guess the right to do Harry Potter games, is partnering with Niantic to do what?  If you thought Pokemon Go was a phenomenon, I personally feel feel that when Wizards Unite, which is the Harry Potter game, comes out and I think it's imminent, it's going to dwarf.

Transcript:  Oh my God, you're evil.  I mean, good in a good way.  Let's take a break.  More to come with a superb panel.  Our show today brought to you by Captera.  Who doesn't have had, we've all had this experience.  I certainly did of going to work, going to a new job, and they're using software that's based on Windows 98.  Or that requires Internet Explorer 8.  Old line of business software.  Some high school kid wrote for the boss 15 years ago.  The kid's long gone.  He's running a tractor in Indiana or somewhere.  But the boss can't get the new software.  He says, I like this software.  And you're still running this stuff.  It's insecure.  It's inadequate.  It crashes all the time.  Who doesn't have that experience?  I got a solution for you.  You can show the boss this.  Captera.com.  Captera is the leading free directory of software solutions for your business.  I guarantee you there is a newer, better program out there for you.  Many of them running off the web.  But the point is, no matter what your business, and there are 700 categories, thousands of businesses,  everything from a content management system to email marketing, to IT service, to running a yoga studio, to workflow management.  I can go on and look at all these categories.  And if you need software for your business, you don't have to, you know, your line of business software doesn't have to be old and out of date.  It can, but it's all there.  And it makes it really easy.  Pick a category, Carson.  Any category. I don't care.  Just click on one there.  What are we going to get here?  Computer repair shop software.  How many packages are there?  There's hundreds.  But now you can narrow it down.  You see that on the left.  You could filter it by, I want ones with reviews that are four star or better.  I want something that can run online or I can want something that runs on disk.  I maybe I need to manage accounts, whatever it is you need.  You click the boxes, filter it out, narrow those hundreds of packages down to the few that do everything you want.  You can build a chart, a comparison chart of four different ones.  So you can look side by side to see what which they do.  But here's the magic.  Captera has eight hundred fifty thousand reviews of products with thirty thousand fresh reviews every month.  And these are real reviews.  Captera is very careful to vet them of people actually use the programs so you can find out what people really think about the software you're thinking of buying.  Filter the results, compare them side by side, read the reviews and pick a better program for your business.  Captera believes software makes the world a better place because software can help every organization become a more efficient, effective version of itself.  Nonprofits too.  And here's the best part.  I think people would pay for this five, ten, twenty dollars a month.  But Captera is absolutely free, free forever.  They're not free me um, free free.  No matter what kind of software your business needs.  Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution at no cost to you.  Go to captera.com.  Captera is software selection simplified.  Stop suffering with old software.  Get in the new stuff.  Captera.com.  We thank them for supporting this week in tech and I thank you for using that URL because that tells them you heard it here.  Captera.com.  I love this article in Gizmodo.  Don't forget to cancel Apple News Plus.  I forgot.  I got charged.  So it's been a month.  I want to cancel.  Yeah.  It launched March 25th.  I did the same thing.  But you know Apple popped up a thing saying, um, do you want to renew?  Which I'm really grateful to.  This is their magazine rack.  They pay ten dollars a month for hundreds of magazines.  And I found it in...  And Wired is on there.  And Wired is on there.  I didn't use it that much.  So I did cancel because you know what I prefer to do when I do this?  I buy Wired.  I subscribe to Wired.  There's a handful of newspapers and magazines.  I actually want to give them money directly instead of whatever it is you get from Apple, probably 50% or less of the subscription fee.  So, um, but I think for most people they don't want a bunch of different subscriptions.  So maybe Apple News is a good solution.  But April 25th, three days ago, if you didn't cancel, you just paid Apple ten dollars.

I mean, they've essentially said where Amazon, I guess they said were they're trying to over the next year change entirely globally.  Their two day prime shipping offer around the globe to be one day to all zip codes anywhere.

I had if I'm ordering like 12 things, I have to make 12 separate orders so I can collect the one dollar on every single item versus putting them all in one box.  If you let me put them all in one box and get credit for each one of the items in the box, that's 11 less boxes.  You have to send stuff in.  I'm just saying.  I always choose to have it shipped.

But I can't find it online.  I have to always go to my mobile device and do it that way.  And that's because I just I don't know.  I have this thing about people like neighbors seeing me with 12 boxes and I feel weird and like, I don't know, I just it makes me feel bad.  I'm like, I feels like I'm flaunting wealth or something.

Transcript:  What's inside of there?  And so I find this interesting and I'm curious.  All of you, your experiences with Amazon delivery, I have not had any issues.  It says two day shipping.  I think once in my whole history of being an Amazon customer, I've had it.  It took three days instead of the two days.  But I saw several people on Twitter complain saying, oh, great, they're going to switch it to one day delivery.  This is going to cause a bunch of issues for me.  I wish they would just improve the the quality and this and that and the other.  A lot of people apparently have issues with whomever is delivering their packages where they don't put them on their porch or they it doesn't end up showing up or they say I knocked and no one answered.  And then they're like, I was home all day because I work from home and I not I didn't hear a knock.  I've not had any issues personally.  Most of the time, Amazon chooses to use the postal service, the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mine.  Occasionally, it's UPS.  But I'm curious for you all, if you order today, does it arrive in two days?

I bought I bought a new ThinkPad and I ordered a one terabyte M.2 drive from Western Digital.  I'm in Hawaii and I got an email saying, we don't know what happened.  The carrier lost it.  And what?  It was supposed to come the next day.  I thought, that's amazing.  And it didn't come at all.  And then it turns out you can't just check a box saying, well, I want my money back or send me another one.  You have to call them.

Or it'll say got delivered.  And if I check the tracking thing, it'll be in like, I don't know, upstate New York somewhere.  Never got taken from its facility.

So the chat room, this one day delivery is going to put a lot of stress on already highly stressed Amazon employees working in the fulfillment centers, working to do delivery.  I mean, I'm so torn because I've been an employee all my life.  Now I'm an employer at Twitter.  So I understand both sides of it.  One is is an employee.  It really sucks if this is your job and you're treated badly.  But as an employer, I also say, but they could just get another job.  Why are they working in a job that sucks?  So maybe it's the only job they could get.  Maybe there are not a lot of jobs in that town.  Maybe they have face tattoos.  I don't know what it is.  But so should I feel bad for Amazon employees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because they'll quote it later sometimes and I've chosen to do that because for me it varied.  Sometimes I would get deals on Amazon pantry and I'd get deals on some other things as well.  And so I'd sometimes click that expecting, OK, this isn't going to arrive for a while.  That's fine.  And then it would still arrive the same day.  And then because I'm weird again, I don't know if it's a Midwestern thing, but then I'm like, I feel guilty that I got this credit.  So I've got 12 packages on my porch and I'm already guilty about that.  And then I'm like, wow, they delivered it the same day that they said they were going to if I just did two day shipping.  But now I've also got this Amazon pantry deal.  I know it makes no sense.  I don't make sense.  But that's how I feel about it.

Transcript:  Amazon did throw out 700 million dollars to invest in Rivian.  This is the electric truck company that plans to launch an electric pickup and electric SUV in 2020 in the United States.  Amazon joined a round of investing that also included automakers.  I think.  Let me see who else invested in it.  I can't find the rest of them.  But still, that's obviously the Amazon looking at electric trucks to replace its its diesel vehicles.  That would make me feel a little bit better about deliveries from Amazon.

Start time: 5553.50
End time: 5598.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've always thought that there is far more of a market for electric vehicles, industrial electric vehicles than there are for consumer electric vehicles.  Consumer electric electric vehicles are great.  They're fun to show off.  But when you talk about actual savings, it's the industrial stuff that fits what electric vehicles are good at.  Electric vehicles are great at getting efficiency for short travels that don't go really, really fast that require a lot of torque.  Right. That's a delivery vehicle.  That's a truck.  So, I mean, Amazon's looking at this and it's a very forward way of saying we want to own everything that's part of our core strategy.  And if our core strategy is this one day delivery and if we can have more electric vehicles on the road than anybody else, we essentially replace USPS and UPS and FedEx.  That's amazing.

But what's interesting is Amazon didn't take a profit for a long, long time, right?  It feels like it's almost they can do what they want.  Like, should we make profit this quarter?  What do you think?  I don't know, Jeff, what do you think?  This feels like a profit quarter.

Start time: 5688.12
End time: 5705.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's because they make most of their profit from AWS.  It all comes from AWS, doesn't it?  The amount of money that they make from AWS allows them to operate at a loss when it comes to e-commerce or logistics or any of the other spheres of Amazon.  Right.  Because they are making so much money hand over fist from their web services business.

But I mean, it still rose 17 percent.  So it's not like really dragging it down.  It was 43 percent a year ago.  So stock is up.  Let me just see what they talk.  Do they divide up their revenue by division or do they not say that?  They probably don't say it.  Although advertising business revenue derived from advertising rose 34.

You got to remember on the on the the advertising story for Amazon, that number includes a lot of the technologies that's not Amazon selling ads directly.  They're enabling the metric gathering on ads.  Oh, really?  Right.  So they sell some great technology, some great AI technologies that allow you to to better target advertising and to better target your like CRM models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's for example, if I if I set up a service using AWS, I automatically have the ability to quickly add AI to my service so that I can gather better quality information on my users.

Every I guess every year they survey 18,000 Americans to ask them which companies have the highest reputation quotient.

There's there among the big tech companies among the fangs.  They're number two.  It's Amazon, Microsoft, number nine, Netflix, 24, Apple, oddly enough, number 32 on list below Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix and just above Google.  But nobody but nobody is as bad as Facebook.

Ouch.  Right down there with General Electric and character.  What?  People don't like Apple.  I think it's just representing how they don't like Apple.  Shall we kick a puppy?  Kick that puppy.  Look up Comcast.  Oh, no.  Are they even on the list?  I want to see what they get for ethics.  I thought that was outstanding in growth, vision, and trajectory.  But its only weak point, and it wasn't very weak, is citizenship.  It was number six.  And ethics.  And ethics.  Yeah, but not terrible.  So where is Comcast?  Probably sort of down at the bottom.

Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  Our show today brought you, I tell you what, Tweet does have the best dental health of  any podcast network because we are a quip network.  We use the electric toothbrush design to make brushing your teeth more simple, more affordable,  even enjoyable, created by dentists, loved by people and very affordable.  If you've always wanted to brush better, but maybe didn't want to spend hundreds of  dollars for an electric toothbrush, check out Quip.  I think it is absolutely the best toothbrush I've ever used.  In fact, we use it for travel too because, well, let me explain it.  So it's gentle and all dentists say people are brushing too hard.  Sometimes electric toothbrushes are too abrasive.  Quip is an effective gentle clean for both your teeth and your gums.  Of course, it has a two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds.  So you could brush each of the four quadrants of your mouth for 30 seconds each, as a dentist recommends.  And by the way, about 90% of us don't do that or don't clean evenly.  So it's very helpful for that.  I love the cover, which you can use either as a stand or there's a little sticky strip on the back.  I'm at it right to the mirror.  That way I never forget.  Hey, I'm looking at this toothbrush in my mirror.  It's time to brush.  Declutters your sink.  And because it doesn't have a charger, it runs on a AAA battery, which lasts three months.  I love it for travel.  I don't have to bring a charger with me.  It's very compact.  That stand doubles as a cover.  So you flip it around, cover it up.  There's no easier way to travel.  No wires, no clunky charger.  And even if you do run out, you just go out and get a AAA battery.  You're good to go for another three months.  Brush heads, batteries, even toothpaste if you want are delivered automatically on a dentist record.  Every three months for just five dollars.  Well, that's for the brush heads.  And that's important too because about three out of four of us use brushes that are worn out, old and ineffective.  Quip, one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the American Dental Association.  And they have thousands of five star verified reviews.  I love Quip.  We use Quip.  They're backed by 20,000 dental professionals.  And I love it because it starts at $25.  So it's affordable.  The whole family can have a Quip or you can get one Quip with four heads and share it around.  Twenty-five dollars for the starter set.  That couldn't be a better price.  And if you want, you can get fancy.  They have copper and gold and all that stuff.  If you go to getquip.com slash twit, even your first refill pack is free when you purchase any Quip electric toothbrush.  That's a great deal.  What a good Mother's Day gift.  Maybe I should send that to Mom.  Get your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash twit.  I did send it to my daughter.  I was very proud.  She said, Dad, I think I ought to brush better.  I said, it's on its way.  The Quip is on its way.  Getquip.com slash twit.  We thank Quip for their support.  We thank you for supporting us by using that special URL.  Getquip.com slash twit.

Transcript:  And falling.  And next year, I'd be surprised if it's on the list at all.  So the latest thing, and now the state of New York is investigating, is this email password thing.  Have you seen this?  The New York attorney general is going to investigate Facebook over harvesting email.  The unauthorized collection of 1.5 million users' email address books, which Facebook says was unintentional.  It was unintentional.  So it started with a tweet from E-Sushi saying that Facebook was asking some users to enter their email passwords when they opened up new accounts.  What?  What?  Because we have to verify that you're real.  So let me, whoops.  So this is the pop-up, according to Business Insider.  This is the pop-up.  Confirm your email address.  To continue using Facebook, you need to confirm your email address.  Because you signed up with Steven Mercantile at Yandex.com, you could do this automatically through Yandex.com.  Now, normal website, what would they do?  They'd send you an email, right, to that address that say, click this link to verify.  That should be sufficient.  No.  What did Facebook do?  Here's your email.  Give us your password.  Amazing.  We promise we won't save it.  It does.  It says we won't save it.  What the what?  Well, maybe they didn't save it, but what did they do with the password?  They connected and downloaded your contacts.

Transcript:  Okay, here's the thing.  I love Dorelli against Facebook because they've done so many head slappingly bad moves in the last couple of years.  But we're enabling them.  By we, I mean the internet community that continues to use Facebook because they have done this so many times.  And then they draw back a little bit and then they push again and then they draw back a little bit.  And if you look at where our privacy policy was with Facebook eight years ago versus where it is now, it is so unrecognizable because they know that all they have to do is apologize, maybe pay a tiny little fine.  And then they'll push again and again and again.  And that's why this will never stop until people finally say, no, no, no, you finally push past the line at which we will we will continue to use your service.  They will never stop because it makes money.

Start time: 6749.88
End time: 6777.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook, it might not even be a tiny little fine, but Facebook makes so much money.  For instance, in their quarterly results this week, they announced, we're going to set aside $3 billion.  We expect a pretty big fine from the EU in the $3 to $5 billion range.  So we're just going to take a little of that pocket change we made this year and we're just going to put that aside.  Three to five billion.  But come on, they're making more than that a quarter.  It's pocket change.  Okay, no, that's a serious slap on the wrist.

Start time: 6778.40
End time: 6783.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is, but it isn't because $3 billion to again move the privacy goalposts further just a little bit.

Start time: 6784.46
End time: 6823.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually the real point, which is they're getting something for that $3 billion.  And it's worth it because they're not only moving the privacy goalposts, but whatever it was that they did to get the fine, I bet you they made more money off of it than the fine.  And so it's a profit thing.  I just, I don't, what more can you say about Facebook?  These guys, are they scum?  Are they what?  So I asked this question on this week in Google.  We talked about the same story.  Is Facebook immoral?  Are they amoral?  Are they just move fast and break things geeks?  Paris, what do you think?

Start time: 6824.66
End time: 6861.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think at a certain point, a company gets so big that it is impossible even.  I mean, I think the thing that always sticks out to me is during the Zuck hearings last year, there were certain times where Mark Zuckerberg said something where he's like, oh, I didn't know the X was happening in regards to Facebook.  I didn't know that we were doing lie.  And it's like at a certain point, your company gets so large that there is not one person or five people or 10 people responsible.  It is a giant beast that cannot be contained by any man or woman.  And that is terrifying in and of its own right.

Start time: 6861.77
End time: 6866.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're kind of giving them a pass.  You're saying, well, it's just, no, I don't think they're giving it a pass.

Start time: 6867.02
End time: 6909.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that it's still just as bad, but I think that there is a certain they're ungovernable.  I feel like school of thought.  Where they're saying, oh, we are blaming it on suck or Cheryl or blaming it on a certain person that it is.  I think blaming it on morality, being good versus evil makes the problem too simple.  The fact is that it has grown to such a size that none of the choices are even at a certain point the choices of one person.  But it is just this large, ever moving, ever moving fast and ever breaking things of a beast that is very difficult to contain and even more difficult to have actionable solutions to things.  And that's how we should think about it.

Start time: 6909.32
End time: 6925.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have two billion users that you can't you just can't.  But I mean, still writing an authentication process that requires a user's password to their email.  No one thinks that's a good idea.

Start time: 6926.58
End time: 6957.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then to to use it at not not for what it's advertised for, but to then start to contact when that was not.  Yeah, there was no mention. It didn't have anything to do with important contacts.  You're supposed to be authenticating my log in or whatever.  Why are you now importing my contacts?  That's not what you said was going to happen.  Why did this happen?  And then to go with the unintentional thing, that's just so it was it was intended that you can't say it's unintentional when that makes no sense at home.

Start time: 6959.70
End time: 6997.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think unintentional is Facebook code for we've gotten too big for our bridges and we do not know how to control all parts of our body.  And that is an even scarier reality, of course.  So that's why they would not use that term of phrase, I guess, to make matters worse during the same week.  I mean, it was last week, you know, last month they had had that whole plain text password snafu on Instagram where they had said, oh, we had, you know, had some thousands of users password stored in plain text.  And of course, on Mueller report day right in the morning, they updated that PR post to say, oh, yeah, it wasn't thousands of accidentally millions of Instagram passwords that were exposed.

Start time: 6997.54
End time: 7029.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But all they did was change thousands of millions. They didn't tell anybody.  They just changed. They didn't say we got to say anything.  They just changed thousands to millions.  Of course, everybody noticed. Thank goodness.  That's pretty bad. It's internally stored in plain text.  That's that you could say that was a mistake.  Somebody blew it. It's bad.  It's a bad mistake.  And it's by the way, the following on the heels of them doing the same thing with Facebook passwords not so long ago.  I don't I mean, I don't have a Facebook account.  I think you'd be nuts to have a Facebook account at this point.

Start time: 7029.85
End time: 7055.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I wish they didn't know Instagram.  Here's the thing.  We we know that this is bad.  And most of our listeners know that this is bad.  But Facebook is counting on that the vast majority of the general public, more than 90 percent of the people are still in that mind, that mindset that says, well, I don't care if Facebook has that information.  Why does that affect me? I don't care if they have my contacts.  I don't care if they have all my email because I like what they do.

Start time: 7056.22
End time: 7080.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem is people say this to me all the time.  Well, you can say I quit Facebook, right?  Because you don't need Facebook. But there's a lot of us.  We need Facebook. This is how we keep in touch with family, with friends.  In some countries, it's the Internet.  It's because we have.  So it's it's unreasonable of you to say quit Facebook.  Why isn't there a better Facebook somewhere?  Why isn't somebody come along?  Isn't this a better Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Preach.  Yeah.  Instagram has gone downhill since they bought it, though.  Right.  For what I created.  So I got off Instagram at the same.  I decided I'm not going to use WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook all at the same time in August.  My wife, when we were in Hawaii, said, please create an Instagram account.  Just follow me.  Make it private and just follow me so that I don't have to tell you show you all my pictures because that's where I put them.  She has a private Instagram account.  So I use it that way.  Nevertheless, even just signing up for that, it asked me no fewer than five times for access to my contact list.  I think it's going to keep doing that.

I feel like I get way more ads than every nine pictures.  Oh, man.  And what the main part of the reasons I got rid of Facebook is Instagram is because I get buying Instagram.  It was terrible.  Oh, those underpants look great.  I'll buy those.  I mean, constantly.

I get random prescription medication ads.  I get ads for like fake doctors.  I get ads for teletherapy services that are definitely illegal, as well as like ads for  like medications for migraines that if you look in the fine text, they're definitely  just like some fake herbal thing.

I'm working on stories related to kind of like the medical industry's takeover of Instagram.  And so I guess my engagement with them or the fact that I'll sometimes screenshot them  means show me more and more, which I guess works because it's better fodder for my reporting.

Transcript:  It's a better job of understanding what we like.  With Facebook, for my use of it, that's different versus who I follow and what I...  In the discovery tab, I think about this a lot.  When I'm in the discovery tab, I wonder, does it know how long I linger on a section of the discovery tab?  Oh, absolutely.  I'm sure it does.  And to tap on a video is going to take me more...  Actually, Megan Moroney was tweeting the other day.  She keeps getting these ads for a mushroom coffee.  And first of all, why would you ever do that to yourself?  But apparently she's bought it.  But she was asking, she's gotten it, and then somebody else she knows has gotten those ads.  How come they both were getting those ads?  And I think it depends on who you're following and what you like.  And yes, of course, how they developed a profile of you.  But maybe just for me, Instagram has a better understanding of what I actually am interested in and like,  and my age group, and all of those things that apply as well.  I don't know.

Transcript:  I'm sure they brought to you by, oh, we just got the new Casper mattress.  Darn it, I wanted to bring you a video.  I will bring you a video with it.  These guys are amazing.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses.  They were the first to realize the mattress markup in the store is crazy.  Why don't we just sell direct?  We can manufacture it here in the US.  We can innovate, make amazing mattresses, and by selling it directly to customers instead  of through a store, we can make the price so much lower.  They literally revolutionized the mattress industry.  Of course, they realized one of the problems with that is people think they like to go  to a mattress store and lie on the mattress before they buy it.  But I would submit having fallen to this, many times you can't tell how good a mattress  is going to be by lying in the middle of the day on a store while a shop girl looks at you  like, don't get your feet on my mattress.  You can't test a mattress that way.  Casper has so much of a better way.  They now they send it to you and you have free delivery and painless returns within  a hundred days.  So you have a hundred nights to sleep on that mattress and really know if you like it.  This new hybrid mattress, amazing.  But all of the Casper mattresses, amazing.  The original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface  with just the right sink, just the right bounce.  It's breathable.  So all of the mattresses are breathable.  So you sleep cool.  Really important to be able to regulate your temperature through the night.  That's what keeps you from waking up.  Long lasting comfort and support.  And it's risk free to buy it online.  So they just came out with this new hybrid.  Take a look at that.  I don't know how they do what they do, but they make mattresses that are both things  that I want because I want a soft mattress because I want to be comfortable.  I don't want my hips to dig into it or anything.  But I also want firm because I want firm support for my back.  And somehow Casper makes a mattress that's both.  And they keep innovating.  They keep inventing.  So there's a bunch of different kinds.  Go to the website, look at it.  Casper, all the Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards.  They're made in the USA with free shipping and yes, free returns to the US and Canada.  And you could pick the perfect mattress for you at casper.com slash twit.  In fact, you'll save $50 towards select mattresses if you use the promo code twit one at checkout.  I just love these mattresses.  Casper.com slash twit promo code twit one at checkout.  Terms and conditions apply.  We have two new Caspers sitting in our entryway of our house.  And I will promise you for the next time I will do a video because I love to show the unboxing.  They're so compact that we just got two California Kings, which is the biggest they make.  It's in a box, you know, not that big.  You open it up and it goes shh.  You can get it up apartment stairs easily.  It's amazing.  Love our Caspers.  Casper.com slash twit.  I got a feel for Hertz because I know the feeling when you get a brand new website and the cost keeps going up and up and up.  And actually, Hertz was so upset about the website that Accenture, I'm sorry, yeah, that Accenture pretended to be making for them that they're demanding $32 million.  They never got a site or a mobile app.  It wasn't responsive design in the first place.  None of the things Accenture said they would do, they did.  And then they said, well, we'll do it, but you have to pay more.  It is a textbook store.  It is a textbook story of how a website design can go wrong.  I know exactly how they feel.  The code, as Hertz says, was terrible and a security nightmare.  Accenture's developers wrote the code for the customer-facing e-commerce website in a way that created serious security vulnerabilities and performance problems.  The defects in the front-end development code were so pervasive that all of Accenture's work on that component had to be scrapped.  It was built on Angular 2.  Then Accenture said, oh, we could speed it up.  We need to use something called Rapid, but it hurts.  You got to buy the licenses for it. Hertz bought the licenses.  And then it turned out Accenture didn't know how to use Rapid.  So the quick fix took longer than it would have done without it.  Accenture admitted that they had spent a good deal of time fighting through the integration of Rapid into Hertz.  I could just go on and on and on.  A spokesperson for Accenture told the register, we believe the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to defend our position.  But I tell you, I read this and I thought, oh, boy, I have been there.  I feel for you, Hertz.  Big, big news, I think, in the Academy Awards arena.  You remember after the last Oscars when Roma came perilously close to winning a Best Picture, even though it was a Netflix streaming movie.  But what a great movie.  It did win a couple of Oscars, but it didn't get the big Oscar for Best Picture.  After that, Steven Spielberg said we ought to change the rules and no movie that is not from a theater should be eligible for an Oscar.

End time: 7982.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, weirdly enough.  Steven Spielberg, but he was only doing TV shows.  He's doing his TV show, not a movie.  So Spielberg wanted to change the rules.  And weirdly, the Department of Justice got involved, which was very weird.  And wrote a letter to the Academy saying if you change the rules, you'll be in violation of competition law.  If you vote to make streaming movies ineligible for Oscar nominations.  I have to think that somebody like maybe Jeff Bezos at Amazon said it would be very kind of you to write them a note.  So here's the good news.  The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences announced that it will allow streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime to be eligible for Academy Award nominations.  However, they still have to run in a Los Angeles County commercial theater for at least seven days with at least three screenings a day for paid admission to be eligible.  That's what Roman did.

And they end up a lot of them popular kind of viral a bot made X tweets come from Botnik.  I don't know if you've seen there was one like a I generated Harry Potter script or maybe like Seinfeld scripts or Coachella lineup.  But it does a lot of really cool stuff like this.  And I think this I'm not sure if it's this song in particular, but they have a thing called the songularity, which is an entire album created by A.I.

Transcript:  But this is actually important because one of the big feelings of A.I.  neural networks has been it's not good at ending things.  I'll give you an example.  You're going back to MIT and their media lab.  They they tried to train an A.I.  to look at thousands of YouTube videos to see if it could complete the video.  So could it understand that there's actually a narrative going on?  It would give it.

Start time: 8268.08
End time: 8302.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, for example, one of the things that they had a video of a train coming into a station  and then leaving the station and the A.I.  was able to actually reproduce the train and it knew that there was a train and there were  cars and they were connected and they were all moving in this direction.  But the thing is, it never stopped.  It never knew that at some point the train had to end and they could never get the A.I.  to understand that.  If this was generated by an A.I., this is an A.I.  that actually understands that there's a certain cadence to the song and then it ends.  Yeah, so it's pretty good.  Small and it's funny, but that's actually still a very big advancement.

Transcript:  This is a little bit inside baseball, but I thought I'd mention it to people who have been asking me.  There's a new podcast app out called Luminary.  They raised $100 million, and there was a bit of a to-do over Luminary this week because when they launched on Tuesday,  it turned out that they were cashing or proxying the requests to download the podcast or the podcast on their app  and they didn't understand this podcast network would be unable to count downloads.  All the downloads would look like they were coming from a handful of IP addresses in the Luminary network.  And it also turned out, some complained, that the proxying was also stripping out links to Patreon sites and other show note links.  And a number of podcasts, including Joe Rogan, I think The Daily, a number of podcasts said the Gimlet Media shows,  said, no, you can't put our shows on Luminary.  That may backfire also because then Luminary on those shows put a big banner saying,  well, these shows won't let you listen to it on the Luminary app, but here's some other shows you might like better.  Wow.  We decided after looking at this, just to stay out of it entirely,  if you want to listen to our shows on Luminary, be our guest.  I'm not going to weigh in on this unless they do something else awful because they've gone back to letting us count the downloads,  which is really what's most important to us.  So, but a big battle going on over that.  And I think part of the problem was that they raised a hundred million dollars for a podcast app.  But subscribe away if you'd like.

That would be twenty one thirty UTC.  I'd love it if you'd come by and you could watch us in studio if you want to be in studio.  We have a nice audience today.  All you have to do is email tickets at Twitter dot TV, but there's a live stream you can listen to or watch.  We've got audio and video at Twitter dot TV slash live.  You could even ask your vocal device, your Amazon Echo or you could say listen, play  twit live and it will actually play the audio stream that's going on right now, which is kind of fun.  Or you can ask for any podcast.  Just say, hey, Echo play this week in tech and it will play the most recent episode.  You can download any episode from our Web site.  Best thing to do is subscribe and you can subscribe with whatever podcatcher you like the best.  If it's luminary, that's fine.  iTunes, Google, Pocket Cast, Stitcher, Slacker, Spotify.  The best thing about subscribing is you'll get it the minute it's available and plenty of time for your Monday morning.  I do appreciate you listening and we'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can. Bye bye.  Why did I buy that?  They sent me a can.  I tried it and then I said, oh yeah, I'm subscribed to this.  Wait, wait.
