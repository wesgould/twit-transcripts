Transcript:  We'll get your we'll get your take on that. But I guess we probably should start with the big news of the week, which is  This is the this when I went visited my son's fraternity in  Boulder at CU Boulder, he said come on out. We're pre gaming. I said, oh great. What does that mean?  You this is like your tailgate before the football game the big football game and then y'all go to the game  So now we don't bother going to the game. We just  Pregame by the time we've done pre gaming really no shape to go to the game  So let's pregame the big events of the week and it's kind of funny first it started with Google announcing that on October 19th  Tuesday they were going to  Finally take the wraps off the pixel 6 of which no secret remains  we know everything there is to know about the pixel 6 and  At that point I think on Mac break weekly even I think Renee Richie and we all kind of conferred and said well that means  Apple probably won't do it that week, but the following week, but no  Apple said hold my beer and they announced last week that they're gonna do it on Monday the day before and there I  Don't know what they're gonna announce  But we think it's probably laptops and then little Samsung comes running along and I'd love you to psycho analyze this  And says wait wait, we're gonna do something on Wednesday  So this week Apple Monday Google Tuesday Samsung Wednesday  You couldn't get a more jam-packed week of announcements, let's start with the Mondays announcements  We talked about this at ad nauseam on  On Mac break weekly, of course, but it's pretty clear. They're gonna announce a new  MacBook Pro a 14 inch a 16 inch and maybe a new Mac mini which I know Alex you're  hot and bothered about there is a  Rumor has just come out  That we might know the names of the chips. The only really question mark really was  Are they gonna be the m1x the m2? What's Apple gonna call them? They're not gonna be m1s  They're gonna be a successor chip Mark Gurman in his power on newsletter  Says a Mac developer informed him that they saw in the app logs chip names  m1 Pro and  m1 Pro max  Or m1 max I guess not pro max. That's the phone  So now I guess they're consistent. Yeah. Well, we already own it. We already got the you know  We got we got it down. We could just do it that makes sense though because it is a pro version of

Start time: 613.46
End time: 642.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What we saw earlier which was well kind of the entry level and I think it may be delineating that there's the chips are gonna be  Very distinct from each other as opposed to just the same, you know, or relatively the same chip set  I think it was a little less clear with them the MacBook Pros and even with  With the iPads that there's some subtle differences based on the storage that you got right, you know in the chip set  And so this one would be probably clearer and probably a lot different, you know than than the original one

Start time: 642.54
End time: 674.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So if they're really interesting if there is a surprise, you know when the Apple announced the first m1  systems, they all had exactly the same chip and  You're right. The iPad Pro is slightly different. It's called an m1, but it's slightly different  But it's essentially same clock speed on the MacBook Pro 13 inch on the MacBook Air on the Mac mini  They're essentially the same chips and that it's the the package around them that that varies  This sounds like there's gonna be two chips. There's an m1 Pro and there's an m1 max. So that's kind of interesting  That's a that is a tidbit. We hadn't anticipated

Start time: 676.06
End time: 693.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it happens and it does make sense that it would it would make sense for them to include the iMac and the Mac mini if  Upgrading the chips, you know beyond just the so that you would get the more powerful  Laptops, but you would also get more powerful desks. Do you think they might do 16 inch MacBook Pro in two flavors and m1?

Start time: 694.46
End time: 706.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pro and an m1 max like do they do the phones kind of that way, you know when you buy the the  iPhone 13 you get the 13 or you get the 13 Pro or you get the 13 Pro max each of those is distinct same

Start time: 706.94
End time: 746.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hopefully they'll give people the choice between 14 and 16 having either chip and not put the smaller chip on the 14  Oh, that would be a 16. Yeah, it would be a little bit of a bummer  but yeah, but the but I think that you know, I think that the desktop I think that the timing is really good for the  desktops as well because  I was I was really looking at this announcement and trying to figure out how excited I was and I was like I really just  Want more Mac minis like I don't I don't need I don't you know  Cuz I most of us aren't traveling the way we used to like I don't have a need  Like I have to open up my I open up my laptop every once in a while and then it has all these updates that it  Has to do because I haven't used it for a month  So it's an it's an interesting it's a different space that that we've been in then what we've been in in the before times

Start time: 746.44
End time: 785.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple pioneered these all-in-ones. They were the first I think to do the iMacs where the computer and the display  Everything was in one piece nice for the living room. Not a lot of wires just kind of clean  Design but I wonder if if times have changed Georgia  Do you are you still like that? I'm a I mean, I've been all-in-one in front of me right now  But I think maybe I'm thinking at home. I would like more choice in display  This is especially true now where Apple has not doesn't have a display and and it and I would like to separate the processor from  the display do you think maybe that the idea of an all-in-one is  is over

Start time: 786.68
End time: 834.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Overaged over I think that it depends on your personality type  I think that some people like things to be kind of simplistic and straightforward and direct and they just  Want to be given what's the best and not really have to think about it and not have to look anything in  Yeah  and so I think that that  Definitely serves a certain type of person and then I think that other people want to be able to buy what they want to suit  its purpose and don't mind if there's more wiring or that they can move things around and they can be able to  Upgrade display without having to upgrade all the processing that happens within so I think that it all depends on your personality type  I think that for Apple like a lot of people would really enjoy being able to  Change the display without changing everything else and you kind of have your setup with that or have like many multiples  Yeah, that's me all kind of hooked up

Start time: 834.82
End time: 842.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have a 55 inch OLED that I'm using for a Windows machine Linux machine  But I would love to cook up a Mac mini to that. I don't need a display

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that for me I float my displays a lot  And so I think that's what I realized is that over the last little bit of time  I have you know these arms that cost anywhere from 80 to $250 that

Start time: 855.16
End time: 866.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 937.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So yeah, I think actually I don't know what the numbers are cuz Apple doesn't reveal them  But I would guess that the new IMAX at 24 inches sold quite well  And those were definitely not those are consumer products. They were they were smaller than the 27 inch I make they came in colors  They were really some people even said I don't think this is fair, but they're just an iPad on a stand  There were very thin simple clean devices  So maybe yeah, there must be a market for that bill are you a fan of the all-in-one?

Start time: 939.08
End time: 1033.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I don't like the all-in-one because I'm kind of like Alex and I'm like you're actually have a yeah  Well, I have a wide monitor I have a 50 inch  Samsung monitor in front of me right now  It's one of the ultra wide curved monitors and I love it because I can get so much information on it  And so now I will admit I run it off of a 2016 MacBook Pro  But I don't see an all-in-one for myself, but my daughter loves it  She's got a 27 inch iMac and she likes simplicity  And so in her room she uses that and then she just went off to college this year speaking college Leo  And your son it's perfect. She took what did she take with her a MacBook Air?  So, you know, she didn't take the iMac because she needed the portability  So, you know, I still like the I still like the variety  But I'll tell you what I'm most excited about if the rumors are true and the new  MacBook Pros  go away from  The silly things like the touch bar bring back magsa  back in SD card slot  Rid of the USB C  Charging because I just think go back to magsafe  Like I said that because the ports just wear out after plugging it in pulling it out plugging it in pulling off so many years  So I'm much more excited about those functional changes as a longtime MacBook Pro  That I was really sad to see go away, you know with the 2016 redesign  So more than the processors, I like more power  I like more RAM and everything but I want to see some of those other things come back

Start time: 1034.20
End time: 1050.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I don't like and this is again. This is rumor  But according to Mac rumors  And and the why bow account any turtle 999  There will be a notch on the screen of the Mac book pro. What I

Start time: 1052.10
End time: 1075.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Okay, but I do absolutely hate  The notch so to have like please don't do that  Just make it a little larger, but don't give me a notch. That would be horrifically horrifically bad

Start time: 1075.82
End time: 1092.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  it would be to solve the bezel problem because of course  One of the things I think they want to do with this 16-inch is put it in a  In a package is not much bigger than the 14-inch but with no bezels the screen goes all the way out to the edge  But then you have this problem with a camera at the top and so a notch might be

Start time: 1093.80
End time: 1112.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one thing that the notch does to do when you think about it though when you're talking about  Like face time what we're doing right now the notch brings the camera  Yeah, that's true. So so that's so that's gonna put your face, you know  That's gonna put your eyeline better and it's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and the way Apple does its operating

Start time: 1112.66
End time: 1131.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  System there's a menu bar at the top  So just like on a phone the notch would be in the menu bar  But I often run applications full screen over writing the menu bar and for me that would be a pro  I would not be happy that even a tiny bit of real estate is taken up.

That's what I want  You were talking about this earlier Alex, which is moving the notch  Down or the screen closer to the notch puts it closer to your eyeline  But like I'm looking at a camera that's at least four inches above my monitor  And I would rather have it right in the center  So you can actually sort of look at the face of the person you're talking to on a zoom call without trying to rig up  Teleprompter setup or another kind of you know external display, so that's really what I want in the next MacBook Pro

I agree bill that would be really  Yes, they got to solve this they sort of solve it Apple sort of solves it with their zooming capability  When you're using on  iPad Pro or I think the mini now does it  Face time and other apps if they're properly configured will zoom as you move around and

Transcript:  Yeah, the hard part is is the hard part really is the icon line line  You know the eye contact is is super important one of the things that we started  we've done a lot of insert studio work and the big thing with insert studio work is that  Usually there's no return video  So the video doesn't come back to the person because the broadcasters are too cheap to do that because that would cost money  And so so they just get your when you're watching CNN or Fox or whatever  There's they have an in-ear they're listening to the conversation and as you know, they're just looking straight at the camera  You know and what we what we learned when we started doing lots of in what we call in teratron  Which is putting the video into a teleprompter  Is that people's eyes and their facial expressions are different when they can see the other people that they're talking to so literally?  Their eyes converge slightly differently and then they do this funny thing where they mirror people and then they and they change what they're talking about  Because if someone puts their puts something puts their eyebrows up or down or nods a lot or looks looks  Concerned all those things bring out an entirely different person, you know from the person on the other side  And so it becomes it's not just it's not just a little  Inconvenient so a lot of us are moving toward like I'm getting a new teleprompter  My camera's right above it because I had a smaller teleprompter and I didn't like it you want to look right through it  Yeah, yeah, I want to look right at people and it and it and it's and we have a lot of people  On we have about half of office hours has on teleprompters and so so you see, you know, you see the getting every day  Oh on prompter about half of them. Are they reading stuff?  No, no, they're just talking the  Promptors just there so that we can talk to each other directly through the through the glass. You're on the prompter. Oh, that's interesting  Yeah, that's the  If you look at like into the void or fog of war from Errol Morris  Yeah, he does that and so we started doing it in the I mean, you know ten years ago or more with  interviews, but now we do it we've been doing it a lot for this kind of thing and it really makes a huge difference in  How people look because that direct eye eye contact is great  And it does make a difference like it's something that  Is worth doing and so we've been I put it off because I again I had it for a little while  Then I took it out because my mom my teleprompter itself was just too small to do everything I wanted to do  But now I'm putting a 24 back in  To because it I think I just made it  I just noticed how much of a difference it makes when I'm looking straight into the into the camera  You said the word

Transcript:  It sounds like you're interrogating somebody but he he has it like he invented it though now in office hours  We have the person who actually invented the digital in  Teleprompter so so he Courtney and and so he he's like well, he didn't invent it  I mean people were doing it in the 80s. It's just it's just that he's the one that popularized it  So I'm putting video in putting putting the video back into the thing as is really useful in the and you know  We built them at all different sizes. I think the largest one we built I think was  70 inches a 70 inch teleprompter, which was a little scary

Transcript:  In a lot of ways what we actually have a part of the brain that that fires that we have mirror neurons that like there's  There's parts of the brain that actually fire for two dots in a like a face shape  And it only fires for that and since most of the way that we engage with people is about we're constantly reading  Unconsciously all of the different micro expressions that people deal with so if someone moves back Alex as you were saying they move back  Or their eyebrows raise or they come forward. It's totally different. I do  Like, you know interviews sometimes on like like big network shows and sometimes I don't see the other person I'm talking to  Because in my head I'm going am I talking too long have I been too loud do they hate this  Giving me the cues hurry up or continue on I have no clue and so because of that  I'm just hoping that I'm reading the nothing because

Transcript:  So when I first heard about Errol Morris's technique, I thought you're just weird but now that you've explained it  I understand it's not just weird because he wouldn't even be in the room sometimes with the person he's interviewing

Start time: 1971.96
End time: 2041.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well and a lot of times he was in the room and curtained away and that's how we started but we actually found it  Was funny. We had a client. Well, you don't want the person looking over at you. You want him looking  You put curtains you put curtains in between yeah, and then and and with the way he did it  He didn't run like an IFB or a microphone  He just talked loud in the room and you could hear him talking but you're looking at him there  what we changed was creating a  environment where  The person is always in some other room or some other state or some other country and we started doing this with  The other place that we've done this is point-to-points where we put an executive in another country  You know, so there's like, you know, they have to talk in Singapore or Morocco and they don't want to spend four days  If you're a CEO for a fortune 100 company, you don't want to you know  and so and that one is interesting because  For them it was really good to look into it  But we found that if we actually put the monitor right below the camera  It would drop their eyes down below the camera and if you're in the room  It is it's like Wizard of Oz like it is this huge head looking right at you because you're  We actually wanted to drive that eyeline just a little below the camera  To see the audience.

Transcript:  The great and so I wonder if one of the reasons this works  Georgia is because your interview subject isn't  Talking directly to you. They're talking to the image of you. Do you think maybe they feel a little more free?  To self-express it's an odd it seems like a very artificial environment nowadays  We're used to it. This is how you and I are interacting  We're you know, we're in you're in Montreal. I'm in California and I'm looking at a picture of you  You're looking a picture of me. But at the time and imagine, you know  You're doing an interview the fog of war you're Robert McNamara talking about this. Why is the guy behind a curtain?  Does it give him more freedom to be candid you think

Transcript:  Sometimes we do that even in therapy certain therapists will be behind the person. That's right. They're dealing with therapy  They're not actually there so that the person can kind of be really free  Like I do certain exercises with people that I will turn off my camera and I'll turn off my mic since most of my sessions  Now are still over zoom so that they can be alone with their thoughts and I'm there but I'm not specifically

And as you kind of free speak you can kind of go wherever you want to without that interaction  So sometimes I would use it as a technique which I could see that that would be a benefit and then in other cases people might  Feel very uncomfortable with that because they might have more social anxiety and they're worried about being judged  And so they'll be in their head constantly saying what did you think of that and that might stop them the the chat room?

Transcript:  Well, and this is this is the way it started, you know, like this is that that's not what yours looks like  20 years ago or whatever or ours is just a you know, like that, you know 20 or 30 years ago that so he when he  Got started with it. That's what it looked like and and his is pretty rough  Ours is you know, we've got digital film cameras that are looking at each other and and it's and and I think that it is  one of the things we think about a lot when it comes to  Zoom sessions and so on so forth is cognitive load, you know  And so what is the cognitive because we can we run 24-7? There's a lot of literally how there is a lot of  But but that fatigue I think a lot of times comes from bad video bad audio  It's you're kind of listening for people you're kind of looking through that process  You're not people aren't really looking at you. All those things are things that that that each not that  There's no one of those that causes a problem  But but as a as a load they they over time take a lot out of you, you know  And so so what we find is that as we reduce that cognitive load by by reducing making it more comfortable  You're talking to people they you're better lit you sound better you look better  You know in that whole process and you're having that more fluid conversation  That that load reduces and you can do it for a lot longer and we do it, you know again we do it for  At least three hours a day  You know, so it does make a difference  Sort those things it's actually really  invigorating  You come out of it because we've been thinking about stuff all day  You know you're hanging out with 200 people a day every morning and you're talking about ideas and

And so  And so anyway, so the so this is I have to admit the zoom  It's kind of perfect for me because I can make turn it on and off  I can turn it on and off as needed, you know, like our but you wanted to get a word in I'm sorry

Transcript:  You know in the in the  And then in the age of remote work when everybody suddenly sort of goes to zoom and goes to video meetings  One of the things that I've found is really interesting is that you know, I think  I've been on camera for  Decades now and I'm a little bit of a ham and I don't mind the performative aspect, but I'd be interested to hear  You know George's take and Alex's take too because you know, I think that that performative part of it is also draining  so if you feel like especially in the early days of  The pandemic when everybody was doing zoom meetings for everything and nobody was doing face-to-face meetings  there was that extra level of energy that you were spending because you felt like  You had to be on camera and people had to act a certain way and it was just a different energy  And so I don't know if that it really didn't bother me because I'm kind of used to it  But I saw that on my team and I saw that in people that I was interviewing for my show  Dynamic developer on Tech Republic or for other interviews, you know  There was just this kind of unused to being on camera all the time and feeling like you still had to perform when you were  on camera  Even if it's just a facetime call or a zoom call with a colleague that you're trying to substitute a water cooler or a hallway  Conversation for so, you know not to completely derail the show, but you know  I'm really interested to hear what Georgia and Alex think about that

Start time: 2434.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Georgia so Georgia so I I like this is what I do for like I'm with people and and  Having to be you know  Someone that Sarah supports so I'm kind of used to being able to be that plus  I've done technology shows and podcasts and stuff for a really long time  I'm though like very high on the extraversion set like truly not just on camera  So I'm pretty similar to that me not on camera. I would be very similar to that. I think though that  Having to constantly put out a certain set of things is  Exhausting at a certain point and it is nice to be able to take some time off from that  I think that the hardest thing for me because I'm also like a caretaker  Worry about making other people feel bad or saying the wrong thing or insulting people  Because of that like the delay that happens and it's just a fraction like now people most people's internet connection  They're so good that it really is just a fraction  but even on the show here we sometimes step on each other's feet because I  Started talking when someone else talked and then we speak upon each other  That doesn't happen when we can see everyone and it's very clear because usually when someone wants to talk  There's like a little tiny like thing of like I'd like to speak next  Yeah, and we're missing a lot of that because when it's on me, it's just on me  So I don't see that Alex is really interested and wants to kind of you know, does that little tiny lean forward?  I'd like to say something and so that's the piece that I think it's fine  I find that that costs me a certain amount  Whereas usually I could be on camera and it probably wouldn't bother me a great deal  Though I do find that phone calls are less of an emotional cost that cognitive loan is less  but also that emotional load is less because I can drink or I can scratch my face or  You know if I feel an itch  I don't have to worry about not doing that and it's gonna look really horrible if I scratch my eye right now  Alex

Transcript:  I mean I think that that all of this has a load to it when we when we think about  Going to a meeting and you know what we were doing before was going to conference rooms  So now I have to drive down I have to go into the meeting. I have to dress up a certain way  I have to you know, I have to put on whatever  No, but my general state is you know, like I had a meeting with with someone in DC  Then I had French cuffs and a and a jacket and a tie and everything else and cargo pants cargo shorts  And barefoot and I was like this is the best  You know like you know and and you know  Cuz as soon as I you know  What's gonna happen as soon as I finish that meeting I'm gonna take that monkey suit off and I'm gonna put my flannel back  On and go back to what I was doing and so the ability for me  I guess the thing is there's everything has a give-and-take right and so so there are advantages and disadvantages for someone like me  There's more advantages than there are disadvantages  I can definitely see you know people who don't feel that way that they they really groved with what they had but for someone like me  The ability that I can go to my own kitchen and make my own meals when I want to I can I can see my wife  You know, we both work at home  So I get to you know, go over and say hi and talk about things for a little bit for you know in a break  I can wear whatever I want from from the you know from my my chest down  This is pretty much whatever I want to wear. I have a very controlled environment. I'm always well-lit  I always have I always sound good. I don't have that in the real world  I mean sometimes I'm not well-lit and sometimes I don't have good audio and I have a telestrator usually that I can use and  I have multiple computers that I can jump to and I have you know  and I can jump between things very quickly and  So I think that for me the control that I have over how I interact with people now  I do think what I will say is tiring is people with bad audio, you know bad audio and bad video  So like I find I literally you see these conferences and people put up virtual backgrounds. I literally won't go  As soon as I see a virtual background  I'm like I'm gone because that that that virtual background upsets my mind so much that I can't I can't even look at it  I can't and I'll listen to it sometimes sometimes I'll put it on some other monitor  I'll listen to it  I literally can't look at a virtual background because of all the edges constantly changing in there their glasses coming in and out when they  Move their hands they disappear and and I feel like that creates a huge cognitive load for me  You know that that I'm constantly trying to ignore that that is so weird, you know  And and so I think that  So I I think that this there's things that people do in zoom that make it  Horrible when it's done. Well, you know, we again we have for 21 hours a day  There's what we call after hours and it's the ultimate open office where there's 30 to 50 people in there and most of the cameras  Are off, but if you walk in and go hey, I'm trying to figure out today  I was like I literally walked in I said  I don't understand how to change the volume on this little road wireless go or whatever  Someone immediately turned on the camera said oh, there's a little button at the bottom that you just push the thing  I went back to what I was doing, you know and it's a

Transcript:  No, just go in there and just ask a question and and and so or Google like, you know  Like instead of googling we just ask it  But the point is is that the reason a lot of that works is that so many of us take take our?  Audio or internet are you know because like the little thing that you know when you're on Wi-Fi you break up  You have these micro stalls all the time and as you know, but Leo  I mean that's one of the first things we ask people to do is turn their Wi-Fi off and  I think that that all of these things the bad audio the bad video the things that aren't working  Create make you tired, you know  Because I know that when I used to be on like conference calls with people in conference rooms  I literally have to lie down when I was done  Like it was so much  It was like I was like because I could you spent the whole time trying to fit not think about what they were saying  But try to figure out what they were saying, you know, and and I think that you know, so a lot of this has been  A long time in coming I guess in my opinion

I'd far prefer I think that that's much more enjoyable  I think that there's benefits to doing it with technology base and I think that we've covered we're very lucky  We're very we have to fortunate those that can afford it  But there's a huge digital divide if you are  Tech-phobic if you're change phobic if you can't afford it if you don't have internet in your area  It kind of cuts you off from a world that's kind of leaving you behind and I think that that interplay among people  the stuff that you miss because you're only getting a kind of curated view of  Someone is also a huge cost to interplay among people where there's more chance that you might misinterpret  What someone's saying or they might misinterpret what you're saying and insult someone and you didn't really know that it happened and that also is  Can cut lead to a whole bunch of issues

Transcript:  Bill what do you think? Yeah, no, I well I I'm in the middle I agree with  Leo and and with you so I always enjoy  Face-to-face conversations, you know, I always enjoy doing my interviews with people in the same room  I always enjoy getting together when I would go to tech conferences when we used to go to tech conferences in the before times  You know, that was my favorite part was making personal connections  That you that I felt were stronger when you were there together  so I think we have to strike a balance which is  To Alex's point which is using this technology to allow us to overcome those geographic hurdles while at the same time  recognizing I think the innate human need for that  Personal face-to-face connection that you just don't get through a screen  At least I just don't get through a screen and I think a lot of people don't get to it  So we have this we we need to be purposeful in our you know connections that we make and that  Make an attempt to have those connections when we can and use the technology when we can  So I don't necessarily think it has to be an either or I think we just have to be smart in our use of technology  You know, it's either a benefit or a hazard and we just have to choose which it is

Transcript:  Well, and I think that I think that has been the thing that after you know  I think that that's one of the interesting things about what we've experimented with in office hours because that's the big lab  We've done it. We've met almost 600 days in a row. We're all in lab right now, right?  But but it's but but we have you know  5,000 people and any given day two or three hundred show up and there's 50 there all the time and the thing is is that is  That there's a connection that we've all had and I think that a lot of us consider that has been has been a big boat

Transcript:  You know, here's the thing though is that we know right? No, well, yeah  But but I would have never met these folks right like I would have never met them  I would have never been able to connect with them  I would have I mean in any given day where we have people coming in from four or five different continents  You know that are that are sitting there talking about how it is from there and people are understanding others  You know in a much different way because of the the fact that there when you're talking about  Something that's in London  I agree when you're talking about someone that happens in London or Israel or South Africa or the Philippines  We have people there every day from those countries, you know  and so so they can they sit there and talk about their their process to that and like for instance we  Have on any given day 15 to 20 people talking at the same time  Like you know, like what we're doing here except with 15 to 20 people and it is very civil and just kind of works because  We figured out how to do that after 600 times. You get good at it  and  the  But what happens though is that we could never put that that that group on stage you could never put 19  I have put 19 people on stage. It's a horrible experience. Yeah, you know, it's a horrible idea, you know  And the Mormon Tabernacle choir, but other than that, it's not a good  So yeah, so the thing is is that there's absolutely costs  I think that but I think that a lot of the costs that we see when people are feeling disconnected  I'm gonna keep coming back to they're not playing very hard like not just them  Is not you know, they have bad video bad audio and it makes a huge difference in how it how it appears when you're coming  Across at high resolution with good audio and you're it's a much more connected experience  Is it the same as being in person?  No, but it also doesn't require the flights and the cars and the parking and all the other things that are required to it  Yeah, and so and and you can we need a little above

I think that's why bill we've talked a lot about  Conferences and the loss of conferences they've all gone virtual and most people who say well what we should do is some sort of hybrid  thing where we get the benefit  Well, I know you may think that but I think for instance the Apple events where they have pre-recorded stuff  It's fine  But there is also a place to get together and see the things and talk to engineers  Those are valuable contacts to and maybe this is your natural  Tenancy Alex and you well, no  But but honestly, I think that that that there are a lot of us still for whom human contact is an orgy  And I worry about there's a long-term effect.

Yeah, we're part of the tech Republic family  I think and Alex Lindsay also part of our family Mac break weekly the founder and a regular host of Mac break weekly and rubs leg  In the new rubs leg Star Wars story appearing soon  Disney Plus our show today brought to you by something we use all the time and I love stripe  What a great way to improve your  posture and  In terms of e-commerce we use stripe for our payment platform on Club twit  That's when I first I mean I knew I've known about stripe for years, but that's when I really became a customer man  I am now blown away by stripe  Stripe is the payments platform with stripe your business can easily optimize your payments infrastructure  Simplify its expansion plans create new revenue streams and all help you grow and initiate change  Rather than having to react to it those of us who are stripe users and stripe customers often remark about the incredible  efficiency stripe adds  To businesses like Shopify to Postmates to Twilio. They all use stripe to power their global payments  We use a member full which is a patreon company and they use stripe  Twilio and this is I think pretty typical  Increased its authorization rates by an impressive 10% with stripe and they actually tested it with an a b test  Using multiple global payment processors stripe help Postmates generate over 70 million dollars in revenue  Increasing their authorization rates. I've seen stripe users on Twitter say as much as 20%  Improvement stripe is great. It's easy to use once integrated their single platform and world-class Docs documents are so important  allow businesses to easily experiment so you can scale and grow revenue and  Stripe is a leader  I mean they process billions of dollars every year for every size business  From precede startups to fortune 500 companies with stripe and this was important to us. You're easily international  They support 135 plus currencies and payment types and they're always improving stripe does not sit  Still they do not rest on their laurels  There are new features hundreds every year new improvements to help you stay ahead of the industry as it moves  And I love the five nines API uptime  250 million plus API requests a day  We launched Club twit this year with stripe as our payment platform. It's seamless and accepting payments and issuing refunds  We couldn't be happier with that. In fact, if you've if you've  joined Club twit you've experienced stripe and  It's great that you can get 135 different currencies and payment methods in there. Let's us focus on business  Producing quality podcasts while we don't have to worry about the payments and the money movement because stripe does it for us  Stripe also and I always like to talk about this with with our sponsors as an invested interest in our earth with stripe climate  You can direct a portion of your revenue to help scale emerging  Carbon removal technologies and it's very easy to set that up and I encourage you to take a look at it  Whether you're an online or in-person retailer software platform  Marketplace or subscriptions business visit stripe str.

It's easy and man as it work  Stripe comm  Thank you stripe for making it so easy to run Club twit. Thank you for supporting this week in tech  stripe comm  All right, we talked about Apple I guess we should give Google equal time Google's pixel 6 and pixel 6 pros phones  Which are absolutely zero secrets about I'm hoping Google has some one little thing that no one knows  The the ads for the pixel 6 have now been leaked  There's very little  That we haven't seen about this  Pricing I think we're gonna see  I think we're gonna see seven hundred fifty dollar for the pixel 6 somewhat under  $1,000 for the pro  Custom tensor chip a system on a chip designed by Google  Pretty colors, although I'm not sure all colors combinations will be available on all platforms  They they I think this is gonna be very interesting but you know  We don't really know much until it actually  Comes-out well, maybe we do look at this table  This looks like the specs table you would see the announcement I'm most interested in the cameras  The pro will have three cameras of 50 megapixel wide 48 megapixel  Telly and a 12 megapixel ultra wide of course Google's camera software has always been great  They've kind of rested on their laurels for the last two releases  In fact, I didn't even get a pixel 5 because I thought my pixel 4 was more than adequate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm ready for the pixel 6. I think the camera is everything at this point. It is isn't it say it is a  That's what you use the phone for  Probably more than actually a phone is taking pictures  And so so I think that rightly so both Apple and Google have spent an enormous amount and Samsung has spent just enormous number of  amount of engineering time on trying to make trying to figure out where they get their  What makes them different? You know Apple's gone down one path with the last phone where they have  Apple Pro res and macro and you know those types of things and Google is going towards resolution  Which it turns out well  There's gonna be a whole they're able to carve away a group of people where that's more important than what Apple's apples

Start time: 3807.18
End time: 3877.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  50 is it do you think you'll actually be 50 the hard part is is that when you get to that size good lord  the hard part is the errata related so a lot of this is computational photography because the  The issue you get into is that the errata created by having such small sensor sites  So, you know to do 50 megapixels theoretically  You know if you really have a sensor that's able to take 50 megapixels for a small sensor on the camera  That means that each photo site that is saying I've that's seen light  It is there's a lot of chance that it could be a little wrong  And that's what we see with grain and we start gaining up we start seeing those things and so as when you make that  You want to make the chip larger so that you can get better low-light performance. You can get more  You know better quality a quality of pixel, right?  And that's what Apple is really focused on more of each pixel getting better as opposed to putting more pixels into it  Now there are a lot of things you can do  Once you have a 50 megapixel image when you shrink it down to a 12 megapixel image  It's going to get rid of that as well  And so so having the raw resolution especially in well lit scenes could be advantageous  But it's it's still it's a lot of pixels to put into a whatever size they're putting in 1 1⁄2 inch chip.

Start time: 3911.76
End time: 4003.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it is, you know, I kind of I expected to like the folding phones  I tried the first ones and you know, I was kind of so so on them, but I like I like them now  I think there's a real use case for them and for me personally  I I would actually spend my own money and buy one of them  The problem is my daily driver is an Apple and so, you know  I am deep into the Apple ecosystem in my personal life  And so I don't see myself actually, you know  Just switching out of that ecosystem and going Android and Google of even if I love the hardware so that's kind of hard  And you know, what's really interesting you were talking about the cameras on the pixel 6  I'll be interested to see what the new tensor chip and the hardware in the phones Alex to your point can do around  Photos, right? I mean and they've got this magic eraser feature  I guess that is rumored to come out that'll remove things from the photos  I don't know. I mean, I'm kind of caught in the middle  I love Apple's commercials and all the high-end phone commercials where they show people who are filmmakers using them to create films  But I never use my phone to capture anything that that's it that that's  That's that interesting and exciting. So I don't know if I've reached a point where kind of phones are good enough  I mean you can always get a little bit better, but I don't I don't know, you know  I'm still you know, I'm still about the ecosystem more so than the hardware on the camera

Yeah, I don't like it. It's fakey  It's like those fake  Backgrounds are the fake blur that people are using on zoom. It bugs the hell out of me

Start time: 4020.94
End time: 4063.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that there are times when it hits it. Okay, I play with it a little bit  I admit I don't use it very much either  But but I think that it's it's I think that there is a place for it when you're making tic-tacs or  But and when I do product shots  Sometimes I use it because it just it just gets rid of whatever's behind the errata behind it and and on products where you don't  Have hair it doesn't cut it all, you know cut off all the little  Bits that make it feel unreal. So so I think that I think that  that  That I don't think is that exciting  I think that the macro on on Apple's phone is  Unbelievable like and and that is so exciting. I mean it is like I can't stop I do I use it all the time

Almost as good or as good as what I was taking with the probably five six seven thousand dollars worth of camera equipment  So, you know, that's the amazing thing about technology that now you get that functionality in the you know  In the palm of your hand and your pants pocket.

Transcript:  It's a really here's something interesting. This again is just rumor. Although like I said, Google is a leaky sieve when it comes to this stuff  Looks like they're also gonna announce something called pixel pass  which I'm  intrigued by a  monthly subscription  That gives you a pixel phone with the promise of regular upgrades. Are those hardware upgrades? Maybe it gives you  Google one play pass YouTube premium and network coverage from Google Phi  You get an extended device warranty preferred care or device protection  Now I doesn't say I don't know what the price is of this the leak did not include that  We'll have to see or where it will be available, but that is kind of interesting. I'm already a Google Phi user  so this might be a  Apple kind of offers that where you you get a new phone every year  Yeah, the iPhone upgrade program. Yeah. Yeah, but I think this is includes a whole bunch of other stuff  I mean if it's a good deal Google has to do something because let's be honest. They just don't sell these phones very well  They're not in phone stores. People don't see them  It's really a small group of people people who listen to this show or are all about Android show who buy these pixel  Phones the other question will be will we see the foldable because picks Google is a  Rumored to be working on a foldable phone for some time  The one rumor said they were gonna start producing the phone this month, which means probably they would announce it

Transcript:  Well, and I think that one of the advantages that Google has is that there's so many other people were using their operating system that they don't  You know they need to build one that allows them to dog food things allow it keeps them in the market make sure that  They still have the ability to turn that on and that does  Allow them to keep trying to push some technologies forward with all of their partners  But but their situation is different where I think they needed to be cash positive  But I don't think they need to have the same  I don't think their their goal is to take the the same size of the market, you know, they had Android has that for them

I want to give you I want to I want to get your reaction your emotional reaction  Did you watch the launch in Jeff Bezos his penis rocket? Did you did you watch Bill Shatner come back?  I'm sorry. I shouldn't do that to you  When did you watch Bill Shatner come back and and and he was in tears he was in he was so moved was that cool

Transcript:  I think it was cool. Like I would totally go up into space if I could you got a quarter of a million  That's the thing. That's the thing that bothers me. It's just like I don't know. It's these billionaires doing you know  billionaires and billionaires doing things that you're like like  It's just so self-engraciating and I'm like we could have used money for something else  That's just the piece of it. But the other piece is William Shatner going to space. That's awesome  I'm a star trek fan. So like I'm I'm totally with it. I think that that's really cool  but  Like it wasn't it wasn't I was not moved like it was not a huge thing for me. I'm happy for him  But I don't know. Does it does it really help the planet any how does it benefit?

Transcript:  Are we spending money wisely I had the same reaction and of course  I really didn't like how much they promoted the fact that they're astronauts when Bezos went up  It really I found it a little bit offensive because they're not they're not really doing anything  That you know, Alan Shepard didn't do 50 years ago  But when Shatner came back at least I did understand one benefit of sending non astronauts up into space  artists poets people who can talk is  He really  expressed in so it's such a beautiful way the moment of going out of the atmosphere into the black of space and  Really realizing how fragile our planet was and I thought that was quite beautiful and quite real  and so I do think there is an advantage to sending people like Shatner up because  They're gonna give us a take on this that we can identify a little bit better with than the astronauts and engineers who have preceded him

Transcript:  Well, I mean we have to remember that I mean for better for worse most of the things  Many things that we have in the world are rich people's like we're rich people messing around, you know  Like, you know with their money and instead of spending it all where it should go  I mean, you know the the helicopter was you know an auto gyro and you know  Like that was a rich person trying to figure something out  You know and you know that but a lot of the things that we you know, the the  Conquest, you know the whatever we sent ships out all over the place and we've done all those things and again not all of it  Was net positive for everyone  But but the point is is that a lot of technology goes through by people starting this way  There's gonna be some point 20 or 30 years from now that we're  That we are doing this all the time and that's what this is where it starts  It's never gonna happen when the government's doing it because it's just it's just too much, you know  There's just this is a lot of money that we're not that the government isn't spending on doing that and it allows NASA to focus  On things that are like Mars, you know and like other things because there's other there's someone else taking care of those things for them  So I think that I think that there's a real, you know interesting possibility, you know, I think it's easy to say  Well, they should put that money somewhere. But well, it seems like a lot of money it  It's not a lot of this  Trying to fix problems, it's not it's not that much money. They won't it won't solve anything more than what's already being solved  I mean, you know what, you know, it's it's good have better use

Transcript:  No, I would just wonder  Part of me because I can see both sides of the argument you want to make sure that our financial resources  Whether they're private or public are being put to good use at least you'd like to think that  On mass right for society's benefit as a whole  but you know, I wonder if some of the backlash is just from the amount of kind of showmanship or  Excess celebration. That's what bugs me. Yes. Yeah, and so, you know, I like you Leo  I did watch it and I listened to Shatner's words and I think a lot of listen to a lot of the scientists  That I do and some astronauts, you know  That was the benefit they see is putting regular people exactly in the space who can come back and share their experiences and  Show others that this is a future that we want to take  These are the voyages as a species we want to make we need to move out and there's a real possibility of being able  To do this so I would which I thought you got to some degree maybe  With some of the early space exploration missions, you know where sure there were ticker-tick parades  People were hailed as heroes, of course, you know and I well deserved  But I get the sense that it was a collective  Celebration around something look what we have done as opposed to look what I have done  I'm gonna pop the champagne and it's all and even though you make you know  Bezos or Richard Brands and talk about the teams that they have and the amazing people there and so does Musk with SpaceX  You still when you see those images you just got a little bit of yes  It's you know, it's me and and that rubs people a little bit the wrong way. I think yeah

Transcript:  I'm you know, I  It's a mixed bag and yeah, and I do feel like I've been reading  Bradstone's new book about Amazon Amazon about he talks a lot about Blue Origin and  While there is this aspect of billionaires competing, you know Bezos  Damn that Elon Musk. He got the contract and must going. What's he doing? That's not you know, there's that little bit of that but  Honestly what Blue Origin is hoping to do is very important  You know and and Bezos is a businessman  He says this is one of my investments that might take decades to pay off  but ultimately I expect Blue Origin to make money mining asteroids or  Maybe in space tourism. I think space tourism has to be the least important thing that Blue Origin is doing  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's about building that infrastructure. Yeah, you know exactly point, right?  Asus has said he couldn't have built Amazon without the infrastructure that already existed of the post office of FedEx and shipping and  The internet so we need that infrastructure of spaceflight for all the great entrepreneurs to envision new businesses and opportunities  Beyond the planet as well as people like Shatner to tell us look, you know  If you screw up the planet if you screw up the environment, we don't have anywhere else to go  Space is hard and cold and it's death  Yeah, so we should really take care of the planet so and and just like  You know ever a lot of people that I've talked to just like Georgia. I would go in a heartbeat  So if anyone I would do going to fund my trip  Send it my way and I'm on the next ship. Yeah. Yeah, I'd rather go in orbit

Start time: 5229.60
End time: 5259.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if I can't go in orbit and I'm maybe we shouldn't go in orbit  I wouldn't mind the amusement park ride  Yeah, it's you know what we live in interesting times don't we at least we're going we're doing stuff  For there were there was a period of time there after the end of the shuttle where we weren't doing much at all  So it's nice that we're kind of back in space  Are you gonna get a vibe flow Georgia Dow I know you're big into virtual reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm you know  I wanted to ask you about it because you use the use the vibe use the vibe don't you as well as the oculus rift?  I believe you do yes, and we have a vibe. I love the vibe  I'm not a VR fan like you are Georgia's family has three rooms dedicated to virtual reality  So that they can all play at once  This looks this vibe is interesting. It's lighter  It's it's it doesn't have a battery in it or power in it you have to plug it into an external battery  You don't need to wear glasses with it it has a diopter adjustment in there so you can adjust it to your eyesight  $500 but vibe says the flow is intended more for relaxation. It's not a gig. I think the others are for gaming more  According to the information the intent of the vibe is  more  For sitting back and looking at things you know if if I could run this to do

Transcript:  meditations and  phobia  Experiences in my office  I would be a hundred percent in because I would love to do exposure therapy  Which I think is it so in vivo exposure therapy is when if you have say a fear of elevators  We're gonna be going into elevators if you have a fear of heights  We're gonna be taking the heights the wonderful part is that our brain the  Our actual visual cortex of our brain  It's so powerful that we do believe it if we see it like if you've ever done any of the experiences where you're really high  Up and using like virtual reality you truly believe that you are there your body is like no  I'm there don't go and you'll have the full experience to it. So this would be a  Wonderful standalone because it's affordable. It's on its own. I don't need to set it up to a system  I don't need to make sure that all the cameras are there and there's no light  It would be standalone and I could do meditations make you feel really relaxed and then do exposures. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would definitely buy it and you might be able to do this. So they they're proposing a five dollar ninety nine cents subscription per month subscription  But because you tie it to your Android device  It can also be a view screen for anything you can put on your Android phone  So presumably these PTSD treatment programs could be made available  As an app on the on the Android phone and it could then be part and that's kind of nice because you can control it  They can do additional things with it. It does not have  Hand controls and I wonder how you feel about that  HTC said they don't feel like hand controls are rely hand tracking is reliable enough and robust enough and they're afraid that if they put  It on the device and it doesn't do it reliably. It's just bad for the brand  Have you how do you feel about that? I

Start time: 5434.00
End time: 5470.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't like the fact that there's not hand controls. I think that  Interacting with things it's better if we interact in person with it  It makes me feel disjointed to what I am controlling and I don't think that the system is like  When I when you use like a quest and you have like at least a little bit of hand control even though it's not fully tracking  Everything I find that's much better experience for me than being able to use another manner of tracking for it  So that would be another reason why I probably wouldn't get it  But again, we're getting closer to be able to treat people in ways that you know  They can really be helped and I think that that's an area of virtual reality that has not been properly explored

Start time: 5470.88
End time: 5481.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and this would be a good candidate for it. It's light, you know, there's no straps  You have to adjust you're not strapped into the VR headset. It's just like putting on kind of weird  I think that there's a lot goals. I

Start time: 5484.14
End time: 5538.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think that there's some there are definitely some places where you don't need to interact  That you could just experience a space experience walking around and looking at something without having to actually  Touch it, you know, and so like we've done some museum  Stuff where we've you know virtual museums where it's like a 30 by 30 space and you can walk around in it and you can  Just experience it. You're not you're not interacting with the statues the virtual statues  You're just walking around and looking at them  And so so I think that there's definitely a place for not having to deal with all the other bits and pieces to it  I also think that in some cases there's  Some folks that that I know I've been working on  PTSD for you know, and some of that treat some treatment that's related to it along with you know, augmenting augmented treatment  And in those areas, they're not using any of that. They're really just experiencing what they what they need to experience

Transcript:  The for some reason HTC took some heat because their photos of the  Device were really just photos of stock photos of people with the device photoshopped onto it  It's not the same exactly with same person girl. Yes, it's wearing the same clothes  This is the this is the I stuck  Photo and this is her wearing that's the same photo wearing, you know, those ad budgets aren't what they used  Yeah, I don't you know, they didn't do a shoot is not the end of the world

Start time: 5577.80
End time: 5611.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know a lot of times that is the  Someone probably used those photos for the like as the test and then they just what what happens there  Here's the behind the scenes on some of that is you go down you download a bunch of stuff from iStock  You say this is what we want to do  So in all the the the tests for the ads you all have those things in that now you're gonna go out and do the  Photoshoot right and the photo and what happens is you do the photoshoot you don't like it as much as the iStock ones  And yeah, it's like, you know, let's just stick with the ones we have it actually works pretty well  It was a shoot. There was probably a shoot there that just didn't didn't go. Okay. Yeah, you didn't make it to the thing

Transcript:  There's a thing and who knows maybe there was a you know, they're a time constraint  Maybe they didn't have the production models ready. Now they get free publicity about  I'm glad to see actually HTC making more because I don't want Facebook to own this space  I think the vibe is a good product. I was worried that they might have decided that it's not enough money to continue development  So it's good to see them making this of course  Everybody's just waiting to see what Apple does and it's widely rumored that Apple is both doing a VR and a mixed reality  Headset the VR will be out maybe next year and then the AR set the year after I think that one one thing that's distinct

Start time: 5665.36
End time: 5743.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From what Apple's doing and what everybody else is doing is they're building the production pipeline, right?  Very very slowly  So if you watch what what's happening with USDZ and motion and Final Cut and everything else  They're putting all these 3d tools in that don't make any sense right now  So so the you know, like a lot of those tools are like why would they do that?  And and then they have object capture so that you can capture 3d objects  And so they're slowly seeding the market with the ability to create the content for it, which is what's missing  Right now it's pretty arduous to build content for  Oculus or or for the vibe and so so making it something that anybody can do  Is going to be is going to be a game-changer. I think when when Apple  Does whatever they're gonna do. I think that they're what they've done is a very very orderly rollout  Where they're just slowly adding the pieces that need to be added you can see it happening in slow motion  It's very over the last five years. Yeah over the last five years that USDZ  I think was four or five years ago is when they announced it and then they've been rolling out object, you know, they reality  creator reality converter object capture and you know, and then you know motion now has it you can open up a 3d model in preview and  You know and it's it's amazing, you know, and so those are the kind of things that that are possible right now, Georgia you still

Yeah when we start getting into higher frame rates  So really we're really clamped down in the you know  The 30 or 60 frames per second and also the very low resolution of 4k per eye, you know  Or or less oftentimes and so when we when we start seeing, you know  High frame rates in the 90 to 120 frame per second at you know, 8 8k per eye  It is completely different, you know  It's a completely different experience as you start to go down that path where it really feels like you're somewhere  and so so I think that that's gonna  We're still again. We're still looking like everything we've seen so far is like the 320 by 240 video version of what is probably  Still four or five years away

Transcript:  This is why it's still all about the content and I think this is what's important about Alex's point  You know is that the pipeline has to be there of content that you're looking for that  I'm still looking for that one killer app, you know  I tried the the oculus and I've tried the vive and I've got a ps4 VR that I played  And it really you know, it was it was a completely different experience games that I had played in  Not VR and then played him in VR. I actually enjoyed the immersion a lot better  But to me there's still you know, I'm still not completely sold  There's still something missing yet for me to be able to say that's an essential technology  So I hope is the tech gets better the content gets better. So you're you find that one thing  Maybe this is a solution to the conversation we were having earlier where you have those face-to-face  interactions in VR  in the metaverse and that's the  That's the tech conference of the future

Transcript:  I think that that that's gonna be further away than most people think you know  I think that when we talk about you know, like we you know, we I've been playing since second life  I've been playing with you know virtual and my my daughter is an interior designer in roblox  Like she literally people pay her roblox money to like do their house up and stuff like that  and so so I see a lot of I see a lot of roblox and and I  And I've been watching a lot of this and I think that people get very excited about it  But I find the process of the digitalization of a person to be  Really dehumanizing and and I think that it is it actually it is I spent a I've spent a lot of time  using you know using  Unreal or epics metahuman which isn't amazing by the way for what what I use it for which is pre-visualization and everything else  But when we start animating the face, the problem is the face actually  Metahuman faces look really close to human faces like it really starts to close that gap and it's immediately super weird  You know like it's it's you know, so because it's uncanny  Yeah, it is you get into the uncanny valley and you're like, okay  And the problem is is to get to that  We're still a long way away like from us being able to like have our own version of it and be able to capture our  Face accurately and be able to send it back  I did a project where I did a bunch of metahuman and I would have been happier with the Memojis and I understand the  Memojis a little bit better now whereby lowering that resolution and making it kind of cartoony  I'm totally I'm impressed and I'm excited about it and it's really cool and it's so realistic  But not really realistic and that's the part that I think I think it's gonna take us at least a decade  And I think that I don't know if we're gonna really feel like we need it, you know

What have them they've been doing what have they been consuming?  Because I deal with so many people that have anxiety ticks and anxiety has been skyrocketing right after the pandemic  People being locked inside spending a lot of time on social media  Yeah, it would be one of again. I probably see this more than others because I'm an anxiety therapist  So I would see anxiety more often and someone else that deals with other things might you know say that it could be something else  But I would probably look to like the straightest line is probably the truth and it's just so much  It's so very common to get ticks when you feel anxiety since March 2020 and what happened in March 2020?

Like so you're looking you scroll you starting to like, you know slow down  It's tracking that and so because of that you're gonna get more videos that deal with that and because it's gonna be something that's kind of  Explosive and pops out and unexpected you're probably gonna pause more often and so feels your feet this one

We like to think that we're all we're we're like making our own choices and dealing with that  But actually for most of our development we are just mimicking behavior, right? And that's a very strong mimic  So if you do have an influencer or even if you hang out with people that speak with an accent  Every once in a while you may say a word with an accent or there's a lot of people that will just suddenly merge and chameleon  Into saying things do that all the time  Walk it's just they're submerged in that and so that part of our brain that deals with mimicry which we also have  Specialized neurons that just deal with mimicking behavior because of that  Yes an influencer that you like has a much greater influence like what you consume  Actually physically modifies your brain and so I think that we do need to take a look at we're very careful about what we consume in food  We need to be even more  Like important and take a look at what we consume for our brains  Because it is physically modifying the way that we feel about and what we do with things but people spend an average

This show is so successful for Netflix  Now Netflix does not want me to tell you this so I will not tell you this I will let Bloomberg tell you this  Bloomberg got confidential viewing data  Netflix an attorney representing Netflix said in a letter to Bloomberg  It would be inappropriate for Bloomberg to disclose the confidential data in the documents  Netflix does not discuss these metrics outside the company and take significant steps to protect them from disclosure  So I'm not saying this I'm just reading a Bloomberg article. Okay, but according to Bloomberg  at least  132 million people have watched at least two minutes of squid game and that was in the first 23 days  Which actually made it the most popular Netflix show of all time  And this is the number that Netflix never tells you because Netflix doesn't charge per show, right?

They climb Mount Everest, which is very dangerous  Has a great chance of death and it's for nothing at all, but the accolades  I think the only difference was if it would be on TV  They would be more people going into these games in the hopes of winning money  But if you're down and out and truly hopeless any chance of hope might make you go off and do something and unfortunately  human behavior we often  overestimate our own skills and chances at things and so because of that you'd be like but I could win and  So would choose to stick in because in the game as long as more than half the people decided to quit  They still could so it was also about free will and choice and this was not where you were forced to do this  You did have a choice if enough people that were dealing the games could stop and so I don't know  I think that it is much more realistic than you know, the dark side of humanity than we give it credit for

Transcript:  I think that I think that I I we talk a lot in our family when we watch me media about what we put in  Our what we call our mind's eye  And just it's really like if we see something that we're like, whoa, that's what's there. I don't want that my head  Yes  I work in challenging places around the world where people have gone through a lot and  But I'd rather it be doing something useful rather than just as entertainment  I just don't need to to work on work on that problem in that area. So I keep it pretty  pretty basic  But we still watch a lot of things. I mean just it's just that was something that looks just wholly like wow that is  As a crazy level of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm with you a hundred percent. I don't want that in my head, you know, because it'll it'll stay there  It'll come up it on an opportune moments  Wow, you heard about deep fakes there are deep voice fakes  Last year in the UAE a bank manager received a call from the director our director at the company  With whom he'd spoken before the director said his company was about to make an acquisition. He needed the bank to authorize transfers  35 million dollars worth of transfers  The bank manager knew the guy's voice  So he did it  What he didn't know is he had been duped that the fraudsters had used deep voice technology  to clone the director's speech  The this is a court document unearthed by Forbes just this week in which the UAE has sought American investigators to help tracing  Half a million of those stolen funds because they went into US-based bank accounts  That's about all I know but don't trust don't

Transcript:  Yeah, that's the scariest thought because you could be called by someone that you recognize like they have all of these calls where they say  Oh, I'm your nephew. I'm in jail  Please send this much money to bail me out  And usually I'd be like that you probably recognize your nephew like depending on how you gotta be a dope

Transcript:  Yeah, that was my thought though Leo right exactly is how poor were the controls at this bank  Yeah, that they allowed a transaction of that  Amount to be done based on one person's you know, you know one person's word  And if you recognize the voice and supposedly, you know after reading the story, there were some email transactions  But still, you know, I've been part of M&A as I've gone through this process and there's like months of  Work up to this there's multiple signatures there's lawyers and banks  I'm just it baffles me. Maybe I'm just not in the right circles and international kind of finance here  But you know, it baffles me that this scam was able to work  I mean, maybe they tried it 50 times and this was the one time that it worked

Start time: 7916.30
End time: 7987.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that also it depends on what what is the scale?  How often does does that bank manager do a 35 million dollar transaction?  How often do they what what amount of money is that related to is it related to half a trillion dollars or to?  100 million dollars and and so, you know in UAE  You could be that could be like someone's chump change, you know, like, you know, I'm just like they you know that they lost  It's a lot to us  But but I've you know, I've seen people spend a lot of money on things that you know  That I wouldn't spend the money on I'm like, wow, that's a lot of money, but but it's not but for them  It's not you know  And so I think that I do think it's crazy and I think the deep fakes I still I will argue that they're healthy for us  Because I think it's important for us not to trust right what we see and hear it's really important that we you know  When we see something we go. Okay, I need to see that from a couple different angles  I need to verify and you know and and do all these other things when I'm being asked to do something because  It's always been that way to some degree  I mean, that's how confidence games work is you believe that somebody is who they aren't  And I think that we're now getting really clear that you really can't  Trust a video or audio at its face value and I think that that's good  You know because I think that it keeps us from from believing things at face value because we really shouldn't you know

Transcript:  The only problem with that though Alex is that people are infinitely lazy by nature  And so yes  There will be some people that will try to use science or take a look at things or research  But for most of us we like people don't even click an article anymore  Like they see the title and that is what they believe and if it goes into what is already your cognitive bias  We want to believe the things that are within our cognitive bias  And so we won't even want to question we might even deny looking at other things that are not within our  comfort level of bubble and so that area of scope is  Unfortunately, this could be then used to manipulate people even more easily. I think that when I think I think you're right

Start time: 8030.06
End time: 8071.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think that that's definitely but we've been manipulated for a long time  Oftentimes, I'm the one with the shovel, you know  And so the so the thing is is that is that when we you know  We do a lot of things to manipulate people like, you know the height of the camera and a crowd  The kind of questions that we ask the words that we use, you know, like all of those things drive that, you know  like so we're you know, the you know, how where people are allowed to put cameras where  You know how when what was that person's position when we asked that question or how we put it together?  And so the thing is is that those are all things that we use to manipulate people in how in in what we hand them  You know, and we try to have you know open conversations  I think that that that that is why I have to teach media literacy because yeah

So you're but but it's so smooth that a person doesn't realize it and that's that is just as manipulative as  a deep fake because  I don't know

Start time: 8111.12

Transcript:  But but when when but when we stopped losing when we start looting, you know for a long time for instance  DNA was like one of those things like once we find dna you're done like, you know when we have dna  And then there was this thing called chain of custody  And chain of custody has basically in many places destroyed the dna evidence  Because now as a as a uh, like like by the way, I probably shouldn't say it on here  But like if you're in if you're in a jury pool and you say i'm going to be really interested in chain of custody  You know how quickly the prosecutor will get rid of you like like that  They don't want to have any conversation about that  They don't want any juror to think about chain of custody because because it unravels the entire trust the entire chain of trust  Because it's almost impossible to maintain chain of custody, you know  Like like at a level at the same level as the dna itself, right?  And so but it's what but what's important is is that that that was too tight like the dna by itself because it could be planted  It could be inserted. It could be there's lots of other places and that's just blindly trusting

Start time: 8207.46
End time: 8213.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just gonna say  You still have to gather the dna if it's actually there like I guess you can say that it's there and it's not

Transcript:  And yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean that's right. But the point is that i'm not saying it's not it's still a trial actually  So yeah, it was yeah, but the thing is is that yeah

Start time: 8222.04
End time: 8234.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and but it's it's one of those things that that it was  It was too blind. It's you're right that it's hard  But it was too blindly followed for a long time where it was just and there's a lot of people in jail

Start time: 8234.48

Start time: 8242.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially when we're when it comes to results and things that we see in the media  You were talking about media training and I used to teach this in my class for folks  I don't know. I have a couple criminal justice degrees and I used to be an adjunct professor for a decade or so  and so  you know we would talk about media bias when it comes to exactly what you were talking about in the  CSI effect we used to call it because you know people would see this technology as infallible and they would see things on television that  They thought were the way the real criminal justice system works and it wasn't and so they would be a prosecutor's kind of worst nightmare  And expect like this has to be perfect or they could be a defendant's, you know, a defense attorney's nightmare, too  Expecting them to sort of have this exculpatory evidence  That that just wasn't how our justice system has really ever worked  And I think that's kind of you know, that's the quandary that we find ourselves in with technology whether it's internet  You know, I know we had some things having this week around 230  um, and and what in deep fakes so it is what do you trust right and how do we  Teach, uh, how do we how do we help a large enough section of our society?  Be skeptical enough that they ask those tough questions  But also not be so skeptical that they don't believe anybody because as humans right, you know  We trust relationships more than we trust facts, right?  And so I think that's the balance that we're still trying to figure out with  All whether it's social media or whether it's deep fakes or whether it's a, you know fake voice call  How do we manage that?  Skepticism in a healthy way and that that's a hard question to answer and it you know to your point joy  It's not it's it's not a um

We'll wrap it up  Great panel bill detweiler is here from tech republic good to have you  I had no idea you're so, you know all about train of custody all that stuff  I love the csi effect  Oh clearly this person has watched too many procedurals kick him off the jury your honor  Uh, we got alex lindsey whose dad is a prosecuting attorney states used to be used to be a long time ago  So he knows a little bit about assisting u.s district u.s attorney  So he knows a lot about these kinds of matters and george adow  Whose videos include get the sleep you've always dreamed of  boundaries and consequences  understanding what anxiety is parenting  How your thoughts are running the show damn it and calm  Calm calm finally all of anxiety dash videos.com. I've got more I got the whole set  Thank you for being here. All three of you our show today brought to you by nareva  When it's as you get back to the office and you want to have meetings and people are in different places and stuff as alex said audio is  Can kill a conference call bad audio is the worst  Exhausts everybody it makes it hard to to be in the meeting  Nareva solves this problem now you you know if you're faced with this  Especially if you want to get a good audio in a in a fairly large room a mid-size to large room  I'm talking 25 by 25 to 30 by 50. You probably immediately think well, we're gonna get that pro av solution  But but I just want to tell you there are better ways to do this than that complex expensive  Pro av solution you set up pro av in a mid-size to large meeting room  You've got multiple components. You've got mics. You've got speakers. They're installed in the ceiling  Mics are spread across the table. And what else do you have with lots of cables?  You'll need specialized technicians to tell you what needs to be bought to install it to calibrate it  It'll take days to install and tens of thousands of dollars per room  For purchase and installation and I still go to big businesses and see these very very expensive av setups when all they need  Is nareva nareva n u r e v a provides exceptional audio  For rooms. Well one integrated nareva microphone and speaker bar will handle 25 to 25 feet  Two bars will cover a space of up to 30 by 50 feet. You can do it yourself  It's as easy to install as a as a sound bar takes about 30 minutes two screws one cable  Fraction of the cost of av systems and it actually works better because of nareva's patented microphone mist  Technology which puts thousands of virtual microphones  Throughout the room so you can move around you can face away from the screen  Everyone is heard no matter where they are and now with you know, you gotta have social distancing  Or you know you you don't have to put dots on the table where people need to sit for a beam forming system  You don't have to calibrate or recalibrate. In fact, it continuously auto calibrates. It's essentially computational audio  And it's a really clever solution to all this  So easy to do you can do it yourself  They have a great console the nareva console a platform lets you monitor manage adjust and scale your fleet of systems from anywhere  Great for multiple rooms and a fraction of the cost of the pro av system  Sound great works great easy to install easy to use no training required  I just want to encourage you not to go with that pro av  Modeled go to go to nareva.com  twit and learn more n u r e v a  nareva.com  Twit i am a sound  Snob and this is a great solution doesn't require people to stay in the same place or face the same way  It just works nareva  nureva.com  Slash twit we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech  And thank you for supporting us by using that address so they know that you saw it here nareva.com  slash  twit  so the st. Louis post dispatch reporters looking at the  Uh, uh government website for social uh social for school teachers  and notices  This is the state's department of elementary and secondary education notices that if he views a source  You all know how to do that right views source on the site  And the social security numbers of department employees teachers administrators and councils counselors are completely in the clear  viewable in text  No problem at all  hundreds of thousands of social security numbers  Revealed so the st. Louis post dispatch does the right thing  They reported having found a bug in the app  They waited until it was fixed to publish the report didn't matter because  Governor mike parson of missouri wants to prosecute the journalist who found the bug  He says he's a hacker  and is vowed criminal prosecution  for viewing source  If you ask me  The guy did the state of favor  And he reported it responsibly  This is uh, ignorance can really lead to problems in this world

Yes governor. We'll look at that, but clearly  This is just sad

Transcript:  Yeah, and the problem is is that it's even if it's even if he's exonerated the cost of the  Legal case is going to be a thing like even if the governor loses it's going to cost him somewhere between  10 and 100 000 dollars, you know  That's the fine for the governor putting his thumb down if it actually goes anywhere because you're going to have to you know  Go out and get a lawyer and pay them a you know  A retainer and then there's hours and those are only two or three hundred dollars an hour  And the mistake you'll make is that you'll say i'm not going to hire a very good lawyer  And because because I i'm obviously going to win and then you lose and now things get real ugly, you know  And so so the the issue is is that you know them just making these like it seems like oh, yeah  He'll get off  But yeah  He's going to get off after spending tens of thousands of dollars and on a journal with salary  To defend himself against something that's stupid

Fairhurst. Here's a picture of this is we'll use this in court. Here's woodward's house. Here's fairhurst's house  Uh, dr. Fairhurst said mary fairhurst said it's harassment. She was forced to move out of her house  Because of the intrusive internet connected  gadgets  He fitted four devices around his property to protect his vehicles  The judge was particularly uh upset because of the microphones on these devices which would apparently  Clearly hear whatever was going on  On her property they've lived as neighbors for two decades  She complained about the camera and uh, he got aggressive. So that's why  She went to court  The judge found that he had breached the provisions of the data protection act of 2018 and the gdpr  And dr. Mary fairhurst is now entitled to compensation  plus  Preventing mr. Woodward from continuing to breach her rights with his security devices  Is fair claim I mean when uh, you know, I love my video doorbell. I have cameras all around the place of course  They don't pick up audio from our neighbors and they can't really see into the neighbor's yard  But if you live very close to somebody very likely cameras do

Transcript:  Well, and that's the thing, you know, you were saying leo. I live in an area where we're um,  If I put a camera, I don't have one on my front door just for this reason because it would be picking up  Um my neighbors across the streets doors and multiple doors and their front windows and whether they had them open or not  And I have a fairly busy street not not terribly busy, but it will probably go off and detect the motion of the cars  um every few minutes every 10 minutes something like that, so  You know, I I think this could be a little bit if it stands  um, and if the fine stands this could be  The beginning of maybe an inflection point in these the use of these cameras  I mean, maybe they'll have to be technological safeguards. I mean, maybe they'll have to be  um, you know  Blurring effects something in there or maybe only property owners will have to position them in a down position  So that they're only looking at the the doorway and not straight out  I don't know, but it's definitely bad publicity for ring. I mean I have to say like this is  When you go after people's pocketbooks, that's when you can really start to change behavior and I could see people saying  You know, i'm just not going to take the risk of putting this thing up there and getting sued.

What got him sued was him getting aggressive when she's asked him to move it  Like he didn't get randomly like she didn't just file a lawsuit  Like that's a good point up the camera. There was a solution prior. She said hey  Can you stop that and he wouldn't do it and he got aggressive with her and that's that's usually you know, they  uh, there's a  um  saying in africa  I was I was hanging out with these guys in zimbabwe and and we were talking about something and and they were talking about  The political issue in zimbabwe and and I said why don't you just overthrow mcgabe?  And and he said he said we've been farmers for a thousand years, you know  Like, you know, we're we're shown. Oh, we've been farmers for a thousand years  And when you're a farmer for a thousand when your family's been farming for a thousand years, you know  That if you get into a fight with your neighbor, they're still your neighbor tomorrow  So  I think about that all the time because I really good that's a really good motto  So it was so and so I think about that saying every time someone one of my neighbors does something that i'm like, wow  I can't believe they just did that, you know, and I have some great neighbors. I have some  Not not as great neighbors. Um, and uh,  And all of them but whenever they do something that kind of pops my eyes and where I come from, you know  I would react badly.

Oh, they were always turned off. Okay, but we made sure that they understood  We are not but you could you could eavesdrop on conversations and things so  John says he could turn them on if he had to  You can't retroactively turn them on so you can't say no wonder were they talking about last night  Uh one last story before we wrap this up. This is interesting. We'll talk about this on mac break weekly alex. I'm sure  Apple of course got a lot of attention and a lot of applause  In ios 14 for turning on I think was 14.5 when they turned on the feature where you could say I don't want this app  to track me  However, there has been a benefit to apple as well as a benefit to consumer privacy  apple's  in-house business their search ads  Are now  huge growth  50 their response were for 58 percent  uh  Of all app downloads resulting from clicking on an advertisement so apple puts ads for apps sells ads for apps in the app store  That number a year ago was 17 percent big growth there  Uh, it is it could mean  According to the financial times five billion dollars in its advertising business this year  20 billion a year within three years all because apple's privacy push has significantly altered  The landscape so you can do a thing that's good for your users and hey we all win

Transcript:  So this is always my issue  I think google and apple both and facebook benefit from because they have first party data. They have direct data  So it's easy for them to say and we're gonna turn off all that third party tracking

What the hell is this?

Start time: 9333.14

Transcript:  It's the triangulation. It's the triangulation of the data that is just abhorrent like it's it is  It is what you're buying at safeway and where you're buying gas and then how you're going and all your gps data and then you  map that all into it and I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's what it could be used for like if someone was outside your bathroom watching you and writing what's happening  I understand that but that's not what's happening. It kind of is because what you buy in the pharmacy  To use in the bathroom is being tracked  Where you are is being tracked what you're doing with that  And so if you're buying a certain set of whatever type of sanitary or health cucumber butt wipes  Attention to this yeah, but they're paying attention like it is that creepy actually  I think that people don't get the amount of information they can take from this triangulated data, right?

Start time: 9390.62
End time: 9476.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the thing is the key point is to let them make that decision, right?  I mean that that's what you want is that yes, you know  We've been tracking people ever since there was you know, um  There were credit cards credit card companies and other companies data brokers could track your purchases throughout your your your when you use your credit card  Um, the same could be true for magazine subscriptions or companies that would work with law enforcement  That they would come to to know if you ever had a magazine subscription that they could track back there  So, you know, it's not a new practice  but I think the important thing to your to everyone's point is that just  People know about it and maybe if they know about then they can decide whether like you leo  They don't really care or they really do like yeah, that's fair myself that they do care about it because yes  you know, I was helping my mom buy a new phone yesterday and  Um, she had an app and I had to remove the app on her old phone because it was eating up  I don't know what it was doing. It was a word game, but it was eating up like three gigs of space  And i'm like, why are you using this? And then when she she said, I don't know you can get rid of it  So I got rid of it and then when I loaded it back, of course  You got the message to say this app is tracking you across all these other apps and i'm like this is a word game  Do you really want this? She's like no, I don't I just say yes to that every time the message pops up  Right, i'm like really? Okay mom, come on. I clearly I haven't done my job as a proper geek to teach you better  so, you know, we uh, I was able to convince her that maybe she didn't need the app but
