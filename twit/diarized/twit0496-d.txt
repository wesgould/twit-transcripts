Transcript:  I would love to talk about it.  What is Safer Internet Day?

Start time: 207.10
End time: 302.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Safer Internet Day has been going on for 11 years.  It was started by the European Commission by InSafe,  a nonprofit out of Europe working with the European Union, European Commission.  And it's now recognized in 100 countries.  And our little nonprofit, ConnectSafely.org, that I co-direct, is the US host of it.  So we're having it this year on Facebook.  It's going to be streamed live starting at 415 Eastern through 115 Pacific on Tuesday.  Great speakers, Kamala Harris, who's the Attorney General of California,  Sheryl Sandberg, who's the Chief Operating Officer at Facebook is speaking.  I'm speaking.  The president of the National PTA is going to be there.  Panels on bullying and trolling and harassment.  Panels on using technology to affect social change.  And then we've got a great industry panel with Facebook, Twitter, and Google  kind of duking it out in terms of their safety and privacy.  We've got 200 kids coming.  So it's going to be really exciting.  Lots of kids, lots of adults too, sold out.  But you can stream it at saferinternetday.us.  So it's going to be a real fun event.  It's our second one.  Last year we were in D.C.  We had Chuck Schumer speaking.  But this year we got Kamala Harris and Sheryl Sandberg.  So it should be fun.  Wow, that's pretty cool to get Sheryl Sandberg.  That's great.  Yeah, no, yeah, it's not easy to get Sheryl Sandberg, even though it's right there at Facebook.  But this is kind of a celebration and a kind of acknowledgement that the Internet can be safer.  It's not going to be perfect ever.  But we need to deal with trolls.  We need to deal with bullies.  We need to deal with security problems.  We need to deal with all sorts of issues, privacy.  And Connect Safely tries to do that.  And this is a day when we kind of celebrate it.

Transcript:  So I made it on safer Internet, like devices you don't even think of.  I just had an incident with a child.  Someone asked me they had their own 3D and the kid had went on and Googled something and horrible, horrible things came up on their 3D.  And they're like, how do I stop this from happening?  I don't know. You got to bring it to me because I wouldn't even think.  You wouldn't think a Nintendo 3DS would be able to go to horrible, horrible sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next big frontier for our organization is going to be the Internet of Things.  I mean, you think about it.  I'm wearing a device where my pulse rate is constantly being uploaded into the cloud.  Now, I don't really care if anybody knows my pulse rate, but I should have the right to protect that information.  And it's going to get more and more invasive and we're going to get more and more information about it.  So we're talking to drone makers, thing makers, automakers, all about how can we make sure that this next generation kind of web,  I don't know, 4.0, whatever the heck it is, this next generation of technology gets born in a more secure and safe environment.  Lots of lots of interesting things coming down the pike.

Start time: 377.30
End time: 386.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know why, but for some reason I feel like a company like Facebook is only going to pay lip service to this for so long before they say,

Start time: 388.10
End time: 393.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Internet will be safest when it's all on Facebook, right?  Let them just take over everything.  That's true.

Start time: 394.76
End time: 400.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's one of the negatives to saying a safer Internet is, well, the safest way to do it is to have gated, you know, gated communities.

Start time: 400.94
End time: 432.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The safest way to do it is not be online at all.  I mean, that's really safe, right?  But, you know, the fact is that there is a business case to be made for safety.  And I think that's part of what we try to talk to these companies about.  You don't want a company or a service that is, you know, run by trolls or is occupied by trolls.  So I think there's a little bit of a vested interest.  I mean, there's a tension.  There's always a tension, especially in the privacy side.  But when it comes to security and keeping people from being harassed, I think it's in the interest of companies to do what they can.  And a lot of them do good work.  A lot of them.  Hey, what?

Start time: 433.66
End time: 437.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dick Costolo this week admitted that he said it's my fault that there's trolling on Twitter.

Start time: 438.07
End time: 448.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And I think that's a pretty interesting comment that he I guess he admitted that an internal memo that got leaked to The Verge.  But that's a good example where companies know they've got to do a better job.  Ask him.

Start time: 448.76
End time: 467.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think if I if I make the analogy to a safer cities, you're never going to have a city be safe.  There's always going to be back alleys.  There's always going to be dangerous things you could do in a city.  But the idea would be let's as a community kind of get together and try to encourage places on the Internet where people can participate without fear of trolling, bullying.

Start time: 467.86
End time: 513.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when you say when you say that, it's the system of in Philadelphia was called Killadelfia.  They had more murders per capita than anybody else.  So what the mayor did was he put a cop on every corner for six months and all the crime related places.  So crime fell.  So the force being out there did it when AOL was known for chat rooms and little girls get kidnapped to put on TV that all these guys are coming on to AOL chat got smushed down.  So as soon as Facebook is known for the place to pedophiles go to pick up on children, then maybe they'll do something crazy about it or something with this bullying and the gamer gate and all that kind of stuff.  Once once it becomes mass media that like, oh, man, people getting bullied on Twitter.  Well, Twitter better do something.  So we need hamster damn do something.  Yeah, we were talking about the wire.  We need hamster damn.

Start time: 514.17
End time: 516.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was really good.  I think for Internet Day, it's safer.

Start time: 517.90
End time: 530.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's never going to be safer.  And the fact is, you know, my space and Facebook already went through that peddler panic a few years ago.  They're there, but there aren't that many kids that actually get snatched up.

Start time: 531.16
End time: 550.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear you say that because sometimes I think when you've really been big on safer kids and all of this stuff, and sometimes I worry that there's this kind of panic being created that the Internet is full of predators.  No, there isn't.  We know that most kids who are abused are abused by people they know, by relatives, by friends.

Start time: 550.66
End time: 590.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know the most dangerous place for a kid?  At home.  Home is by far the most dangerous place for a kid.  So if you want to keep your kids safe, don't let them go to the doctor.  Don't let them go to school.  Don't let them go to any place of worship and don't let them go home.  But the bottom line is that, you know, that kids, you know, there's been moral panics about about predators and we had moral panics about bullying.  Then we had moral panics about sexting, moral panics about all these things.  And there are dangers on the Internet.  No question about it.  Even security.  I don't lose a lot of sleep about Internet security.  I know there are risks.  But hey, if I walk outside, somebody could steal my wallet, break my window, knock me down in the street.  There's no such thing as a completely safe environment.  Even in Philadelphia.  And I think I worry sometimes.

Start time: 591.82
End time: 622.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We talk about this a lot on this week in Google, because as you know, Jeff Jarvis is an advocate for being public.  And I'm kind of public myself.  And I worry that we lose something by trying to enforce privacy on the Internet.  I think Internet inherently is a public space.  And so to make the people who really want privacy.  Don't go online.  Well, yeah, I don't want to say that either because online is so valuable.  But you have to understand you're really participating in a public space.

Start time: 622.96
End time: 642.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I don't want the public to be looking over my shoulder while I'm doing online banking.  But you're right.  If I'm on Facebook, I just post everything to public.  I mean, first of all, I have no private life.  But second of all, I don't really believe that you could guarantee privacy on a social networking site, even though they've got great privacy tools.  Or even if they do, you just can't trust them.  We know Snapchat.

Start time: 643.78
End time: 659.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  Snapchat images were safe and they were being stored and visible.  We thought that Facebook would honor its privacy controls.  Even Mark Zuckerberg was confused and had publicly posted pictures that were private.  I mean, that's what I mean by not getting online.

Start time: 660.33
End time: 680.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know a lot of people that just don't use Facebook.  But that's the wrong answer, too.  You can still use the Internet.  You can still Google and research and use the Internet for what you want.  But you don't have to put a picture of yourself eating a birthday cake and ice cream down your nose for everybody to see.  You can be selective about what you want to do.  If you don't want to be public, don't tweet out that you had a ham sandwich and Starbucks on the corner.  So people can select and choose what they want to do if they want to be private.

Transcript:  Devendra, you're what we would call a net native.  You basically grew up with the Internet, right?

Start time: 687.70
End time: 712.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I feel like I'm in a weird spot because I, you know, for most of my life, I didn't have the Internet.  You know, I got it when I was around, well, I guess maybe half my life.  Half my life I've had no Internet.  And then my parents got like a 486 and I got prodigy in the late mid 90s.  So I have the distinct memory of the world without the Internet.  And I saw how quickly everything changed.  And it's a weird thing to notice just like how different things are now.

Start time: 712.82
End time: 728.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, my kids, for instance, 20 and 23 have always had Internet.  They've always, you know, they were born in 92 and 94.  Internet has always been part of their lives.  And I don't think they think a lot about privacy and security.  I just don't think it's on the radar.

Start time: 728.90
End time: 754.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Maybe they think about it differently.  I think the thing we're really talking about is that consumers should have control over, you know, what they're doing.  So, OK, if you're putting something online and you know specifically you're making it public, OK, that's it.  That's the agreement.  But if you set it to private or something like that, it would be nice if, you know, companies honored what they said they were going to do.  I think it's the obfuscation of what's actually happening with our data.  That's kind of the bigger problem.

Start time: 754.84
End time: 774.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the thing about your kids, Leo, I mean, I can't speak for your kids, but there's been a little research about kids and privacy.  It turns out kids actually do care about privacy, but in different ways than adults do.  They want privacy from their parents, from their teachers.  They still want some level of privacy and control.  They just don't have the same concept of privacy that a lot of adults would.  But they think about it in their own way.

Start time: 774.68
End time: 783.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what Dana Boyd, who's done great research on kids and privacy, has concluded is that the word even means something different to people who are Internet Natives.

Start time: 783.78
End time: 796.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Dana's research that I was citing.  And there's a lot of really great data out there.  I'm actually pretty optimistic about, you know, the millennials and I don't know what the current what we're calling our current teenagers, but I'm pretty optimistic.  They're sure a heck of a lot better than we were when we were young.

Start time: 797.68
End time: 821.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know, the only way to really be private, in my opinion, the only way to really be private and to use the Internet privately is to use encryption and end encryption.  I'm encrypted. What I send is encrypted all the way to the end point, whether it's a bank, Amazon or an individual.  Then it's really private.  Even the NSA can't see it.  But but I don't think my kids even are aware of the notion of encryption.

Start time: 821.94
End time: 826.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It needs to be built into every service they use.  They don't they shouldn't think about it anymore.  It should just be the service itself.

Start time: 828.42
End time: 835.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like we've seen a lot of a lot of messaging clients like a fire chat just really blow up because they're so secure.

Start time: 835.82
End time: 851.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So people do they know, oh, this is what's that added secure effect.  They're using the red phone stuff, right?  Silence Circle stuff.  And do you think that people who use WhatsApp are aware of that and choose WhatsApp because of that?  No, it doesn't necessarily WhatsApp.

Start time: 852.66
End time: 866.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But for an app like fire, fire chat or something explicitly secure.  Yeah, yeah, I think that's it.  It's like the service itself.  You don't have to worry about your PGP key.  You don't have to share it to somebody.  I never did that because it was such a mess.  It hadn't reached critical mass yet.

Start time: 866.72
End time: 871.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you've got to build that.  I mean, you know, you've got to be talking Gmail, Yahoo, Mail, Facebook, Twitter.

Start time: 872.82
End time: 894.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fire chat was used not for encryption, but because it's a mesh system.  It was used in things like the Hong Kong protests because you didn't you weren't on a public Internet.  You were on a private mesh network.  Right. And you even have to have Internet access on your phone to use it, which I thought was fascinating.  But I don't know if it was the encryption that was really the thing that made people say.

Start time: 894.66
End time: 897.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I think I'm thinking of another service right now.  There's text secure.

Start time: 898.00

Start time: 907.79
End time: 910.26

End time: 977.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Silk Road, ladies and gentlemen.  Ross Ulbricht. Guilty on all seven counts.  I was accused on Twitter, the bastion of truth, of misstating what happened in the Silk Road trial.  Last week we had Nick Bilton on the show.  Nick is writing the book, the Silk Road book, which has already been optioned for a movie.  It's a fascinating story.  Ulbricht guilty on all seven counts of creating Silk Road, which was used as there's basically a black market for illicit products,  chiefly drugs used, used toward in it.  It was a tour tour site and he was arrested and accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts.  Life sentence.  That's the question that this article poses on the news.  Big BTC.  That'd be crazy.  I don't think a life sentence.

Start time: 978.35
End time: 1034.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think a life sentence either.  I mean, there's been a lot of drug deals getting caught with a lot of drugs.  I don't think they got life.  Life seems excessive.  I mean, but at the same time, it's amazing that $200 million.  That's probably what they can find.  That's probably what they actually can get a hold of because once it gets to that number, you don't know what you're talking about.  You know, but it reminds me like the things on people on Instagram saying, oh, don't post your weed on Instagram because there's a there's a drug raid.  They put $350 million in one weekend just surfing Instagram for people to post drugs and like regular people have that much weed and drugs in their house.  And then they're dumb enough to post pictures of it.  Right. Exactly.  So I mean, $200 million.  I'm sure that's a drop in the bucket.  I mean, if they just want to Instagram got 350 in two days.  So very, very interesting and sneaky way to get your drugs delivered and keep it off the books.

Start time: 1034.66
End time: 1083.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll find out May 15th.  That's when the sentencing happens.  The jury only took a few hours, which tells me that they were pretty convinced by the evidence against him.  It seemed like a kind of a tangled thread.  The FBI found his postings on a forum and then tracked it back to his computer.  I mean, it was a very complicated thread and a technically very difficult thing for even a technologist to follow.  I don't know. I doubt somehow that the jury had any idea.  We talked last week about the fact that neither side wanted a technically literate jury, that they were hoping that the ignorance of the jury and technology would help them.  Each side turns out, I guess it helped the prosecution more than the defense.

Start time: 1083.66
End time: 1088.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how long that'll last.  Like sort of like just hiding certain facts from juries like that.

Start time: 1088.74
End time: 1108.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was even a debate.  They're reading transcripts of posts and there's a emoticon, a happy face emoticon, and they were debating whether that should be read in court.  They went back and forth.  Finally, the judge said, well, that's part of the message.  You have to say it, but you can't say it.  You have to say it in a flat voice.

Start time: 1109.97

Transcript:  All of the transcripts had to be delivered in a they had to be read because they had to get into the record, but they had to be read in a flat neutral.  So as not to plant crazy.

Start time: 1126.98
End time: 1129.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1129.66
End time: 1167.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think it's still in that trial.  It was in the transcript.  It's still a question of whether that going forward, and we mentioned this last week, I served on a trial of one of the predators in the NBC Dateline.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  To catch a predator and heard a lot of chat transcripts read in a monotonic voice by a defense and prosecution.  And it was really and now I'm technically literate.  So I knew what was going on, but it was really interesting.  And I really do have the feeling that it is an opportunity for the two different sides to slant it in their favor if the jury doesn't really understand what they're hearing.

Transcript:  The prosecution presented the judge threw it out saying it's entrapment.  We never even heard the defense.  Interesting. Interesting.  Very interesting.  And I think it was entrapment.  A lot of times it is.  Yeah.  You probably all saw this TV show, the Dateline show, where they got the guy and the guy thinks he's talking to an underage girl.  In fact, it's an adult.  They use a kind of an advocacy group to do these chats.  There's a lot of-  Perverted justice. It was called perverted justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but what perverted justice did is it really was entrapment.  They would get adults and they would really try to get people in these chat rooms to talk dirty to them.  And they would use techniques that no child would use.  It wasn't overtly like talk dirty to me, but they would use techniques that they knew as adults would appeal to some guys.  And I don't think a kid would talk like that.  And so there was really a lot of question marks around their methodology.  But the fact that the Petaluma Police Department enlisted them to create this sting and then allowed NBC to pay them to film the sting, I think kind of the judge was a little disgusted.

We got a good studio audience here.  Lots of people from all over visiting today as we do the show.  It's always nice to have.  It was a very rainy day in Petaluma,  so I'm glad they braved the weather.  Tom Wheeler, who we thought was a henchman for the cable industry and the wireless industry.  John Oliver called him a dingo.  He said, you wouldn't put your broadband in the care of a dingo.  It's like putting your children in care of a dingo.  He was called all sorts of names.  I myself said he was a shill.  He is in the Hall of Fame for the National Cable Television Association  and the wireless industry as a lobbyist.  Yet, in fact, I wondered why President Obama even appointed him  to be the chairman of the FCC given his background.  Yet, he seems to have done the right thing.  He listened.  They got more comments in the comment period  than any FCC issue since the wardrobe malfunction on the Super Bowl 10 years ago.  Right.  He has said, now we've decided everybody but the ISPs seem to be behind  using Title II regulations as specified by the Telecommunications Act in 1934.  Title II basically says broadband providers are common carriers,  and they are regulated.  They may be regulated by the FCC.  This has been the whole issue, is that the FCC can only do what it's mandated to do.  Congress says, you're in charge of this, this, and this,  and that's all you can do.  Initially, the FCC last year issued what they called open internet regulations or rules.  Verizon sued, took him to court.  The judge said, you know, you're right, Verizon.  This is not within the FCC's purview.  But he did.  Actually, it was a judicial panel.  They did say, but if you were to declare broadband providers common carriers,  it would be within your realm to tell them what to do.  And the FCC has been really trying to avoid doing this.  I think a lot of us were concerned that this might be a heavy-handed form of regulation.  But Wheeler has said, no, we're going to use a doctrine called forbearance  to enforce selectively within Title II.  For instance, we will never regulate rates.  That was one thing ISPs were worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting.  If you read his commentary, he hit a piece in Wired last week,  and he actually pointed out that he himself ran a company that wound up getting shut down  or basically being AOL with its competitor.  And AOL was on the open phone network at the time,  because even then you could hook a modem to any phone line.  His company was on the cable system, which was locked up.  So he actually made the case that having a regulation which required certain kinds of neutrality  will enhance innovation.  Even though the cable and phone industry is making the opposite argument,  they're claiming that regulation is anti-innovation.  So it was an interesting point he made.  Again, he based it on his own company that was dealing with the cable industry  that essentially wouldn't give him an equal playing field,  whereas Steve Case had an equal playing field through AOL and the phone network.

Transcript:  Well, I have to apologize to Tom Wheeler.  And I'm sure John Oliver, when he comes back on the air, will say,  I'm sorry I called you a dingo.  I'm sorry I called you a shill, Tom.  You did the right thing.  I have to say, when I read that he said we're going to use Title II, I did go,  because while this was something many of us thought needed to happen,  there is a real concern about government control of the Internet.  We don't want that either.

Transcript:  Because saying something to me doesn't mean anything until I see it written down.  And somebody smarter than me comes back and tells me that it's something I should believe in,  because I'm not going to read it, but I need it written down  so somebody else can read it and tell me about it.

Start time: 1800.70
End time: 1818.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what he's done technically is recommend it.  The members of the FCC, the commissioners, have to vote.  He says I am circulating to the members of the FCC  proposed new rules to preserve the Internet as an open platform for innovation and free expression.

Start time: 1821.66
End time: 1854.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay, so what will happen first is the FCC commissioners will vote yea or nay.  I presume they're going to say yea, because President Obama has said this is what he wanted,  and the chairman has said this is what he wanted,  and I know several commissioners have said we'll support this.  So I'm going to presume it passes.  At that point, those are official rules unless Congress overrules it.  So Congress absolutely...  And by the way, if you think the telecom and the wireless people had a champion in Tom Wheeler,  they have spent a lot of money on a lot of campaigns,  and they have many, many champions in Congress.

Transcript:  So before you go saying, oh, he's not a dingo anymore,  just think of the common phrase of people who are skeptical about life.  The person you think is the devil comes out and says,  I'm going to do right by you, and you say, oh, thankfully, finally you're going to do it.  Knowing right on his back pocket that people want to strike down the notion that he wanted,  I'd just like to wait and see that what he said was good is supposed to happen  before I go claiming he's not a dingo.

Start time: 1878.12
End time: 1894.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does seem like politics, right?  He waited until the tide was totally pushing in this direction, like Obama said it.  All the votes came in from consumers like, oh, maybe I can do this  and not risk hurting my political career, or at least what he was doing right now.  So I don't give him too much credit other than following where the tide was headed.

Start time: 1895.08
End time: 1933.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, it's coming during Obama's last two years when Obama has grown a pair on a lot of issues.  And even though Wheeler doesn't directly report to Obama,  I think it's part of the administration's plan to finally do what it needs to do.  And if the Republicans want to counter it, the Republicans will counter it.  But it's standing up and doing the right thing.  And we'll have to see what happens, whether Congress does intervene,  because it is a political issue.  Unfortunately, there are Ds and Rs on both sides of this issue,  but it tends to be D versus R.  Not completely, but there are some ideological questions involved  in whether the government should be, even to this limited extent, regulating the Internet.

Start time: 1933.66
End time: 1963.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I even feel like among Democrats and liberal geeks,  there is some concern about you don't want government regulation.  Government, notoriously, and it was designed this way by the Founding Fathers,  is slow, kind of technology adverse for good reason.  But it operates at a different speed than technology and the Internet.  And so I don't think anybody wants heavy-handed government restrictions.

Start time: 1963.66
End time: 1971.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't want them picking winners and losers.  We don't want them regulating content.  I agree with Wheeler that we probably don't even want them regulating rates if we have a free marketplace.

Start time: 1971.86
End time: 2090.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, and this is an issue that some have raised,  he uses the word legal content.  He says, so this is what I am proposing.  I'm submitting to my colleagues the strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by the FCC.  These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization  and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services.  Some people have focused on that word lawful and said,  well, that's a giant loophole for the copyright police to jump through,  for the music industry, the television and movie industry to jump through,  to allow ISPs to block BitTorrent, for instance,  to do deep packet inspection to make sure that people aren't sending illegal content over the Internet.  Certainly, the Snowden papers would be deemed as unlawful content.  WikiLeaks would be deemed by some as unlawful content.  So that's going to be interesting to watch how that plays out.  He says, though he is absolutely saying, and he did this in writing on Wired.  He's speaking to geeks when you publish an opinion piece on Wired.  He says, we will not regulate rates.  There will be no tariffs.  Now, this one, unfortunately, I disagree with.  No last-mile unbundling.  That's a sop to the cable industry, by the way.  Last-mile unbundling has happened in the phone industry.  That's why you can have many different Internet service providers over your DSL lines.  You can only have one Internet service provider over your cable line,  and that's the cable company, Comcast or Time Warner.  That's unbundling.  And he's saying he's threw that in there.  It completely doesn't fit.  One of these things is not like the other.  No regulation, no tariffs, no last-mile unbundling.  That's a sop to the cable industry saying, don't worry, guys.  You still have a monopoly, which is one of the big problems, frankly.

Start time: 2091.19

Start time: 2093.66
End time: 2114.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What he's saying is, he says, to preserve incentives for broadband operators to invest in their networks,  which means we still want you to make plenty of money on those networks.  Right.  So I agree that the proof will be when the FCC steps up and says, you, knock it off.  We don't know.

Start time: 2116.05
End time: 2142.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the first time, they also mentioned mobile broadband, which is something the FCC,  I think the last time we heard anything related to net neutrality was a couple years ago.  They didn't even mention mobile broadband at all.  And I feel like at that point they were cotoing to the wireless carriers who were arguing that, you know,  wireless is so strange and we have to regulate it more and we have to limit speeds.  That's actually something that could mean a lot for people and how they use their phones and tablets  for the next couple of years if it actually happens.

Start time: 2143.18
End time: 2160.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was a bit of a shocker because even Google in a famous and controversial brief cited with Verizon saying,  no, no, mobile is different.  You don't have to have net neutrality on mobile.  And so that was the fact that he mentioned we're going to do the same.  This is mobile and cable was surprising.

Start time: 2161.18
End time: 2197.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you know, just to make sure that nobody listening is living under a fool's paradise,  none of this says that they can't raise your rates, that they can't control how much data you get to use,  that you don't have to pay more for higher speed Internet at home.  It's really all about content providers, access to the networks and access to people's homes.  It really doesn't do anything to protect consumers against having to pay more as it is.  I pay far more for my Comcast bill than my neighbor does because I have the highest package that they offer  and my neighbor has a basic package.  So I'm already paying probably fifty dollars a month more than my neighbor.  And that doesn't go away. Network neutrality has nothing to do with that.

Transcript:  What we really want, I think we can all agree, what we really want is for the FCC to foster competition.  Right.  What we really want, and this is why the cable company can screw you, is because they're the only choice.  86% of Americans have only two choices for broadband, the phone company and the cable company, and that's it.  86%. There is no competition.  And so I want to see what the FCC is going to do to foster competition.  They've already made noise that they're going to go and try to overturn these rules that prevent municipal internet.  That's huge. If they do that, that might make a big difference.

Transcript:  So weird.  I remember when they were proposing 250 gigabytes per month caps.  And they were going to roll it out and different and test it.  And then I heard Comcast say, no, no, no, that's not worked out.  But they're still doing it.  If they want to offer you that service at a great discount, you know, as an option,

And they had to bump down to the business class version of Comcast internet,  which I think is only 10 or 15 megabits.  So they were at like 25 before.  I know a good realtor.

Transcript:  Wow. Well, again, this this argues for competition because had they another good choice,  another high speed choice in Atlanta, they could say, well, screw you, Comcast.  They can't. I need Google.  I think Google, we got to rattle Google's cage because initially they said Google fiber.  We're just showing what we can do in Austin and a few towns and Kansas City.  Kansas City and this city.  But they're adding cities.  And I'm wondering if Google is starting to think maybe this is a good business, maybe gigabit.  Maybe people do want gigabit.  You know, it's interesting in the towns where Google fiber is like Austin,  all of a sudden Time Warner and Comcast are saying, oh, we can do that.  Oh, we. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry.

Transcript:  It also solves. But it also solves net neutrality.  Because if Comcast is throttling your Skype because they have a VoIP solution,  you can also go somewhere else. But you need more than two.  You need more than three. You need a few.  And you need some upstarts. You need companies like Sonic Net.  We had Dane Jasper on Twitter, the founder of Sonic Net, talking in this debate over net neutrality.  And the guys like that want they, you know, they want this.  If they could get into every house, they are thrilled to say we'll offer unthrottled.

Transcript:  And the problem is that we only have two companies that run wires into your house, right?  The phone company and the cable company. So unless you do it wireless,  even if you have the deal that with the what do they call the the carriers that work with the phone company  that allow them to piggyback on the phone company's wires, the N.O.s. Yeah.  Even they have to use the same wires and phone companies control, essentially control the speed because they that's why.

Transcript:  You know, at that point, it sounds like Chattanooga where they have established high speed Internet owned by the city,  like the city owns the wires and the water.  And then and then Chattanooga says, OK, and, you know, we'll manage the infrastructure.  And anybody who wants to become an Internet service provider on top of this infrastructure can.  That works. Right. And of course, immediately Chattanooga, the big the big ISPs tried to shut this down,

Start time: 2596.42
End time: 2625.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  make it a legal privatized like privatizing the road system in every town. Right.  I mean, we have certain things that we have agreed can be public.  And in fact, doesn't L.A. still own a municipal water and power?  I think L.A. you know, Palo Alto, the water and power is all city owned.  And that's been that way forever. And you're going to tell us we can't have a municipal Internet system.  Why not? It's an infrastructure so different than a bridge or a road or an electrical system.  Look at this. This is Chattanooga gig dot com.

It's an open platform.  And of course, the first thing Verizon and Comcast try to do is shut this sucker down.  That's why we need that. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need that's why we need it so badly, because for Google and their whole I want to make a social network  and do all this to all the little companies they're trying to build and acquire and steal.  Just roll this out. You will make money.  People need television. People need Internet.  And people are desperate for another option. And so many cities.  People in San Francisco out where you live, they hate everything about the Internet that they have to use.  And that's the Mecca of Internet and computer and technology.  And it's just evil out there. And it makes absolutely no sense.  Roll it out. Make some money.

Transcript:  I think it seems just very difficult, right?  Because Verizon announced a couple of years ago that they were going to stop rolling out the fiber installations, right?  If you have if you have Fios in your neighborhood, that's pretty much it.  It's not going to get much further than that.  And if Verizon, you know, one of the biggest mobile carriers and one of the biggest ISPs in the country can't even roll out more fiber or chooses not to, I don't know how a smaller company will.  But that's what you have to ask.  Why? Why did Verizon do it in the first place?

Start time: 2720.21
End time: 2772.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And why did they stop doing it?  And it's widely agreed it was a political move.  They never intended to roll it out everywhere, but they wanted to curry favor with the FCC.  Verizon's been in a lot of trouble with the FCC.  So there may be some question about their motives from beginning to end on this.  I am thrilled that Wheeler has also said we are going to enforce rules to prevent municipalities from making it illegal for municipalities to create their own Wi-Fi.  They're on they're on the verge of killing that, too.  And I the state laws that would prevent municipal broadband like Chattanooga's.  And I think that's fabulous. That's what we need.  That's what if the FCC continues down that road, then there will be that I don't care about Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon and the rest.  There'll be competition. Yeah.

I'm going to be spying on her so bad, she's going to wish the NSA would come in here and slow me down.  Say whatever you want.  My daughter's in jujitsu.  She's a soccer.  She's a basketball.  When she goes out on a date, talking about Mr. Stone, bring back a 930.  You won't come on when she wants to.  She's an international spy and then she will break your neck.  I'm going to be all up in her grill.  So I'm not worried about safety.  These other kids we got to worry about on the 3DSs and the computers.

So you charge the phones in a central place of the house.  We used to say put a computer in the public part of the house,  but that doesn't work anymore because everybody's got phones.  Yeah, everything's mobile.  But you can insist that the phones be charged in the living room or the kitchen  or wherever you put them.  They shouldn't be playing with them when they should be sleeping.  And by the way, Leo, that goes for you and me too.  No.  We should be guessing with our phones.  No.  No screen watching in the middle of the night.  It disrupts your sleep.  There's evidence about that.  Even if you're watching good stuff, screens disrupt your sleep.

You know, I think we got a problem in this country with healthcare, and I think we need to modernize it.  And I'm very intrigued by what Oscar is doing.  Now, unfortunately, it's only available right now if you live in New York or New Jersey.  But if you live in New York or New Jersey and you need health insurance, I want you to check out Oscar.  They make health insurance.  They have an app.  They make health insurance simpler, more intuitive, more human.  Their IT.  The engineers used to work at Tumblr.  At Spotify, at Google.  So their websites are slick and usable.  They have these great apps.  Part of their customer app, they develop a personal timeline.  And I wish I could do this.  I love this.  That lets you track your medical history over time.  So your doctor appointments, your visit notes are visible on there.  Your prescriptions.  If you do phone calls with your doctor, those are there.  You can, of course, use it to find doctors and care in your area.  You can search by location.  Language is spoken.  Hospital affiliation.  iOS right now.  Android's coming soon.  They recently launched, this is cool, a Misfit fitness tracker.  And it provides financial incentives if you are active.  It pays you.  So if you reach your daily step count, you get a dollar.  A dollar!  Once you hit $20, you can cash out with an Amazon gift card.  You can keep doing this until you hit the limit is $240 a year.

Yeah.  And I and she explained to me the best way to get the hair that it still doesn't work quite as well as it.  Well, you put it basically you put it so it's backwards so that the water goes on the back of the blade.  You lose high pressure water through the back of it.  But I do it in the bathtub now because I get really super high pressure.

Recode reports.  Apple is once again talking to TV programmers about putting its own Web TV over.  They call it an over the top service on Apple TV.  It's over the top because it eliminates your cable television or antenna and you get your TV as you do Netflix now over the Internet.  Sling is offered the Sling TV product.  We've talked about before.  Twenty dollars a month.  You get ESPN, which means you get actual sports.  You get CNN, which means you get actual news.  In your opinion.  OK, all right.  You're right.

Had to learn that you always look at what's the underlying motivation, what's the slant, where is this coming from, about every news source.  Everything.  And that's actually, I think that's why the New York Times and the NBC and the traditional news stalwarts are starting to fall,  because that skepticism, which is needed on the Internet, is now being applied globally.  And it's right. It should be.

Transcript:  So here's a weird concept that most people would probably think is odd.  I actually consider access to media to be a sacred trust.  I know that sounds very naive and idealistic.  I agree.  But I really feel that if people are taking the time to read me or to listen to me or to watch me,  I have a moral obligation to do the best job I can to be accurate, to be fair,  if I have a conflict of interest to disclose it, as I do,  because I admit that my Connect Safely is funded by some of the tech companies,  but that's right there in every article.  And, you know, as long as you do that, then you can sleep at night.  But anything short of that, I think of the violation of a trust.  And I know a lot of people think that that's crap,  because they think the media is nothing but a big corporate business.  But maybe I'm just old and I'm part of a dying breed, but I strongly feel that way.

What do you think?  And they basically put it out there, so...  I know! I know!  Four thousand people put comments on it and click and click.  That's a lot of effort.  You didn't make anything. You asked me a question.  How about this one?  You post 40 articles a day like that.  How about this one?

Transcript:  And I talked about this before the show.  A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to know when the Super Bowl kickoff actually was.  So I Google, what time does the Super Bowl start?  That is an eye-opener, because what you get is a lot of sites, including, by the way, the Huffington Post, the IB Times, the LA Times,  who create bogus pages that tell you what time the Super Bowl starts.

Start time: 3886.65

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they create pages that will show high on Google that you will click on, here's the Huffington Post, and then they put ads all over it.  Because you don't need a news story titled, what time does the Super Bowl start?  That is not a story you would see in the New York Times.

The Tube. One of our editors, Anthony Nielsen, got one, and Mike Elgin has it in his house and is reviewing it.  We were over for dinner. You know what? It's pretty cool.  I immediately asked for an invitation because if you're a Prime member, it's only 99 bucks.  First of all, the sound quality is good. And Alexa's pretty smart.  You can ask it. You can ask it questions.  And she will answer in a nice, natural voice. It didn't sound robotic.  It's like a little pal in your kitchen.  And you can ask them things like literally what time is Super Bowl start?  We asked, how old is Michael Jackson? This is a good one.  And it said, well, she said in a nice, natural, human, female voice, Michael Jackson died in whatever, 2010, but he was 50 when he died.  Actually, he said he was 50 years, eight months, 29 hours and three seconds old when he died.  It was very interesting. I'm amazed that Google hasn't done this.  And when I first saw it, I said, this is stupid. Who would want this? And now I want this in every room.  In fact, we were all saying, you know, who should Amazon should buy Sonos.  Those are the speakers that are in every room and build this into Sonos.  And then as you walk through your life, you go, hey, Alexa, and they would tell you smart house, really smart house.  2001 Space Odyssey is here. Right. Google's mission was to put in your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so perfect example. She does. She's learning to read and write. Right.  So she has words every week. Now she has to form her own sentences.  What used to happen was she would ask me to reread her sentences. I would help her.  And so I get out a dictionary or I pull a dictionary up online and I'd make her read it and she'd understand it.  Now, do you know what I hear in the other room? I hear, OK, Google, yeah, how do you spell what's wrong with that?  OK, Siri, because she's not looking at the definitions like I'd make her do.

I feel like this may be a change in kind of a big change in how we think of knowledge that the facts,  because they're at your fingertips at all times, are no longer important because they're commodities because you can get the fact.  You can get the spelling of ancient anytime. You can get the definition of ancient anytime.  And so memorizing all of that stuff is now no longer important.  And I don't think that's such a bad thing.

Is it knowing what question to ask and where to ask it more important?  Tell me what? Why does it matter?  You know, what? Why does it matter? Not who?  It's not memorization. It's thinking that we need to teach.  Right. I mean, and I think that that would be the way I would teach, but they don't let me teach anymore.

He loved it. And he said, you know, Copernicus spent most of his energy grinding lenses in manufacturing telescopes  so that he could observe the heavens so that he could figure out that the earth revolved around the sun.  Nowadays, all of the information that he needed is available without any effort.  How much more can people figure out because they don't have to spend the time grinding the lenses and making the telescopes?  It was an interesting insight.

Yeah, I did. I did. It was it's it's all.  But the point is that I spent most of my time in graduate school going up and down the elevator to get between the card catalog and the tax.  I don't know. I don't think I learned anything other than riding the elevator.  You were good at the elevator, though. I was good at the elevator.  I was able to, you know, crunch out a long dissertation.  But the point is that knowledge is so much easier to acquire now.  And that means we need to be smarter in how we use it.  Let's use this learning thinking.

And Denise Howell, who has become our corporate attorney, she does This Week in Law on the  network, said, you know, you really have to.  The FTC is, the fines are immense.  You really have to have hashtag sponsor or hashtag ads, or you have to make it clear  that this, these, even if they didn't pay for that tweet, that these people are sponsored.

There's stuff on the road today, like the parallel parking assistance.  So people are going to get more and more used to it.  So I think in 10 years, yeah, a car pulls up in front of you.

Transcript:  But for me, it's more like, if you want to look up something that's happening right now  and there's no news stories about it yet, you typically look to Twitter.  But Twitter search is very good.  So for me, it makes sense having it all on one screen.  There have been incidents here in New York where I see a car crash,  where I see a street is closed down, I'm like, what is going on here?  And Twitter is the way I figure that out, but that's after a lot of culling through junk Twitter feeds  and things like that.  So it could be good, but it's just strange.  It's true.

I mean, I've seen people go half a day, 30 comments deep, and I'm like, you know this is the onion, right?  And then I delete all those people.

Transcript:  It's true.  Twitter stock pops as company tops earnings expectations.  This is another Twitter story.  I guess good news for Twitter because for a long time the assumption was  unless Twitter grows at the same torrid pace with new users,  it's not going to do well in the stock market.  But because they didn't grow as fast, but their earnings were good,  this stock did well.  And that's actually a good thing for Twitter because that was becoming a problem.  The issue of having to grow at this crazy rate.  They almost doubled quarterly sales.

Start time: 5245.93
End time: 5266.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like honestly, the expectations for Twitter was starting to worry me because I think, you know,  of all these services, it's probably the one I use the most in real life,  and I didn't want just to die in a year or two just because it didn't get enough users.  But I think people are realizing, hey, they're actually making money.  So maybe let's not focus on how many new people they can add.  Let's focus on what they can do with the people they already have.

Start time: 5266.68
End time: 5293.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, people were concerned because last quarter Instagram actually surpassed Twitter's monthly active users.  And there was some real concern that this is going to hurt Twitter.  It also is bad because it was forcing Twitter to just do whatever it could to increase user growth.  Which often meant that the quality of what was on Twitter went downhill.  In other words, they were not blocking junk accounts, spam accounts, troll accounts, because they needed the numbers.

Start time: 5345.12
End time: 5355.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've never understood though, why, how this works.  So what these bots are like tweeting normal stuff, tweeting normal stuff so that you'll kind of trust them and then they'll put an ad in.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 5357.72
End time: 5371.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they'll follow you or like they'll start, you know, they amass followers in different ways.  So once those things hit a certain amount, they could be valuable for ads.  Think of like what people do with YouTube when they just like upload random things.  They're just trying to build a user.

Start time: 5373.77
End time: 5389.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll tweet about content, legitimate online content, but they'll actually tweet to their page that links to the content.  So you'll write something for a legitimate news source.  They'll tweet about it.  And then you go to a page with ads with a link to that news source.  The bigger point is like when you talk about Instagram,

Start time: 5391.76
End time: 5453.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram went through and just demolished all those junk accounts.  Like there were literally people that I was following and they're funny.  I was like, man, how did they get 500,000 followers when they filled those things out?  I saw people with 500 K dropped down to 10 K like overnight.  So Twitter doesn't do that though.  Twitter is like, oh, well, there's bots in their spam.  Well, we need those numbers.  We're going to leave them.  The fact that Instagram did that is shocking to me.  And in fact, Twitter, after that whole debacle of numbers and Instagram's numbers aren't real, they don't matter.  Well, Twitter's numbers aren't real because the other thing those bots do is you go back to their page and yeah, they retweeted you.  But they also retweeted 30 other people.  And what all those people do go back and why did you retweet something from 10 years ago?  And like he said, you click on you go back to their content or you see something else that might resemble something that's interesting to you and you click on that.  So they're dragging you in with this backwards stuff.  And it happens a lot.  Like there's a lot like, you know, it's really strange that they don't cut those people out.  But again, they need those people.  All right.  As long as they're not abusive, they're not going to just.  But the Grammys are tonight.  Okay.

And it's like people say to me all the time, like when I go out for work, because nobody really knows I do for a living, but I'm a consultant.  So I hear this all the time.  Well, you only have seven thousand followers.  And I'm like, I could whip out 50 of those followers right now that have like a million plus followers and they're following me.  So the number versus the quality is a whole different atmosphere.  Like, I'm sorry, I didn't go out and pay to get 30K fake people.  But, you know, it doesn't matter.  But a lot of people do that.

Transcript:  I have no concept to do that because my basic thing is I'm trying to teach other people about the Internet or show them what's going on.  The biggest thing for me is funny is explaining someone about how Facebook ads work.  People want to dump all this money into Facebook and buying likes for their pages.  And I'm like, you know, these are click farms in Istanbul and they still make me help them buy them.  And then after two months, I go back and I show them like, look, they're not real.  And they're like, oh, well, why didn't you tell me that more?  And I said, I broke it down for you from the get go.  But in their mind, they just want numbers.  They want numbers.  They don't care about writing a check.  But once those numbers do zero for you, then somebody realizes, all right, we're going to start writing these checks because it's useless.  So you got to play the game right.  But it makes you feel like you're trying to do is like this obsession with numbers, right?

The Twitter desktop app on the Mac can't I don't think it can play animated gifts yet.  Tweet deck like hasn't had some features that have been all on all the other Twitter things.  And it's been really annoying to have a service where it doesn't work properly across different devices because they don't have the time or inclination to actually focus on building those features.

I give up.  And I used to love Tweet deck.  But for those reasons, you're exactly right.  Like focus on the people that you have and making them more happy because they'll go out and evangelize for you and be like, dummy, why aren't you on Twitter?  And that's how you bring more people.  That's how it started.  It was an awesome thing that other people had to tell other people about.  You know what I mean?  Like saving with the Grammys.  They're going to be memes and jokes.  And how many people going to be at their jobs tomorrow with nerds that don't have the Internet and say, look at this like, oh, really?  That's funny.  I'll get there for free.  I'll download this fam.  And then they'll do it.  But that that old school tell somebody to do something still works.  And they need to focus on those kind of things sometimes.

I bought another car, and I was looking at it for it.  And my biggest problem was all the technology and stuff, I had to go search for it.  By the time I got to the place, they didn't know what was going on.  And I'm like, I shouldn't be sitting in this car teaching you about this car.  And I asked to get two other people, and they still couldn't do it.  I'm like, you know what?  Never mind.  And there's nowhere online where you can just go.

Transcript:  People who advertise, like Squarespace, who's been with us for four or five years,  people who advertise with Twitter, Squarespace credits us with putting Squarespace on the map.  They know that actually these ads really do work.  And so I'm not too worried.  One of these days, I was talking to somebody who was an ad manager for Procter & Gamble,  and he said, we're starting to see digital media like podcasts, but also banner ads,  so outperform our broadcast media for big brands and brand names like Tide.  And that at some point, it's just going to shift.  People are just going to say, why buy a podcast?  Why buy a $4 million Super Bowl ad?  You get a lot of...  I mean, we've been talking about the Super Bowl ads.  Super Bowl commercials dropping the hashtags.  So the folks at Marketing Land keep track of how many hashtags there were.  In the 2014 Super Bowl, 57% of the ads had hashtags, only 50% this year.  So it just shows you, you thought maybe hashtags were forever?  No.
