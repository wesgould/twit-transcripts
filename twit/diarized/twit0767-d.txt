It wasn't called TWIT at the time.  It was called The Revenge of the...  And we had to bleep the screen savers out.

Transcript:  I've got to be honest. I remember the furniture in your old apartment.  You've upgraded. I'm looking at some mid-century design behind you.  I see a beautiful home there.  If nothing else, you vastly improved the environment you're living in.  No disrespect to the house.

Start time: 272.80
End time: 316.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lots of cool test equipment.  I had the misfortune of going back in preparation for this and listening to that first Revenge of the Screen Savers,  which by the way, the acronym TROTS was the worst possible acronym,  which by the way, the acronym TROTS was the worst possible acronym,  although it's gotten worse.  And it was frankly a painful show for me to listen to because I was in the middle of a terrible situation.  And it was frankly a painful show for me to listen to because I was really overanxious.  I think I wanted it to succeed so badly that I was pushing too hard.  I think I wanted it to succeed so badly that I was pushing too hard.  And so for me it wasn't a great show.  For some reason, I think mostly you guys, people wanted to hear it  because Tech TV had disbanded the year before.  Because Tech TV had disbanded the year before.  Kevin was down in LA doing what was to become...  Was it the attack of the show at that point, Kevin?

Start time: 317.86
End time: 334.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they changed it pretty quickly to the attack of the show.  Well, they fired... Well, they got rid of Alex Albrecht, which sucked,  because we had a lot of fun doing that show together.  And then they brought Kevin Perera on.  And then that's when the name changed.  Or maybe it changed before that.

Start time: 335.84
End time: 341.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it had changed because that's why I thought I could use the Revenge of the Screen Savers.  And the letter said, we're not done with that name yet.

Start time: 341.98
End time: 343.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think that's what happened.

Start time: 344.84
End time: 352.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they were.  And Patrick and I were left behind in San Francisco.  They didn't take us to LA.

Start time: 354.08
End time: 366.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's hard to make a move when someone doesn't want you,  doesn't talk to you.  And then there was no reason to go to...  To pay my own way to go to LA when I was pretty sure they were going to kill the show  as we knew it anyway.

Start time: 368.80
End time: 373.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Not just not worth it.  Robert, what did you do at the end of the Tech TV?

Start time: 375.22
End time: 398.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to G4 as well.  I kind of just went with the flow.  We ended up setting up a lab briefly down there,  but otherwise I ended up working with the folks on Attack of the Show  until they had another round of layoffs.  And then at that point I took a good break  and then came back up to the Bay Area and worked for more Zip Davis properties  and I was a big fan of Extreme Tech and PC Magazine.

Start time: 398.80
End time: 407.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's who you were writing for when we did the first show.  You mentioned Extreme Tech. Patrick was also writing for Extreme Tech.  And the publication, which I don't think lasted long, called Extreme iPod.

Start time: 410.96
End time: 450.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It lasted for a while until Lawyers came out.  But we also replaced that with DLTV  when we got our hands on the first...  Gosh, was that 2004, 2005?  2005, I think.  We got our hands on the first TriCaster  and built the studio around the TriCaster,  which was like, after watching, after building the Tech TV set,  it was like, $7 million studio!  And it's like, well, we just did it for like 20 grand.  That was like, okay, this is what disruptive means  when you replace a million dollars worth of equipment  with like $40,000 worth of equipment. That was pretty crazy.  You know, now you can...

Start time: 453.06
End time: 473.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people are doing it at home now with an ATEM Mini  for $300 and a couple of DSLRs sitting around, right?  People think that Dvorak was on the original show.  He wasn't and didn't show up, I think, until episode 4.  So he wasn't... This is who was on the original show.  So it's fun to get you guys back again.  Was David Prager there for whatever reason?

Start time: 473.84
End time: 476.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. He might have been hiding. He's always at somewhere.

Start time: 479.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife was there.

Start time: 482.90
End time: 517.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the first time, yes, all of them were there.  We did it at the 21st Amendment Brewery  right after Macworld. But that wasn't...  I don't consider that the first tweet because that was many months earlier.  And that was like in January or February after Macworld Expo.  And that was more just a test.  But yes, Sarah was there. Prager was there for that one.  And I think all of you as well.  So, yeah. It's kind of fun that you guys...  What's interesting is shortly after that,  Kevin, you left G4 and started Revision 3, right?  Well, I was there for one year.

Start time: 518.80
End time: 530.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I was at G4 for one year.  We started Rev3 and I started to dig right around the same time.  Yep.  Yep.

Start time: 533.98
End time: 549.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, everyone is still standing.  I mean, you're all standing.  But this is the only thing that started in 2005 that's still going.  That's seeing in the podcast business, that's seeing a lot since most podcasts die after a week.  So, the fact that we're still here 15 years later.  No cupcakes.

Start time: 551.80
End time: 573.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were no sponsors back then, right?  I remember when we were doing Dignation, we had a ton of viewers.  But then finally, slowly, sponsors started to come online.  We had GoDaddy.  There wasn't a lot of money to be made.  And now you look at Joe Rogan, who's doing double digits of millions a year in revenue.  It's an episode, depending on how you count it.  But yeah, it's insane.

Start time: 575.80
End time: 640.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we first started, I didn't want to do advertisers.  I wanted to do, as Patrick has done his shows with the...  We didn't have Patreon in those days, but it was a tip jar with PayPal and that kind of thing.  But that was good for one show.  But it wasn't enough to pay anybody or have any help or anything else.  It was just enough for one show.  So it took us a couple of three years, but we finally said, I finally said, okay, we'll do advertisers.  And yeah, at this point, we're entirely ad supported.  Although thanks to COVID-19, there's a little thinning out of the herd, if you know what I mean.  I think that Rogan guy might make it though.  I think he's probably going to survive.  You know who's visiting real quickly?  A pop-in.  This was an old feature of the old shows I used to watch, like the Tonight Show.  People would, like Bob Hope would pop in and he'd be across the way.  He'd show up.  Look at this. A friend from the past, Scott Harriet Squatch is here.  Scott was never ever on the Twitter.  I don't know why I never asked you, but that's probably because you were busy making movies.  Yeah, still doing that.  Still, again, as I told you before, I'm not a fan of the show.  I'm not a fan of the show.

Start time: 642.02
End time: 672.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still doing that.  Again, as I told you before, we went on the air here.  I make just enough to still live with my 87-year-old parents down in Southern California.  But it's been great.  It's been fun.  I've been able to do primarily hiking films.  And we've gone around the world.  Australia, Iceland, just hiked in Ireland on a new route last year.  Take about three months to hibernate, edit them together,  and put them up on SquatchFilms.com.  That's awesome.

Start time: 674.80
End time: 682.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People may remember Scott from Internet Tonight, which was the high-end fancy show on ZDTV and Tech TV,  the one with writers, producers.  I think always look back.

Start time: 683.86
End time: 693.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think screen skaters, though, you guys were like, you were the highest rated show.  I think we were second.  But I mean, I think your audience brought a lot of people to our show.  A lot of geekier people.

Start time: 696.86
End time: 703.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yours was the show for real people, normal people, about, oh, look what's on the Internet.  Yes.  That was so fun, man.

Start time: 705.82
End time: 706.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those days.

Start time: 708.80
End time: 735.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also because you were a comic, and Michaela Pereira, who's gone on to fame and fortune,  you guys were funny.  So it was a funny show.  And you were a comic.  So that was easily the most entertaining show on the network.  But it turned out what people really wanted was, you know, we're going to install Linux on this box,  and it'll take us an hour.  Maybe it'll be time before the show's over.  That for some reason people liked that.

Start time: 736.44
End time: 856.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you were able to do both to be informative and entertaining.  I mean, if I attempted anything of that technological level,  you would be hearing the TV sets turning off.  But you told me you're a geek now.  Well, I'm a geek now.  I remember it because I actually took pride at the time that I was really the pure end user host on the show.  Everyone else knew so much more about tech than I did.  And my interest wasn't in it, really.  But as the gig was winding down with the Internet tonight got canceled  and then they were cool enough to keep me on for a year where I was on the show with you guys.  And I remember Kevin Rose sitting right next to me.  And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to be on the show for a year.  And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to be on the show for a year.  And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to be on the show for a year.  And I remember Kevin Rose sitting right next to me.  And I remember thinking to myself, this kid's never going to be a millionaire.  And I was right on the money with that.  Hey, Kevin, there is.  You know, it's great.  So and then, yeah, I mean, it's just I always look back on those times as just being.  I mean, it's a cornball word, but really magical, really fun.  And what a great place to live there in the Bay Area.  And then I was like, oh, I'm going to be on the show for a year.  And then absorbing all that technological info.  And then when the gig ended, I wanted to edit my own documentaries.  And I remember what was his now Mark Devito.  Remember Mark Devito, the editor? Yeah, he was the number one guy he's going.  And again, this is at that time he would go, dude, for like eight thousand dollars,  you can get Final Cut Pro, a power book and a Sony mini DV camera.  You can make your own documentaries and it looked good in a theater like that.  You know, great. And that's what I did and started making films.  What do you shoot on now?  I actually shoot on a Canon HFG 10, which is one of their cinema cameras.  Yeah, you know, those are good.  I just I just kind of correctly or incorrectly.

Start time: 856.80
End time: 877.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, wait a minute. This is a camcorder.  Oh, that's the same. That's the same thing we use.  You know, one of these run about now that the T20 we can't get the T10 anymore.  We bought ready for this, Scott, when I first set up to it, when we first step video,  which was in the in the brick house, we bought thirty five of them.

Start time: 879.24
End time: 880.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow. They're great cameras.

Start time: 880.84
End time: 919.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are how many are left, John, are all not all thirty five. Thirty three.  We're using it right now. That's what I'm on right now.  It's the old Vixie is that's pretty funny.  And, you know, we see and it's so funny because we've been totally eclipsed.  We had Marcus Brownlee on a couple of weeks ago and he's shooting everything on Reds editing on.  I think he's four or five Mac Pros, the new ones, the ones that start at six thousand dollars with XDR displays.  He even has wheels and monitor stands. That's how well he's doing.  And the times have changed quite a bit.  I'm still so funny that you're shooting your movies in the same camera that we're doing to it on.

Start time: 919.96
End time: 954.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a step. Yeah. And I did, though.  I just bought a Mark for five to four Canon to shoot video and get my next project.  I'm hoping to show what I think is the most underrated state for beauty in America.  Nevada, Nevada. You think of, you know, Vegas and Area 51, but that's got a lot of beauty.  It really does. Like in the northern two thirds.  So I, you know, got that's about like thirty five hundred bucks.  That may be. And I already did some tests.  The video looks is sharper than than the Vixia.

Start time: 955.00
End time: 986.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, it's so another old timer is actually in this in the chat room.  Karsten Bondi, who produces this show, he's producing at home these days.  He can't come in to the studio. That's as no one can except me.  But Karsten was also one of the people who went to L.A. with Kevin and Robert and stayed with them until 2005.  Stayed with G4 Tech TV. He says Mark DeVito.  He misses Mark DeVito most of all the tech TV folks.  He had the dirtiest mouth of anyone I've ever met.

Transcript:  I know there were some pretty foul mouth. Scott, it's really nice to see you.  I ran into Scott when I came back to Facebook.  And it's the only good thing that's happened to me in two weeks on Facebook.  But it was great. Scott goes, is this you really?  And then he says, all right, if prove it's you.  What did I used to yell during the tapings of Internet Tonight?  And I had no idea. So I said, well, I do remember you yelling foul obscenities every time you busted a take,  which is pretty much every time.  And Scott didn't remember that. That's the funny thing.  Carstens remembers the big list.  He's shouting in the chair.

Start time: 1033.88
End time: 1042.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drebben once once told me that Larry Wangberg came up to Drebben said, you know, that Leo's not bad looking.  I don't know why Drebben felt compelled to tell me that, but I wish he had.  Hey, Scott, it's really great to talk to you. Squatchfilms.com.  We're going to, you know, come back. We'll do a little more time.  Spend a little more time with you.

But essentially every Canadian who was every Canadian snowbird who was somewhere in the southern United States  was bombing for the Canadian border as fast as they could.  There was this point where the as the virus started to pick up, you know, one of the RV mags in Canada  was like, OK, your insurance is going to be canceled in two weeks and maybe closing the border.  And literally you just see Canadian license plates would like hit at six, plug their power in maybe water  and they would be gone at like seven o'clock the next morning.  And I was like, I am. Yeah.

There is a little tech news.  We could talk a little bit about the tech news just as we had in the old days.  In fact, before we go after we do the ad, I want to talk a little bit about the tech news.  Fifteen years ago, what we were talking about.  Oh, goodness.  It was a little different.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  Fifteen years ago, we didn't have VPNs.  If you had a VPN, I remember you had to have like a Cisco client and it was real complicated setup.  And the only reason people used VPNs was because they wanted to get on the work intranet from the outside.  There was lots of security to do it.  But it introduced some people to the idea that you could have an encrypted tunnel between where you are and where you want to be.  And at first it was just work.  But then people thought, well, we could put VPN servers other places, couldn't we?  And there was an VPN started exploding.  Virtual private networks.  Today, you'd be nuts to go to an open Wi-Fi access point, a coffee shop or anywhere and not have a VPN protecting you.  More and more people are using VPNs at home.  There are a number of reasons why you'd want to use it from home.  Of course, number one, privacy, right?  Your Internet service providers watching everything you do with a VPN, they can't see.  You also have an anonymity because you emerge under the Internet on an Express VPN server, the same server IP address used by other Express VPN customers, thousands of them.  So no one knows that it's you.  So if you're a Netflix subscriber, for instance, you can watch Netflix UK by just pressing the button and saying I want to go to London, Netflix Japan.  There's a lot of anime.  You can watch Doctor Who on Netflix UK, Netflix Canada.  So if you're running out of stuff to watch, Express VPN is a great way to do that.  Express VPN is also fast.  And that's one of the advantages of it.  Express VPN is so fast you can watch HD video.  So if you're running out of things to watch, Express VPN at home.  If you're not using Express VPN, it's like leaving your front door unlocked every time you go out.  Nothing may happen for a long time, but eventually you're going to be paying for it.  And the easiest thing to do is Express VPN.  Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, everywhere, even on your smart TV or your streaming device.  Express VPN is the easiest way to secure your internet.  So the only question is why haven't you started using it yet?  We've got a deal.  Maybe this will be the thing that will put you over the top.  Express VPN dot com slash twit.  You'll get three extra months free when you buy a one year package.  The number one trusted VPN in the world, Express VPN.  By the way, their privacy policy has been independently audited.  And the auditors said, yep, it's exactly what they said it is.  They use Trusted Server, which is a really cool technology.  The VPN server only spins up when you log in and it's sandboxed.  So it can't write to the hard drive the entire time you're using it, then disappears when you log out.  No trace of your presence is ever recorded.  Absolute privacy.  The third party auditing team also said, yep, that's exactly what Trusted Server does.  And it works.  Express VPN dot com slash twit.  We thank them for their support for this week in tech.  And I thank you for supporting twit by using that address.  Express VPN dot com slash twit.  So I don't see you guys as iPhone SE users somehow.

And I don't typically use cases because I like to just like slide them in and out of  my pocket.  It seems that way.

Transcript:  breaks.  There's a company called M film.  They sell them on Amazon.  They're cheap.  They're like seven bucks for two or something like that.  The tempered glass essentially distributes the force.  You'll fracture the glass, but you'll fracture the tempered glass.  But it'll protect the screen below it.  I mean, I'm sure if you start wailing it against a concrete wall, you can shatter the screen.  But that's interesting.

Start time: 2088.80

Start time: 2111.44
End time: 2143.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As far as I'm concerned, at this point, I got so tired at one point, I went through  like three screens in a year, eight months or a year.  And then I started using the tempered glass ones.  And I just simply refused to operate a phone without a tempered glass screen protector  because, you know, there was the one point where I had a screen shatter and I didn't  have time to get it fixed and I couldn't find the parts for it.  You know, and I'm ending up with little pieces of glass embedded in my thumb.  At this point, I can't really, you know, gorilla glass, whatever, versus tempered glass.  My thumb can't feel the difference.  So I'm happy and my screens aren't breaking.

It's better than the big four.  And I used to do custom runs on phones just to have that pure Google experience or the

Transcript:  If it's truly worth it.  If it's something on like the, the build level of a Samsung device, a high end Samsung device  with the most epic screen and build quality, that's generally right.  But on the other hand, I prefer the integrated features that the pixel phone actually has  in terms of the assistant use.  And again, I'll go back to having just basic stuff built in like a good VPN service, even  though I use a third party.  Google actually has one built into their pixel phones.  That's pretty damn nice actually.  And I'll just go back.  Their customer service has been nothing but absolutely superb and I'd never have to think  about billing.  It's just like, I can't really screw it up.  And it's about perfect for me.

It's tied to a phone number.  So for a normal person, that's fine.  But if you're like Kevin and maybe me and you have more than one phone, it's no good.  You got your burner phone, Leo?

Transcript:  I know they published a couple of documents recently outlining how they're aware of that  very condition and how it is an issue for a lot of people to join up.  And it is something I know they want to address.  I don't want to attach it to a number.  And they have a way they've come up with that might actually work, but they needed to get  it implemented.  And right now, I think they're more concerned about that new trust act or whatever the hell  it was that was looking to circumvent end-to-end encryption.  The EARN IT Act?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  EARN IT is more clever than I thought I could give Congress credit for because Congress  and the Department of Justice and every government in the world has been trying to eliminate  end-to-end encryption.  Their position is, oh, no, law enforcement needs to be able to know everything you're  doing or we can't stop child pornography or terrorists or whatever the offensive flavor  of the month is.  But the problem is, at least in the US, they've done it in Russia, they've done it in Australia,  they've done it in Sweden, they've done it in many countries where they just say, no,  you can't have end-to-end encryption.  It's up to the signal or whoever.  You're going to make a plain text version available to law enforcement if they ask for  it.  They can't do it in the US because people like us will get up in arms.  So they thought they were clever.  Oh, we got it.  I know.  We'll threaten to withhold Section 230 protections, the ones that say you're not responsible  for the content on your website or your blog, the comments on your blog or the videos on  YouTube.  You're not, you can't go to jail or be sued for those because you're just a carrier.  But they say if that protection, you have to earn it by, yeah, you got to earn it by  following, quote, best practices in terms of encryption or just in terms of offering,  best practices, but what they're really talking about is encryption.  And who is the final arbiter of best practices?  Sure, they've created a committee, but it's all deferential to the attorney general of  the United States of America, one William Barr, who thinks encryption is the worst thing  that ever happened.  Also to Dianne Feinstein.  And Dianne Feinstein, who is one of the sponsors of the Internet Act.  So Dick Blumenthal, another sponsor, said, it's not about encryption.  We just don't want child pornography, want companies to be responsible.  They have to earn their Section 230 protection, but it is about encryption.  The funny thing is Dick Blumenthal is going on and on about how you got to use encryption.  And then he's got sponsoring this stupid act.  It's very offensive.

Transcript:  And it's just, it's so they don't realize that this is a whack-a-mole game.  Encryption is never going away.  Right. So you shut it down on messaging and guess what?  You just take a file, a text file, encrypt it, put it on a Dropbox and share it with someone else.  You go back and forth and you just keep doing that.  It's like, it's so ridiculous.  It's just people are going to find ways around this.

End time: 2827.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you ever used, I love magic wormhole.  Do you know about that?  The problem with using Dropbox is Dropbox has a copy.  Of course it's encrypted, but it's there and there, you know, maybe that sets up a red flag or something.  Magic wormhole is point to point.  So if I want to send Patrick a secret plan to dominate the world,  I would use magic wormhole to encrypt it and it would give me an English passphrase, you know,  nasal walnut, glow nasal walnut.  And then I would call Patrick said, glow nasal walnut and hang up.  And then Patrick would fire up his magic wormhole type and glow nasal walnut and it would do a peer to peer connection.  And so no third part.  Well, I guess the phone company know about it.

I'm going to click if I click that button.  I think I agree with you.  And I've felt for a long time the 12.9 inch iPad is amazing hardware that somehow the  software just isn't living up to the promise.  This shit.  This is a laptop.  So they're finally putting a laptop keyboard.  It's the same keyboard as on their MacBook Air and the 16 inch MacBook Pro.  They're putting it on a hinge.  So it's kind of a little bit more.  It's even got a charging plug on the side.  This turns it into a laptop.  Yeah.  Bring under $50.

End time: 3068.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After they announced this, I thought, oh, they don't need to because the laptops are the  trucks, as Steve Jobs famously said, and the desktops are the trucks.  They're for the people who are doing coding, video editing, launching rocket ships.  The iPads, the computer, everybody else will want.  Normal people will want.  And then we don't have to we can keep Intel because they really need the horsepower, frankly.  So they can keep Intel in the trucks and then they and then arm for everything else.  You think they're going to put arm on the trucks?

Transcript:  I think they're going to try to.  They'll probably start with the with the errors and work their way up from there.  It's going to be interesting to see.  It's also it's been kind of crazy watching the the new processors from AMD desktop or  should be on the laptop and the performance on those for what you're paying is spectacular.  Yeah, because, you know, we're just like, oh, this is like the desktop story.  But in a laptop and that all, you know, it's because we were looking at special peak from PC Per and I were talking about this earlier this year.  And we were like, really excited, but we were waiting to see what the battery life looked like.  And then the battery life. Wow.  Battery life's not looking bad.  So, you know, the they're just they're just kicking asses at AMD right now.  And Intel has to be, you know, Intel is looking at like a year, two years of reorganizing and reorganizing and trying to get back on their pace.  I mean, they've you know, they've they've been off on their process technology for a while.  They just didn't care about power users, particularly because, hey, who else they going to go?  We'll give another five percent this year, ten percent that year.  And now all of a sudden, AMD is just pushing them hard.  And I think it's, you know, we've been looking at processors and everybody's coming up with custom processors for the phones.  And I think it's, you know, like Qualcomm is going to be competing not just with Apple, but with, you know, it seems like everybody else in the planet at this point in terms of arm designs.  I feel like they're starting to get enough power out of arm where they're going to sort of take over the low end Intel processors and be able to do things that kind of customize it to run their code better.  We'll see in a couple of years.

But for right now, if I'm building a new box for myself as a workstation, AMD, I'm not even I'm not looking at Intel.  I have not said that in probably like 15 years.

Remember, at the screensavers, we were rooting for AMD because they were sticking it to Intel and they were keeping keeping the overall processor prices down and they were really improving efficiency.

But it's kind of unfortunate because after you know after dig was very successful this this this guy named Alexis Ohanian Steve Huffman came along said oh we should do something like that call we'll call it Reddit.  And dig passed away because everybody gamed dig and then you had massive gaming issues which was really massive.  Yeah.  Spammers just hit it hard and somehow Reddit avoided that and they got all the glory when you really deserved it because it was your idea and they just made a clone frankly.

Let's take a little break.  We'll talk more with Kevin Rose Patrick Norton Robert Heron will catch up with all three of  them in just a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV our 50th anniversary IT Pro TV is not quite  as old but they were based on the same notion.  In fact I remember that Tim and Don the founders they were IT trainers.  They came to a little panel we did at NAB some years ago.  We talked about what we had done with Twitter.  They said boy be interested to do something like that around IT training and IT Pro TV  was born.  They have absolutely surpassed us.  Now in Gainesville they have I think five or six live studios are beautiful.  They are doing hundreds of hours a week of IT training 4000 hours in on demand.  And one of the reasons they keep those studios running all the time is because they want  to keep them up to date.  That's part of their core values.  And it's important if you're thinking about an IT training you've got to train for the  latest exams.  You've got to use the latest software.  There's new certs all the time.  There's interfaces are redesigned.  You can't use the old stuff.  So IT Pro TV makes a point of having the latest greatest IT training.  And I got to tell you it's engaging.  It's entertaining.  It's fun.  Binge worthy learning for IT professionals whether you're wanting to get a job in IT  or keep that job going.  Look at that set.  That is a core.  That looks like the old screensaver set.  It's gorgeous.  They really cool set.  Isn't it.  They have one has an elephant freaking invader an elevator.  I always I'm so mad.  Then they also did something really smart.  They have a central control control station in the middle and then the studios are all  around it.  So it's very flexible.  In fact they also do just side light right now with a lot of companies trying to take  conferences and training off you know offline or online I should say instead of in real  space.  They also are helping people do that too.  So you can contact them if you're interested in that if you want to cancel or you had to  cancel your upcoming conference they can actually do virtual conferences either in their studio  or use their expertise to come to you and have you set it up.  So IT pro TV is great to keep in mind for that too.  Four thousand hours of IT training.  They're the official video training partner for CompTIA.  Those CompTIA search are the base search for anybody wants to get into IT whether it's  a plus or network plus or security plus search.  They have 12 in fact CompTIA on demand courses.

I like laughing because I think like you know operating system updates used to be a big  deal and now we have Windows as a service which on some days I adore and on other days  when like I remember you know my system rebooting right before recording a podcast and discovering  that it had wiped out the drivers for my camera my focus right and the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But here OK here's a story that just came out that I think illustrates how difficult  it is for end users and this is right up your alley Patrick.  It turns out that a lot of the big NAS drives being sold by Western Digital Seagate and  others are using a technique called SMR shingled media recording or shingled I'm sorry shingled  magnetic recording and there is a real flaw in SMR.  It's slow.  It's really slow.  It gives you higher densities because it's like a roof shingle.  It's it's it's layering the data multiple on the same data on multiple.  I'm sorry different data on the same track and it's really can slow you down.  It's not the kind of most hard drives are CMR conventional magnetic recording.  But the problem is there's no way of knowing.  If this NAS drive you bought is an SMR drive and as a result unsuitable for use on a NAS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've started using Seagate drives of late for all of my hard drive needs.  I had ran into a couple issues with some Western Digital drives and I use them in NAS boxes for surveillance systems that are constantly writing.  Not a lot of read performance really.  You know I don't really need that side of it but it is writing like ninety nine point nine percent of the time to a bunch of drives and most people especially once you start getting into systems that are at least eight drives or more then vibrations become an issue.  And that's really the case and the drives themselves have to be rated properly.  We were just talking about the good old days with operating systems.  I think one of the big transitions was just this this this multitasking environment we're in now.  It really just kind of used to be back in the day we ran one app at a time at full speed.  If you want to close that app and do something else so be it.  But that seems to have opened the means for a lot of people just to get themselves in trouble like you accidentally click the wrong email while doing something else and it'll wipe out a wipe out a system or make your life uncomfortable.

And at first if you read the ours technical article at few first Western Digital said oh no no we're not doing that.  Oh OK. We did it on one drive which never made it to the consumer.  OK. We are doing it.  But it's like it was very embarrassing for Western Digital.

I don't I don't think it's something you can really survive if they start wiping out NAS performance.  Good.  You know I could be wrong.  It's frustrating right because so many of the really you know there are only there's not a whole lot of sites in really serious really serious you know drive reviews or or SSD reviews anymore.

But it's also the it's also the disk controller.  So they can put bare you know bare NAND chips on the motherboard.  And that's their flat that's their you can't upgrade it.  But that's their that's their SSD.  Pretty remarkable.  They're very very fast and VME drives.  Geez I bought a two terabyte NVMe drive to put in my XPS 13 for 200 bucks.  Nice mind boggling.

Transcript:  I do.  The chat room is asking that you go out and grind in that rail while we're taking a break.  Yeah.  Just take your skateboard out the skateboard out.  Yeah.  Do a little grinding.  Our show.  Wasabi.  Hot cloud storage.  Hot.  Yeah.  You'd think it hot like with the wasabi you get with your sushi.  No, no, no.  This is sort of like that.  It's hot cloud storage.  Do you know everybody's moving to the cloud now?  I'll give you I was talking to my friend David Friend who's the founder of Wasabi.  Really great guy.  Love this guy.  And we were talking about how more and more people have realized that they can't do on  prem what they want to do.  They have to go to the cloud.  He talked about a building downtown in Boston.  Put security cameras up as one does all over the place.  Those securities cameras are streaming about a megabyte every minute.  It's actually a megabit.  So yeah, it's even more than that.  It's a lot of data and there's a lot of cameras.  And all of a sudden they realized if we keep buying hard drives, it's going to cost us  a mint.  Put it in the cloud.  In most cases, Wasabi is less expensive and more secure than your on premises storage.  If you need storage, we all do.  You need Wasabi.  If you're a managed service provider, you're going to love Wasabi because it costs you  less.  That means you can charge less and still earn more money.  Wasabi uses a patented technology.  Only they have it of writing the disk.  They write in data in blocks, not sectors, and it saves them so much that they're 80%  cheaper than Amazon's S3.  That means they're significantly less expensive even than on-prem storage.  In fact, typically you could store data in the cloud with Wasabi for less than the annual  cost, just to the maintenance fees on the on-prem storage.  I remember how much our SAN used to cost.  I get much more storage for much, much less.  Wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage just kind of the  natural no-brainer.  There are two ways to pay.  You could pay as you go, like you would normally.  By the way, Wasabi is about $5.99 per terabyte per month.  It's really affordable.  Or you could pay one time with what they call reserved capacity storage.  This is another way Wasabi is really innovating.  Wasabi's reserved capacity storage makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to your on-prem  storage.  If you're thinking about buying more hardware, like that building in Boston, compare the  price against five years of reserved capacity storage.  What it'll do is you'll say, and I know sometimes for accounting to convince the boss, look,  here's the price of this, here's the price of that.  It's easier to understand.  It's easier.  You can purchase cloud storage in one, three, or five-year increments.  You'll get even greater discounts for term and capacity.  Security is better than on-premises storage.  11 nines of durability.  And they do active integrity checking.  And since they're in multiple premier tier four data centers that are highly secure and  fully redundant, you lose one bit on a file, they get another copy from another data center,  you're golden.  And all Wasabi data storage is secure by default.  It's always encrypted at rest.  Even if you don't specify encryption, it's just the way it works.  Encrypted at rest.  And they have very powerful access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs.  You can even say this data is immutable.  It cannot be erased.  It cannot be altered.  It cannot be encrypted by ransomware.  That data is protected from hackers, from malware.  It's protected from you.  I just think Wasabi does it right.  It's第二個a, cjais-compliant, affordable.  They don't.  It's 80% cheaper.  It's six times faster than S3.  They don't charge for API access.  And by the way, they use the S3 API.  So you already know how to use it and you already have tools that use it.  They don't charge for egress.  You know, if you look at S3 and all the tiers and all the buckets and all the egress and  everything, it's so complicated, Wasabi is very straightforward.  It's very straightforward.  I don't know why anybody would do anything else.  Calculate the savings for yourself.  You can try it right now.  Free storage for a month.  If you go to wasabi.com, click the link and use the offer code TWIT.  This is a good way to really bang on it.  Take a look at this reserve capacity storage is something new they just introduced.  It is really disrupting the industry.  I know you probably say, what?  I never heard of them.  I know Google, I know Microsoft, I know Amazon.  You better know Wasabi.  You better.  It's a better way.  Join the movement.  Migrate to the cloud with confidence.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  And don't forget the offer code TWIT.  These guys are great.  I know them well.  I'm really proud to work with them and I'm very happy what they're offering is so superior.  Wasabi.com.  It's kind of, you know, it's an enterprise play, but I also know a lot of individuals  are using this for all sorts of interesting things.  It's just a brilliant way to go.  Wasabi.  All right.  Everybody's back refreshed.

And he would either use those for parts for other consoles  or, you know, restore them, you know, fix them up.  And either resell them or keep them.

The vinyl people hate anybody who's using anything digital  or, for that matter, in many cases.  It's funny to watch because when you, especially if you go into the forums,  there's so much in-fighting.  It's kind of hysterical to watch.  You know, the headphone, the speaker people trash talking, the headphone people,  the headphone people talking about why their experience is better.  And it's, it's, it's, there's moments where I'm just like, there's so much hate.  Just shut up and listen to what you like.  Yeah, that's it.  You got a great point, Patrick.

Transcript:  It's amazing.  It's amazing how good the soundtracks are on television series now.  And just even putting a simple set of stereo speakers or a sound bar  will just vastly increase the immersion.  It's amazing how much a really good audio experience.  And it doesn't have to be an expensive surround sound system  or a cheap surround sound system.  Just having a decent pair of stereo speakers that cover most of the audio range  makes a huge difference in what's going on.  You start realizing how clever some of the audio work is  in some of the television series or movies these days.

Transcript:  I think Patrick's suggestion for a sound bar is the way to go.  And the one I'm using right now is the Sonos Beam.  It's their smaller sound bar compared to like the Play Bar.  And my favorite, my favorite thing about Sonos,  other than pretty decent audio quality, is their freaking app.  And with that, I have every audio CD I've ever owned ripped to a NAS box.  And that can deal with tens of thousands of tracks in a lossless format.  And let me stream that however I want around the house.  And I absolutely adore that.  And what I'm hoping for coming up is an upgrade for my TV has built in Dolby Atmos support.  And for TV speakers, it sounds OK.  But I really, really want to get a set of audio speakers that can at least simulate it maybe with a sound bar system.  Or eventually I'll get the full blown home theater with four speakers in the ceiling in addition to the seven speakers around.

Transcript:  I mean, Elac's a great speaker company right now.  They're a German speaker company.  And a couple of years ago, Andrew Johnson, who had been doing stuff for Pioneer, started doing some designs.  And he's just flat out trying to give you as much acoustic performance for the least amount of money possible.  I mean, he liked to be 2.0 is a fantastic speaker.  And you don't have to get super audio filey about it.  They he basically redesigned when he we did the second debut is because they did this very high performing speaker for not much money.  Made a decent app to push it.  But then the entire industry started to kind of like, like, oh, you people will buy decent speakers.  And then they did the deep of the debut 2.0.  And I think it's the reference series.  It's the new one. I haven't heard that one yet.  I hear amazing things about that.  But the original debut 2.0, they're on sale right now for like 30 percent off on Amazon.  You know, it's like two hundred thirty dollars for really solid speakers.  And they they sound astonishingly good for the money.

But it's it's amazing because there are a lot of companies right now.  You know, Mr. Speakers are actually it's Dan Clark Audio.  And that's one of my favorite headphone companies.  There's some amazing audio quality that doesn't cost a lot of money, you know, because you see a lot of stuff,  especially if you're going to like a can jam or or some of the audio shows, you'll walk into a room.  And I remember walking into a room and somebody's like, this just sounds astonishing.  And I'm like, well, you know, this is six hundred thousand dollars worth of speakers and amps.  If it doesn't sound astonishing, something's horrendously wrong.  But it's kind of amazing when you look at somebody like RSL doing a speed woofer,  which is this 10 inch woofer that has phenomenal performance.  I think it's I think Brent Butterworth picked it as the as wire cutters pick or, you know,  what Elac's doing with their speakers. Emotiva is out trying to.

Transcript:  Redcon, what did you do? George Lucas leave those to you and as well.  That's nice. I remember.  Those are nice. Not all. They're very nice. That's it. Really?  I thought they were hugely. So years ago, Scott Wilkinson had a friend who was they were scoring  the Sony uncharted I think was uncharted two or three.  And they used this symphony orchestra soundstage at Lucas down here in the in the Marine Skywalker  Skywalker Ranch. It's one of the last few symphonic sound stages where you can get a hundred musicians.  He invited me down. It was amazing. But I was so on the floor listening in the room with these guys.  And there's nothing better than that. If you can, if you're lucky enough to stand in the middle of a symphony,  that's pretty good. But then I went into the control room where they have these beautiful Rebels speakers.  And it was pretty indistinguishable. It sounded really, really good for for a quick A B test.  I was impressed. But I'm sure those were the high end diamond cone, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it's also I mean, it's kind of hysterical because I do remember Robert when we were we were up in the tower at CES  and we walked into this room and one of the guys from the super pretentious audio mags was in there.  He sounded like the comic book guy and he's talking about his personal Niagara recorder and how he had recorded his  you know, his name dropping. And I think Rob looks over it'd be really funny because I'm basically standing on my chair  and then I'm dropping down low and then I'm back on the chair again. And you know, there were these beautiful speakers.  They physically just visually stunning, like seven feet tall.  And they were talking about their diamond tweeter technology. And and they sounded like ass.  It was like I'm standing up. Maybe my head's not at the right level to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it was it's so funny. You mentioned Revelle because we went like I was I was I was sitting there because I looked at Rob.  I was like, oh, there's like one hundred thousand dollars speakers. And we found out like two days later, there are four hundred thousand  dollars speakers and like two doors down was Revelle.  And they had, you know, which is still incredibly expensive, twenty thousand dollars speakers.  But they were astonishing. The imaging, the sound, the low end, everything was just it was it was everything you want out of your twenty thousand  dollars speakers, except I want to pay, you know, you know, five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars.  And but I was we were laughing because it was like you had these amazing looking ridiculously like house money for a pair of speakers.  And they sounded atrocious. And that's that's one of the frustrating things about, you know, when you start getting into the audio file stuff is  is you start seeing these companies that are selling like thousand dollar cables or or three hundred dollar USB cables or my personal  favorite, the audio file grade, a nine hundred dollar switch, which is essentially a modified thirty five.  It's essentially like a thirty five dollar switch that they modify and resell for like seven or nine hundred dollars.  There's no measurable difference. If you blind a be it, there's no difference.  And it's it's a little frustrating to see some of the stuff that's out there.  And then you hear something. It's amazing. It's like, oh, so I don't know.  It's curious. The whole thing. But you were we were talking before everyone you went to commercial and the rest of us ran to the bathroom.  It's good that they have that catheter for you. That should go the entire time.  But so I I have been to a lot of the audio files.

Transcript:  Yeah. And then I bought and this was Scott Wilkinson's recommendation.  He reviewed it recently. This little DAC, it's called a hip DAC from I.F.I.  And it's a battery backed up, you know, so it's got its own power and you and you take the USB out of  your MacBook, which has, you know, an OK DAC or I'm using it with XPS 13.  And so you just get the digital audio from your device.  You can even use it with your iPhone if you want with the right cable.  And this really makes a big difference. And then you can put on some put some decent headphones in.  It sounds good. And this way, I'm a little more portable, you know.  Yeah. Well, there's a lot of workstation. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I'd love to have some good speakers with these.  It might be pretty it might be pretty good. It's funny, like AudioQuest, who makes expensive speaker cables.

That's awesome.  And these things are ridiculously good. I would start with the black unless you have like some planar magnetic  headphones that require a lot of power. This thing's complete overkill for the vast majority.  But the the AudraQus Dragonfly back is amazing for the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're there. And they're it's funny because when he came out with those like the original Aon's, you know,  I was talking to him like you're you're delivering something.  It's like as good as your primary product, but for half the price.  And part of his thing is he's just out there to kind of blow up the industry and deliver as much.

When you go to someplace like Audio Science Review, it's outperforming.  This is a ninety nine dollar inexpensive product they did because they do.  Their elements was like my old headphone amplifier.  DAC was kind of trash. They had just come out with the element.  I fell in love with it. And then the primary engineer spent a couple of years kind of experimenting and figuring out how to lay out the boards.  And he's created this. You know, I was laughing because I had this like, you know,  Thirteen hundred dollars set of like this very, you know, serious audio companies, speakers, and it was picking up all the noise from my 34 inch curved monitor.  It was really frustrating because if there was a pause something or if there was a quiet passage, I would hear noise from the monitor.  And then this ninety nine dollar headphone amplifier, you could basically like shove it up against the alternator of a car and it picked up nothing.  I mean, you know, it was it was next to this monitor and it was picked up nothing.  And it's amazing like companies like these guys like JDS Labs and again, like, you know, Mr. Speakers, they're they're delivering astonishing audio quality for not that much money.

But these tracks are so accurately modeled using the latest information year to year, they actually re-scan them with laser systems.  And there's a cool video right now on YouTube where they do a split screen with the Circuit of the Americas track in Texas.  And the top half is the eye racing running, I think it was a Ford GT. And on the bottom is a real Ford GT.  If you squint a little bit, you can't see the difference.  And it is exposed some of these drivers to a more social aspect and they're for the good and the bad.

So when I go to her house, I'm extra paranoid because she already has lung issues.  And it's just like I'm I'm freaked out about that.  So there's as I'm sure we all have something similar, right?  Somebody in our lives that is immune compromised or something's going on and you just you're extra careful and it's the best you can do.

Of course, elders are often isolated anyway, but I really think about people who are alone right now and how difficult that must be.  You and I were lucky enough to be with our families and and that's good.  And I do Zoom calls with my kids because Abby's and Marin and Henry's I don't know where Henry is.  He was in San Francisco. I think now I don't know.  He's gone somewhere. He's he's sheltering in place with his good buddy.  I think he's in Monterey as a Pacific Grove.  But we do Zoom calls together. But yeah, it's it can be really hard for older people, I think, especially because they're so high risk that they just can't see anybody.  Patrick, it sounds like you're maybe in a very small quarters with your family.  Has that been all right? Yeah.
