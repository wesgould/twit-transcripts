I like to get together a diverse group, an interesting group of people, tech journalists, entrepreneurs, candidates for Congress.  Every week we talk about stuff.  Brianna Wu is back. It's great to have her.  She is both an entrepreneur, a founder of a giant space cat, which is of course an online, it's a gaming company.  But running for Congress in the Massachusetts. I always get this wrong. Which district?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brianna Wu, 2018.com. And she's told us she also has 2022, 2020.  Got to run for reelection.  In fact, that's one of the problems. As soon as you get into Congress, you're going to spend the rest of your time running to get in again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, you know, the philosophy I'm going to have is I'm going to go there and I'm going to do the best job I can for, you know, the people I'm representing.  And I'm just going to go for broke. And, you know, if I get reelected, I will.  But I'm not going to go there and play this game where, you know, like you, you think three times about everything you do, if it's going to help you get reelected.  I just, you know, I don't think you can do that with integrity.

Transcript:  And with us, the entrepreneur, the founder, the guy who put together Evernote, Phil Libbon. It's always great to see you. His new company, All Turtles, is an incubator, not incubator. What do you call it?  We're a studio.  Studio.  We're an AI studio.  For artificial intelligence applications, Coolio.  And you may not recognize Phil because he used to look like Mitch Miller with a black goatee and a few extra pounds. You look like 20 years. You look great.  Thank you. You look great, too.  Yeah. He's a good suck up. So, yeah. No, I lost a little weight. I did because I'm doing what you did, which is fasting, intermittent fasting.  Oh, you're fasting.  Intermittent fasting. Not all the time.  You know what? I tell people I'm skipping meals.  All fasting is intermittent.

Start time: 263.72
End time: 303.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, it's official. And I want to pull the panel. Apple sent out invitations this week, uncharacteristically early. Usually they wait till exactly a week before the event, but they announced on end of August that they would have an event.  September 12th, 10 a.m. There's Jim Dalrymple's post. Of course, Jim from The Loop was invited. There's his invite. And if you read the invite, it says, what does it say? Let's meet at our place. And I think that's even the bigger story.  And the only reason I want to go to this one, it's not the 10th anniversary iPhone. It's going to be the first event at the new Apple Park in the new Steve Jobs Theater. And we were speculating whether they'd be ready in time. Pretty exciting.

Start time: 303.72
End time: 306.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a spaceship. It's going to be this amazing structure.

Start time: 306.60
End time: 348.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, if you look at the Steve Jobs Theater is separate, but it's kind of echoes. It's a circle of glass with the world's largest carbon fiber roof on top of it. But the event is actually it's almost like an evil, you know, evil genius lab underground.  So you go in this big circle and then and then there's two escalators there and then you go down into the Steve Jobs Theater, a thousand seat theater. Presumably, this is where Apple which is actually a smaller venue than they often use when they were.  Bill Graham Auditorium is about 50% bigger. But I think a thousands enough. Remember, they want to have room not only for the press, but for Apple employees. Sure, because there's always a lot of applause. Press typically don't applaud.

Start time: 348.52
End time: 380.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you? So you've been to every Apple event? Almost everyone since 1984 or something. Do you sit on your hands during these things? I don't. I don't applaud. No. Is that what you mean? Do I applaud? No. I'm impressed.  You don't have to sit on your hands. You just applaud. I would have to sit on my hands. I don't know. I don't know where the tradition began. You applaud. You're not a journalist. You're not a press. So in a way that's kind of freedom, I have to admit, I think and I don't remember but I'm guessing that in the original iPhone announcement 10 years ago, which was held at the big Moscone West.

Start time: 380.72
End time: 393.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at CES. I would guess that I leapt to my feet when he announced the iPhone. Because you were excited. It was pretty exciting. Why wouldn't you applaud as press though? Because it's like you're taking a side. You're endorsing the person speaking as opposed to being there and being objective.

Start time: 393.96
End time: 418.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's why it's known. It's just a tradition. There are exceptions. Sometimes you will applaud to be polite. Not so much for an announcement like when Steve Jobs came on. And he was definitely ill. I applauded then of course. And everybody in the theater rose to their feet.  So there are certain times you would applaud but you wouldn't applaud an announcement because that would be, I don't know. I'm not sure where the tradition started.

Start time: 418.50
End time: 423.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's because you're objective. You should not applaud. You're there to take notes. You're not there to cheer.

Start time: 424.44
End time: 427.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not applauding is not being objective either because then you're visibly...

Start time: 427.72
End time: 431.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not making any reaction at all. You're just simply taking notes, getting the information.

Start time: 431.50
End time: 432.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well fine. So you're not throwing tomatoes either.

Start time: 434.50
End time: 439.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there's an interesting point there because in fact you are attending an Apple event.

Start time: 439.54
End time: 449.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're signaling that you're not happy about it.  That you're interested in it.  But when the camera pans across the audience and there's a bunch of people not applauding, no one is like, oh that's the press section. Those people don't like it.

Start time: 449.90
End time: 483.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Steve started this tradition probably in 1984 where they made a big to-do about the release of the Macintosh. Remember he was in his bow tie. He pulled the Mac out of the bag. It said, hello, it's good to be out of this bag.  And ever after I think Apple, primarily because Steve Jobs was a brilliant showman, Apple made a lot of this. But prior to that, I don't think companies had...they would be at Comdex. Bill Gates would give a keynote. They might mention new products.  But they did not...this whole idea of a dog and pony circus started with Apple.

Start time: 483.60
End time: 508.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Started with Steve. Yeah, and I remember I was at that event in 1984 showing my age here. And most of his events...the next event when he introduced the next and he just had this amazing way...here's what I will say.  Almost every time I'd walk out of a Steve Jobs keynote, I would walk out saying, I've got to have that product. I can't wait to get my hands on that product. Often I was disappointed. Often the product was not that great.

Start time: 508.54
End time: 511.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it the reality distribution fee. And it was very real.

Start time: 511.90
End time: 539.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very effective. And so when they would interview me immediately afterwards, because typically what I will do with these things, they'll do a radio or television interview immediately afterwards, I am always ensuithed because I just heard this amazingly enthusiastic speech.  And afterwards, very hard at trying not to sound ensuithed because Steve had that ability to get people...and that's not true anymore. Tim Cook's a great guy.  He's not exactly a leap to your feet and sheer kind of guy.  Not at all.  You like him.  Yeah, very likable.

Start time: 539.62
End time: 549.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I met Steve Jobs for five minutes once at one of the events and he pretended to know who I was and it was like the greatest moment of my life.  I know he didn't really know who I was.  I have a far worse Steve Jobs story, but I'll let Brianna...

Start time: 550.50
End time: 563.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've only had one.  Poor Brianna. We should mention that we are in studio, the three guys, and poor Brianna has to sit here on Skype, which is putting you at a disadvantage and I apologize. So please don't hesitate to step all over us and I won't stop.

Start time: 563.60
End time: 575.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm super excited about this.  You know, this one.  Like, I think the prototypes have come out for the iPhone.  I guess we're going to call it the eight.  I think we're going to bet.  Is that what everybody's saying?

Start time: 575.50
End time: 576.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody 58.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 578.19
End time: 633.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The prototypes just look amazing.  I'm a little skeptical about getting rid of the home button.  And the reason is, this is terrible, but I measure what normal people are going to think about new technology by watching my husband.  He's a brilliant guy.  He has a PhD in bacterial genetics.  He's head of IP for a major biotech company.  But he's normal.  He cannot figure out tech at all.  He cannot figure out tech at all.  He cannot update his iPhone.  And I just, you know, you read about some of the things they've found in the beta for swiping up to get to the home screen.  And even the supposed feature about like scanning your face with like a connect technology to unlock it.  I'm really skeptical about how normal people are going to react to that.  I mean, we're not going to have any problems, but you're getting rid of the major interface paradigm of the iPhone.  But to be fair, most Android phones don't have home buttons.

Start time: 633.72
End time: 643.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not physical ones.  Samsung has.  It's very true.  And so it's not undoable, but it does feel a little bit like getting rid of the headphone jack.  It's a little more courage.

Start time: 643.52
End time: 649.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple hates holes.  Apple hates buttons.  This has been clear for years.  It's all moving in the same direction.

Start time: 649.64
End time: 653.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve insisted a mouse should only have one button, despite every bit of evidence otherwise.

Start time: 653.56
End time: 659.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be great.  Steve also didn't like on off switches too.  Right.  He just wanted to work.

Start time: 659.54
End time: 665.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me neither.  But losing the home button also means you lose touch ID, the fingerprint sensor.  Although you could do it.

Start time: 666.52
End time: 672.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what Google does is it puts them in the back.  They're not going to do that.  They're not.  I love it in my Nexus.

Start time: 673.72
End time: 675.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks great.  It's very functional.

Start time: 675.50
End time: 688.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually like it on the back.  The only negative.  What I worry about with the iPhone.  Right.  Or, you know, when I drive, I Velcro it to the dashboard of the car.  So you can't reach the fingerprint.  I can't reach the back.  Yeah, that's a problem.  What are you worried about, Brianna?

Start time: 689.82
End time: 706.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So like if it's in the dark, like, you know, they're going to change over the secure enclave chip to, you know, supposedly work with the front facing camera.  And I just worry about how awkward that's going to be.  Like if you're in a meeting, you know, you can kind of do it under the table and hide it like that.  Yeah.

Start time: 707.50
End time: 738.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is based on rumor.  Of course, we won't know really anything for sure until the 12th.  But the but the rumor is that this face recognition will work at any angle.  So it's my guess that Apple wouldn't do this unless the face recognition was so good that it basically knows you're there.  Yeah.  So if it's under the table, it still sees you.  If it's on the table.  If you can see the phone, it can see you.  Right.  And if the facial recognition is fast, it will unlock the minute it sees you.  So my guess is that this that's how this will work.

Start time: 738.54
End time: 745.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I turned it off on this laptop.  It was the laptop Windows.  That's so bad.  It actually I just turned it off.  It's much faster to type in.

Start time: 745.82
End time: 771.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a question of how long before somebody breaks it, cracks it.  We mean with a photograph or something.  Yeah.  I mean, the Samsung Galaxy S8 face recognition was defeated by the Chaos Computer Club.  They showed how you could take a picture of somebody not with a telephoto.  And what they did, which was interesting, is they put they projected the picture onto a curved piece of paper to give it the Z axis to give it three dimensionality.  And that fooled the S8.

Start time: 771.56
End time: 775.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why can't it look for a blink or some kind of movement?  Sometimes that happens.

Start time: 776.48
End time: 809.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't you think Apple would not abandon the Touch ID, which, by the way, it's not merely unlocking the phone.  Their Apple Pay relies on this for security.  Their secure enclave needs to be unlocked by this.  This is a big deal to the point where if you get a third party to fix your iPhone in it, they immediately disable the Touch ID because they say, well, we can't be sure it's still secure.  So I don't think they replace this unless they have something that they feel very confident is as fast, if not faster.  And for that reason, I'm confident that they will recognize you as soon as you can see the phone.  It will see you.

Start time: 809.82
End time: 813.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then what about that issue if it's dark?  I mean, it will have infrared.

Start time: 813.54
End time: 818.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got IR.  Yeah, it'll have.  We know that, actually.  We think we know that.

Start time: 818.82
End time: 822.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Theoretically possible that it could still do Touch ID at some point through the screen.

Start time: 822.74
End time: 829.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the rumor was Apple was trying to get that to work and never did get it to work effectively.  It's a very, if you think about it, very difficult thing to do.  Why couldn't the camera do it?

Start time: 831.02
End time: 839.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's theoretically possible they could still have something like that.  But I think, yeah, I doubt they would release it unless it's actually a pretty good experience.

Start time: 840.45
End time: 855.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's bet is you will like face recognition so much.  It will be so good and so convenient that you will never again say, where's the fingerprint reader?  And it will make every other phone, including apparently there's 7S and there's 7S Plus, obsolete immediately.  And so you're going to spend $1,200 or whatever this thing's going to cost.

Start time: 856.54
End time: 857.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fingerprint readers have been around.

Start time: 858.74
End time: 917.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It also makes a lot of sense with ARKit.  I was really amazed with how little press this got coming out of the State of Union at WWDC this year.  You know, if Apple, like we're going to talk about later in the show, but they have some really, really fascinating ARKit demonstrations,  like things like virtual tape measures.  You can just move around.  So like Apple's iPhone having infrared built into it to specifically sense depth, that makes a lot of sense with, you know, ARKit, because that's the problem.  You could see it in the demo and the little Lego Batman mobile would stutter a little bit because it couldn't quite detect the depth as fast as it was moving.  So it makes sense as like a bigger move with Apple.  And I agree with you that I don't think they would bring it to their flagship product if it didn't work.  I just, you know, it's one of these things where we need to see it to evaluate it before we really believe in it.

End time: 920.50

Transcript:  Well, Phil, you were saying fingerprint has been around for a long time.

Start time: 920.62
End time: 928.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been around since the 90s and it always sucked until it came out on whatever, the iPhone 7 or something.  Touch ID. And then everybody followed.

Start time: 928.58
End time: 929.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's very good now on everything.

Start time: 930.04
End time: 942.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Face recognition has been around since the 90s and it's always sucked.  I had it on a ThinkPad back when that was still IBM and it was terrible.  And if Apple releases it, it's going to be the first time that it's going to be good and then it'll be good everywhere.

Start time: 942.78
End time: 951.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was always this, you know, the kind of the story about Apple.  You think that story is still true?  Yeah.  That they're still going to be if they do it, it'll be great.

Start time: 952.22
End time: 960.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think on like a mainstream product, it doesn't mean that they won't release like other products that may still not be great.  You don't miss your headphone jack?  No.

Start time: 963.92
End time: 983.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear from a lot of people who miss it.  I am not convinced that was a good idea.  Apple sold more iPhone 7 than any other iPhone.  AirPods are pretty great as headphones.  Yeah, but they're 159 bucks.  They're hard to get.  You can lose them.  You can lose them.  And I mean, it's not a substitute for a wired headphone.

Start time: 984.36
End time: 987.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The AirPods are going to seem like a bargain when you wind up paying 1200 bucks for the phone.

Start time: 991.76
End time: 994.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not saying they won't do it, but it seems crazy right now.

Start time: 995.40
End time: 1006.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wouldn't be a bad thing to have to give themselves the freedom to have a really high priced item that's not high priced because of gold or ceramic or something stupid, but actually high priced components.  That's what I've been saying.  That's why they keep the iPhone 7.  That's why they do the 7S.

Start time: 1006.74
End time: 1018.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I've been saying Apple should do is say, look, price isn't even a consideration.  We're just going to make the best phone we can make and we'll charge you a fair price for it based on what it costs.  It's a Tesla strategy.  Yeah.

Start time: 1019.72
End time: 1021.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Tesla master plan.  It was actually the Mac strategy.

Start time: 1021.56
End time: 1045.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Steve Jobs said when the Mac came out.  You know, people criticize.  In fact, wasn't it Wozniak or somebody?  No, it was a Jeff Raskin who was the late Jeff Raskin criticized.  He wanted to make it cheaper.  The Mac was originally his idea.  It was a people's conclusion.  I remember Jobs saying, look, you know, we have BMWs and Mercedes and then we've got Pintos and Novas and there's different market segments.  He wanted to be in the BMW business.

Start time: 1045.50
End time: 1069.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think this is different.  This is Tesla.  Like Mercedes is a luxury brand.  Yeah.  The Tesla explicit world domination plan is you're going to make something expensive because that's where that's how you get the freedom to put in the technology that you want.  Right.  And then you're relentlessly going to make new products using those technologies that drive the price down and increase the experience.  So Model 3 is probably a better car than the Model S at one third the price.

Start time: 1069.50
End time: 1082.24

Transcript:  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I was just going to ask you how much your husband would pay.  My husband would pay nothing.  He keeps the same phone until he drops it or breaks it or it runs out of space.  He's not the market.  It's a new one.  He's not.  You know, he's you know, Frank takes out the garbage and I take care of our tech needs.  So how much would you pay?  I mean, I'm going to get the best model.  You know, something for me is I have the six, I have the six, the seven plus.  And, you know, I use it as my main campaign device and it's on so much time resting on my finger, you know, this pinky finger down there that you do end up getting like hand cramps from using it that much.  So if it's a fraction of a, you know, an ounce lighter, that's something that's really going to increase usability for me.  Yeah, I was also really interested in the jet black iPhone.  It didn't bother me that it scratched a bit because I think that's the life of a phone.  You know, I really love that material and the shine.  So I personally don't have a problem paying more for it, but it's hard to not have a bit of a cynical attitude about it because Apple's best quarter really hasn't been repeated since, you know, they released the iPhone in China and really had that just explosion in sales.  And I think they've, you know, got to find a place where they can get a lot of profitability again.

Transcript:  You know, in almost every product line there, there is this law of this marginal return.  So I'm a bike bicycle guy and I know that I don't even bought a bike lately.  Now I think they like cows, 10 grand for the really good bikes.  But when I the last time I bought a bike, you could buy a crappy bike for two hundred dollars, a decent bike for five hundred dollars, a good bike for a thousand dollars.  And then about fifteen hundred dollars, you could buy a really good bike.  Still not a great, great, great.  And so I went, you know, towards I think I spent fifteen hundred dollars in back.  That's probably about a three thousand dollar bike today.  But my point is that that it's what you get for that is marginally marginally better than what you get for the one that's quite a bit less expensive.  And that's true with cameras. It's true with cars, almost every product line.  Yeah. But I could easily see why somebody like Brianna, who is using that iPhone, it's her lifeline.  It's I mean, when you think about what you're getting at, percent more for it over a period of two years.  For something that you're using many hours a day.

But and yet it's I think it has something to do with size, too.  If you spend two thousand dollars on a desktop computer, that doesn't feel outrageous.  Yeah.  But you spend two thousand dollars on something this small.  It's like, what? That seems a little expensive.  But it isn't. If you think about it, I don't think I agree with you, Brianna.  I got the jet black and I'm a sucker.  I feel a little bit like a sucker, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, here's a different way of thinking about it.  What if it was five thousand dollars? But it was too much.  Well, but it is too much. But what if it was five grand?  But it was the kind of product where somebody who wanted to pay five grand would be like amazingly happy to have.  Right. Rather than. And then and then they can work down that same functionality and they could work it in subsequent months and subsequent years into more accessible products.  It's not going to be five grand. It's probably going to be a thousand or twelve hundred.  But this idea that like let's let's make something that lets us innovate that actually is at a price point where you can work on technology and the people who are happy to pay it pay it.  Right. I think that's great.  I'm like the cell phone industry has been kind of in a rut with hardware.  There's been only incremental improvements.  I think it would really help the entire industry if Apple were to take a pretty big jump.  Say this is a thousand dollars, twelve hundred bucks.  A lot of people are going to complain.  That's fine. That's not the only phone they have.  But actually make a product that people who can't afford to pay it are happy to do it and then have everyone benefit in the sub.

I call them the friend of mine and I have this thing we call the hot dog version.  It's one with everything.  So when the new Mac came out, got the hot dog edition, one with everything about three grand.  I used my MacBook three or four times a week.  I use my iPhone 30 times a day.  I'd pay as much for a really great iPhone as I would for a MacBook.  Yeah, I would.  Like if there was a product that they would sell me, I would pay it.  Now, it would have to be worth it.  It would have to have holographic.  I do think a difference is I don't know what it would have to have.  But if they gave they came out with something, I would pay that much.

Don't regret it at all.  It's been a great video machine.  I've done 3D work on it.  I've done unreal.  It's amazing.  But the difference is, you know, if that MacBook gets a little scratched up on  the outside, it doesn't affect its use.  I don't think I'm the only person that can't go like more than a year tops  without getting a scratch in my phone screen.  So I think that that's a really big difference.  So if they charge that much more, you know, I don't have a problem with it.  And I've definitely this last time I tried getting the version with the most,  you know, storage possible.  And I really, really enjoyed that freedom.  And I'm going to do it again.  But I think the difference is if you really use an iPhone day to day, I don't  think they can last like more than a year or two tops before they get damaged.  So you have to figure that out.

An iPhone that did everything this new imaginary god phone could do for twenty dollars as you can with a watch, by the way.  You can buy a Timex. It works just great.  It works just fine. So that would be a big deal.  Then you'd say Apple's charging a premium because of the brand, because the name, because of styling, not because of product.  But this is technologically and it will it remains to be seen, but presumably technologically going to be an advance.  It's hard to imagine what kind of advance you could do in this era of peak smartphone.  It would be that much better, though.  Maybe is it a camera? Is it augmented reality? Is it?

Transcript:  And that's true. I think what I think what people really want to see from Apple is a battery that will charge faster.  I think it's so interesting what anchor is doing with their battery products.  You know, I bought a host of them lately and you can plug your iPhone into their official.  They've got some name for it. IQ three or whatever.  But it does charge much faster because they figured out that the charging tech,  they can't change batteries because you can't cram more electrons in there, but they can make it charge faster.  I think that's the biggest pain point that everyone has right now.  Like the screen is solid. It's fast enough. The camera is amazing.  I love the depth, you know, for my iPhone seven plus.  I think that's amazing. What I want to see them do is to really solve this battery charging thing.  And you can do it from two ways.  Like, you know, I've seen experimental materials at MIT.  They're both superconductive and super capacitive at the same time.  So like if you can make the battery charge instantly, you know, then you can get by with not having as large a reservoir.

In 1984, when they came out with the Mac, partly because of Jeff Raskin, they had a very well defined philosophy of user interface that informed everything.  They told every developer, this is how you do it. They published a book of it.  I would completely disagree. In the iPhone case, every app has a different UI.  Where are the settings in an app? It could be anywhere. Where's the back button? There is none.  How often do you exit an app on an iPhone app by pressing the home button because you can't figure out how the hell to get back to the previous page?  And you know what drives me crazy?  It happens to be every day.  To add to that.  That's a terrible user interface.

I remember this example.  This was a few years ago.  I remember the first time that I got a modern MacBook.  It's probably, I don't know, 10 years ago.  And I plugged some USB thing into it.  Like a presentation remote or something.  I plugged some USB thing into it.  And I had this experience where it didn't do anything.  And I was like, wait, it's not doing anything.  But then I actually used it and it worked.  And I had this shocking revelation that the Apple design philosophy was like, when you plug something into the USB port,  it's supposed to just work.  If you plug something into a Windows computer's USB port, especially like 8 or 9 years ago when this happened,  you would get a whole, even when it worked, it would be like,  I detected that you plugged in something into the USB port.  Now I'm a Sony driver. Now success.  That was 8 or 9 years ago.  And that philosophy is carried through.  Look at the AirPods right now compared to any other wireless headset.  It's just good usability.

Transcript:  I think that's generally true.  But I think that I had a really interesting experience with my company back before I was running for Congress.  This is about a year ago.  We were really, really sitting down prototyping AR and VR apps.  We were trying to make emotional sensing APIs.  And yeah, it's really cool stuff like figuring out what your voice engine nations were.  We're trying to signal to people where you looked, what that was trying to signal.  Tons of interesting research out there for it.  And I had the experience, I had not built a Windows machine since the 90s when I was in high school.  And we did. We built it.  We started working with Windows 10.  And I rock it on Relay.  We are all Apple fans.  I love Apple. I mostly use Apple.

Transcript:  But my point is, I think that if you're really in the Apple ecosystem,  you kind of don't notice that when you start a new iPhone, like from scratch,  that now it has like 20 modal dialogues that you have to go through instead of like 10.  You have to enter your password.  A hundred times. Over and over.  And I do think that it's better than anyone else,  but I think it's closer than I think us Apple fans like to give credit for sometimes, in my opinion.

And I've never really been a fan of Windows and Windows 10,  which is admittedly the best Windows in a long time.  I just use Linux everywhere. And actually I buy a Windows machine, I put Linux on it and I'm happy.  It's Linux. Well, I shouldn't. People are going to think I'm insane if I say this,  but I do think Linux is the easiest to use. So there I said it.  And actually what that only proves, Phil, is that you think whatever you use day in day out is the easiest to use.  Right.  Really.  Yeah, that's true.  None of it's easy. Technology is not easy to use.  Well, if you use day in day out, it is easy.  Ask Frank. Technology is not easy to use. Right?  Frank's out there emptying the trash. He says, I forget it.

I think the other really big skills, I think we need engineers in Congress.  I think we need people that will think about problems holistically, will not treat it like you're arguing for a side.  And we'll just look at all the options on the table.  Anyone that's worked on a dev team knows that you have to really think outside the box sometimes to ship a product.

Traditionally, I try to get tech journalists on.  But I have to say, and usually I avoid the entrepreneurs and the CEOs.  Me too.  Because most of them are mealy-mouthed, especially when they're running a company.  The last thing you're going to ask them is, you know, I mean, you're not going to go to a CEO and say, well, tell us about your company.  You're not going to get an ad, right? But you're great.  You're great. You really and because of all your experience with product design, I think your insights are very, very much appreciated.  Thank you. Very kind of you. Thank you.

Oh, and when I say that, I want that Geeks go, oh, you know, the funny thing is there's nothing in the place that goes faster than a gigabit.  You know, all our all our.

Transcript:  Maybe you can get Sonic at your house in if you live in San Francisco.  I don't know.  Move East Bay, North Bay.  Sonic is the best internet service provider, not because you're going to get 10 gigabit, but they do offer.  What did I tell you?  The gigabit internet that includes 15 email accounts, 15, a gigabyte, by the way, properly configured email accounts, a gigabyte of storage.  You get a new domain name and personal web hosting.  You get fax line service. You get home phone service.  You can port your phone number to because it's real phone service, unlimited local and long distance.  You get all of that for forty dollars a month.  But one of the reasons I love now, I know most of you listening can't get this, so it's just making you crazy.  One of the reasons I love this and I love to talk about it is it shows that what these other guys are charging you for service that's not as good is really a rip off.  It is possible to have it be a profitable company to give you this kind of service to stand up for your rights.  There are no bandwidth caps.  They fight government subpoenas and orders.  They provide local support, private browsing, friendly support, uncapped bandwidth and a great price.  And they make a profit.  So it is possible.  And I think that this is really if you go to EFF's ratings of Internet Service providers, go a green checkbox is all the way across.  It's one of the few.  Here's what you do. Go to sonic.com.  S O N I C dot com slash twit and enter your address.  See if you can get it.  If you can get it, get your first month free and phone service plus bundle it with this.  You'll get one hundred twenty dollars on your Sonic bill.  S O N I C sonic dot com slash twit.  I know for most of you going there is going to be depressing.  It's checking me right now.

Everybody makes 4K now.  Google's Chromecast does 4K.  TiVo does 4K.  My Android TV, my Nvidia Shield.  Everybody does 4K.  Apple was one of the last remaining devices.

And I have to say, bigger, more importantly than the resolution is HDR, high dynamic  range.  That you'll see more of because if you're at more than a few feet away from a 4K TV,  it's not going to look that different because you can't see the dots either way with HD  or UHD.  But you will definitely notice the broader dynamic range of HDR.  So if you can get it, do.

And this is the really cool thing.  So if I go to the news section, all four of these are live.  And so is the sports.  So if I'm trying to figure out what I want to watch,  if I'm watching live channels, they'll actually show it live.  That's pretty cool.  That's cool.  YouTube, this is the best UI I've seen for TV.  But if you're not in the right markets,  there's a limited number of markets that have live and live locals and all of that stuff.  It also has a DVR built in.  And you can have multiple users with independent DVRs on the same account.  So I can record different shows than Phil.  Because Phil does all those cartoon land stuff.  He does. He loves that.

It's a really, really good workout gadget to give you heart rate and feedback information.  But it's like the interface on it is just this big rat's nest of apps.

And there are companies who have tried and failed.  There's a book called The Pursuit of Non-Invasive Glucose Hunting the Deceitful Turkey.  It was hard to send up a rocket and have it land back down.

It's when someone actually gets AR in a form factor that's not much bigger than glasses.  Also very hard to do.  That's going to be amazing.  And non-invasive real-time glucose monitoring.

I think, Phil, I've got to say the reason Apple's doing that is merely because they  want you to stream Apple music on your watch.  Seriously.  What a waste.  A lot of what Apple does is about boosting Apple music.  Why is Apple spending a billion dollars on original content, original television content?  Because it will boost Apple music.

Transcript:  It's built into my Audi TT right now.  But my point is, I think if you look at Siri and where it was when it came out, I really would have thought that it would be more evolved by this point.  I don't think it's as intelligent as we need it to be.  I think that it still goofs up questions a lot more than it should to truly be usable.  And I was thinking about this the other day.  I've never once used Siri on my Mac.  And that was one of the really big features for this last release of Mac OS.  So I do think that maybe it's time for some new leadership there.  I'm annoyed.  Siri's a good product.

I have an echo in my kitchen, an echo in my living room, and there's no real wall between them.  They both respond.  Well, but I had to.  So one of them responds to a different word.  To Amazon.  I'll say Amazon.  Because everybody.  And the other one responds to that other word that I won't say.  I had my own echo.  I had my own echo.

Cashmere Hill wrote a scathing article.  And I want to know, get what your guys take on this, because this is quite an accusation  that Cashmere Hill made.  And it's on the heels of another accusation about Google quashing ideas and stories it  doesn't like.  But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about Stamps.com.  You've got to start using your time more effectively.  If you're going to the post office, if you're finding parking and getting in line to do  simple things like buy stamps or charge up a postage meter or drop off packages, stop  it.  If you're doing mail, you need Stamps.com.  It brings all the services of the U.S. Postal Service to your desk.  And you'll never need to go to the post office again.  You can buy and print U.S. postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.  You don't need a meter at all.  Your computer and your printer, that's all you need.  It'll print right on envelopes.  It'll print your logo and your return address.  It'll automatically get the recipient's address from the website.  If you're an eBay or Etsy or Amazon seller, you're going to love this.  Plus, it just makes your mail look more professional and it saves you money because you never have  to guess on the postage.

Transcript:  No, in fact, this is actually something the US government started a long time ago.  It's called Indissia.  It's a QR code.  And one of the reasons this is Postal Service loves this because all your mail is automatically machine sorted.  Everything is, they've got a barcode under the address.  It's all done automatically by machines.  They don't have to have humans, so it saves them money.  And the Indissia has your account information in it.  So, yes.  So for instance, if you go to the post office, if you want to, like if I tried to mail packages more than a pound from the box,  they'd send it, no you can't because it could be a bomb or something.  I don't know.  But since 9-11, you have to bring it in and show your face, but not with stamps.com because of the Indissia.  They know who you are.

Transcript:  Look it up.  That's our title for the show, I think.  Moving at the speed of paper.  Stand back.  But you have some time.  You don't have to stand back right away.  You have a minute or two before.  All right.  So we talked, I think it was last week we talked about the story.  I think maybe hard to know the truth of it.  The New York Times had a story about a foundation that Eric Schmidt had given a lot of money to.  Google had given a lot of money to.  The foundation created a report that criticized, that actually supported the EU's anti-monopoly claims against Google.  At some point, for reasons unknown, the foundation decided to sever its ties with the guy who created that report and his group.  And now, this is the article, I criticized Google, it got me fired, here's how corporate power works.  Kashmir Hill, a little bit of a pile on, tells a story that frankly is even a little more scary in her Gizmodo article.  Yes, Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like.  I know because it happened to me.  So this is kind of following on the heels of the New America Foundation story.  She wrote a story, she was working for Forbes.  She says, I was new at my job.  I ran social media.  So because I was not only a reporter but ran social media, I pulled into a meeting with the Google salespeople about Google Plus.  This was when it was just starting out.  The salespeople were trying to get Forbes to add a plus one button.  You know there's a Facebook like button and there's a plus one button to their articles alongside the Facebook like and the Reddit share button.  They said you had to do this.  It's important to do because the plus recommendations would be a factor in search results, a crucial source of traffic to publishers.  So she's wearing two hats.  Maybe this is part of the problem.  She said, this sounded like a news story to me.  That in fact Google was saying your search results will be better if you use our plus one button, which is a news story.  So she asked the Google people, did I hear correctly?  If a publisher doesn't put a plus one on the page, search results would suffer.  The salespeople in the meeting said yes, but they're salespeople.  So she did the right thing.  She went to public relations.  She said, I'm a reporter.  Here's what I heard in a meeting.  Did I understand correctly?  The press office confirmed it.  They preferred to say the plus button quote influences the ranking, but they did not deny what the salespeople told me.  If you don't feature the plus one button, your stories will be harder to find on Google.  So she published a story.  Stick Google plus buttons on your pages or your search traffic suffers.  She got called in the carpet.  Her boss said, wait a minute, that was an NDA meeting.  You're not allowed to write about her boss at Forbes or both.  Google flipped out.  This was in 2011.  They didn't challenge the accuracy of the reporting, but they called and said you have to unpublish the story because the meeting was confidential.  And the information discussed there had been subject to a nondisclosure.  She hadn't signed the meeting, the NDA.  She hadn't been told the meeting was confidential.  And she at the meeting said, I'm a reporter.  She said, I was told, and this is the point you were asking, I was told by my higher ups at Forbes that Google representatives called them saying the article was confidential.  I was called them saying the article was problematic and had to come down.  It might have consequences for Forbes.  She said, I thought it was an important story, but I didn't want to cause problems for Forbes.  And I think, by the way, her boss is coming to her is in effect putting pressure on her, whether they said take it down or not.  You know, that's putting pressure.  It's going to hurt us.  So given that I've gone to the PR team and it was already out in the world, I felt it made more sense to keep the story up.  But after continued pressure from my bosses, I took the piece down.  Kashmir Hale, who's very respected, said, a decision I will always regret.  Forbes declined comment about this, I presume, currently when she contacted them.  But the most disturbing part of the experience, what came next?  That story disappeared from Google's search results.  You couldn't find that story.  If you search for it today, you won't find it.  The story came down?  The story came down, but more importantly, Google scrubbed the search results.  Well, why wouldn't they find the search results?  No, no, no, you should still have a reference to that, even if the story isn't there anymore, right?

Start time: 4675.82
End time: 4696.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She says it was unusual websites captured by Google's crawling to not tend to manage that quickly.  She felt that that was evidence that they had manipulated search results to eliminate references to a story they didn't like.  To me, that's not so much the issue as Google saying, take that story down.

Start time: 4697.92
End time: 4721.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, part of the question also, if she was in a meeting, it should have been clear one way or the other if she was under a non-disclosure.  By the way, I will disclose right now, Google supports my nonprofit and I write for Forbes.  So I'm in a funny position on this one.  And so I go into meetings all the time with Google under NDA, but I always make it very clear, am I under NDA?  And if I am, I am. If I'm not, I'm not.  This is always challenging.

Start time: 4721.88
End time: 4740.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I refuse to sign NDAs or embargoes of any kind, partly because I have a leaky memory and I'm talking all the time.  So I prefer not to be encumbered by that.  But if I went to a meeting unwittingly that there was an NDA on and then was then asked to not report it,  that would be a problem.

End time: 4805.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the NDA is not the big issue here.  We've got to unpack the issue.  So there's the issue of whether or not it's a good thing or not or legal or not.  If it's literally true that adding the plus one button, that not adding it would hurt your search results, right?  There's the actual facts of the story and whether or not that's problematic.  I'm not sure whether it is or not.  Then there's this sort of general nonsense about NDAs, which if you go to a meeting at almost any of these companies' offices,  you're signing NDAs just to get in the building.  Most of those sign-in things are NDAs.  And the journalists are that meaningless thing.  It's all meaningless.  NDAs in general are bullish.  But the story is, is it okay for Google, which is a private company, to say,  hey, we're rolling out this product and using it is going to help your search results?  There's a second piece, which is it okay for a reporter to write that in the negative?  There's a third piece, which is it okay for her to be pressured to remove it?  I mean, those are all the topics.  The NDA is the least interesting part of this for me.

Start time: 4806.18
End time: 4814.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the only part that I find interesting is whether or not she, this discrepancy,  whether she thought she was under NDA was.  But you're right.  I mean, these other issues are just as troubling.

Start time: 4814.52
End time: 4908.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she did get a communication.  This was added to the article after the fact from Google's vice president of global communications, Rob Shilkin,  who said very clearly we had nothing to do with removing the article from the cache.  That did not happen.  And there's no evidence that that did happen.  Just, you know, anecdotal reporting that it might have happened.  And I thought he wrote a good article.  He said, from our perspective, I have a good note to Kashmir in which he said,  we've enjoyed working respectfully with you and are sad to hear you've carried this since 2011,  which I think is a good way to start.  From our perspective, this was a disagreement over whether the meeting was held under nondisclosure.  We thought you had been told that had we known you hadn't been told that we would, of course,  have mentioned that because, like most of our client meetings that discuss new features,  this is a nondisclosed, you know, we don't want reporters to hear this.  This is a client meeting.  Which makes sense.  Your editor agreed.  He told our PR rep the article is being removed because it involved reporting on an NDA meeting.  He says, as for the Google cache, it's easy for a website owner to request the cache be cleared.  It's very possible that the editor merely put in a request.  It gets automated, by the way, on the Google tools, Webmaster tools.  But he said, we had nothing to do with removing it.  Maybe your editor did.  And so this was actually a very conciliatory letter from Rob.  I have to say, just like the previous story from the New York Times, there is no smoking gun.  It's very much circumstantial that something might have happened.  So the headline...

Start time: 4908.72
End time: 5031.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like she was very clear in her piece, too, saying, like, look, I can't definitively know this.  This is what I can find from what I know.  So I think rather than get into what exactly the situation was, you know, like, Leo, you've run an independent media company.  And I think that you probably have very strong feelings about there essentially being a duopoly on how news articles get spread in 2017.  You have Facebook and you have like Google results.  And that is such a critical component of any media organization getting things out there that I think that's really worth thinking about.  I also, you know, I know so many Google engineers.  I know the Google engineers I know are genuinely socially conscious.  They are genuinely people that want to make the world better with the tools that they have.  And I kind of, you know, like my gut goes off a little bit with like insinuating that the work that, you know, they're doing is evil.  You know, like Tim Cook, even last week came out with a very thoughtful piece from a reporter that ran into him over breakfast.  And Tim Cook was talking about how, you know, a government being able to tackle fewer and fewer things, you know, from his perspective,  corporate leaders had more of a role to step up and help serve the public good.  Completely agree with that.  Yeah, there are a lot of people at Google that genuinely think like that and want to do the right thing.  But I do think it's very concerning when you essentially have two media companies having a duopoly on how news is spread.  And for me, like I think if I had to write companies down to good guys and bad guys, I think overall Google would be probably my good guy category.  I think they do a lot of really important work.  But I do think this is something we should really think carefully about as a society.

Transcript:  The power issue is concerning me, right?  So, I mean, as I mentioned before, Google is a supporter of my nonprofit.  And I will tell you, they've been good and I don't agree with them on everything.  I've criticized them publicly.  I do worry about the amount of power that Google has.  I worry about the amount of information they have.  Not so much that they're going to do evil with it right now, but the fact that this information is being warehoused.  I worry about a future leader in our country, you know, a government, whether it's ours or someone else's, getting into that data, whether legally or illegally and abusing it.  But at the same time, Google has been very good about funding my nonprofit and not getting all upset every time I say something critical.  And same thing with Facebook.  It's really hard because I like you.  You take ads from some of these companies, right?

Start time: 5077.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we try not to take ads from a couple of them.  Yeah.  Microsoft, Apple and Google.  Do you cover them too much?  Yeah, it would be difficult.  But at the same time, you know, we also have to assert we take ads from a lot of companies we cover and we have to assert that there is a wall between editorial and advertising.  There has to be.  And have you ever gotten pressure?

Transcript:  I mean, this is straight forward for me.  I think unambiguously the world is better off because Google exists in it.  Absolutely.  Doesn't mean that it's a perfect company.  Doesn't mean that there's not examples of it, of people in Google or even the company itself acting poorly.  But to me, there's not even close to a difficult decision.  Like, of course, the world is much better right now because Google is in it and because Apple is in it and because Facebook is in it for all the flaws of the companies.

Start time: 5129.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wouldn't the world be a better place if Google just stuck to search and didn't have a content arm with YouTube and didn't have a shopping arm and didn't.  In other words, I would love Google.  I've always thought this, that Google.  Look, I agree.  I have friends at Google.  I am very impressed by the Google ethics.  But I think they do believe don't be evil.  But I think Google would we would be better off if Google didn't have its fingers in so many.  If they were just a search engine and did everything they could to be the best search engine possible, we would still get the benefit.  All that benefit that you're talking about without these concerns.  What about Android?

Start time: 5167.23
End time: 5184.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Android should be separate.  YouTube is awesome.  And I'm glad I think the world is better off because we have YouTube.  But I don't think it should be owned by Google.  And second of all, that money that they make with search is helping to fund Waymo, which is their automatic driverless car company, which is going to save lives.

Start time: 5184.62
End time: 5215.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I don't get a vote and have what Google owns or doesn't know.  Right. But I'm just saying.  I'm just I am pointing out that some of the problems we run into with Google come from the fact that it does have so many fingers and so many pies.  And as a result, the power, the awesome power of its search engine, there's a huge risk here it can be misused because of these other businesses.  So that's and look, they're going to do what they're going to do, which is maximize profit.  That's what all American corporations do.  Right.  And that means owning YouTube.  I think the Android and start in Waymo.

He's the director of the Wall Street Journal is always making fun of me because he's an Android phone because he thinks that I'm basically giving away my privacy and somehow thinks that because he owns an iPhone, he's not.  And there may be some truth to that.  Apple and Google have a different business model.  But that does give me some some cause of concern.  Me too.  The amount of information is one company has simply because I walk around with this thing.  So that's another reason why we need to be there.

Transcript:  There's no accident that these two articles appeared this week.  I think people are more and more aware of the fact that Google, because it is it has tendrils in everything we do and and partly because it's so vastly useful, knows a whole lot about us, has a massive database of information.  Massive database.  And we're starting to understand what big data can mean.

Start time: 5263.03
End time: 5278.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the articles did appear right.  And everyone's talking about them.  These I know that's good.  Right.  And like this, this is the check.  It's just not.  There needs to be a check of the top 20 problems or dangers in the world.  Google potentially suppressing search results, which they probably didn't do about.

Start time: 5279.91
End time: 5333.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but it's a symptom.  And I agree.  I agree with you.  It's not a massive, you know, moral risk.  However, there is a massive moral risk because of this database, because of what Google knows.  At some point that it could be vast.  Why really misused?  This is the least of it.  Pressuring journalists not to run articles is the least of it.  But the point is, the articles, especially this foundation study, are really about this monopoly.  And I think I think that there's probably some evidence, whether conscious or unconscious, Google would like to suppress the conversation about.  Are you too powerful? Right.  I mean, that's what's happening in the U.S.  It's got to be scary for them.  Facebook has the same issue.  Frankly, Amazon is going to have this issue any day now.  If it isn't already, it's got its fingers in every economic transaction we make practically.  The new monopoly is definitely data.

Start time: 5333.54
End time: 5357.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So access to data, access to APIs is definitely a new monopoly.  And the way to cure it is to is to democratize access.  It's a completely already lost game to try to limit to try to limit the data.  Like you're never going to be able to keep things secret.  You're never going to be able to prevent everyone from finding out about stuff.  The only thing we can do is make sure that no company has a monopoly on it, that the data is as freely available as possible.

Start time: 5357.66
End time: 5360.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 5405.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  I don't think I think I do.  I do.  I think they definitely have some advantages.  But I think that I think there's tons of startups, there's tons of companies that can do meaningful things, that can put that can create good products, that can put pressure on Google and Facebook and all the other companies that have a lot of data to make that accessible.  I think the next generation in anti-monopoly legislation, you know, when you get to Congress, like the next the next version of anti-monopoly, anti-trust legislation should have nothing to do with the ownership of companies.  Companies in general are increasingly archaic.  It has to do with access to data.  So we'll see anti-trust laws that guarantee data access.  And we should.

Start time: 5406.60
End time: 5490.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would agree with that.  But, you know, like, so you're talking about like a check on the power here.  For me, you know, like I'm on the show today and like you're talking about Sonic is an ISP provider and Leo Handigot, I'm seeing her going, can I talk about Verizon and how much money they give to members of Congress to basically, you know, buy certain policies on these committees?  So if you want to talk about a check and a balance, it is factual.  If you look at the 15 people on the House subcommittee, that effectively sets technology policy in the United States, you know, the big telecom companies give them a lot of money.  And that is just a mathematical fact.  Yeah, I think that weakens that check.  So I agree with you.  And I think that if Google, you know, like we made a decision with AT&T when I was a teenager to allow other people access to that infrastructure, if they paid for it.  I think that it overall, I think it was a good move.  I can see us doing something like that with Google to democratize this information.  But my concern is right now you have some very powerful technology companies that have basically bought the legislation that they want.  And I don't believe our current representation in Congress is able to provide a competent check on these business practices.

And, you know, the way we got to this point with the do nothing Congress is because the worst people are the ones out there engaging in the system.  So I think you're right.  And something I ask myself every single day doing this is how the frack I can do this job and keep my integrity and keep like the core of who I am.  Because it's I tell you, until you do this, until you spend the entire day on the phone fundraising, until you have like powerful business interests calling you, it's also don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I kind of think that there's really very little evidence that the amount of money raises directly correlated to the success.  I think there's been a lot of a lot of very expensive elections lost.  I think this is just like I I don't know exactly what why you need that much money, what you would spend it on.  I think having a good message, using the current platforms to make sure that everyone hears it, connecting at a level like it may be there.

The last thing I want to do is tie their level of innovation and improvement to the world to the to the lowest common denominator, which is our government.  No, I agree.  A hundred percent. Just because current Congress can't do anything doesn't mean that we should get companies to stop actually building the world.

Transcript:  It's not a text story, but gerrymandering is a huge problem in this country.  I'm very curious what your experience is going to be, Brianna, when you do get elected.  You have an experience now.  Wait till you go into Congress and you're dealing with those members of Congress in gerrymandered districts that are locked for them as long as they can beat the beat the lowest common denominator in the primary.  And that changes the equation 100 percent.  And I think that's one of the reasons we have such a terrible Congress is that Congress got to decide the the the electoral district, electoral districts.  They were the ones who got to that's that's insane.  When it's the states to do that.  I mean, the state. Well, it's legislators and parties, essentially.  Yeah, let's be honest.

Both parties have like separated up the country into their little fiefdoms and only if I'm remembering correctly, it's five to 10 percent of races are classified as competitive in any given election.  That is a broken system.  Like we are all in technology.  We believe in competition.  We believe in the best idea winning.  They've raked the game.  And I think you're dead on that we've got to have campaign financial reform or nothing is going to substantively get better with our technology policy.

Transcript:  That's why that Tim Cook interview was very interesting.  I agree with you, Phil.  I think it's you know, it's absolutely the case that the risk of overreacting to the kinds of pressures Google can can can offer or the privacy invasions that Google can offer is that we will eschew technology will go backwards out of Jeff Jarvis calls a techno panic to a worse place to a worse place.  So I agree with you.  There's this is a balance.  We do want some controls on this stuff.  But we don't want to do it to the point when people say, oh, don't use Android because it's not safe.  My reaction is, well, I don't want to step backwards in technology just because of some imagined harm that could be occurring.  And I think that that's really always a risk as well as people overreact and hold us back.

Transcript:  It just does.  I do think that part of Donald Trump's success during the campaign was the fact that he complained and belittled so many things that were happening,  some of which probably needed belittling, but a lot of it didn't need belittling.  Somebody in the chat room just asked, you know, what happened to the vast election fraud?  I mean, you know, he belittled the entire electoral system and yet was able to game it.

Transcript:  I think there's an experience that I think almost all smart people have.  I'm sure like I'm sure pretty much everyone here has had this at some point.  You guys probably remember when you first had it.  There's this experience that like I think I remember I had it probably in college where I call it the there are no adults realization.  Yeah.  At some point you realize like, oh, yeah, like you go from thinking, well, I'm just a kid and there's all these other magical beings called adults and they know what they're doing and they're kind of taking care of things.  And then at some point you kind of say, wow, no one knows what they're doing.  Like it's just people like us.  There are no adults.  There's a great Steve Jobs quote.  That's what the world is going through right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is happening like at a national level.  It's happening.  It's just happening all over the world.  The best thing to come out of the Trump presidency is going to be this realization that there are no adults like Obama is not around to magically do stuff for everyone.  You have to do it yourself.  You have to do it yourself.  That means for companies, for voters, for individuals, for politicians, regardless of like what your political affiliation is, like this is the no adults realization that the entire world is going through.  Yeah.  And it's a little bit unsettling, but I think ultimately it's a really positive thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, though, like because it's so hard sometimes to have an adult conversation when you're running for Congress.  I'll give you an example.  Today, a story came out with Harvey that Texas has 20 billion dollars in the bank and they are passing on funding any of their own reconstruction,  which means states like Massachusetts and California and New York are going to pay to rebuild the state.  That's pretty well off.  I feel like that is a little bit hypocritical.  I was trying to talk about that on Twitter and you just get chewed out if you try to have a nuanced adult conversation.  And, you know, it's it's incredibly challenging because you want to be genuine to your to yourself and to your constituents.  But I feel like it's hard in this climate that it's harder than it's ever been to have an honest discussion about problems.  Because like as someone running for office, I can't have as an honest discussion with the public sometimes as I can with, say,  my engineering team about memory constraints with, you know, shipping.

Transcript:  That's true. Engineers for every engineers is true and false.  There's fact or fiction. And if you're an engineer, you have to deal in truths.  Otherwise, the bridge will fall down.  There's just no middle ground.  And yet people, I think we can't really blame politicians for lying to us because we beg them to lie to us.  We want them to lie to us.  And if you're a politician and I'd be very interested, Brianna, in what ends up happening, there is intense pressure, I'm sure, to misrepresent or at least to oversimplify the challenges.

I set up my first WordPress site on my own server, mind you, in the 2000s and ran it for a long time.  I found that it was a lot of work to keep my WordPress site running.  That's when I went to WordPress.com. Let them do the hosting. Let them do the updates.  And man, I love it.  WordPress.com runs the same software, some of the same guys who gave you WordPress, which runs 28% of all the websites in the world.  In fact, the WordPress.com VIP program has some of the best publications in the world. Quartz is built on WordPress.  It's really amazing what you can do with WordPress.  And if you're a business and you don't have a website, do you really want Yelp to be the first thing people find when they Google your company's name?  I don't think so. I think it's a bad idea.  That's why you ought to make your own website.  And I know why you didn't because you don't want to be a webmaster. You don't want to get in all that.  But this is easy. All you do is you go to WordPress.com, pick a template, hundreds of designs to choose from, and start typing.  You'll get built-in search engine optimization. You'll get social sharing.  The WordPress.com community is vast. You'll get a lot of favorites and likes from there and a lot of publicity.  Plus, of course, expert-friendly support available seven days a week. They are the best.  See what 28% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress, the web's most popular and most powerful site building platform.  Go visit my site, leolaport.com.

We knew the candidates were Jeff Immelt, former CEO of GE, Meg Whitman, actually current CEO of HP, former CEO of eBay.  HP Enterprise, I think.  And a third, according to Kara Swisher, unnamed source. Well, guess who won?  The third unnamed CEO who turns out to be, I think by all accounts, exactly the right person for the job.  His name is Dhera Khoswashahi. He was at Expedia.  And if you read Ben Thompson's really excellent analysis on Strotecary, what he did at Expedia, which is essentially turned the company around from the ground up,  not just adding a slap of coat of paint on it, but really redesigning its business model.  Do you have any experience of Dara? Do you know Dara, Phil?

Start time: 6589.88
End time: 6609.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do know Dara, yeah. Not super well, but I've met him a few times.  What do you think?  I think he's great. He's a really good candidate. I'm hopeful that, I think Uber is one of the most important companies in the world,  and I'm hoping that this means that things turn around for them.  We also know Travis, so in all fairness, I know both of them.

Start time: 6609.62
End time: 6632.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course there's a lawsuit still going on, and there's all, I mean it's still kind of a mess.  Some people are blaming the board at Uber. You've dealt with a board.  Tell us first of all a little bit about the responsibility of a board of directors for a company, not a public company,  but a soon to be public company like Uber, and certainly a unicorn like Uber. What is their job?

Start time: 6633.50
End time: 6651.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The responsibility doesn't really change that much if you're private or public.  It's to oversee the governance of the company to make sure that...  You boss the boss.  You decide who the boss should be. I think ultimately the only real job of the board is to figure out who's running the company.  Everything else is sort of...

Start time: 6651.72
End time: 6653.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You advise the CEO?

Start time: 6654.53
End time: 6661.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's sort of a secondary thing. So I think the first thing is you decide who the CEO should be,  and then the secondary thing you advise to the extent that's necessary.

Start time: 6662.86
End time: 6676.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things Kostrashahi did apparently in his deck that he presented the board with was said,  don't call me, I'll call you. The sense I got was, don't tell me what to do. If I need your advice, I'll ask.

Start time: 6677.48
End time: 6686.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's good general CEO advice. You should keep your board busy.  You should give them work to do. If you don't keep your board busy, they will try to figure out how to be helpful.

Start time: 6686.86
End time: 6703.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a tough board because you've got some big institutional investors like...  Benchmark.  Benchmark. You've got some kind of activist investors who are kind of... Benchmark said Travis has got to go for one thing, right?

Start time: 6703.54
End time: 6726.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to get in the middle of any of that. I know most of the people involved, and they're for the most part all good people.  It's a super complicated company. One thing we should point out is the Uber situation right now is probably the most...  Game of Thrones-like board dynamic that exists.  There you go.  This is not like what normal boards or companies are like.  It's not typical at all.  No, not at all. Uber is a fundamentally important company.

Start time: 6726.90
End time: 6734.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said a couple of things. Why is Uber a fundamentally important company? It's just a ride-sharing company. It's a replacement for taxis. What makes it so important?

Start time: 6736.65
End time: 6764.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it ushered in to a large extent the gig economy, which is probably the most important economic force for the next couple of decades.  I think it's more influential to changing what the idea of car ownership should be than even Tesla.  I basically think the two most important companies in the world right now are Amazon and Uber in terms of their ability to influence the lives of billions of people.  For good or bad. And I think more on balance good, but I'm an optimist.

Start time: 6765.96
End time: 6777.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, all right. If it's that important and it's that challenging, if it's a Game of Thrones board, what does Dara need to do as he moves into leadership there?

Start time: 6777.60
End time: 6782.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just run the business. I'm not going to give Dara advice.  Focus on the business?  Yeah. Focus on the business. Make sure that the ethics are real.

Start time: 6786.50
End time: 6788.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6789.20
End time: 6804.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not usually up to the CEO. That's up to the shareholders of the board.  But he could go to the shareholders and say...  He could. I think he should probably get that figured out before he accepts.  Just to sort of minimize. Uber needs to minimize drama for the next couple of years, if at all possible.  Supposedly that was what...

Start time: 6804.60
End time: 6888.40

Transcript:  I have to give you a little bit of pushback on that. Like what Susan Fowler wrote about wasn't drama.  And, you know, she really brought some extremely concerning allegations forward about that culture.  And, yeah, I just don't want us to roller skate past that.  And, you know, she is... Women in tech have groups where women in tech talk, honestly, about what companies to go to and what companies to avoid.  And from everything I personally have heard, Uber is a fundamentally...  I'm trying to think of the right word...  A fundamentally damaged place for women to go work.  And I just... I feel like I need to say that.  But, you know, the gender issue aside and the employment issue aside, to me, I think Uber's longest term challenge is the fact that, you know,  riders only pay for a fraction of what a rideshare actually costs and the rest of it is, you know, venture capital.  I'm very much for this model. I think it's much more convenient for a consumer.  But I don't see how it's sustainable, you know, 10 years from now.  I don't know how you recoup these costs enough, even if you go to an automatic, you know, AI model for driving.

Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't want to... When I say that I think Uber is one of the most important companies in the world,  I don't at all mean that it's a very good company.  That's a different thing to say. And there's been tremendous problems at Uber that I think are very serious.  I know a lot of people there at every level.  And it is both a great place and in many ways a terrible place. And it's done terrible things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm not trying to paper over it at all. There's fundamental issues that need to be tackled.  But I think it's worth tackling. The question is like, is Uber worth saving?  And I think it absolutely is. But it's a difficult job to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if we just look at the... I mean, if we backseat all those other issues, which are not insignificant  and enough to bring a better company to its knees, there is, it strikes me, a fundamental financial challenge,  which is Uber lost $3 billion last year. It's on track to lose the same amount this year.  That's a lot of money to lose. They, in order to become profitable, need to somehow make more money on the rides.  One thought, and you mentioned it, of course, Brianna, is replace the drivers with automated vehicles.  But that seems to me a long way off. How much runway does a company like Uber have?  And can it go back to its investors, who have now valued it at $70 billion, and say,  hey, we'd like to be worth a little more? Can they get more money out of these guys?  Well, they don't need to be worth more to get more money.  Okay. But they need to get more money, right?

Start time: 7006.88
End time: 7035.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they're looking necessarily for self-driving to be the only way they become self-sustainable.  What else can they do?  Hey, look, when Uber was getting started, I remember the early investor meetings.  And I remember people, investors saying, well, yeah, like, okay, so let's say they become the world's largest taxi company,  and they own 10% of the taxi market. What would it be worth?  Not $70 billion, I'm guessing.  But I also remember Travis saying, we're not going to own 10% of the taxi market.  We're going to own 10,000% of the taxi market.  Interesting.

Transcript:  We're going to replace car ownership with... and we were just talking about that.  It's cheaper to go buy Uber than to have a car.  On the other hand, that's because Uber subsidizes 59% of the ride.  So the question is, how long are investors willing to subsidize it?

Start time: 7050.50
End time: 7058.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's based entirely on how good is their story for long-term fundamental profitability?  And I don't know, I haven't seen the decks in a few years.  Well, the other question is, how much are consumers willing to pay to ride Uber?

That's a pretty quick turnaround, unless they get more cash.  And already many investors are saying it's not worth what they pay for it.  And how is Lyft doing? Does anybody have the data on Lyft?  Well, Lyft seems to be fumbling a massively great opportunity.  I don't know why Lyft isn't jumping on this one all over the place.  Go ahead. I'm sorry, Brianna. I cut you off.

Transcript:  No, no, no. I was just going to say, you know, I had a meeting today.  You know, Boston has some of the worst public transportation systems in the United States.  Better than San Francisco.  And San Francisco, which is doing the same thing I'm about to say, which is working with partners like Uber and Lyft to subsidize the fact that we can't build our own infrastructure there.  So maybe long term, like, you know, the Department of Transportation pays X number of dollars to keep Amtrak running and the T running.  You know, maybe the answer there is there's a public component going to these private companies.  I think that's easily arguable. But, you know, the fact is, you know, I travel all over this country because I speak a lot.  And, you know, what I hear, like if you want to know what an area is going through, you talk to the Uber drivers out there because they're the ones like trying to make a living doing it.  And, you know, what I hear from people is they're already not really making enough to make that job worth it.  And, you know, I suspect that as they're trying to recoup these losses, it is going to come at the expense of their workforce.  And that really concerns me.

And I set it up for her in an app and I put my credit card in and I said, won't cost you anything.  This is, you know, she lives on the East Coast.  She does.  I gave her an iPhone.  So and she she said, I don't going to use it.  They're rapists.  And which is, I think, a very common misconception about Uber is that it's dangerous.  I said, Mom, you take a cab.  How is it more dangerous than that?  She said, Well, I hear things.  And so I finally convinced her she loved it.  And she took it to the doctor and she loved it.  And I'm saying just keep it safe.  It's OK.  Keep using it.  Tell me.  She said they came in five minutes.  He was very nice.  He drove me right there.

Our show today brought to you by My Mattress.  And there's a new mattress.  Casper Time.  You have a Casper? I heard it.  I have a Casper pillow.  Yeah, they sponsor Rocket.  Oh, we love Casper. You guys, Simone does such a good job with her funny voices.  She's quite a character.  Anyway, yes, that's right. You guys love your Caspers.  The Casper team, I love it, is a bunch of engineering nerds.  And that's what's really cool about them.  So they took all the research they did, but they built hundreds of prototypes,  trying to find a perfect mattress.  Their supposition was, and I kind of agree with this,  what you want is something that gives so that your bony parts sink in,  but is firm so that your back doesn't hurt in the morning.  It's got to give you, it's an impossible dream.  An impossible dream, a supple, pressure-relieving mattress that gives you firm support.  But they did it. I don't know how they did it. They did it.  And with its breathable open cell layer, it is on a hot night like last night.  Man, I was so glad. It just breathes. It's cool.  Do you have the older one or the new one?  I have the old one, but they're sending us, and I can't wait to try it.  This is the new one.  By the way, Fast Company's most innovative brand of 2017.  That means they don't sit on their laurels. They might sit on the bed.  But they don't sit on their laurels.  They introduced the Casper Wave mattress.  What are laurels?  I think it's the laurel leaves that the victors in, why would you sit on? It would hurt.  Because don't rest on your laurels.  Oh, right.  So it's not literally sitting.  Got it.  But you can rest on your Casper.  In fact, it's the best rest you've ever had.  And the new Casper Wave mattress, I haven't tried it.  I'm getting one. It features, they say, natural geometry support system.  A new top layer. But you get your choice.  They still offer the Casper Classic, I'm going to call it, which is, I don't know, it's pretty close to perfect.  Now, one of the things you may say is, well, I'm not going to try this unless I'm not going to buy this unless I can try it.  Well, you can because when you buy a Casper mattress, you have 100 nights to return it.  That's a 100 day trial period.  So if at any time in the first 100 nights you say, yeah, it's nice, but I don't like it, call them.  They will come get it.  They literally come and get it, take it out of your house, give you every penny back.  No risk to you.  But I don't think this is going to happen.  I think you're going to really love it.  What do you do with your old mattress?  Well, if you are at all unsure about your Casper, I'd keep your old mattress in the garage or something.  Because then you could just go back to it.  I didn't.  I said, take the old mattress.  I mean, I get a good will for the king.  Good will comes and they take it.  Good will comes.  Oh, of course.  All right.  Yeah, you donate it.  One of the things about the Casper, when it comes, it does come in a very compact box.  You open it up and goes, and this is another thing.  I have had other mattresses that smell for weeks.  They smell like rubber for weeks.  I don't know how they do it.  Casper has some, I don't know, order extraction technology because there's no order at all.  You sleep on it immediately and it's wonderful.

Like any business you run, you should run beneficently, which means you make every single decision based on solely what's in the best interest of the end user of the customer.

Casper just did that for mattresses.  Which like who knew that mattresses were this like weird slimy predatory business?  Right.  But they were.  And now it's not just Casper.  Now like.

Because they both knew that both sides were lying to them.  And given that both sides were lying to them, they preferred the lie that was less condescending.  Which is we're going to get your jobs back.  I think you're right.  I think that's really interesting.  So the 45-year-old coal workers are not going to get retrained installing solar panels,  which was a Democratic claim.  That's not going to happen.  That's not going to happen.  Right.  They're also not getting their jobs back.  That's not going to happen.  But if those are the only two choices, they're just going to take the lie that feels less  condescending to them.  The truth is, it's really about their kids.  The government has enough money to support.  If you're 45 and you've been a coal miner in any industry, we should just be able to  support you in your current lifestyle until you would have retired.  But none of your kids will be coal miners.  That's the truth of it.  The truth of it, this is a generational problem, not a problem within the lifetime of the  middle-aged people currently employed.  No one said that.  But I think you can do that with charisma and truthfulness and get elected.  But no one did.

Transcript:  As somebody who's actually considerably older than 45 and still works and loves working  and has no intention of retiring, even though I could afford to, it's not simply about losing  money.  It's also about losing your sense of being useful.  It's who you are.  You need the meaning.  The future of work is the future of meaning.

Transcript:  The hardest question right now is how do we give meaning at scale?  There's some ideas about that, but that's a big one.  It's not like universal basic income and all of that stuff.  It's solving the easy problem.  That's just math.  It's really what is the future of meaning.  But in terms of what can you tell voters, you tell them the truth.  This is about your kids.

Transcript:  I agree with everything you're saying.  I do want to point out here on this show, Leo, you've got a Tesla.  We've got two Tesla owners, somebody that doesn't even drive and somebody that's looking  at buying a Porsche Cayman.  We come into this conversation with a certain group.  Are we one percenter?  I'm the previous owner who's made by a Tesla.  I just want to tell you, I talk to people literally every day that are out there.  They're really struggling to get by.  I agree with your points.  I just want to acknowledge that it's a lot easier for us to talk about it theoretically  than it is to really be like opening up a room of your house on the weekend to Airbnb  so you can afford to pay your mortgage.  I agree.  Yeah, we've got to look at universal basic income.  But you're so right.  At the base of it, humans need meaning in our lives.  We want to work in a future where more of us can be journalists, where more of us can  be musicians, where more of us can make things.  That's really, really exciting to me.  I think you're really right that it's going to look different 20 years from now.

Transcript:  I think there's a sense of treating people with agency, which most politicians just haven't  done, have no experience in doing.  A friend of mine runs this company, I think it's called Groups.  It's a series of heroin addiction, opioid addiction centers.  She's opened up like 50 of them.  They've got this new process that makes it much more efficient.  She was telling me this idea, a woman named Joy Sun.  She was telling me this idea a couple of years ago when she was just getting started.  She said, yeah, I'm going to run these centers and they're meant to be sustainable and they're  for profit.  They're not connected to insurance and we've got this new way to treat opioid addiction,  which is really effective.  I said, well, who's going to pay you?  She said, well, the heroin addicts are going to pay us.  I was like, really?  You're going to get money from heroin addicts?  That seems like a bad idea.  She looked at me and she said, they've got money for heroin, they've got money for heroin  treatment.  Oh, interesting.  You're just assuming that these are all people that are losers that have no agency, but that's  not true.  Some of them are, but there's many of them that actually have the motivation, that they're  not stupid.  They have the motivation to actually change something and they've got the money to buy  heroin, therefore they have the money to buy heroin treatment.  She's just opened up 50 of these centers and it's super effective.  This idea that people need to be lied to because they have no agency because they're children,  is not the right idea.  Yeah, I wonder if one is effective if they have skin in the game.

If you'd like to be in our live studio audience, we welcome you.  All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll put a chair out for you.  We have pretty good size space.

We have YouTube live.  We have Twitch.  We have you stream.  We also have many audio streams so you can listen live.  In fact, if you have an Echo, people ask me a lot, can I listen to an Echo?  Absolutely.  If you want to listen to the audio, just say to your Echo, listen to Twit live.  If you want to do the live stream, listen to Twit live on TuneIn.  That's the key word, TuneIn, because it's TuneIn internet radio that has at least that  stream.  But you can also say listen to Twit on TuneIn or listen to MacBreak Weekly on TuneIn and  you'll hear the current podcast.  Are you going to do a video version for the show?

You would say if you have an Echo show with a screen, watch Twit live on YouTube or watch  Twit on YouTube or watch This Week in Tech on YouTube or watch MacBreak Weekly on YouTube  and it will pop up.  It's awesome.  You can watch it.  You can watch it live or you can watch the podcast.  That's the point.  We do this live every Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC, but many people  can't be here and be in the chat room at irc.twit.tv.  We do make on-demand versions of everything available on YouTube and wherever you get  your podcasts.  You can get audio or video.  You can even download it from twit.tv, our website.  My suggestion, my request in fact is if you've got a podcast, favorite podcast client, an  app on your phone or whatever, Stitcher, Slack or Overcast, Pocket Cast, iTunes, whatever  it is you use, subscribe.  Almost all of them will offer a way for you to subscribe, which means you'll get every  episode automatically and that it helps us to kind of smooth out the highs and lows so  we can predict with some reliability how many people are going to be listening.  So if you would, subscribe.  We'd appreciate it.  That way you don't miss anything.  Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye bye.
