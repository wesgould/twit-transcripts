End time: 271.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Ant.  Oh nice.  So what do we expect Daniel?  This is where is it Centaurus?  Is that where Centaurus is going to debut?

Start time: 272.15
End time: 310.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Centaurus the dual screen folding Surface device that they've been working on for a  few years and perhaps just as importantly we're probably going to see Windows Lite or Windows  Core OS the brand new operating system designed for this new advanced hardware that they're  pushing with this device.  Is it ARM hardware or is it Intel hardware?  This we have reasonably will be Intel based.  That said we are I mean we'll talk about this in the Microsoft segment but we are expecting  a ARM Surface device as well.  Guess what?  If you want to go right into it.

Start time: 311.88
End time: 320.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't do this stuff in order.  What are you talking about?  We do have a lot of stuff with Amazon.  There's Facebook but as long as we're talking let's talk about it.

Start time: 321.00
End time: 326.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got to be careful here.  I basically know everything that they're going to talk about.

Start time: 326.64
End time: 331.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now do you know that because you have great leaks or you know that because they told you  in non-disclosure do you?

Start time: 332.68
End time: 349.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great leaks.  Microsoft as far as I know doesn't do NDAs for this except if you're like probably the  Verge has probably already got five hands on video shot because they always get preferential  treatment.  Most media outlets don't though so now this is an NDA.

Start time: 350.44
End time: 362.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also was offered not from Microsoft but from a well-known leaker pictures of something  but I don't I don't I you know I feel skeezy looking at that stuff.  It's like tech porn.

Start time: 363.74
End time: 410.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah from my perspective it makes my job easier knowing what's coming but I also don't want  to ruin everything for people tuning in Wednesday especially because you know the surface team  puts a lot of effort into it and this day and age where literally everything is leaked  now months in advance.  It doesn't matter if you're Apple if you're Google if you're you know it kind of ruins  it so I want to keep some of this under lock but I'll just say that you know the leak so  far we've heard about from other sources too has been surface pro 7 so this is going  to be this is a stable refresh right this is internalized hardware will be upgraded  likely 10th gen Intel but the form factor and overall design is going to remain the  same we are however expecting and I can confirm that it will switch from a mini display port  to type C.

Start time: 411.60
End time: 422.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my god I'm going to faint because even Tharat thought they would never do.  Now when you say type C is it Thunderbolt or is that too much to ask that I can't confirm

Start time: 422.56
End time: 439.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that we don't know yet so a lot of the actual details about the hardware we don't know but  I can tell you it's type C now they also are keeping the surface connect port which I've  heard it's probably not Thunderbolt 3 and I'd rather tell people it's not because if it  is then it's right.  Yeah then you'll be happy.

Start time: 439.52
End time: 450.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even the surface go had a type C port that you could use for USB 3.1 and charging  as well as a surface connector so that would be a revelation it's really the Thunderbolt  3 we're looking for.

Start time: 450.88
End time: 504.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean and I'm mixed on this stuff so I have a lot of devices that have Thunderbolt  3 and a lot that just have type C when most people are looking for is the type C they  want power delivery they want to be able to charge it they want to charge their devices  they want to display out they want that functionality of a universal port Thunderbolt 3 is cool but  talking you know now for powering maybe two 4k displays at 60 frames per second right  that's cool but you're talking a small percentage of the population especially surface owners  who are doing that same thing with I always hear the people chime in with what about an  external GPU and I love eGPUs they're super cool but I mean come on most people are not  investing in eGPUs these days that said I mean I would never turn down a device that  has Thunderbolt 3 but because they're keeping surface connect I'm not sure what the PCIe  lanes how that balances out they'll be able to do it or for what but let's assume it

Start time: 504.34
End time: 509.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does the connect have that fast of a interface for data you can basically think of surface

Start time: 509.68
End time: 524.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  connect as their Thunderbolt 3 is pretty stupid so you're talking it uses its own amount of  PCIe lanes but let's just assume it's just type C 3.1 we'll find out there if it's Thunderbolt  3 but I'm assuming not.

Start time: 524.60
End time: 551.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thunderbolt 3 is a 40 gigabyte per second and it is peer-to-peer USB is not peer-to-peer  it's a master you know server client and it is at max 3.1 I think it's 10 gigabytes per  second so it's a quarter of the speed it's not as flexible you can't do as much with  it but you're right I think probably most users 10 gigabytes per second oh that's fine  I'll take it.

Start time: 552.28
End time: 569.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I think for most users they just want that type C universal port it'll be interesting  to see how that goes so that's surface pro.  Surface Pro 7 honestly is going to be probably the least interesting thing in this event  because even though it's kind of their flagship product like I said we're not expecting a  big redesign of that until 2020.

Start time: 572.60
End time: 585.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just to be for people haven't seen it I think everybody has but it's a tablet that  floppily Alcantara covered keyboard.  Minimum key travel keyboards which I'm not a fan of.

Start time: 586.84
End time: 591.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually really like the surface pro keyboard I find typing on just especially because of  the angle.

Start time: 592.40
End time: 593.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better than the Mac keyboard I will grant you that.

Start time: 594.02
End time: 597.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really great when you eat like Cheetos and rub it on the Alcantara.

Start time: 597.52
End time: 629.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a picture at Windows Central of Panos Panay showing up actually I remember this  is from last year where he stole Paul Therotte's laptop and I didn't give it back for a long  time but interestingly if I blow up the picture I feel like this is the Zapruder film.  You see here you don't get a great typing experience.  I don't think that's the full message they're trying to give out but I just want to point  out that one and a half millimeters of key travel is not great.

Start time: 630.32
End time: 646.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're comparing it to a Mac book.  Which is really awful.  Yes because that's the Surface laptop which actually I'm going to go on record and I've  said this already that the Surface laptop's keyboard and typing experience is still the  best of any of the laptop.

Start time: 647.02
End time: 649.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better than Lenovo better than full travel.

Start time: 649.78
End time: 670.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I get Lenovo.  Lenovo is super good.  I love Lenovo and HP.  I think they make both excellent keyboards and what's cool about them is they feel very  different from each other.  It just depends what you prefer but in just terms of overall ergonomics because of the  way the palm rest works on the Surface laptop because of the aspect ratio it's just in my

Start time: 671.52
End time: 687.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mind perfect.  But the palm rest is covered with Alcantara.  So that leads us nicely to Surface laptop 3.  They have to have an option not to have Alcantara on my keyboard.  I like the laptop but I didn't want it.  Really this is for sure?

Start time: 688.98
End time: 693.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After hearing for Surface laptop 3 the 13 inch version will have optional Alcantara.

Start time: 694.42
End time: 698.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Caroline have you ever had a fabric covered wrist rest on your laptop?

Start time: 699.71
End time: 703.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Let me tell you.  Wait.  Yes.  You haven't lived.

Start time: 704.22
End time: 709.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes?  A long time ago.  You haven't lived until your wrists are floating on Alcantara.  It's so soft.

Start time: 710.34
End time: 712.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a nice experience compared to metal.  It is.

Start time: 714.32
End time: 723.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little of a disconnect from the hard edged high tech world.  You feel like you've got a grass covered laptop.

Start time: 725.34
End time: 728.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'd like some turf on the laptop.  I'd have to buy some.

Start time: 729.22
End time: 739.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I prefer grass to Alcantara.  And I don't know.  Have you used a Surface laptop for a long period of time?  Because I only used mine for a few months.  But I would imagine it doesn't wear that well.

Start time: 740.38
End time: 782.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it depends.  One you see that picks up dirt the most is the silver one with the gray Alcantara.  That one gets dirty if you don't clean it.  I like the burgundy.  You get the burgundy and the cobalt or the black.  It definitely wears way better.  So it really depends on from that.  But yeah.  So what we're hearing is that there's going to be an option for Alcantara this time, which  means also in theory, they could lower the price, right?  So maybe it's 50 bucks cheaper without Alcantara.  You mean I'm paying for that?  Yeah.  Or being Microsoft, it could be just charging you more for the Alcantara and still make out.  But yeah, Alcantara is a trademarked fabric, right?  It's a proprietary cloth.

Start time: 782.98
End time: 787.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this the rumor is it's going to be AMD, not Intel based on this new Surface Laptop

Start time: 788.42
End time: 847.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you notice, I said the Alcantara is optional on the 13 inch.  And that's because we're also hearing there's going to be a 15 inch version announced.  And that 15 inch is going to be likely the AMD version.  And the reason that makes sense is because that would have integrated Vega graphics.  And so Vega graphics doesn't quite get you gaming level Nvidia RTX or GTX.  It's not that, but it's better than Iris Plus and a little bit better than the MX150s that  are out there.  So it'll sit nicely in there in terms of video editing, photo editing with a more powerful  processor and that kind of.  So that's what we're hearing for that.  We don't have the specifics on the actual model numbers and all this.  And there could be one rumor came out that there's actually a range of processors, whether  it's four, six or eight core.  So pricing could start as low as a thousand dollars, but goes all the way up to around  twenty four hundred dollars.  And by giving their flexibility, you can basically buy which Surface Laptop version suits your  needs.

Start time: 848.50
End time: 858.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like Surface Laptop didn't get the credit it deserved.  It was just it was kind of it was nice and thin and pretty, but it just wasn't didn't  seem did it sell well, do we know?

Start time: 859.52
End time: 899.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it does do well.  I mean, they've obviously are making a third generation.  And when I've talked at Surface team before, their goal is always to get to version three.  Version three is basically when it all comes together for them.  This is the one.  Yeah.  And so because they've learned from the market what people want, for instance, you know,  we're hearing Alcantara is now optional.  That's from feedback, right?  But yeah, they have sold well, the problem with the Surface Laptop is it's a traditional  laptop.  So Surface has traditionally been associated with these new category devices.  And this is a straight up laptop.  But I would argue it's one of it has all the fundamentals about it makes it one of the  best Windows laptops out there.  Very elegant.

Start time: 899.62
End time: 903.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a nice, elegant, simple, clean line laptop.

Start time: 904.58
End time: 907.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trackpad is good.  Audio is good.  Just play is good.

Start time: 907.60
End time: 912.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a rumor that it will not have Surface Connect, but just USB-C for charging on this  one.

Start time: 913.36
End time: 922.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that?  Yeah, I don't know that for sure.  But it too will have some sort of type C port as well.  So many displays finally going on.  What happened to the Surface Book?

Start time: 923.18
End time: 929.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're due for a Surface Book 3.  That's the one with the clothespin hinge that you can detach the top.  Always had problems.

Start time: 930.96
End time: 973.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, there are some issues people have, especially specifically right now.  with the GPU being disconnected.  But we're not hearing Surface Book 3 for this event, which means the good news that that  really bothers you is Microsoft tends to do spring events too for Surface.  So it may not be as big.  For that we are thinking maybe just a refresh again, internalized hardware, 10th gen Intel's,  which at least at that level may aren't I don't think are out right now anyway.  So it'd be kind of premature for them to announce, but you probably switch to RTX graphics.  And some minor improvements.  But yeah, we're not expecting Surface Book 3.  Will they update the Go?  Go is not we're not expecting that for this event either.

Start time: 973.78
End time: 985.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I really had high hopes for the Go.  I just it's a little it's nice and cute and small and it's like a it's like a Surface  Pro but it's steamy and it's also kind of slow.

Start time: 985.60
End time: 1026.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of not.  So this is the fundamental issue with it, which is the processor.  Now I'd also say the bezels are a little bit thick and so they can fix that.  But we're also just about the Surface Go came out in July of last year, so it's not that  old of a device.  So it makes more sense, I think, for spring.  But that getting back to that processor issue.  So it uses Pentium Gold, which I remember when they told me that, like even I covered  some of that Pentium Gold.  I've never and it's such a it's a weird low end processor.  And the issue here is there's nothing I can't tell you like what else if you were updated  tomorrow, what would they replace that with?  I don't know.  There is no other Pentium Gold as far as I know, or some chip in that.

Start time: 1026.40
End time: 1030.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As I remember, Intel made that for that device, right?

Start time: 1030.70
End time: 1047.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've actually made it kind of they had some Pentiums around and I think basically  they're pulled open a drawer, spray paint them gold, little Rust-Oleum and you're good  to go.  I think they were going to go a Qualcomm and Intel was just like, take these here.  We'll give you here.  And I think they cut them up probably a really good price on them.

Start time: 1047.70
End time: 1051.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were better than the Qualcomm based ARM processor.

Start time: 1052.38
End time: 1055.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And better than Atom.  Atom was the other thing that you know, wasn't awful.

Start time: 1056.42
End time: 1070.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just know I love it.  It was so cute.  It has LTE in it.  It just was a very nice portable travel device, but it just a little too well.  So it looks like they've got a really good lineup of things to announce.  Surface Studio or they they're not due for an update on that yet, are they?

Start time: 1071.13
End time: 1120.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Surface Studio.  But that leads, you know, so Surface Go probably next spring.  I do expect them to switch to Qualcomm probably at that point.  Unless Intel has something else out there.  But we're hearing, you know, a 7CX.  The problem is they got to keep that price point right.  And so you can't put a core processor in there Intel Core because they're too expensive.  So they got to find something that could meet their needs there.  And I think the Qualcomm may work better, but we'll have to wait and see.  But the so this now gets it to all right.  So what's new?  Why am I saying this event is going to be so big?  So Centaurus and Windows Lite.  So besides Centaurus, we're hearing a new Surface.  Think of a Surface Pro.  Thinner, lighter, thinner bezels.  Think of something that looks like an iPad Pro.  But with a kickstand and uses the keyboard.  But it's going to be running a Snapdragon 8CX.

Start time: 1121.86
End time: 1138.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So very interesting.  That's ARM, of course.  The 8CX is Qualcomm's supposedly desktop class.  So these other devices were on the 855, which really was underpowered for that.  The real benefit of anything running on ARM, though, is battery life.

Start time: 1139.02
End time: 1229.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instant on.  This thing will never go to like a hibernation mode.  It'll be like the iPad where you just hit the power button and it just pops on the screen.  Always connected to LTE, of course.  Really good battery life.  And I've seen this thing.  It looks really nice.  Like it's it's and I expect this design is going to be what Surface Pro will turn into  in 2020.  But you want to see it for the Qualcomm version, which if you think about it, it kind of makes  sense.  Microsoft's going to you're going to see this thing and you're going to kind of want it  because it's going to look really hot.  Like I said, think of an iPad Pro, but with the kickstand and the Surface type cover and  they have a new pen system.  I won't ruin the pen system here.  It's kind of cool, but they're changing it up a little bit for this device.  And so you're going to see this thing and you can kind of want it.  And that's going to help, I think, push people to adopt it.  And then next year, they'll probably update the Pro version and Pro users will get it.  So it's a good way, I think, to funnel people to ARM, which, you know, I think what's  Microsoft does this, it will really say we're serious about ARM and everyone should be  like taking a look at this stuff now.  And so that device for me is really what I'm excited about, because I actually do like  using ARM devices.  Snapdragon 850 is actually OK.  The 8CX, though, is supposed to perform like an Intel Core i5 eighth generation.  It's supposed to be a pretty good processor.  So, yeah.  Now, of course, Intel is on 10th generation and I've used some of these and they're really  good. But Core i5 for a lot of people in this form factor, I think is actually pretty ideal.

Transcript:  I think this is a little bit, you know, looking at the iPad Pro and going against that.  ARM is the future for a lot of mobile devices and they're moving towards there.  I think you're going to see this bifurcation of computing where you get to these light,  thin devices running ARM that are always on an instant.  And then you're going to have more heavy hitting devices that run bifur processors and have  GPUs for people that need to do localized computing.  But as we move towards cloud computing, stuff like Windows 10 on ARM and this goes into  Centaurus makes more sense because everything starts to be in the cloud.  Like right now, a lot of people want hardcore processors and GPUs for gaming.  But Microsoft is about to start beta testing its X cloud service for doing game streaming.  So that solves that problem.  You think about it, you could actually have a thin client device and playing your Xbox  games without having to have expensive, heavy hardware.  And so that's a really interesting transformation.  So I think that will be like the main announcements.  And then I think there will be this sort of, you know, one one more thing.  Right. And they're going to start to talk about the future of form factor.  And the next thing coming computing, that's where you will see this foldable Centaurus  device. And I should say foldable.  It's not Samsung.  It's a two screen device.  It's not a single screen with glass.  They're glass screens. So they're not going to be plastic.  I mean, as much as I love Samsung Fold and I give credit to Samsung for pushing out  there. I mean, if you read the reports, right, if you drag your fingernail on it, you  could damage the screen. I mean, that's really like that's, you know.  But if you have glass screens, you don't really have that issue, right.  Plus, you can use a pen.  So this device, we don't know the size of it.  It's between 10 and 13 inches, possibly dual screens folds up.  I may reverse fold to because it has a special hinge on it.  But this thing will be pen, you know, pen first basically as the input modality for  it. And it's going to run this new version of Windows, which has been built for this.  And it's not Windows traditional Windows 32, the classic desktop shoehorned into a  new form factor, which is kind of what the old Microsoft would have done.  This is think of iOS with Chrome OS mixed with Windows.  And that's what this is kind of going for.  And it's it should be pretty awesome looking.  But you're going to see a device that helps redefine a category.  And I think a lot of people will be like, I don't need that or I don't know how to  use it. But that's always what's cool about new form factors.  And so this will be good for note taking.  It'll flip up and you can use a keyboard on it.  And so it's going to have a lot of I think cool things.  And you're going to see other OEM pop in on this.  Right. Lenovo already showed off its literal foldable device back in June.  That's coming out around the same time it too will run this operating system.  So you'll see other OEMs jump on this stuff.  But it's it's a new exciting way to think of computers as smartphones become limited  and what they can do.  So I don't know. It's going to be but they'll tell the story of what we expect.  And we'll hear a little bit more about this operating system.  That said, we don't expect this device to launch until spring or summer 2020.

But I wanted to touch on what you said, Leo, about Microsoft sort  of this being an event where they step out and show that they are doing something new.  I've felt that since the studio was.

Start time: 1515.90
End time: 1549.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, since such an Adela took over the company, it has been a completely reinvented  company. But it's been drips and drabs like the studio.  So you really feel this is going to be like this?  I sounds to me from what you just described, Daniel.  Yes, they're going to be throwing like this.  What about this? We got a triangular one.  We got a round one. We got one shaped like an egg.  Whatever you need. And how long has it been since we saw a new version of Windows?  I mean, Windows 10 is just like Windows 7 is just like I mean, it's not.  It's an incremental improvement.  Windows. What is that?

Start time: 1550.36
End time: 1575.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So from what we understand, so the actual name is Windows Core OS.  They call it W cause internally.  Windows Light is also its internal name.  We don't know what its official public name is.  So I throw that out. There's Windows Light.  I don't think that's going to be its marketing name.  We'll probably find out hopefully this week.  But this is a new operating system built just like how iOS was built for conceptually  this new form factor, new devices going forward.

Start time: 1582.74
End time: 1694.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, kind of.  So these it's not a start menu like in Windows 10, but there is.  So there's some screenshots already that have kind of come out that show what it looks like.  You can think of it.  It looks more traditional like an Android or iOS launcher app launcher.  So we're not talking live tiles anymore.  They're getting rid of the live tile thing for this.  These are just static app icons that people know.  It looks like it has a centralized launcher.  You hit a little button. It pops up in the middle of the screen.  You pick your apps. It's very clean.  It's very minimalist looking.  It uses a lot of what we've already seen with the fluent design system.  So a lot of acrylic, a lot of like sort of see through elements.  It looks very fresh and modern.  It will be always updated.  You don't need to right now with the Windows update, you know, you get the update,  you get a notification, you got to restart the PC it installs.  That doesn't really happen on iOS and Android, right?  It's a lot faster of an update.  Well, that's how this is going to operate, too.  So this is them bringing the best of Windows,  but to a modern system without all the legacies.  Because the problem with Windows, you know, as it is in desktop,  is anytime they try to get rid of something.  Yeah, they're just what it looks like.  Anytime they try to get rid of something, people kind of freak out, like, you know,  because people still are on Windows seven.  And so this gives them an opportunity to really start fresh with  and allows them to jump onto modern computing systems  with a new look that sort of brings the best of Windows.  So from what we understand, it can run Win32,  but it's primarily going to be a universal Windows platform,  as well as their new technologies that they've been doing around there,  like WinForms and everything.  It can run Win32, but it seems to be part of that containerized  systems that they've been building like around Linux.  And so you'll be able to run Win32 as a fallback,  but it's not meant to be a primary because Win32 app development is basically dead.  Right. It's it's totally like with 32 or dead.

End time: 1785.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it will just be these updates that just come through every day.  But it's not going to be this legacy code that they need to maintain,  and it's going to be lighter, it'll be faster and allows them to  create an operating system built for these new ideas of hardware,  which is like a dual screen device, because like, yeah,  you can run Windows 10 on dual screens.  Some of us have three screens. Right.  But for a small foldable device, you can do cooler stuff, including,  you know, focus and moving things around with the pen.  And so this is going to be where the magic kind of happens,  where they really are trying to focus on the user experience built around this.  So this is going to be, I think, super exciting.  And you're right. This is sort of a new Microsoft.  This is them not trying to catch up to the market,  which is the issue with phone and even Zoom. Right.  Zoom was a total response to the iPod.  This is them trying to get ahead of the market, you know, get ahead of the curve.  And we already see this is where it's going.  Smartphone sales plateaued two years ago, and now they're actually dipping.  I believe IDC just put out how this quarter they're expecting  when the sharpest drop in smartphone sales.  And so that market is matured right now.  So the question is, all right, in fact, what comes next?  Is it smartwatches? You know, and so you're seeing these companies push  5G and foldables and dual screens.  And this is going to be Microsoft's take on it without necessarily  going after the phone market.

Transcript:  That's a hard thing to do.  I mean, Microsoft foisted tablet computing on us with Windows 8 and 8.  One much to their chagrin.  It's hard to predict where the world is going with technology.  I think often it's it's such a paradigm shift or discontinuity  from what has gone before that I don't I really don't expect any big company  to be able to figure that out.  It's going to come from somewhere unexpected.  And yet I got to say, this is a this is a really revitalized  Microsoft with a whole host of interesting new products.  And it doesn't feel too spaghetti.  It doesn't. It feels fairly coherent.  Yeah, everything makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems the biggest problem they have is Windows, honestly.  And I think Windows Lite or CoreOS is an interesting attempt to.  It sounds to me like strip it down to the basics, make it more robust,  get rid of some of the excess stuff that was causing problems.  Really, the hardest thing for Microsoft is legacy.  Did you see we talked about it on Windows Weekly, the video  that the former Microsoft programmer posted on YouTube  in which he said this is about the bugs.  Yeah. Barnacles. Yeah.  This is he's Barnacles.  This is the problem, he says, with Microsoft is they fired all the testers.  That's true. We know that.  And they're relying on telemetry.  They're relying on automated systems and the Windows Insider program  to find bugs, to fix bugs, to figure out what to do next.  And that's I think he makes a strong point.  I think Paul agreed it clearly a failure. You agree, Daniel?

Start time: 1879.98
End time: 1896.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to call it a failure.  I will say definitely has a lot of room for improvement.  That said, the industry is going that route.  We're just talking about this with iOS this week.  Internally, we have a bunch of us use iPhones.  I got the new iPhone 11.  Apple is also I mean, they're now at thirteen point one point one one.

Start time: 1897.12
End time: 1903.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So there are so many bugs in iOS 13, even though it had a massive data test.

Start time: 1903.60
End time: 1934.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And so I haven't experienced those, but I read those headlines too.  Right. And so they're doing this open beta stuff.  And yet it seems like they have more bugs than ever.  So, you know, the problem is the industry is going down this route.  It is, in a sense, my you know, Microsoft, to their credit,  kind of gave what people wanted, which was this stuff kept leaking out.  Early versions of Windows would leak out and then they would get feedback from that,  from those leakers. But they were in a weird position because it was an unofficial version.  So all they did was say, like, oh, you guys just really want to beta test this stuff.

Start time: 1935.30
End time: 1938.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this was more a concession to that than it was an attempt to find out.

Start time: 1939.34
End time: 1947.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. I mean, you think about now,  Microsoft doesn't get up on stage and goes for next year.  This is what we're doing in Windows 10 because it's already been announced  in the insider program. We've all been testing it.

Start time: 1948.28
End time: 1968.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's taken that out. But it feels like I have to say it often feels like stuff  that the insiders reported that were known bugs still make it into the shipping version.  This has happened with 1903. It happened with 1809.  So it doesn't feel like the insiders program is actually a good feedback loop for Microsoft.  It feels like either they're ignoring it or they're not getting useful signals.

Start time: 1968.76
End time: 1985.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is where they need to.  And they are always tuning the system.  I mean, it's a first.  It's weird because it's the first time this is being done at this scale.  And you think about it's kind of a crazy system.  So I do believe that maybe they're getting too much information.  They're just the. Yeah. And how do you measure that?  How do you prioritize it?

Start time: 1985.12
End time: 1998.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have two million beta testers, most of whom have no idea what beta testing even means.  Why do I have this?  You're not going to get valuable signals back from them about real bugs.  But they're still missing some massive flaws.  I mean, I don't know.

Start time: 1999.30
End time: 2035.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, on the other hand, the argument goes that Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows.  Oh, they say that every time.  Yeah. Is it true?  From my I think coming from IT departments who don't do the advanced  insider stuff and usually our version behind.  They do get a lot more power and flexibility on this stuff.  And from what I've talked to some IT departments, they actually enjoy what this is.  But I think we can all agree they can definitely improve there.  I don't think it's going to go away.  Maybe they'll. But again, as Windows 10, you know, it's going to be around for years.  I'm not saying they're going to get rid of it.  Obviously, it's like a.

End time: 2098.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, that that is going to be the future for them.  You're going to. I mean, because you look at Chromebooks.  We all laughed at Chromebooks years ago, including myself.  Yeah. And now Chromebooks are, you know, oh, it's starting to look a little serious, right?  And education, especially.  So they did Windows 10 S, which was that was a bandaid.  That wasn't their solution to Chrome OS.  That was like, we got to get back into this market.  Let's lock down Windows 10 a bit more for schools and IT departments.  But Windows Core OS will eventually replace that.  And if you think about where Chrome OS has done well,  Windows Core OS is built exactly for those kind of markets.  And as consumers go more towards these devices, it starts to make sense  because then you don't need everything to be up in the cloud.  Eventually, we will have cloud operating systems, right?  And 5G will play a role in this.  But we're still years from now from that happening.  Oh, that's depressing.

So what we'll see on Wednesday will be sort of the future of where  Microsoft is going. And yeah, it's in the Dallas credit.

Transcript:  We're going to talk about earbuds and spaghetti in just a bit.  That's good stuff.  Brought to you today by Wasabi.  That goes well with your spaghetti and earbuds.  Indeed. Not that kind.  Not the green ball you get next to your sushi.  I'm talking Wasabi hot cloud storage is created by two guys I know pretty well.  David Friend, who was the former CEO of Carbonite, Jeff Flowers, his CTO.  They actually, when they did Carbonite,  they invented a new way of writing the hard drives.  They patented it to lays data on disks sequentially,  as opposed to in blocks.  That gives you big speed up, big efficiency improvement.  And that's kind of the incentive for them starting Wasabi.  They've moved on from Carbonite.  Jeff and David now have a new startup Wasabi that is truly amazing.  Look, you talked about it already.  We already talked about people are going to be moving to the cloud.  You want it. I can make the argument.  I think it's nowadays in the days of ransomware, a very good argument  that your cloud storage is safer than your on premises storage  and the hard drives in the closet and the server.  Those are the ones that are going to get bit by ransomware.  The place to put your data, the place more businesses are going, is the cloud.  By 2025, according to Gartner,  80 percent of enterprises will have shut down their traditional data centers.  80 percent.  So the question is, well, where do I go?  And everybody says, well, you know, it's obvious you go to Microsoft,  Amazon or Google, one of the big three.  And Amazon is like three times the size of the rest of them.  I want to just add a fourth name.  I know, I know, you know, it's going to be hard to bring the bus.  Well, let's not do those guys. Let's do Wasabi.  But just add this to the list and show the bus the benefits.  For instance, because of this revolutionary patented process,  they're 80 percent cheaper, one fifth the cost of S3,  six times faster.  And they don't charge for egress, S3 charges for egress.  They don't charge for API requests and they use the same S3 API.  So really, it's plug and play for you.  It's easy, but you get so much more.  Nine, 11 nines of durability.  You can designate some storage and you'll want to do this in this day  and age of ransomware as immutable.  That is nothing can change it.  Even a malware process running rampant in your computer.  That storage on Wasabi cannot be messed with.  Data center redundancy, of course.  It's HMPa compliant. It's FINRA compliant. It's CJIS compliant.  It is really going to be more secure, more reliable, more robust  than your on-premises storage.  It even does integrity checking on your data every 90 days.  All your data is checked for integrity to make sure that not one bit is flipped.  Wasabi is amazing.  Calculate for yourself and start a free trial of unlimited storage for a month.  Go to Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I, Wasabi.com.  And make sure to use the offer code TWIT to get a unlimited free trial for a month.  Wasabi.com.  Cloud storage costs one fifth Amazon S3.  Free egress, faster, better, more secure.

Transcript:  Well, one of the things that I wanted to know  and what I found interesting is that Amazon actually started the show  without announcing any products at all.  In fact, they started like the first 10 minutes of the show.  We're just talking about privacy.  We're talking. Well, that's really interesting.

Start time: 2507.94
End time: 2513.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, since the next hour of the show was putting microphones  in every orifice of your home.

Start time: 2521.00
End time: 2535.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and what was interesting is kind of not just privacy,  but also sort of becoming more comfortable with these devices  and trying to limit confusion.  So they along with talking about how they announced a plug socket

Start time: 2536.80
End time: 2551.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with a microphone on it.  Yes. And a light.  So you put it as a nightlight.  But this is how and then you could talk to Echo from anywhere.  That's how Echo works. That's I guess.  If you're if you have Echo, you're all in on Echo. Right.  Well, got a microphone in the living room.  Might as well put it in every room. Right. Exactly.

Start time: 2551.42

Transcript:  And so the point here, though, is that now they've got this thing set up  to where you can have your voice recordings automatically deleted  every three months.  You can ask a le XA to play back a voice recording that just happened.  And one of my favorite features is the fact that now you can say,  why did you do that?  So wait a minute. What?

Start time: 2570.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the picture Stacey posted.  There you go. Yeah. Echo, why did you do that?  I do that to Siri all the time, but she never asked.  What are you talking about?  You found a web search for open the pod bay door.  What are you talking about?

Transcript:  This is great. So, for example, say music just starts playing randomly  on your Echo and you turn to the device and you're like,  what the heck just happened?  Why did you do that?  And it could say, well, that's because this device  you told me to be streaming started Bluetooth streaming to this tower.  So we will give you that.  It's a snitch now.

Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, I'm thinking a lot about the products  that are marketed toward children and the certain protections  that they're trying to to introduce about that.  But it doesn't really seem like it's solving the problem there.  Like, as I understand, they have some sort of feature where you can communicate  with, like, other parents that have, like, Alexa compatible devices for their kids.  I forget which article this was in.

Start time: 2684.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's that problem that hasn't been resolved.  And there's I don't know.  I just keep thinking about the fact that, like, let's say you have, like, a kid  who does like a play date over the house of another kid's house, you know,  and there's not like there still isn't that.  We would have to really re socialize our like people as parents  in order to be asking those kinds of questions about, like, you know,  whether there are devices in their house, because if the other kid, for instance,  like, let's say you're a parent and you give your kid, you know,  and you know, like that's, you know, that's your decision as a child.  But if you're sending your kid over to somebody else's house,  is that even a discussion that different parents are having?  That different parents are having. Yeah. Right.  What are your kids allergies?

End time: 2820.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. There's like there's that aspect of it.  And, you know, the thing I think about a lot is like if you're a child growing up  and that's a part of your household and that's something that you are like  growing up, socialized to trust and interact with.  I mean, that's going to be shaping your entire attitude toward like  what sorts of privacy tradeoffs you see is acceptable for the rest of your life,  because that's what you've been raised on.  That's what you understand.  And, you know, is that trust misplaced?  I mean, that's up for you to decide.  But I don't know what that's also something that I think about.

Start time: 2820.76
End time: 2943.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, I gave up and I think most people gave up and just say, fine,  I'm going to take the convenience.  I don't think that putting that burden on the individual user  is really the right way to do it.  This is what I think.  Because nobody's a nobody's going to pay that much attention.  B, people aren't going to want to give up these features  because of some unknown, you know, cloud of uncertainty about privacy,  because we don't really know what's going on.  This is what I I'm going to just start a campaign.  We got it's got to be legislation.  It's got to be federal legislation.  And it's a very simple thing.  Companies that collect information about you with them.  We just learned, by the way, a big study, ours, Technica had the story.  I'm sure you did, too, on Vice about TV spying on you.  Even if you don't have a Netflix account, if there's Netflix on your Roku,  Roku is sending information about what you watch back to Netflix.  They have a microphone. Some TVs have cameras.  They are observing what you watch.  They say, oh, he just left the room.  He's not seeing this ad.  And they're sending that all back to advertisers.  What I want is legislation that says, if you collect information  of any kind about users, you have to disclose exactly what you collect,  how you collect it.  There's a microphone. There's a camera.  What happens to that information?  Not merely how we store it, how we secure it, but who you sell it to  and what they do with it.  So what happens to that information?  And there should be an opt out, at least an opt out button.  I think maybe by default it should be opt in only.  But let's say companies say, but that's how we monetize.  We give you free Gmail, so we can't do that.  But at least there should be a checkmark.  And that disclosure should be very clear.  I mean, I think Apple does this and it shouldn't be in a 400 page  terms of service. That's the problem.  It needs to be done clearly, simply.  What do I what data do you collect? How do you collect it?  What do you do with it? Opt in or out.  And the ability to delete stuff.

Start time: 2944.10
End time: 2952.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think deleting is great.  Which they're offering now, at least almost all of these companies now  are giving that ability.  I think Amazon announced that too.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2952.82
End time: 2970.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it kind of depends what that means, though, right?  Because like they do keep certain bits of information  even after you like delete recordings.  And that was the thing with the kids devices, too.  Like, oh, you can set up your kids recordings to be deleted.  But then like they still exist somewhere or the transcripts still exist  or something to that effect, you know?

Start time: 2971.84
End time: 2983.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it should. The burden shouldn't be on users.  The burden shouldn't be on lawsuits.  It should be in law and it should be enforced.  Now, that may be asking an awful lot.  But I think that's the right way to solve it.

Start time: 2983.62
End time: 3053.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's the right way to solve it, because what we have at this time  is a situation that's a free for all where no one.  The everyday person does not care.  I remember talking to a friend of mine around my age and saying  that TV that you just got, you know, you might want to get this TV  instead of this TV, because this one doesn't have smart features.  Well, what I want the smart features.  Well, this is what's happening and it's tracking you.  Well, I don't care. I don't care that it's tracking me.  There's a lot of apathy surrounding our privacy protections.  And so we almost need that law in place, too, for the folks who don't quite  get it when it comes to what we're giving up in whenever we say yes, yes, yes, yes,  yes, to all of these different privacy policies.  And so if we're kind of not protecting ourselves or more importantly,  kind of like you said, Caroline, that we've kind of been  even now have been socialized a little bit to to be OK with these things.  And it's only getting more and more as we put these rainbow striped  echo dots and people's and little kids rooms.  We're only going to be more and more comfortable with these devices.  But if we're not protecting our own privacy, then, yeah,  I think there need to be laws in place to help us with that and help  to sort of combat the apathy that's there.

Transcript:  And look how far things have shifted since 2012.  I believe it was when Microsoft announced the Kinect for Xbox.  And people freaked out.  They're like, I'm not putting a camera and microphone in my living room.  Microsoft of all the companies, Microsoft has always been pretty good  about data protection of users.  At least they don't monetize like Google does.  But they got a lot of pushback from that.  People didn't want a camera.  Seven years later, these things are just normal now.  You know, they're in every room.  And then Amazon just announced a bunch of stuff that is just like  it borderlines on ridiculous.  It's just like, well, we're going to do it in a ring now because we can, you know.  Yes.  And it's just like we've never had that conversation.  I'll also say, you know, Facebook culture contributed to this.  You know, we went from I don't want my name listed in the yellow pages,  you know, and people would take their names off.  And we went from that world to people posting intimate details on Facebook  with their location and photos and family like voluntarily.  Like that is to me absolutely insane.  But it happened within just a couple of years.  And, you know, the old joke, right, about, you know, FBI used to have to investigate  people and all they had to do was create Facebook.  And now you can monitor everyone.  And it's like now afterwards, we're having this discussion, but it's almost too late.  And so it is.

Start time: 3133.68
End time: 3150.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, believe me, everybody knows everything about me.  So, yeah.  So let's talk about all the new spy.  I mean, convenience devices that Amazon has introduced.  They start a ring.  They put a dot, a clock in the dot.

Start time: 3150.44
End time: 3165.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like this. OK, so this is one thing where my point exactly.  I have to give Amazon credit because they the one thing that I see them doing is,  yes, they're throwing all these spaghetti projects out there,  but they're actually paying attention to what their customers are are doing with these devices.

Start time: 3165.84
End time: 3177.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually kind of interesting because as far as we can tell, they killed the spot.  That was the little ball with the clock that looked like a little alarm clock.  You put on your bedside table, but it had a camera in it and nobody wanted it.

Start time: 3187.20
End time: 3216.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the most important thing here is they heard they saw that with these echo dots  without the without the clock, the most common question that is what time is it?  So they're like, well, let's put a let's put a clock in it.  And it turns out that the microwave oven that Amazon announced is kind of almost like  does it not have a clock?  No, no, no, it does.  They were like, let's just see if this works.  It ended up becoming a super popular product.  And so they've gone all in now.  They've got a convection oven, microwave, all this stuff.

Start time: 3216.30
End time: 3230.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what Amazon's really good at, right?  I mean, they they what are they?  They're a data company. Yes.  And they and the commerce is supported by all the things they know about you  and your use of their products and other products.

Transcript:  That's that's the fire is years ago.  I don't think Amazon would make that same mistake.  I feel like Amazon, they might try stuff, but I don't think they would go all in on  a fire phone. That's the way they did.  I think they know too much.

Transcript:  The funny thing about all the Alexa stuff, you know, they we talk about them being  successful with it.  And in one sense, they are obviously releasing all these devices.  But fundamentally, wasn't Alexa supposed to be about ordering Amazon products?  Like it was supposed to be this way of interacting with Amazon dot com  on a different level.  So people would order more stuff.  But I believe there's a report and it might have been vice.  I covered that that only like two percent of users actually use these devices  to order stuff from Amazon.  So from that perspective, I do see these things as like not  necessarily successful in their original intent.  Instead, they've become alarm clocks, timers and jukeboxes, right?  You just play music on them.  And I guess some people, families, you know, use it to communicate with each other.  I still find that weird. But sure enough, you know.  So I do question how much money they make off these because they sell them for so cheap.  It's almost seems like at cost.  So, you know, they're making it some other way through monetization of data, presumably.  But we don't know necessarily all the details there.

And I think Jeff looks at this as a long term investment.  What what what?  OK, as long as they don't lose a ton of money on this stuff.  And I'm sure they don't.  What could possibly be wrong about having all of these devices in people's homes?  I mean, this is even if he hasn't figured it out yet.  But this is classic Bezos.  I think this is what they did with AWS.  Somebody said, Jeff, we got all the server, you know, stuff we don't really use fully.  Well, let's try this if we make some money.  It's now makes more money than anything else.  Amazon does. Jeff, you know, we could actually write to make a thing  that responds to voice and tells you what time it is and do timers.  What do you think? Let's try it. See what happens.  I think Jeff is pretty strategic.

Basin with this low raw when.  Oh, no, it's not low when it competes with low raw  women, Sigfox. I just wanted to say that.  My cousin's low.  Yeah, it uses the 900 megahertz band.  It's a low bandwidth.  It's kind of replacing these Bluetooth trackers  with its own kind of low bandwidth tracking device.  And it's a mesh network.  So that's the whole idea.  They were able to put these  all over the L.A. Basin and they had complete coverage.

I'm I'm thinking a lot about I mean, I've reported a lot about like rings  specifically and the way that like this is an Amazon product  that's been able to like expand its customer base, like in part  through doing like local police partnerships all around the country.  And I feel like if like working on a local level and moving outwards,  I think this connects here.  I don't know. It's just.

Not a solution.  That's the one that does face recognition.  But at least the cops are involved.  Oh, it's not like Amazon is selling.

Transcript:  Here's the thing that people don't acknowledge a lot about ring.  I mean, they have been working on developing like in-house facial recognition,  not like R.E.K.O.G., like not Amazon's brand recognition,  but like their own brand of recommend facial recognition.  I mean, that's been in development for like a couple of years,  and it's not like a public facing product yet.  But currently, I think the way it used to be was that like anybody's footage  could be submitted for like testing.  And I think now they only use the things that are posted on neighbors.  Because they got caught.

Start time: 3623.04
End time: 3664.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But neighbors.  So neighbors is also a problem.  And I and this is the thing that kind of creeped me out.  So when you have a ring doorbell and you have the neighbors software,  neighbors can say there's a there's a guy almost always an African American,  oddly enough.  There's a guy walking around the neighborhood, you know,  looking into windows and stuff.  And so it really created this terror, even in Petaluma, this terrorizing.  And also felt like kind of biased.  Scare stuff.  And it happened all the time, you know, and I got that kind of  was another reason I got rid of it.  It kind of creeped me out.  At the same time, I can see why people wanted that.  Now, that's opt in, isn't it?

And it's compatible with other security devices.  So theoretically, like if you have like your nest footage,  you could still post it on neighbors, even though it's not a ring product.  The whole idea, what's interesting is that like you can sort things  into a couple of different categories on neighbors.  And three out of the five categories involve like suspicious person,  unknown person or stranger.  And so all of these things need to be like it's literally like the  like the structure of the platform encourages people to  like assume the worst about the people that they capture on camera.  You know, and there's there's a culture of just like,  even if you're not sure post.  But what is that feed into people's ideas about like  like what their neighborhood is or if it's safe or like who they should trust  or who is considered like maybe not a part of their neighborhood  because they call it a neighborhood watch.  And that's one accurate way of looking at it, that everybody who uses  the app is automatically inducted into this digital neighborhood watch.  But I think like a better way of putting it.  Yeah, like almost closer to like a gated community, you know,  because you're determining like what sorts of like behaviors  and people belong and who doesn't.  And even like relatively like normal behaviors can automatically  spun be spun into something that looks a little bit more suspicious, for instance.  I don't know. Like, let's say someone let's say,  I don't know, I experienced this if I'm looking for, you know, an address  and I haven't been there before, I walk up to the house  and I realize I'm at the wrong address.  I've seen footage and it's I mean, honestly, normally of like people of color,  often men, you know, they go up to the door and it's like, oh,  are they checking out the house?  Are they like scoping it out for like a robbery? Right.  It's like, no, they almost definitely are not doing that.  And very rarely will people actually push back on that.  Often people are just like, call the police, call the police.  You know, that's the automatic response.

Transcript:  Like that's not saying there's not value to this,  but I completely agree with Caroline because I had the same kind of feeling.  It creates this general low level sense of I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared,  I'm scared. And we already have enough of that in this world.  I called Mean World Syndrome.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah, the overall was stranger danger of as we take in media

Transcript:  Right. And it didn't used to feel like that because we weren't reporting on.  You only watch half an hour a day.  And you think that what's happening way, way far away from you  is also happening right next door.  And so then you add on top of that, this low level, like you said, anxiety about  who's supposed to be here.  And for me, I don't know half of my neighbors already.  So how would I know who actually are my neighbors and who aren't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I think in terms of this, of the of the shooting question  and in terms of crime, I think that like it's honestly,  I mean, it's one of their selling points, especially in terms of like  these police partnerships, because it is a situation like, oh, well,  if I can actually like help solve this thing, why wouldn't I?  But I think the important thing to keep in mind here is like the actual  infrastructure that makes that possible.  So, for instance, like if a police department partners with the ring,  they get access to a tool that allows them to like blanket  request footage within like a certain geographical area.  And they don't normally a lot of times you would need, like, for instance,  like a warrant to obtain this and the way that the ring app works.  It's kind of like an alternative of going door to door in a sense.  Like it's an alternative to going up to someone's door  and saying, like, oh, can I have this footage?  And in one sense, you could say, like, oh, well, isn't this sort of platform  that allows police to do it just like from the computer?  Isn't that just like, you know, making it more efficient, helping this project,  like helping this process work faster?  But I think there's also an argument to be made that  there's certain protections that are built into things  working at a pace that is perhaps a little bit slower.  Like, do we need to speed up the process of asking people  for their personal information to like hand over to the police?  Like, is that something that we necessarily need to speed up  or automate or change or disrupt in any kind of way?  And I guess it sort of depends on your perspective about that.  I don't know. Here's the problem. Here's the problem.

Transcript:  This has happened without a public conversation.  This is a backdoor way for police to put cameras everywhere.  But there hasn't been. But it's kind of in secret.  It's being done home by home without any public conversation  about what's happening, any agreement that, yes, this is something we want.  And of course, I don't blame the police.  This helps them with their enforcement.  But we also understand that in this country, there needs to be that conversation.  The public needs to be in control of what the police are doing.  And this has all been done kind of behind the scenes without anybody's knowledge.  And in fact, ring has been enforcing  NDAs and secrecy agreements with the police.  They know that if people know about this, they're upset.  But they make sure the police aren't allowed to talk about it.  I would also just throw a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do have like ring products and like, I don't put cameras in my home.  Just because I find that weird.  But having cameras that face out from my home or my backyard, I do have those.  And personally, I like them because I get a lot of packages.  And, you know, people literally drive through neighborhoods.  They follow UPS trucks, you know, and they run up and grab stuff.  I'll also say, though, there is this concern about, you know, the police  and having access, and I agree, we should definitely have that conversation.  I mean, CCTV in the UK is this big thing, right?  Everything's recorded.  You even have just people right now.  We just record each other all the time.  And it happens all the time now where you can't get away with anything

Start time: 4096.78

Start time: 4105.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also say conversely, it also helps against police, too.  There was some footage that came out recently of some police  knocked on their door and they're investigating.  I believe it was a 13 year old.  And they said the door was open.  And so they came in without being invited in.  And they took this kid and they put his arm behind his back and cuffed him.  And yeah, and he wasn't arrested.  There was no crime.  But the video clearly shows that the police abused their authority here.  It was only because they actually had a camera facing.  It was actually not their front door.  I was inside, you know.  But it goes to show you that you can also protect yourself.  There was also another video footage recently.  Cops came up.  I believe an alarm had gone off and they a guy came down and he had a gun.  It was his house.  It was his gun. He had permit.  And the police shot him.  And it was all caught on their own his own security cameras.  Now he survived.  But we have a visual record of that, of the police overreacting in this situation.  And so there's pros and cons to I like the idea sometimes.  If police come to my door, I actually don't mind having them recorded  because I don't trust the police, even though I have a system  that could aid them in case I do need help.  So this is complicated.  This is a complicated thing.

Start time: 4190.18
End time: 4215.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess my main point is it should be done in a public discussion  and it should be done openly.  It shouldn't be done secretly.  It shouldn't be done by a big company like Amazon without really  stitching them all together without really telling anybody,  without getting public consent.  You know, this is the kind of thing that shouldn't be done in secret.  It should be done with all of us involved in the conversation anyway.  That's my thought. Right.

Start time: 4216.16
End time: 4314.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's no, it's true, because none of these partnerships  have been done in such a way where there's been like a public feedback period,  for instance, like these are all and it's built into the contracts  that the terms of the agreement aren't supposed to be made public.  And that's the case with pretty much all of those communications.  And I think in terms of like not having cameras on the inside of the home,  it's interesting because that's a line that a lot of people seem to draw.  And in terms of catching the police on camera,  I think the important thing to keep in, it's interesting because I've  heard that argument before from a reporter to story last year from Baltimore.  And do you remember when they had like the aerial surveillance program  and they didn't tell the people before they started doing it?  So there's there was a group of people, they still are like lobbying for that  that program to come back because they say, oh, well, we don't trust the police.  There's documented cases of misconduct.  And if we have this objective eye in the sky, oh, yeah, that's it.  If we have this objective eye in the sky, then maybe this could be used  like not just for the police's purposes, but to protect us.  But of course, that, you know, that relies on that footage  being used in a system that is going to like work in the favor of people  that specifically say that this has never worked in their favor.  So like we are adding things that are making this right.  We're adding things that are making all of these processes work quicker.  But are they actually working better?  Like, I think that's the question that we have to be that we have to be asking here  or at least thinking about, you know?

Start time: 4314.70
End time: 4365.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there was a report recently about body cams where, you know,  there's a big push for my support this idea because it does have this, oh, you know,  the police are recording their behaviors.  But then there is manipulation of these cameras, right?  Also, cops are turning them off during certain  contested arrests and instances or the footage gets lost or, you know,  and we don't get access to it.  It comes out six months later.  You know, so like they're definitely.  Yeah. When they control the footage  and that's that's a problem.  But it is this weird situation where the fact is, when people are recorded,  it tends to result in better behavior, which is like I was in China recently.  That place operates like a machine.  It's like, but I mean, what are they trading off in terms of freedom for that?  Right. They have a very authoritarian government.

Transcript:  You actually were talking about because court  because Microsoft has Cortana.  And I feel like Microsoft just kind of threw in the towel.  But there is some work to create interoperability, isn't there?

Start time: 5064.78
End time: 5196.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so this was part of that initiative, the voice interop interoperability  initiative, I think I'm pronouncing that right.  But I actually think this is a really interesting thing when we talk about agents.  And I'm not really into these agents as much as I have the devices.  I don't ever use them except for, you know, set a timer.  But who am I to deny the fact that these things are catching on?  So the question is now, do we want a world where, you know,  Google would like to just be the one AI and agent to rule them all?  And that's obviously for convenience.  But the trade off there is you basically have to give all your information to Google  and everything needs to be plugged in.  And the fact is, even if you wanted to do that, you couldn't.  Like if you use a PC, Google has absolutely no access to that  outside of your browsing history, right?  But if you don't use Gmail or anything like that, you know, it does.  It's kind of useless.  So and also Google doesn't do anything with Amazon, right?  And or do those kind of services or doesn't do much on your iPhone.  So there's a lot of, you know, obstacles to being a one AI to rule them all things.  So what Microsoft has been putting forward and now Amazon is doing to is this idea  like there shouldn't be a single agent because one, it's too dangerous.  You're putting way too much personal information to one company.  And hopefully, you know, no one gets hacked.  Instead, they see a world where there's a multiple agents  and every company basically has their own and there'll be standards there,  hopefully for security and privacy, what we're talking about earlier.  And these agents instead talk to each other and can feed off of each other.  And to me, that seems like a more realistic kind of world.  So Cortana, you know, people laugh at it, you know, obviously without a phone,  Microsoft does that much of a play there.  But they do have a play, which is they've put Cortana under their  office division. So it's a part of Office 365.  It's going to LinkedIn. It's going to Word Outlook to do.  It's going to all their actual productivity services,  which when you look at what Microsoft does best, its software and services.  And office has been one of the most successful parts of Microsoft for decades now.  So Clippy is that is that I mean, I mean, if you think about it,  that's sort of where this is going. But it's as annoying as Clippy.

Start time: 5196.82
End time: 5198.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's for sure. Yeah.

Start time: 5198.70
End time: 5339.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think this idea of like an agent being a physical representation,  I think that's going away. Right.  Microsoft's going to kind of pull back on that and said,  you're just going to have machine learning and AI weed throughout their operating  system and through their services. And, you know, that's going to be their strength.  So you'll be able to pull up calendars and appointments.  And that's what Cortana is going to be doing.  If you're part of Office 365 and Microsoft, that's something Amazon has absolutely no.  They can't do anything there. Right. And Google can't do anything there.  And yet a lot of the world and business world, it's it's Microsoft.  So this is one way for these companies to cooperate, basically,  and build products where they can work together.  Currently, you can do this. You can actually ask to open up Cortana as a skill.  And it'll do that. And then you can use Cortana through your device.  But that's a little bit of it's a two to stepper. Right.  You got to hey, OK, now open up Cortana.  What this will do is you'll go to one wake word.  You can basically tell your device open Cortana and it'll just go directly.  And so it's this idea of, you know, reducing these walls and obstacles  to these services. And so Salesforce, I believe, is on board with this.  I think Samsung was to Qualcomm for hardware, Verizon as well.  So all these companies are kind of jumping on board.  Google said they just learned about it.  So they haven't committed to it yet.  And we don't know about Apple, of course.  But like, yeah, I love people hate on Siri.  Actually, like Siri's user experience.  I actually think it's very good.  But like Siri could benefit from this, right?  Just plugging into other systems, just like how your browser works now  where you have extensions and we were kind of familiar with this idea  that things plug into each other and should be interoperable.  So that's what this project is for.  I think it's it's the smart way this industry goes forward to the next level  where we can also bring up ideas of privacy, security.  You know, Microsoft's they'll say Cortana,  it obeys the standards that they need for business and operating there,  which is super important.  And that's how all their products work together,  which is why they just don't open everything up to third parties.  So this is one way, I think, to go down that route.  And it's kind of an interesting one, even though I feel like all this stuff is super.  It's very premature. AI is not here yet, right?  We're barely starting there.  That's why this stuff is so unimpressive, in my opinion.  We use voice assistants.

Start time: 5341.18

Transcript:  Maybe someday I just what I don't want to do is say,  Cortana, can I talk to Echo?  Right, right.

Start time: 5347.98
End time: 5352.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. So I'm saying so that's the goal of this is to is so you don't have.  I don't have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how would it know which assistant?  Wakeward. Oh, I just say Echo.

Start time: 5357.84
End time: 5373.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or Cortana.  And basically, if you think about it, then the hardware,  this is Microsoft's problem, right?  They try to build a Cortana speaker with the harmony.  I have it. Nobody buys it.  Right. And so why go buy specific hardware  that's tied to one system?

Start time: 5374.38
End time: 5397.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's one thing on a computer because you can have  you have a lot of storage, a lot of CPU.  It's not a thing on the phone. That's true.  Where I mean, before they do that,  can they just allow me to set my own wakeward?  So you don't have to do all this rigmarole.  I've been bleeping every time people say ALEXA on the show,  because we don't want to trigger somebody's  home echo and have them buy a dollhouse.

Start time: 5397.56
End time: 5402.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 5436.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or it's computer useless.  Amazon Echo, which we use Amazon useless or ALEXA.  But remember on the old Moto X, you could tell the Moto X.  I want my wakeward to be my wakeward is Jacuzzi.  Jacuzzi. Well, yeah.  And actually, I mean, mine helped me.  Obi-Wan Kenobi, because I thought that's never going to come up  in the real world. Yeah.  But if but if I want help from my assistant saying, help me,  Obi-Wan Kenobi is kind of fun. Yeah. Sure.  And it's never going to get accidentally triggered.  Unless there's a big problem with all of these.  I don't understand why they don't do this yet.

Start time: 5436.84
End time: 5517.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of obstacles also.  You know, we're just getting to the point, right, of actual voice recognition.  So if I ask something versus a friend or family member,  you know, now they're getting to the point where, oh, it brings up your stuff.  Right. And Microsoft wants to do that, too.  So I go, what's my appointment?  It knows me versus, you know, sort of my family.  And so this stuff, it has a long, long way to go  before it really becomes useful, even conversational AI. Right.  Microsoft showed this off at Build.  They bought a company called Symantec Machines, and it's actually based here in Boston.  And so they work on this idea of contextual AI.  What I mean by that is you have a conversation.  And so so there's follow ups and the thing becomes more human like.  Right. So that you can ask a follow up question to it like, right.  What's the weather for tomorrow?  Is it going to rain on Thursday?  And you can go back and forth to this without having to repeat the question.  So that stuff is just starting to come out.  But we're still got a long way before this stuff is super useful.  But I think in advance of that, this idea of these companies working together,  I think is a lot smarter because we all benefit from that way as a consumer.  Eventually, you just buy a speaker and it doesn't matter whose service is on there.  Right. You can use whatever you want and they're all tied together.  But everybody will have their strength.  And so that's going to be, I think, really kind of cool.

Start time: 5693.14
End time: 5717.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no video on that because it's an audio only show.  It's one of the things we're going to start doing on Twitter is  audio only shows because we noticed that mostly people listen.  I like doing video because it lets you see us,  even if you only watch every once in a while, then you can have a visual.  But it's expensive.  It's complicated.  It adds a great deal to the complication of doing the show.  So audio will be easier.

And, you know, there are other people who love Twitch.  And so we are actually going to be Matthew Castanelli from Berkeley.  Me from right here in the Petaluma Studio.  We'll be broadcasting the show on Twitch, interacting with that audience.  So stay tuned for that, because right now the Twitch chat is.  But we're going to open it up during that time.  We're going to have people tuning in there and being able to comment.

Start time: 5840.18
End time: 5844.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will there be video?  I mean, yes. So you could watch it to them, do it live and comment.

Start time: 5844.86
End time: 5887.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do it live and comment there.  So we are doing it at 4 p.m. Pacific.  And the reason we're doing that is because that about hits the bridge  either before you're starting to eat dinner or and, you know, depending on how far you go  after you've eaten dinner.  So plenty is kind of a good time there for folks to be able to tune into the live  stream on Twitch and hang out with us.  So, yeah, we are both looking forward to that.  Matthew is already a Twitch streamer and YouTuber and work.  That's going to be fun.  Worked on the team at at or before Apple.  Swallowed it up. So, yeah, we're looking forward to it for sure.  And so you can check that out Monday, October 7th, and he'll be here live  in the studio with me for that first episode.

Start time: 5888.30
End time: 5946.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, check out a new show coming to Twitter.  Smart tech today.  STT and we will create a a topic on the forums.  So it's a category in the forums because that's something else we wanted to mention.  They're still kind of in beta because I don't know if this I don't know how this is going to work.  Tweet dot community. We've created forums.  A lot of people said we can't watch a show live, so there's no point for the chat room.  We love the chat room. It's a great way to interact with us while we're doing a show live,  even if if it's audio only.  But if you aren't watching live, what do you do so that we've created the forums?  They're kind of an asynchronous way to participate.  And every show will have a category.  Every host will have a category.  They'll be placed for you to talk amongst yourselves as well.  Ask tech questions. That's Twitter community.  It isn't open now for you to join, but just understand it's it's it's early days yet.  We're still working on it.  And we've already decided to change the name because Micah says backstage is confusing.  So we're just going to call it Twit community, I guess.

Start time: 5946.28
End time: 5961.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I do want to clarify something because I'm seeing some questions here.  You are saying live audio, if it's just going to be a still picture on Twitch.  No, we will be streaming video to just we won't put out a podcast.  Exactly. There won't be a video podcast afterward.  You can just subscribe to the audience.

Start time: 5962.04
End time: 5964.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5964.42
End time: 5974.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So, yeah, you'll actually be able to watch it, not even just on Twitch.  That's just where we're going to be paying attention.  So if you stream it from another streaming platform, it'll be there.  It's just Twitch is where we're trying to focus.

Start time: 5974.38
End time: 6022.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so we're going to still put it on the Twitter TV slash live stream.  Oh, OK. Yeah. All right. So live, you'll be able to watch.  So this is a video.  There's a lot of them on the Tesla Motors subreddit.  This was one that really irked me.  This is a car. This is a model three.  This is a new capability where you're standing on the curb at the store.  The car is parked. You press a button on your phone.  The phone tells the car where you are and then  autonomously drives it through the parking lot.  It makes me nervous.  It's making me really nervous.  And this is a crowded parking lot.  So there's other cars that, oh, jeez.  Just I think this is such a bad idea.  And I kind of am mad that Tesla released this feature.  It just does this seem like a good idea.  I mean, it didn't hit anything.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but it would just be like this doesn't seem like it's going to end well.  You should. Yes.  I mean, to be fair, there are people like falling asleep in Tesla's  which is like it's good, arguably, because it's like, OK,  you're preventing the car from crashing if someone is falling asleep  and the car is still driving.  But here it's like I don't see what this is saving anybody from.  It seems like pure risk.

Transcript:  I want to be very clear.  Here's the thing, though.  It almost doesn't matter because it's not we can talk about how to use it right now.  It's the fact is we're going toward autonomous vehicles  and these are the first steps that we go there.  Eventually, cars aren't going to have drivers.  I mean, Tesla, you know, Musk has come out and said they've already planned a model  three that has no steering wheel. Right.  So like these things will eventually drive.  And that's how the future of cars is going to be in this country.  Now, we're still years from that. Right.  But these are the first steps.  So it's like I know it's risky.

But yeah, the idea is when you're at a charging station  and they're going to start putting free Wi-Fi at these stations.  But yeah, when you plug in, you can play a video game, you can watch TV,  you can catch up on a movie.  Yeah. And they're literally just throwing in features almost because they can.  And that's what's kind of fun about it. Right.

What's going on here?  And then I came to understand that it was because there was a supercharger station.  And they were all just waiting.  Yeah, they're waiting.  I thought there's not one close enough that they don't have to wait in this long line.  It was a very long line, but they all had their little monitors up with whatever,  probably playing fart signal or whatever the game is.  So, yeah, they've got they've got the entertainment.  But I found that fascinating and certainly not something that I think I would want to do.

Transcript:  You're still.  Just weird.  I'll say, though, this is seems like a response for me.  You know, Microsoft bought bought Alt Space VR,  what they use with Windows Mixed Reality.  And if you go on to Alt Space VR, it's very similar to this.  This idea of a virtual reality community, virtual reality community.  You create an avatar, you walk around.  We it's also a very weird world.  I've gone in there and it's like mixed reality and virtual reality.  All this stuff is.  I don't it's definitely not mainstream,  but yet when you go into these communities, they're very busy.  Like there's a lot going on in there.  And so the audiences that use this stuff are very hardcore into it.  And that's what's kind of interesting.  I as a I don't use this stuff regularly.  I haven't worked into my daily workflow yet, but they are interesting.  And I feel like this is Facebook's attempt because they couldn't buy  Alt Space VR to basically go into this same kind of space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had they had a VR environment.  We played with it with the Oculus Rift when it first came out.  It was not pleasant.  The part of the problem, and I think the reason they don't have legs is because  what they don't talk about, notice the woman couldn't move around  because they're currently there's no way you want to move around  with a visor on that you can't see what you're walking into.  So all of these have some weird way of motivating.  Like maybe you use the device to put down a thing and pull it.  Pull yourself towards it.  Or you press a button that slide glides you forward.  So legs really don't make sense in that environment because you're not able to walk  and they don't want you to walk.  They want you to float and stay where you are.  I don't know. We'll see.  You know what? I don't want people to do summon.  I don't want them to do VR.  I just want them to stay at home and talk to their Amazon Echoes.  You know, do you remember?

Transcript:  Good. You remember Second Life?  Yeah, I played a lot of it.  Yeah. So this just reminds me just the virtual reality version of that.  And I feel like these ideas, again, they don't go mainstream,  but for some reason, they're so persistent.  They keep coming back.  And I don't want to believe there's because of science fiction.

Actually, this show is brought to you by Cashfly.  How many how many years have you heard?  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is brought to you by Cashfly.  It's C A C H E F L Y dot com.  You actually know that, don't you?  It's because for more than a decade now, you're when you get a tweet podcast,  when you download it on the website, when you download it in your podcast  application, when you get it streamed on your phone,  when you're getting it from Cashfly.  It's our CDN, our content delivery network.  It is the best.  30 percent faster than the competition, up to 10 times faster than other  traditional delivery methods and backed by a 100 percent SLA.  That means that's because they have servers all over the world,  so many servers that if one goes down, no big deal.  But but you're going to be getting your content, your customers are getting  their content from the server nearest them.  That means fast delivery means fewer problems.  Cashfly is so great.  LG uses it.  Microsoft uses it.  Adobe and ours, Technica.  We use it, of course.  It is incredible.  And what I really love is they work out your bill, your plan.  It's custom to your needs.  We have very spiky downloads.  Twit gets downloaded mostly Sunday night and Monday.  Right.  That means a big spike.  We actually send out petabytes of data every single month through Cashfly.  And if I had to worry about bandwidth caps or watching spikes,  I'd be logging in every day panicked.  But I don't have to worry about that.  You get a custom plan tailored to your CDN needs based on yearly usage trends,  smooths out the spikes, gives you a predictable bill every month.  You're going to love Cashfly.  And you're also going to love what you save because on average,  customers who switch to Cashfly save more than 20 percent.  It is awesome.  Just for you, right now, you can go to Cashfly and get a detailed analysis of  your current CDN bill to see if they can save you money.  No pressure.  Just the information you need to know if you're overpaying.  Go to twit.cashfly.com.  twit.cashfly.com.  It is the best way to deliver your app, your data, your podcasts to an audience.  And like I said, petabytes a month through Cashfly.  twit.cashfly.com.  I love this story.  Well, I don't love it, but it's an interesting story.  Jailbreak Community has announced Checkmate, a jailbreak that cannot be fixed.  Dun dun dun.  That Apple can't turn back.  Now, it only affects devices through the A11.  So it doesn't affect the last two years of iPhones or iPads.  But because it's a firmware hack, very hard to do.  Apple would have to release new firmware for all its phones, something it can't do.  It would have to take them back in hardware and stuff.  So Checkmate is what they call a permanent, unpatchable boot ROM exploit.

Transcript:  Checkmate with an eight.  Well, I don't recommend jailbreaking in general.  But if you have an older phone, maybe this is a way to keep it alive.  Maybe put some software on it that you want.  Mess around.  Mess around.  It's on GitHub.  I won't say exactly where, but you can find it.  And it doesn't work on the last two chipsets.  And be buyer beware, the creator says, there are still kinks to be ironed out on older  devices like the 4S.

Start time: 6695.80

Yeah, I wouldn't recommend using it.  10 feet at least.  Apple says some of those shows we're making, those movies we're making for Apple TV+,  those are going to be in the movie theaters.  Again, people go to those?  So this is Sofia Coppola directing Bill Murray in a new movie, On the Rocks.  It's going to be one of Apple's first major theatrical releases.  It'll open in theaters first and then on Apple TV+.  That's always been a bone of contention.  Hollywood doesn't remember.  Steven Spielberg didn't want Roma to be nominated for an Academy Award.  He said only movies that had a theatrical release.  So Netflix put it out, I think, for two weeks in theaters.  It's not an easy thing to do.  Apple's going to respond to that.

WWT, we call them, their advanced technology center.  Started about 10 years ago.  It has grown like topsy.  More than half a billion dollars in equipment, enterprise equipment, so that you and they  can test hardware and software before you deploy it.  The engineers at WWT use the advanced technology center to create tests, proof of concept,  pilots.  They use a sandbox so that customers can see this stuff at work, can see how it interacts  with their equipment.  But one of the things I love about this...  I think it's so amazing is that now you can use the ATC as well.  Even if you're not in St. Louis, anytime of the day or night, you can try a test, things  24-7 in their on-demand labs, schedulable labs, representing the newest advances in  all kinds of enterprise technology.  Multi-cloud architecture, security, networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics,  online DevOps.  Learn about the products before you launch.  Test it, reducing the concept time from months to weeks, speed to markets faster.  They call it lab as a service, LAS.  It's a dedicated lab space within the ATC where customers themselves can do programmatic  testing using that vast technology ecosystem.  The half billion dollar ATC.  It's amazing.  It's virtual.  And the time is finally here.  They launched it and they invite you to try it.  It creates a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed and agility anytime, anywhere around  the world for WWTs customers.  You get access to articles, you get case studies, you get hands-on labs, you get other tools  that make the difference in today's fast-paced world.

Worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.  Hence the name worldwide technology and the ATC.  There is some Google news.  Big landmark case in Europe in the right to be forgotten.  So there was Google went to court in France saying, look, you can have right to be forgotten  in the EU, but that shouldn't extend to all countries worldwide.  That's a EU issue.  France said no, we want if you the CNIL, which is France's private privacy regulator in 2015  said no, you have to globally remove search result listings if there's damaging or false  information about a person everywhere globally, not just France.  So what Google's response the next year was to block European users from seeing links  that were delisted elsewhere.  It says that we don't want to censor it, but at least we'll block it.  And then went to court and it looks like the European Court of Justice, which sounds like  a Marvel comic universe event.  The European Court of Justice says currently Google does not have to dereference all versions  of its search engine if a right to be forgotten request has been made just in the right to  be forgotten country.  That's actually a big deal for the internet working period.  And you may remember that also in the EU, publishers in the EU did not like Google's  use of snippets in their search results.  Honestly, that's a big part of why Google search works.  The publishers said, well, they'll read that one sentence summary of the story.  They don't go to our and they won't click the link.  They'll just say, OK, I got what I want.  And they won't.  It won't drive traffic every time that has been blocked as it was in Spain.  It's resulted in decline of traffic to those sites.  It's going to happen now in France.  Google will stop showing new snippets from European publishers on search results for  its French users.  This is the new European copyright law.  We warned against this law.  This is a very problematic law.  I don't want to say something controversial, but if you're going to say something about  cheese eaters, I'm going to be mad.

Start time: 7224.46

Transcript:  I have to look.  The GDPR is a good thing.  The GDPR is a good thing.  But this new copyright regulation we knew would be a problem.  There's one of two problems.  One is a snippet issue.  The other one is a memes meme basically prevent memes.  The memes are the smallest amount of it.  It basically says that any publisher is responsible for making sure copyright is not being violated.  We have a new forum.  If somebody posts something copyrighted on that forum, it's my responsibility to prevent  that from happening.  Which means Twitter's responsibility.  Everybody's and in Europe that means it's going to be a chilling effect on free speech  because most networks can't be blocked.  They're just going to block everything.  French users will only see headlines, not the first few lines or a thumbnail image for  news content unless the publisher asks for it.

It'll say the first sentence and then step one through seven.  I don't ever have to go click on that article.  I understand the concern there.  In many cases, it doesn't provide all of the information that I need or I start to see  a trend of like every time I Google, this one site is telling me the things that I need  to know.  Then you start to trust that site.  You start to go to that site, et cetera.  Yeah, if that's not there, then how will we know that those sites are out there?  This is the whole point.

Transcript:  Snapchat is no but is not much better than Facebook, is it?  I like this one.  Well, two proposals by Elizabeth Warren.  I know we don't like to talk about politics, but actually this is an important one.  First of all, she says we should hire an army of nerds.  Is that the quote?  I like it already.  To defeat Google's lobbyists.  And the army of nerds she's talking about is actually a big deal.  The Office of Technology Assessment, Newt Gingrich, killed this 20 years ago.  This was a real, I think a very valuable group designed to help Congress understand technology.  If you complain that your member of Congress doesn't get technology, and you would be right  to, we need to bring back the Office of Technology Assessment, established in the 70s, to give  nonpartisan, informative information about science and technology to members of Congress  so they could vote appropriately.  Gingrich led a successful effort to dissolve it, and in the 90s Warren says we need to  reinstate, and I know many others who agree, the OTA, to help lawmakers grapple with policy  issues that are increasing.  So what you're seeing is ill-informed members of Congress going after Google and Facebook.  Give them some information.  The internet's like a series of pipes.  Yeah, but it's not much better.  It is like that.  When they were talking to Zuckerberg last year, Senator Roy Blunt bragged about putting  his Facebook address on his business cards.  Hatch questioned the company's business model, Warren Hatch resulting in the, Senator, our  business model, we run ads, remarked from Mark Zuckerberg.  They need to know more.  They need to be better informed.  So I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They need to, I mean, there's already a science advisory group, right, that takes them seriously  But like the government totally needs this because like, yeah, these people making these  decisions about technology are just really kind of clueless.  And listen, I get it.  You get certain age, you're busy, you can't keep up with this stuff.  That's totally fine.  Everybody needs to be an expert on this stuff.  But I mean, they should absolutely be listening to people, or at least getting advice from  people who do this for a living and have some input on it because they're legislating on  it and it's totally crazy.  Even the FCC stuff lately has been totally off the wall.  And so there needs to be cooperation between the industry and government without lobbyists  throwing money around who are clearly influencing these decisions.  I completely agree.
