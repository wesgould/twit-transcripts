Start time: 177.94
End time: 233.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd be off somewhere else.  We actually did on Windows Weekly, we did a demo of it.  We were able to connect the output of the HoloLens to Skype.  So Mary Jo Foley was wearing it.  We could see her and then we could see what she was seeing.  It was actually kind of cool.  It was pretty neat.  I'm a fan but we'll talk about that in a bit because you have some interesting theories  about augmented reality and its future.  Yeah.  I'd rather look on it.  Yes.  We now have Scobleizer.com.  I'm going to get you a copy of the book by the way.  I haven't seen the new book yet.  I would like to.  Also with us is Georgia Dow from imore.com.  Hi Georgia.  Hey.  Fresh off the slopes, she skied this morning.  She'll be skiing this evening.  I will just ski.  She's a ski fanatic.  I'm thank you for taking time out of your ski day to join us today.  We appreciate it.  And also with us, your former colleague from Imore, Peter Cohen is here.  Hello.  Actually, I guess not former.  You're still at Imore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's great to see you once again.  Peter, of course, has been around forever covering gaming among other things, but you  cover everything these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, indeed.  With an emphasis on the Apple ecosystem as always.  Oh, good.

Start time: 253.76
End time: 267.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you're all Apple-ites.  So let's start off with Robert's thesis that there's going to be a massive announcement  from Apple.  We just got the Apple quarterly results this week.

Start time: 268.56
End time: 270.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They sold 78 million iPhones, right?

Start time: 270.92
End time: 325.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A ton of iPhones.  iPhones still easily driving the company.  They made $17.8 billion in three months and they beat the street and they were back to  revenue growth, which they'd been off for a little bit.  In fact, the actual revenue is an all-time record according to Apple.  But the number two division at Apple is the online services, not Mac, not iPad.  It's online.  In fact, iPad declined down 19% year over year and revenue down 22%.  But services was huge.  They made a revenue of $24 billion on iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music.  So I think it's safe to say at this point, Apple is the iPhone and iCloud company, right?  But as with any company Silicon Valley, you've got to find the next big thing.  And I don't think it's the watch.  Sorry to say, I don't think it's the iPad.

Start time: 326.52
End time: 344.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a new watch coming this year.  Really?  A Series 3?  Yeah, a new iPad coming this year.  That we expect.  Really?  They're going to do a TV?  Everything is coming new this year.  They are launching more new products this year than they have announced in a long time.

Start time: 345.06
End time: 348.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Before we go on, you don't mean a television set.  You mean a new Apple TV.

Start time: 348.46
End time: 349.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about the little box.

Start time: 349.62
End time: 351.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, which is due.  The Apple TV is HD.

Start time: 352.86
End time: 364.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I keep hearing rumors about a television set too, but I hear that the TV box will have  a new 3D sensor from PrimeSense.  Apple has 600 engineers working on just the sensor on these new products.

Start time: 365.08
End time: 374.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear the rumors about the Apple television as well, but usually when Gene Munster has  returned from a 3-day coyote binge in the desert.

Start time: 376.94
End time: 408.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was the guy who put his career on the line with the Apple TV and finally admitted, yeah,  I don't think they're not going to do it, but I don't think that it wasn't that they  were thinking about it.  And this is one of the things that's difficult.  A, Apple is very secretive.  They don't announce anything.  And B, they try everything.  They've got hundreds of billions of dollars in cash.  They can have a TV division that never produces a product because they're investigating it.  Even Tim Cook has said that.  We investigate a lot of things.  So anything you say, Robert, at this point could be something in prototype, but not necessarily  a product.  But you're convinced there is going to be a product.

Start time: 409.02
End time: 427.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have many, many sources who say I'm right.  Plus, I was on CNBC telling the ad audience the same thing.  I'm telling you here and nobody from Apple PR called.  And you know how Apple PR is if you get something incorrect about their company, particularly  in a venue of that note.

Start time: 427.40
End time: 436.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you think that there'll be a big announcement because it's the 10th anniversary iPhone,  they're opening the spaceship campus, that there will be something like how big?

Start time: 437.14
End time: 499.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Big, like huge for Apple.  This is Tim Cook's legacy.  It goes all the way back.  In fact, it's Steve Jobs legacy too, because it goes all the way back to Steve Jobs when  they had a conversation about the future of television.  And right after that, they started patenting things about augmented reality, a phone that  had a 3D sensor on it that looked clear where you held it up and you could see virtual things  sort of like with this HoloLens, right?  And it's not just Apple.  If it was just Apple, I'd be like, okay.  When I went to the Consumer Electronics Show, I saw many things in the back rooms like this  pair of Lumis lenses.  Now look at just the lenses here.  These have 720p monitors in the lenses and a little computer.  Now notice it's sitting next to a Snapchat glasses, which doesn't even have a screen.  And that's from a company that got 60 million of investment.  Apple forced Carl Zeiss to pull their optics off the show floor.

Start time: 499.72
End time: 529.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now I have to ask you about that because we've been going back and forth.  I saw your Facebook post saying Zeiss was in the AR pavilion with no AR to show.  And you said that you were told that Zeiss was working on something with Apple.  But it wasn't clear if you were told that or you deduced it from the fact that when  you mentioned it, the Zeiss people looked away.  Did somebody actually say it verbally?  Yes.  Okay.  That's what I suspected.  No, no, he's talking about this nuance thing here.  No, no, somebody tell you that.

Start time: 529.52
End time: 562.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what?  That's how humans work too.  And if it's nuanced and everybody starts laughing when you talk about something that confirms  your suspicions.  Nervous lester.  Which other company has the ability to force a multi-billion dollar company, which Carl  Zeiss is, to pull something off the show floor?  And they showed the optics the year before at Consumer Electronics Show and they were  right in the middle of the augmented reality booth without any augmented reality stuff  in their booth.  And everybody knows that is a fact.  That seems weird.

Start time: 562.26
End time: 569.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what do you think?  So what do you so you so you've got this from one source, two sources, many sources.

Start time: 570.22
End time: 652.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been flying the world and I've been meeting with people at the highest level.  I'm interviewing the chief economist for CTA at South by Southwest, you know, on and on.  This has been coming for a long time.  I did the first interview for my book in 2011 with the chief economist, chief technical  officer of Matio, which Apple bought.  If you go and listen to my interviews with the founder of PrimeSense, he tells you what  he's going to do.  And then he got bought by Apple, right?  And on and on and on.  Tim Cook has bought a dozen or so companies, most of which we haven't heard of or haven't  understood why they are important.  Companies like Turi that are doing artificial intelligence.  He keynote, the founder of Turi keynote at the data science conference in June.  And then two weeks later gets bought by Apple.  So Apple is up to something big.  You can't deny that anymore based on the patents that have been reported based on the rumors  of glass iPhones coming and stuff like that.  So whether you listen to me or not.  What is it going to be?  What's the product?  Tim's been telling you it's augmented reality.  It's next generation augmented reality or what we call mixed reality in this industry.  And it's not just Apple, right?  Microsoft has 1800 people working on it.  It's clear.

Start time: 652.90
End time: 675.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, they've got the HoloLens.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I think augmented reality is going to be big.  I don't deny it.  In fact, I think it's bigger than VR personally, but potentially.  But it's a big, there's a jump from that to say everybody's going to be doing it.  Everybody's working on it.  Let's say Apple's got a product.  You're saying this, you think this year Apple will have a product.  What will it be like?  Will it be like HoloLens?  What will it be?

Start time: 675.60
End time: 713.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple has a range of products coming out, including a new iPad, three new iPhones, a  new TV product, a new watch.  They've already had the earphones.  By the way, the earphones have motion sensors in them, right?  Which let you do fun things.  If you pull the earphone out of your thing, your music stops playing, right?  It also has motion sensors for your head.  Why?  Because they're going to announce a very lightweight pair of glasses and they're going to move  all the electronics they can out of those glasses and into other places on your body,  i.e. a phone in your pocket, your headphones in your ears.

Start time: 715.14
End time: 719.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Peter Cohen, does this match what you've been hearing?  Does this sound reasonable to you?

Start time: 720.72
End time: 729.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it all does.  I posit that VR is dead in the water until it stops looking like a toaster, just trying  to have sex with your forehead.

Start time: 730.62
End time: 731.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'd agree with you on that.

Start time: 731.62
End time: 741.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just showed you the two, I just showed you the Lumis optics, right?  That's proof that they're coming and coming from a number of manufacturers.

Start time: 741.68
End time: 744.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are those AR or VR?  Those are AR.

Start time: 744.70
End time: 752.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are AR.  And by the way, when you say do they do AR or VR, whenever you see new optics from now  on they're going to do both.

Start time: 753.16
End time: 762.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But something like those, those wouldn't be great virtual reality because they're glasses  you can see outside them.  So they're not immersive virtual realities we're used to.

Start time: 763.36
End time: 775.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll see.  The optics from what I'm hearing are going to turn opaque or black and you can have some  things that make your eyes totally black if you want to get full on into VR land.

Start time: 776.08
End time: 778.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can still see on the sides.  I think VR has to be immersive.

Start time: 778.62
End time: 788.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, you can have ways to cover that up.  Put a bag over your head.  Yeah, I mean, does that bother me with glasses?  No, if my glasses turn black, you know.

Start time: 788.76
End time: 796.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess it's what the VR is for.  To me, VR is a gaming.  You're all into VR, Georgia Dow.  I love VR.  You have set up a room just for your vibe.

Start time: 797.10
End time: 800.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to be buying a house just for VR.  Wait a minute.

Start time: 800.72
End time: 801.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, really?

Start time: 802.52
End time: 855.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Kind of.  Yeah.  No, that's not even, that's not a lot.  Does it have a holodeck?  We're buying, well hopefully at one point, yes.  No, we're buying a house, but we're going to make sure that we have enough space to be  able to have a really nice VR room.  You want a room, a dedicated VR room.  Because if you're going to buy a house, you want it all, right?  It's like our gaming den.  It just has to have.  Doesn't everyone have that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some day.  So I think that all of us agree that AR is something that Apple is deeply looking into.  I think that where I might disagree throughout is the timeline.  I don't think that this is going to be coming out this year.  I don't think it's going to be coming out next year either because Apple does not do  well when they're the first ones out of the gate.  They're not the first ones.  HoloLens is already out.  HoloLens is not really a viable product.  And they don't do well until everyone else has kind of gone out, seen what they've done.  And then Apple goes out and takes a look at all the data and does it better.  And that's when Apple is exceptionally successful.

Start time: 855.72
End time: 885.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're forgetting about something, that this is not the first time Apple is coming to the  rodeo and Microsoft is already out.  They're not the first one.  And they're not the first one in any stretch of the imagination.  There's dozens of companies that are making augmented reality stuff.  It just hasn't gotten to consumers because it has not gotten to the small enough sizes.  But whether Apple does it or not, small size glasses are coming this year.  They are not coming next year.  They're coming this year.

Start time: 886.66
End time: 908.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love that.  I'm totally not against it.  It just seems like without the actual data of people using the products, Apple's going  to say, listen, we're going to wait around and see.  See what people like, what they don't like so that they can fix it, change it, make it  better.  They have all this money.  There's no reason that they have to be the first ones out of the gate.  It doesn't benefit them in any way, shape or form.  Being first- You're wrong about that.

Start time: 908.94
End time: 987.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sets Apple, and by the way, I've been talking to executives at competitors and the competitors  believe I'm right about this.  And the competitors believe from China, believe Apple is two years ahead of the rest of the  industry with these announcements that are coming.  This is very important for Apple to nail because if they miss a user interface switch, and  this is what we're in, that's why I called my book and we called our book Fourth Transformation  because it's the fourth user interface switch of our lifetimes.  You know, when we went from DOS to Windows, Borland and WordPerfect went away and they  were dramatically important companies of the day.  And when we went to touch computing on our phones, Nokia and Blackberry went away for  all intents and purposes, right?  Because they did not bet on the new user interface.  And Microsoft knows this because they missed last time.  They have to win in this space or they're going to lose a lot of their business to others.  And Apple knows this as well.  They're the ones that are expected to show up once in a while and really wow us with  something new.  And that is coming this year, not next year.  Next year is too late because Microsoft, Facebook, Google are all going to unclog  mixed reality glasses in the next 18 months.

Start time: 990.18
End time: 1056.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I absolutely think Apple's working on AR.  I think there's no question.  Tim Cosey even said it in effect.  Many times every week.  Every week.  For 17 weeks now.  I don't know.  And certainly Apple has in the past, and it's getting to be the distant past, by the way,  some transformative inventions that they've really, the iPhone is the best example.  iPod.  I guess you could argue about the iPad, which sales have been dropping dramatically.  And I think you could also argue about the Apple Watch, which has not, in my opinion,  been successful.  I wonder if Apple has what it takes to transform.  I agree with you.  I think there's two interfaces that are coming.  Augmented reality is one.  I think voice interface is also a very important shift.  Apple sucks at that.  Yeah, Siri's terrible.  It's laggard.  It's the fourth worst choice out there after Amazon and Google and Cortana, then Siri.  So I don't know if Apple has, I don't know if Apple killed Siri.  Apple took a good product and made it terrible.  Time out, time out, time out.

Start time: 1056.72
End time: 1067.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had dinner with Tom, who still works at Apple and is one of the three guys who started  Siri.  Remember, Siri was launched on that couch right there.  I have Adam Chayer.  Yeah, Adam.

Start time: 1068.76
End time: 1071.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then Adam went out and started Viv, and they sold it to Samsung.

Start time: 1071.66
End time: 1121.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's the second part of my story.  Let's go one at a time.  I had dinner with Tom three years ago, and I asked him, and this was at a venture capital  party.  The venture capitalist was Gary Morgenthaler of Morgenthaler Ventures, which now is called  Canvas.VC.  I was sitting in his backyard because they keep inviting me to this party.  Why?  Because Gary Morgenthaler says, only two people understood Siri, me and Steve Jobs.  So it all wraps up together because when Tom and I had dinner three years ago, I asked  him, what are you learning about running Siri?  And he says, I've learned that Google is beating us.  And I said, how do you know that?  He says, well, we instrumented Google and we know that their AI is learning faster than  I know that by using it.

Start time: 1121.76
End time: 1128.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any idiot knows that.  That's obvious.  But this was three years ago before it was obvious.  I asked Siri this morning, what time is kickoff in the Super Bowl?

Start time: 1128.90
End time: 1145.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And its response was, that's a very interesting question.  Siri's a moron.  I swear it's Siri more than I do at any human.  It's not letting me talk because there's a...  Because you're talking nonstop and you're spouting nonsense, Robert.  But he said something very important.  He said, we are going to have to rebuild Siri from scratch.

Start time: 1148.68
End time: 1180.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was three years ago and they're going to launch it next year.  Now the second part of the story is Viv because his two friends left Apple and started this  company named Viv.  And when I saw it a year ago, a year and two months ago, I asked Adam Chyre, are you going  to sell this back to Apple?  Because it's way better than what Apple has.  It's way better than Siri.  And he says, he told me, no, I'm not going to sell to a big company because I think this  is important to make a company around and go independent.  And then nine months later, he sells to Samsung.  Why?

Start time: 1181.30
End time: 1184.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You haven't proven anything except that Apple has lost its mojo.

Start time: 1185.02
End time: 1196.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't see Apple as the horses to do this.  Apple's produced crap for the last three years.  There's no way they're going to jump on this AR thing and turn it around.  I doubt Microsoft will, although Microsoft's way ahead of the game.

Start time: 1197.51
End time: 1201.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They bought the best companies on the field.  They bought Siri.  You tell me they're not going to do anything?

Start time: 1201.82
End time: 1203.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They bought Siri.  How did that work out?

Start time: 1204.11
End time: 1209.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They bought Tory.  Siri was the most profitable acquisition of all time.  It's a piece of crap.

Start time: 1209.86
End time: 1214.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did that work out for Apple?  That made more money for Apple than any other Apple.  Siri did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How did Siri make any money for Apple?

Start time: 1217.62
End time: 1226.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because when they first shipped on the iPhone, I think, for the 4S, that was the only feature  that mattered.  And they sold billions of dollars the first day.

Start time: 1227.26
End time: 1232.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I won't dispute that they tricked people, but I don't think they produced a product of any value.  I disagree with you.

Start time: 1234.53
End time: 1248.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Siri is a dramatically important product just because it sucks now.  Then you're going to see that the new one doesn't suck.  And what's worse is when you go to the glasses, you only have room for one voice interface.  No, I agree.  I agree.

Start time: 1249.58
End time: 1263.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that this, the AR and voice will be, can be magical transformation.  And I'm not saying it's impossible for Apple to do this.  I just say there hasn't been a lot of evidence in the last couple of years.  You can make all the acquisitions you want.  They know how to do this.

Start time: 1264.10
End time: 1274.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the last five years, you have to look at what he's been doing under the covers.  He's been working on this for seven years.  He spent more than $10 billion.  Everybody knows you can look at the patents.

Start time: 1276.30
End time: 1313.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that though they are definitely working on it, I think that the use case for AR is still weak.  People don't really know how they would use it, what would be the best cases to use it, when would they use it.  And I love virtual reality and I love AR as well.  So I think that it's the future.  But the fact of Apple jumping in at the head of the game at this time, again, just seems like way too soon for Apple.  Once it becomes more mainstream, once people understand it, trust it, feel comfortable with it, that would make the most sense for Apple to end up investing and actually launching a product.  Because whenever Apple even coughs or has a cold, something goes wrong.  They lose a lot of money in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the best way to tell behavior of any unitary source, item, person is from what they did before.  Apple's a very pattern oriented company.  When they jump out of their patterns, they don't actually do that well.  So I think that they'll do something that'll be amazing.  I just think that our timelines are different.

I mean, this would be the time from a point from a corporate point of view because it's  a big anniversary and all that stuff.  I just I wonder I wonder if Apple's got the what it's what it's going to take.  But you know what?  We don't know.  We'll find out.  We should make that we should bet some big thing.

But the question is, what is really going to hit with consumers?  And we're talking about that.  Yeah, that is an area that Apple has not at all been consistent with for the past few  years.

Transcript:  Well, I love the this is one of the few cases.  I do martial arts and I love doing martial arts.  And this is great.  I can actually use my martial arts skills and interact with the world.  I think that the difference in why a lot of people find VR a little bit more exhausting is because it is.  You're actually moving around.  This is not like the old gaming where you're doing this to decompress and be relaxed.  This is going to make you a little bit more anxious.  It's going to burn off some energy.  It's going to make you feel exhausted after that.  And there's definitely a certain amount of mental and visual fatigue that you're going through because your brain is processing at a much faster rate during while you're playing these games.  And so for a lot of cases, I think it's just because it's a little bit more tiresome.  There's a big setup that comes to it.  You have to make sure that everything's on.  You have to clear your playing space.  And so it's not like the usual games where you can sit there and relax.  This is the opposite experience to that.  And that's what I enjoy about it.  But it's not something that I could play for five hours during the day.  I think that as we go and it becomes much more mobile and it's easier to set up and the headsets are not like toasters that are doing things to your face.  As Peter mentioned, I think that then it's going to be a much easier to use and there's going to be a greater set of people that are going to want to jump in.  But its use cases are huge.  I just don't think that the public, the general public has embraced that yet.  And I think that they're testing out different things.  But yeah, like the ability of super hot to actually look all the way through an environment and your movement determines the speed of which the bad guys are coming towards you.  It's a really neat experiential gaming thing.  But if you don't like experiential gaming, then VR is not really for you.  Well, I feel like that's a niche.  I don't know.

Transcript:  I mean, take a look at using VR as a way of acclimatizing people to phobias that they've got.  This is something that I'm sure Georgia can speak to a lot better than I can.  But PTSD, right?  I mean, that's yeah.  Yeah, no.

Start time: 1761.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For that, for when you first go into surgeries and before they've already used AR in order to take a look at cranium sizes and what are they going to go in and how are they going to do that?  We talked to a pediatric cardiologist who actually did a 3D rendering of the baby's heart.

Start time: 1781.06
End time: 1792.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They did a scan of it and then practiced or explored the heart so that he'd know what he was going to see when he actually did the surgery.  But those are niches.  I mean, I'm not saying they're bad niches.  It could be for training for many things.

Start time: 1794.02
End time: 1831.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, again, the closer that we are to reality, the better we are going to simulate the real thing once we go out and use it.  And Peter's right.  The same thing for phobias, for post-traumatic stress, for social anxiety, for flight simulators.  Again, the closer we can get to actually being there, the better we're going to be able to deal with that.  And also interacting with other people in ways that we couldn't do it before, going able to actually see things that are happening on the other side and interact with that.  I think that it's really cool.  I just still think that we are far off from it being accepted and mainstream.  And I think that those are always things that Apple likes to have in play before they decide to jump into a field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that we can argue about the specifics of who's going to do it and how soon.  But I think what we can probably all agree on is that this is an interface that might have some interest.

They're getting ready for this and they already have it working on the iPhone.  This is always a challenge with new technologies because when they first emerged, they're toy-like.

The big boys are going to do it in the next 18 months.  And it's not just Apple.  It's Google just bought iFluence, which is a big eye sensor company that's going to be part of these glasses.  And Facebook bought iTribe, which is eye sensor.  So they're building a pair of glasses.  Microsoft is obviously building them.  Google's building them and on and on.  So you're going to see many companies in the next 18 months un-cloak and ship new products that are going to be in the 2 to 4-ounce size of glasses that are going to look like the Snapchat glasses.

If you are hiring, if you're in that enviable and yet somehow unenviable position of having  to do the hiring at your company, you ought to know about Zip Recruiter because Zip Recruiter  takes all the pain out and makes you even more importantly, more effective at finding  just the right person.  Let's stipulate for the moment that there is a perfect person for that job opening.  There's somebody, if you hired them, it would make such a difference in your company.  It could transform your company.  And we can also probably from experience know that there might be people that would be less  good in that job.  Maybe some that would actually hurt your company.  So how do you get to the right person?  You don't know what job boards they're reading.  You don't know where they are.  You need help.  And that's where Zip Recruiter is amazing.  One post to Zip Recruiter puts your job listing on 200 plus job boards, including Twitter  and Facebook.  And then don't worry.  I know that sometimes people go, I don't want that.  I'm going to have 100 million emails and phone calls.  No, it all goes into the Zip Recruiter interface, which is great because not only does it make  it easy to sort through all your applicants, they pre-format the resumes so they're uniform.  It's easy to read.  You could set up questions, screening questions, true, false, yes, no, multiple choice essay  questions.  So you can automatically kind of narrow down the candidates.  Thumbs up and thumbs down, screen them, rate them, hire the right person fast.  That right person is out there.  This is the best way to find that person.  Zip Recruiter has been used by the Fortune 100 companies, thousands of small and medium  sized businesses.  It's just fantastic.  We've used it.  A million companies now use Zip Recruiter to do their hiring.  You should try it.  Go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit for a free trial.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twit.

But just a handful of people actually tried the technology.  And lately it's kind of come out that the technology they tried is nothing like what Magic Leap promises.  It requires a massive computer, big wires.  And in fact, they may be having trouble with the central technology in all this.

And the earlier optic would show six levels of depth and the new optic only shows two levels of depth.  So they gave away some of the secret sauce.

Transcript:  This is an unusual time in the industry.  And I think this is why Apple is going to behave differently than it did before.  When Apple started up, Waz told me that everybody ignored the personal computer industry for a couple of years, including his bosses.  He worked at HP and he said, I just want to work at HP forever.  I want to let HP build my motherboards.  And he tried to get the bosses at HP to build a personal computer and they said nobody's ever going to buy them.  Sort of like the skepticism around whether Apple can really change the world again.

Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes big companies are not the best places for these new ideas.  Let's speak of big companies.  Facebook announced its quarterly results from Q3 2016.  Another huge success for Facebook.  But what's really interesting, 84% of their total sales revenue came from mobile.  This was the question mark with Facebook back when they went public.  And Robert, to your credit, you've been saying Facebook's the one for at least a year.  For at least a year, a couple of years.  Daily active users, 1.18 billion.  Daily active users, unbelievable.  Monthly active users, 1.8 billion.  That's roughly a 16 or 17% increase year over year.  Mobile active users, every month, 1.66.  So mobile is clearly, you know, this is where Facebook lives and this is where you want to live.  Anything to say about that?  Do you want to take a victory lap, Robert, or anything?  No, I'm going to save the victory lap for June.

Transcript:  We'll have you part of it.  You know what?  When Apple, first of all, that's going to be, this will be the first announcement in the round building, right?  Yeah.

Start time: 2551.84
End time: 2582.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I talked to somebody who is working on the building, I talked to a few people who work on the building,  and they say it's unbelievable inside.  They said that more new technology went into the building or the design of the building  and what's inside the building than any other building in the world.  So that's going to be quite something to see alone, right?  If you got an invite to go see that for the first time, I think you would go.  I would certainly go.  I'm going to beg, you know, I haven't been invited to one of these events in a long time,

Start time: 2582.82
End time: 2618.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but I'm going to beg for an invite to this first event.  I already started begging, baby.  Well, I think you'll get in.  If not, we'll be on Twitter talking about it, right?  We'll sit outside on the street in Cupertino saying,  well, I don't know what's going on.  But it does make sense.  Will they make an announcement?  We know there'll be an iPad announcement, probably new Mac's announcement, probably in March.  You think this is when they would announce this or you think it's more like June?  I think it's June because they need to show off the expansiveness of their vision about mixed reality and all that.

Start time: 2621.94
End time: 2704.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  And the iPad will have a prime sense sensor in it.  So they're going to probably ship it really fast so that developers have something to build games  and other things for the new iPhone and the new glasses and the new iPad coming out.  So I won't be shocked that if in June they announce it and then they say, oh, the iPad is available right now or within two weeks.  Right, at Christmas you can get the...  iPhone comes in September, October like it usually does.  And then the glasses come later or come with the phone too.  I won't be shocked if they all come at one time.  The real problem, and you're starting to see senses of this, is they don't have the same sense of reality.  They don't know that they can make enough.  And in fact, I'll say they can't make enough because like you said, they sold 78 million iPhones last quarter alone.  And anything that looks at all cool is going to drive that number up this year.  Right.  So let's say they do have an expansive new phone that's clear that you look through and do Pokemon hunting and you put it in a headset and play VR and play AR.  That alone is going to drive sales double of what they were last quarter.  And then they can't get enough screens to make 150 million iPhones right now.  So that's...

Google's having a lot of trouble making its...  And they're not even selling anywhere near those units.  The Google Pixel, it's been out of stock for a while.  I can go on and on.

Transcript:  You've seen what happens when they're able to ship a whole bunch at the same time.  There's problems and really it's better to take longer.  And it also brings up demand.  Then it also says, oh, we have shortages, which makes people want to buy them more.  And it seems more sought after.  So that artificially helps push.

Transcript:  Do you think that they're faking it, Peter?  Sometimes I do.  I think that...  I mean, Tim Cook is the master...  The supply line master, right?  That was his reputation as COO of Apple before he assumed the reins from Steve.  So I don't think that anything in Apple's supply line is out of Apple's control or out of Apple's management most of the time.  And I do think that it benefits them to exit quarters with a healthy backlog of orders for products that haven't shipped.  Because it does create the illusion of scarcity, the illusion of higher demand than there would need to be if production was ramped up to equal it.  So yeah, I think it benefits them.  And I think that they've done it for a very long time, very effectively.

Wires, batteries, maybe antennas, stuff like that.  Yeah, they'll be a big-ass bezel.  I won't be shocked.  And by the way, the lower end phones will still do mixed reality, but won't be clear  like that.  So I won't be shocked if they do trickery in conjunction with also having a clear piece  of glass.

You know, they took the headphone jack out and people clearly were not deterred by that.  I'm kind of surprised, frankly.  I thought that was a...

Start time: 3097.06
End time: 3105.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 3105.96
End time: 3132.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the one argument I count as, which is that they didn't want to distract from  this year's phone by going, doing too much.  So they thought, well, we're going to take the hit in 2016.  We'll remove the jack then because we would have had to by 2017 anyway.  And then people will have forgotten.  And it didn't hurt the sales, obviously.  And it probably helps the sales of Apple's Beats and other Bluetooth headsets, including  the AirPods.  So I'm sure...

Transcript:  Apple is moving toward a wireless world from what I'm hearing.  And I haven't confirmed this, so I can't say it's happening definitely, but it certainly  makes sense that we're going to see wireless power in a new way delivered on these new  devices.  We've been talking about this on MacBreak Weekly.

Start time: 3150.27
End time: 3161.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this one I really don't buy.  Renee's talked about and others.  This wireless charging where you don't actually have to put the phone on anything.  It just goes...  It charges it across the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was at Qualcomm getting a tour of their R&D lab and they showed me wireless charging  in a number of different ways.  You don't need to lay anything on top of anything anymore.  The receiver of the power is going to be built into the phone or into your glasses or into  your watch and it'll receive power from some distance.  I don't know how much that distance is.  Qualcomm said it was a few feet, but does Apple have something better than that?

Start time: 3192.78
End time: 3219.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this to me violates the rules of physics.  Remember, the energy dissipates by the inverse of the square very rapidly reduces over a  short distance.  It's not going to be feet.  If anything, it's going to be inches.  The amount of energy you would have to pump out of that thing to charge a phone three  feet away will kill you.  You will have cancer.  It's not a good idea.

Transcript:  I disagree.  The people who are working on it, there's a kid at Stanford who has a lab that is working  on it, and there's a company called Ubeam and others who are working on wireless  transmission.  They can focus and deep focus the power around you.  It's been debunked.

Transcript:  It was not debunked.  This week alone, they just showed off to the press how it works.  And everybody says, oh, we were wrong about this.  So look at the Verge or other companies about Ubeam and you'll see that the journalists  saw it this week and said it works.  But anyways, there's stuff coming and we'll see how good it is.  Qualcomm, Broadcom both showed me wireless power that doesn't need to be touching a coil  or something like that.  So we're going to see new kinds of wireless power that can go further than just a few  inches.  So the Ubeam...

My issue with charging is just having to actually insert a device and I'm trying to get it in  and it's dark and I'm like, where's the stupid wire?

And I come back to it and it's still only half charged or whatever.

Start time: 3373.14
End time: 3389.40

Transcript:  Yeah.  Hallcom showed me wireless charging for driverless cars.  Admittedly that plate is, you know, within a few inches.  They say it's 90% efficient.  We'll see.  Broadcom showed me a coil.  And keep in mind the reason that somebody in the chat room was saying Tesla, Tesla tried  to do that years ago and failed, but the new wireless charging has a huge number of computers  on it.  And it's aiming at figuring out where the receivers are above the coil.  And it's then focusing the energy on that receiver so that you can put your hand in  between and it won't zap you or do anything negative.  There's a lot of technology going into these and they are coming.  I mean, you're starting to see them at Starbucks, even wireless little chargers, but you have  to have those little receivers built into your phones.  And I don't have a phone that has it built in yet.  And I don't have a watch that has it built in.  In fact, most of these phones are losing wireless charging.

The two in ones will feature an included stylus, full touchscreen support and the ability to  run Android apps right out of the box.  Very nice.  On Thursday, February 9th, Google is expected to unveil its big version two update for Android  Wear.  Of course, it's rumored at this point, but it is expected.  Also expected to launch with the news are two new watches both developed in partnership  between Google and LG.  And also on February 9th, Twitter is expected to report its earnings for the last quarter  of 2016.  Twitter's had a rough time gaining new users throughout the course of 2016 and has declined  in five consecutive earnings report periods.  As well, Twitter now faces even stiffer competition from others, including Snap, that just filed  for its own IPO, as you know, last week.

And by the way, he was the one who leaked out the first images of that LG Android Wear  2.0 watch.  So that's coming out.  I'm actually getting the Samsung Plus should come on the 13th in the next week or so.  That's the Chromebook that has also a stylus and is a convertible, much like the Dell.  It's going to be an interesting spring for Chromebooks.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.  Why go to the post office when you can do everything you would do at the post office  without leaving your desk?  Stamps.com makes it possible.  You can buy and print real US postage whenever you need it, right from your desk, with your  computer, your printer.  It's not a postage meter.  You don't need anything special.  You've already got what you need.  And the best part is, you know, they've got a USB scale.  I'll show you how you can get that for free.  You put the stuff on there.  You always have exactly the right amount of postage.  It'll make suggestions for different ways to mail something to save you money, like  media mail, if it's appropriate.  It will print out all the forms you need if you're doing certified mail or if you're  doing express mail or maybe you're doing an overseas shipment.  It'll print out the customs force.  In fact, not just the form, it'll pre-fill it with the information.  So if you're an eBay seller, Amazon, Etsy, you've got the buyer's information, it just  fills out the form.  Everything you need, you print it, you're ready to go.  And then a uniformed official of the US government will come and pick it up, the mailman.  He'll come and pick it up.  There's even a button on the stamps.com site that says, OK, come get it.  You literally don't have to go to the post office anymore.  We've got a great deal if you want to try it, a four-week trial that includes, it's  worth $110, that scale I mentioned, you pay the shipping and handling on that, which is  five bucks.  They make that up with a $5 supply kit and $55 in free postage.  Literally, postage coupons you can use over the first few months of your account.  You've got to try it.  Go to stamps.com.

Transcript:  Leo, there was a company at CES this year, and I'm sorry that I don't remember their name,  but they have sensors that you strap to your feet so you can actually do...  and, you know, hand control so you could actually do like a Hadoken from Street Fighter at somebody  and or, you know, like a round kick and actually have it track.  It looked really kind of cool.  That's neat.

Transcript:  Well, the cool thing about this thing that I'm talking about that you strap to your feet  is that this actually transmitted a haptic response back through your feet.  So if you wanted to simulate the sense of crushing snow or walking across gravel or pea-sized rocks,  for example, you could do that, or splashing in water.  So there were some really cool ideas that were being introduced with that thing.

Transcript:  I hate to bring us down to earth, but I guess we have a few stories that relate to modern times.  The current times, Google, for instance, has been...  A US judge, a magistrate in Philadelphia, Thomas Reuter, has ruled that Google must hand over emails  even if they're stored on a foreign server.  You remember Microsoft had a similar case, which they fought, and one email stored in Ireland,  a district judge said, no, they don't have to hand that over.  So we have two conflicting opinions here, and I'm sure appeals will come  in both cases.  On the one hand, if you use Gmail or you use MicrosoftsOutlook.com,  I don't know if you have a reasonable expectation of privacy  just because your data is stored on an international server.  And yet it makes it difficult for companies to operate because it isn't long before every country says  you have to have a... Russia's already doing this.  Russia closed down LinkedIn, remember, in Russia, because they didn't store their data on Russian soil.

Transcript:  I think the question is not just, like, do you, but should you?  Like, what kind of legislation do we want to have to be able to have what is unlawful versus lawful search  and seizure to what you have and what is privacy versus not?  Because now everything is going to be served onto the cloud.  And so when we make that change versus where mail was actually stored inside of our house  and you could not get to it versus being on our computer where part of that is not, you know,  tracked onto our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and even Google says that.  They say sometimes in the court case, it says sometimes it breaks up email into pieces  for network performance reasons.  So it doesn't know where emails are stored.  It doesn't know what country.  I guess my point would be...  Well, I think a normal person would say it's trickery to say, well, it's, you know,  part of it's in Ireland, part of it's in Denmark.  If it's a U.S. company and the defendant in both cases is a U.S. citizen,  what does it matter where the data has been routed?  And I think most normal people would say that.  Maybe now I'm wrong.  In any event, that's one situation.  The other down-to-earth situation has to do with the new chairman of the FCC,  Ajit Pai.  We were all a little worried when Trump made him the chairman of the FCC  because he's a commissioner.  He was on the commission, didn't need Senate approval for that reason,  but elevated to the chairmanship replacing Tom Wheeler,  who's been a surprisingly strong advocate for net neutrality and other things.  Ajit Pai very much against net neutrality.  Pro-competition, I guess a better way to say it from his point of view would be  he's for competition and against government regulation on the Internet.  We might be able to agree on that.  But on Friday, what one commissioner called a clean out the trash moment,  Pai made a bunch of rulings that threw out things that the FCC had been working on,  one of which was a kind of a pet project of ours was the idea to open up  cable set-top boxes to competitors.  So if you're a Comcast customer, instead of having to rent a kind of low tech box  from Comcast, you get something much more interesting from say Apple or Google  or Roku.  That move, which had been approved by Tom Wheeler, was reversed on Friday.  Pai also announced that the FCC in a letter to the big mobile carriers,  the FCC was going to drop its investigation into zero rating.  This is another one where I think it's the average person says,  what's wrong with zero rating?  This is a great thing.  And it's kind of harder to convince them that in fact it's detrimental to net neutrality.  Any thoughts about either of those?

Transcript:  Because the whole experience of using cable is sort of artificially screwed up by the  fact that you have to negotiate everything through the cable company and the cable box.  And look, I understand that they want to be the gatekeepers of revenue and that the  entertainment companies are content to make them the, you know, the best of the best.  The gatekeepers of revenue.  And I understand that there are going to be issues like having to authenticate different  services and different channels and stuff like that on my Apple TV.  But, you know, when I look at like trying to use, I'm an Xfinity customer, for example,  I'm a Comcast customer because they're literally the only game in town.  You know, I can get dish and direct TV, but there's no competition.  You know, they're functionally the only broadband slash cable provider.  So I'm either stuck with X1 or, you know, GTFO, as they say.  And I've done things like gotten a TiVo and then you have to get a cable card and it never,  never really kind of gels quite right.  Or you get an Apple TV or a Roku box or something else and you plug it in and you can use it  in addition to what you're using with cable.  But you can't really cut the cord.  You can't really do that.  And this was an opportunity for customers to kind of divest themselves of that hostage  relationship that we've got with the cable companies that I thought was a very pro consumer  choice or a pro consumer move.  And to see them backpedal on it tells me or it affirms to me that that this administration  or at least a GPi is, you know, more interested in corporate harmony than he is in providing  anything of benefit to actual people who are paying for this crap.  That's my rant.

Transcript:  Strong recommendation for the back channel interview Susan Crawford did with the outgoing  chairman, Tom Wheeler, who has some very strong words for AgitPi and what he's up to.  And I think defends the notion of Internet regulation.  I remember talking to John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of the EFF.  He said the EFF board was really torn over this because many of them said we don't want  any government regulation of the Internet.  That's always a bad idea.  They're guaranteed to do it poorly.  But many of them also saw the necessity of protecting net neutrality against companies  that don't really have an interest in preserving net neutrality but instead maximizing profit.  Wheeler's response to this conundrum is people say the problem is government are so wrong.  This is so surprising because we thought Wheeler was going to be terrible when he came in.  He was a former lobbyist for the cable and the wireless industry.  But he turned out that he kind of knew what he was talking about.  He says because the people say the problem is government are so wrong, the government  is the people.  It's where we come together to solve our common problems.  It's a messy process and it's a painful process.  But if we can't work out things there, we're in a whole hell of a lot of trouble.  He says what's going to end up happening, in fact it's already started, Pi is using  the excuse that we're going to modernize the FCC to move much of the FCC's authority to  the Federal Trade Commission.  Of that, Wheeler says it's a fraud.  The FTC doesn't have rulemaking authority.  They've got enforcement authority and their authority is whether or not something is unfair  or deceptive.  They have to worry about everything from computer chips to bleach labeling.  Of course the carriers want telecom issues to get lost in that morass.  That was the strategy all along.  One more action on Sweep It Out Friday.  And this one, I'm not going to weigh in on one way or the other.  It seems on the face of it a bad idea.  The FCC is revoking permission from companies that have been offering lifeline broadband  service.  You may remember in the mid-80s the FCC created lifeline service for telephones.  It's a charge on our bills that pays for inexpensive phone service for poor people.  This was expanded last year by the FCC to include broadband, to subsidize broadband for people  who couldn't afford it.  Quite reasonably, I think, saying that everybody needs access these days to the internet for  education, for information, for participation in government.  That was reversed on Friday by Pi, who eliminated nine companies from providing federally subsidized  internet to the poor.  So the lifeline broadband project is now dead as well.  And that seems like a serious problem.  Some say, well, it was rife with corruption or was misrun, mismanaged.  You're going to have to prove that to me.  But those three things put together all on Friday seem to me that the FCC is moving very  much in the favor of corporate interests and very much against the interests of the people.

There's not homework that children are going to be doing or projects that are going to  be done that you can do without having internet access.  And that also cuts off access to information, which is a really big deal.

Transcript:  Speaking of zero rating and the EFF, they had, I thought back in, I guess it was a year ago, it was  February of last year.  They did a look at zero rating and why they've got a problem with it.  And, you know, not only are people clearly falling off on that end of the digital divide,  you know, people who are underprivileged, people who don't live in well served markets are not  able to get high speed internet communication or internet access.  They don't even have a device that can connect to the internet, let alone the access to do it.  But with zero rating, you've got consumers increasingly funneled towards specific types of  content that the service providers like T-Mobile and the other companies that are doing zero  rating have deemed, you know, to be free.  But that, you know, all of a sudden you're disincented from using services or, you know,  products that aren't free.  I know I've even run into this as a T-Mobile customer.  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  Is this music streaming service that I'm using actually something that's supported by my  data plan?  No.  Okay.  Well, I don't know that I necessarily want to listen in, you know, listen to this stuff  then and waste my bandwidth because I've only got X gigabytes to use every month.  So I know from my own experience, just anecdotally, that I'll police myself if I, if I get a  I think a very dangerous precedent, you know, where consumers are insensitive to value some  types of data over another because you're getting them for free.  It just does.  It does not sit well with me at all.  It's just difficult to argue because when you say free consumers go, yeah, I like free.  So it's hard to convince them.  Well, this is a bad idea.

Start time: 4630.58

Transcript:  This is putting T-Mobile or Verizon or AT&T in charge of which services win.  And I think that's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  which services win and which services lose.  And it really impairs innovation.  I mean, and I have a dog in the sun.  I have to confess because we're an Internet consumed product and we're not zero rated  by anybody.  And so that means you're much more likely to listen to Spotify than you are to Twitter.  That's bad for me.  And I don't even care for me, frankly, because I think it's the it's the next thing that's  coming.  The next Twitter, whatever the next thing is, that's the one that's really going to hurt us.  We lose that.  Yeah.  Anyway, there you have it.  That's the FCC roundup for this week.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll talk about, oh, I don't know, something happy like ordering Starbucks from your Amazon  Echo.  Our show today brought to you by our Internet service provider, Fighting the Good Fight,  Sonic.com.  You know, we have if you ever want to experience wonderful Internet access, unlimited, no cap,  no zero rating.  Everything is the same.  Absolute net neutrality, a company that fights for your privacy, a company that fights government  orders whenever in every case you would want to try our Internet.  Come over to the studio and use our Sonic.  We've got was it 10 gigabits symmetric?  Ten gigabits up, ten gigabits down.  Now no machine we have can take care of ten.  So all the machines which have gigabit Ethernet are getting a gig both ways.  But that's good enough.  We should get one machine with a ten gigabit card just to see what that would be like in  life.  It's awesome.  Sonic is not available everywhere, I'm sorry to say, but businesses all over and homes  all over California could take advantage of Sonic's amazing Internet infrastructure with,  you know, let me give you, this is how it could be.  I like talking about this because this could be in your neck of the woods if there were  true competition.  Sonic delivers residential and business fiber to the premise, not to the curb, but into  the place, gigabit connectivity in San Francisco, the North Bay Area, the East Bay Area.  What do you get?  All right, you get, of course, you get a gigabit of Internet download speeds.  You get 15 email accounts.  You get a gigabyte of storage.  You get personal web hosting with a new domain.  You get fax line service.  You get a home phone.  All of this you get, a home phone with unlimited local and long distance calling.  You can even switch your existing number over from your, and you know how much?  $40 a month.  $40 a month!  And if you want TV, they can do that too.  They bundle it with DISH and save you $120 on your bill.  They stand up for your privacy.  Just look at the EFF scorecard.  Sonic's the best.  Sonic.com slash twit, go there right now and find out if you can get Sonic in your neighborhood.  You'll get your first month of Sonic Internet and phone service for free plus bundle it  with DISH and save $120 on your Sonic bill.  I know most of you who are listening can't get this.  I just want you to know it's possible in the United States.  This is a profitable, successful company that is doing the right thing.  Their customers, sonic.com slash twit.  We're so glad that they gave us 10 gigabit.  You know what's fun?  I like to do this though.  Go to fast.com.  That's the Netflix bandwidth tester.  I have to show my screen.  Here you go.  What are we getting now?  Oh, yeah, just 120 megabits per second.  That's all.  I love it.  All right.  Moving right along.  You can now order Starbucks from Alexa.

Transcript:  It just waits.  It makes it worse, but it's kind of cool.  Amazon, as long as we're talking about them, has now, they don't say how many prime members  they are.  But for the first time since 2013, they revealed the growth rate.  But according to Jason Del Rey, who did a little kind of figuring on recode.com, he  He last year did some calculations that came up with 46 million paying prime members.  And in Amazon's in earnings release this last past week, they said they added tens of millions  of new prime members in 2016.  So Jason's doing the calculation.  He says, well, let's see if it's 20 million on top of the 46 million, at least 66 million  prime members.  We don't know the real number, but that is a lot of money and billions of dollars just  from the prime subscription fee.

And so there's been a lot of venture capital raised on building it and there've been various  tests and so forth.  The tunnel Elon's going to do.  In fact, they started digging a test tunnel this week.  So this all came because Elon tweeted, oh, this traffic is killing me.  He drives back and forth from SpaceX to his office at Tesla in Los Angeles.  So over the weekend, workers built a test trench 30 feet wide, 50 feet long and 15 feet  deep on the grounds of SpaceX.  Musk says, we're just going to figure out what it takes to improve tunneling speed by  somewhere between 500 and 1000 percent.  We have no idea what we're doing.  He wants to dig a tunnel between the two corporate headquarters.  I don't know if he'd be the only guy who gets to drive it.  I think it'd be a great benefit for Tesla owners.  And frankly, that's you don't want gas vehicles in a tunnel.  You would want electric vehicles in a tunnel, right?  So you don't have to worry about emissions.  I just like that story.  I guess it's no weirder than Apple having augmented reality glasses and a clear phone  this year.

Transcript:  It's a bigger deal, though, right?  It's a really big undertaking to try to bore, like the idea of the Boring Company, to be  able to bore through great amounts of land.  It's not like you see it on video games.  There's many different things underneath the ground.  There's water systems and oil systems and different types of earth.  And so not to mention the amount of infrastructure that we already have built underground.  And so I think that the time and effort is a lot more than just being able to bore through  a lot of earth quickly, but going through the amount of how damaging it can be.  If you take a small creek that's underground and you've taken the water out of that creek,  then there might not be support for an area that could be miles away from that area.  So it's a huge undertaking.  I'm happy that he's trying it out.  I just don't know if it's going to be as easy to do as he believes it would be.

I think that often we stop ourselves because we think of all of the reasons that we shouldn't  do something and so we don't.  I think that he's more of a visionary and says, he believes in his own word and thoughts  and says, let's see if this could be reality or not.  I like the idea that he tries that.  I think that we need more people to be able to make a stand, try something.  If it doesn't work out, that's fine.  That's okay.  You learn another way not to bore through earth.

I think Elon shares an attribute that Steve Jobs had of not having any, most of us have  barriers to just kind of true creativity and just expansive generative thinking.  This is Steve Jobs from that interview that was unearthed, his vision of the world.  I'll never forget this quote because I think it informed why Steve could be as great as  he is.

That's a very limited life.  Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around  you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.  You can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people  can use.  Everything around you once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

Transcript:  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Well, I think that kind of a strong amount of narcissism that he had kind of helped that  in fact that he was an only child that wasn't really given a lot of nos also helped him  be able to say, I don't have to listen to you because I'm probably right and you're  not.  I think that's a very different personality type.  He's much more caring and actually much more sensitive to that, but he also has a strong  vision of can we do it better and if we could do it better, how would we do it and let's  try it out.  And luckily now he has the backing to be able to actually do that.  When he started out, he didn't.  So it's a really interesting personality type to that and I think that in our world now,  we really do, it would behoove us to kind of let go a little bit of our critical voice  of saying why I shouldn't and say, you know, why don't I try?

He once said that the reasonable man adapts himself to the world and the unreasonable  man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.  Therefore all progress is dependent on the unreasonable man.  Yes.  The expectation that we're just going to conform and sort of abide within society's  restrictions I think is an imagination killer and that's what he's talking about for sure.

Joseph Campbell said, you got to remember if you don't like the culture that you're  in, go make one of your, go make a new one.  You can make a new one.  So in every, in all of those respects, Musk, Jobs, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Campbell,  the common thread, they all, you're right, were damaged in different ways.  But the common thread is you can change your world.  You're not stuck with what you got.  That's powerful, powerful stuff.  So a little narcissism is not a bad thing.

And now I'm in the same generation as Jobs and in our generation it was not uncommon  to take psychedelics, whether it was LSD or psilocybin or mescaline.

This is an interesting story for Robert, the VR heavy Windows 10 creators update.  But also this new cloud version of Windows designed to compete against Chromebooks looks  to be a reality.  This ISO, you can install it.  It leaked out.  It's not a release by Microsoft.  It does require that you purchase all your apps from the Windows store.  It's expected to be shipping on less expensive computers, laptops, mostly for education.  Yeah, there it is.  It's Windows 10 minus the wide open app ecosystem.  You have to buy everything from the store.  I guess this goes with HoloLens a little bit, but the next version of Windows, which comes  out in the next couple of months, this spring is going to have considerable amount of VR  in it.  They have the holographic interface.  Have you been playing with that a little bit, Robert?

Transcript:  Let's talk about Oculus because Oculus just got a blow in their court case against Zenimax.  Oculus court decided we'll have to pay half a billion dollars to Zenimax.  Zenimax owns id software.  That's of course the company that created Doom and Quake.  John Carmack, who was one of the programmers there, left.  The story goes he saw an early demo of Oculus, got so excited about it he left id and went  and he's been accused of bringing with him trade secrets, reusing code, destroying evidence.  Problem is, of course, this is a jury trial in Dallas and I don't know how well the jury  understood what it was seeing.  But in any event, they eventually found Oculus liable for some instances of copyright infringement  and NDA violation, but they rejected the larger claim that Oculus had stolen trade secrets.  Nevertheless, 500 million dollars civil verdict, which will of course be appealed.  Is this damaging to Oculus, to its reputation?  I know it's because it's owned by Facebook.  They could probably afford the fine.

I think this comes out in the wash at the end of the day, but it shows that Carmack  doesn't understand the lie.  He very clearly admitted taking stuff out of a company and that's not legal.  You know, and it's the first thing you do when you I mean, I've left Microsoft and NEC  and Fast Company and Rackspace and at each one they have you sign a contract that you're  not allowed to take anything from your workplace.  He admitted it on Stan.  So that's why that's why he got whacked.  I can't say not to tell the truth, but you know, when you break the law, you're going  to get you're going to see consequences when there's so many billions of dollars involved.

We have advertisers for my mattress and my sheets.  I know that's odd, isn't it?  But I love these sheets.  These are from Boland Branch.  They are beautiful 100% organic cotton sheets that they start out super soft.  They get softer over time.  Boland Branch is a great company.  They use only sustainable and responsible methods of sourcing and manufacturing.  And because you're buying it directly from them, you're eliminating the department store  markup which is massive.  Great sheets like these.  $1000 in the department store.  Only a couple of hundred bucks when you buy it directly from Boland Branch.  And they donate a portion of every sale to help fight human trafficking.  They're very conscientious.  I really like it.  Thousands of five star reviews.  They've been written about in the Wall Street Journal and Forbes fast company.  Even three US presidents sleep on Boland Branch sheets.  You could try them right now.  Risk free for 30 nights.  If you don't love them, send them back for a full refund, but you're not going to want  to send them back.  I should warn you, you're probably just going to end up buying more.  Either way, the packaging, I don't know if we have a picture on the website, they come  in these beautiful boxes with satin ribbons.  If you were giving these as wedding gifts, you wouldn't have to wrap them.  When I got mine, I thought, what is this?  Then I opened it up and saw it's the sheets.  They're so nice.  They're so comfortable.  You deserve great sheets.  And now you don't have to be a millionaire to buy them.  In fact, we're going to save you an additional 50 bucks off your first set of sheets.  If you go to B-O-L-L, Ball, like Cotton Bowl, Boland Branch, B-R-A-N-C-H today, use the  promo code TWIT and you'll save $50 off your first set of sheets.  Won't be your last, I promise you.

Transcript:  Snap has announced where I guess they filed, and now we're seeing leaked stories, for their  IPO.  And the speculation is they'll try to raise as much as $3 billion.  Some interesting stuff, though, if you read the filing, Snap paid out $58 million to media  companies last year.  They have a multi-year contract with Google for storage for cloud services, $400 million  a year for five years minimum.  That's a $2 billion commitment to use Google Cloud.  We did know that Snap's user base, the Snapchat user base, was not growing as fast last quarter,  Instagram taking a dent, but they did add 50 million new users last year, but only 5  million in the fourth quarter.  We also found out that one of the founders of Snap, who was kind of forced out a few  years ago and sued, got a $158 million payout.  Now he's not going to be in the money when Snap goes public, and it's likely that the  two Snap founders will become instant billionaires with this IPO.  So I love reading these, I don't read them, but I love reading about people who have read  these filings because it's really interesting to see what Snapchat's up to.  Robert, are they, do you think, if you invest in Snap, in their IPO, are you buying into  this augmented reality future?

That's online at twit.tv slash survey.  We do not keep track of your email address.  No salesman will call.  We're just trying to get a better idea of who you all are.  Twit.tv slash survey.  Thanks everybody.  Have a great week.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you Peter.
