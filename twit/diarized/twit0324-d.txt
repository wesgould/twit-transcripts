Transcript:  say. Yeah yeah the 60 minutes crew has been releasing little tidbits over the  past week and some of the stuff we had heard before you know what I realized as  they were releasing some of his comments and his sentiments about you know  Microsoft being unimaginative and what he really thought of Bill Gates is that  right after Steve Jobs died and it's quite natural to do this people kind of  took a very rosy view of him. Yes. Even though I mean we all knew you know we've  worked with Apple some of us you know either knew Steve Jobs or interact with  them in some way and we understood he was a tough businessman and sometimes  an easy guy but you almost forgot that for about a week or so and now some of  these comments are coming back you know there's a reason he was so successful I  mean he took no prisoners he always admitted to you know stealing some of  the best ideas you know whatever he saw you know competition he was talking  about crushing it you know wanted to crush Android thought it was a stolen  product these things he's a guy who went his whole own way his whole life so it  shouldn't be a big surprise but I'm hoping that there's one or two

Isaacson on 60 minutes says he's not of Steve  Jobs he's not warm and fuzzy he was very petulant he was very brittle he  could be very very mean to people at times it's really a one-two punch you're  right we had the we had the eulogy the Hageeography last week and now we get  the other side of Steve Jobs and it's not pretty in many ways it's not pretty  I mean saying things like I don't care how much he says to Eric Schmidt  apparently in that in that famous meeting in Palo Alto at the coffee shop  it's not about money you could give me five billion dollars I got plenty of  money I want to crush Android I'm going to use every till my dying breath and  every penny of apples apples forty billion dollars in cash to crush

Start time: 370.54
End time: 415.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well what's interesting is... Go ahead Lance. I was just gonna say maybe he mellowed or  maybe he's been a hundred percent consistent I mean I think the way he  worked was that he believed you know for his business it was good to see good  ideas you know going to to Xerox you know seeing seeing you know an interface  you know a graphical interface and stealing and going and making something  better seeing the mouse and making it usable but you know he's okay with other  people copying his ideas as long as they don't become too successful doing so.  Right. I mean that was really it once he saw them rise to the level of a threat  they said okay games over now you know we're done playing you took my stuff  you're becoming successful I'm gonna go after you I'm going to crush you because  this is how you do business this is how you win.

Transcript:  thing absolutely Samsung provides many of the parts for this. It's shocking to me

Start time: 437.26
End time: 454.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though that you know with all these revelations that Apple really hasn't gone  after Android in particular right now they're only picking on Samsung so it's  surprising to me that you know with all this coming out that we haven't seen any  legal action directly against Google maybe that's coming in the future it's  maybe Tim Cook has a different opinion on things. It's lawsuit by proxy probably

Start time: 455.02
End time: 476.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I imagine that the plan was and I don't know you know that's a good point  Tim I don't know if it will change now under Tim Cook maybe Tim will you know  it's one thing to to take everything personally to have it be a grudge but  once you get into business like politics you kind of have to as you point out  Roger they work with Samsung you kind of have to maybe take some of the personal

Transcript:  stuff out of it. What's interesting is that in the Huffington Post article you  know Jobs had an opportunity to meet with Obama and he wanted he initially  turned it down because he wanted a personal invitation from the president

Start time: 489.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  keeping this secret than they did the Harry Potter books. I mean with good  occasions to leak out electronically. I don't know you know people would scan in those books  and they'd end up on you know Bittorrent but the Steve Jobs book somehow you know  this is his legacy. He can still control things from beyond the grave. It's  amazing. He somehow managed and yeah like every product release. And yet the iPhone 4S

Start time: 552.20
End time: 555.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though I mean we knew more about that than we did about this book. Yeah well

Start time: 555.32
End time: 558.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you actually had a 5 still made up and then at the last

Start time: 565.30
End time: 617.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  month's ago. Well that's one thing that apparently people are saying I know and  Gadget was saying this see or I'm sorry CNET was saying this that that Steve's  real legacy will be the iPhone 5 not the 4S. I don't know if I believe that. I  think everything Apple did from the leather in the van that drives employees  from San Francisco to Cupertino was overseen directly by Steve Jobs. So I  can't believe that a 4S came out without Steve's input. Here's the thing I find  funny. This book actually has a leak of the next Apple big thing and in a very  unjobsian way Steve Jobs told Isaacson that the next thing was TV. And this we'd  heard so many rumors for years. It started with Jason Calacanis two years  ago said Apple's gonna do a big screen HDTV. We kept hearing rumors we thought  even maybe it would be this time. Tim what do we know about this Apple TV? What

Start time: 617.80
End time: 647.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is it gonna be? We don't really know anything but yeah we've absolutely been  hearing these rumors since you know like you said for years now and each time we  have a big Apple event we always wonder well maybe this will be the day that we  see the Apple TV you know there's an Apple TV device but not an actual Apple  TV you know a TV with an Apple logo on it. So it's interesting to hear that  all these rumors actually have something solid. There are some you know  there's something solid behind all this this talk we've heard for years so maybe  maybe in Apple's next big event we'll finally see this big screen TV that's

Start time: 647.24
End time: 704.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  white with a with an Apple on it. I thought we had already seen the Apple TV isn't it an  iMac? The 24-inch big thing looks exactly like a TV and that Apple TV device you  remember it got so small right and it's smaller once you tear off the hard the  hard casing that slips right inside any TV and you know any Apple TV product it's  so simple for them to do but the question is you know and I think this is  the reason it's taken so long is Apple's been trying to decide whether or not it  wants to be in that market you know is it is it the kind of market where they  can really control things can they get the the right distribution the right  visibility in Best Buy you know will Best Buy say yeah Apple TV same way as  with the other Apple products we're gonna do something special for you  because you know there's a lot invested by those other partners who have a  different relationship with Best Buy than say like an HP or someone else so I  think that that for me is the final hurdle there. As Washington Post had the

Start time: 705.04
End time: 760.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  story of course they called the Apple TV the Steve called it a hobby but  according to the biography quote he very much wanted to do for television sets  what he had done for computers music players and iPhones make them simple and  elegant. Jobs said quote I'd like to create an integrated television set that  is come integrated meaning exactly what you said Lance Apple TV in a TV screen  that is completely easy to use quote it would be seamlessly synced with all of  your devices and with iCloud no longer would users have to fiddle with complex  remotes for DVD players and cable channels and this is the quote that I  think this is the money quote this is the one more thing from the grave it  will have the simplest user interface you could imagine I finally cracked it  said Steve Jobs that means I got it figured out we got it I have to say I  was very skeptical but that there could possibly be thinking about a TV what a

Start time: 760.48
End time: 792.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  terrible business for Apple to get into. So I mean at all things D when Jobs  referred to it most famously as a hobby in 2010 the little thing that he said  TV's a hobby smarter people than us will figure it out right but jobs has a  history of saying this stuff I mean before the iPhone he said that phone  carriers were hard to deal with before the video iPod he said I'm not convinced  people want to watch movies on a tiny tiny screen so he's like he's managing  with this information well yeah it's the jobs in reality distortion I like

Start time: 793.44

Start time: 875.38
End time: 927.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for a great management style well what's more important management or leadership  I think that Steve Jobs may not have been a good manager because it wasn't a  people person you know he didn't suffer fools gladly but as a leader you know a  decision-maker I think he was one of the top ones and he surrounded his people  great leaders surround themselves with great people so they can get things done  you know his collection and this is why I've said over and over again that Apple  will be fine because he surrounded himself with top-notch people who  understood what to do who understand stood had execute and realized Steve  Jobs vision and and sometimes improve upon it or expand it so I think you know  we talk about managers managers are sometimes this thing about how do you  manage people how do you make them feel and clearly Steve job didn't care about

Start time: 1972.59
End time: 1997.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not at the time.  You know it's right before that.  I remember the two years before that where the whole industry was trying to figure out MP3 players.  We had a bunch of software based stuff.  Everybody was downloading software.  And things like something called the Jukebox out.  Various companies going in there.  And it was all just failures.  I had a Diamond Rio.  That was my first MP3 player.

Start time: 1998.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well before the iPod.

Start time: 1999.74
End time: 2044.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Actually a lot of people had those.  They were fairly popular but nobody had the right software to go with it.  And no one really.  You know it's funny because a lot of times with Apple you don't know what you need until Apple tells you.  Yeah.  And no one really understood that if you made this sort of ecosystem.  If you created the software and the hardware almost together.  That was going to propel it forward.  You know made it super simple for people to find the music.  And don't forget those deals that he made.  You know the fact that he got the music industry to work with him.  And they were terrified back then.  They didn't know what the hell was going on.  He got them to work with him.  If he hadn't done that would not have been the success that it turned out to be.  But still he created.  They ended up creating that industry which couldn't seem to figure out its ass from its elbow from 1999 to 2001.

Start time: 2046.79
End time: 2136.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very similar to the smartphone situation where you had a lot of smartphones.  But nobody loved their smartphone.  And then Apple comes along and really changes it.  Mike Elgin wrote a great article in Cult of Mac.  How the iPod started five revolutions.  I thought it was fairly insightful.  The one song revolution.  It was you know we used to have to buy albums.  It was thanks to the iTunes and the iPod.  You could buy a cut.  Now musicians hated that because they were selling whole albums just for the one good song.  But it was great for consumers.  The online store device revolution.  He said and Amazon is benefiting from this.  The tablet is store front.  The app store revolution.  The iTunes concept was re-envisioned by Apple as the app store.  The now standard model for buying software.  The touch revolution.  He points out the first iPod you remember this had a rotating click wheel.  But they very quickly went to one that didn't move.  He says when the mechanical wheel gave way to the capacitive sensing wheel.  Users got kind of conditioned to this idea of touch.  Apple got excited about it and was eventually what inspired them to do the touch interface.  And finally the media appliance revolution.  The idea of appliances specifically for media.  And God knows the TV would be one of those.  Certainly the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod.  And yes even the Zune.  So it's been an interesting ten years.  Really the world has changed quite a bit thanks to the iPod.

Chad it's in my museum back there.  I bring it out every once in a while.  Ten years old.  He brought it back and said this was when Apple still liked me here.  They wanted you to have this firewire charging.  So you were in college.  I was in college.  Did you remember?  Was this in Greece or was this in the US?

Start time: 2167.76
End time: 2188.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No this was here.  This was in LA.  And I remember it being so cool.  But the iTunes store didn't launch.  Which is the real innovation here.  It didn't launch until 2003.  So I feel like we were Napstering a hell of a lot between 2001.  Almost everything on here is from Napster.  I fired this up.  Most of my music collection is from Napster.

Start time: 2188.88
End time: 2207.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look how thick it was.  I remember it had firewire charging.  And this was only 5 gigabytes.  But the whole idea of this was it's your music collection in your pocket.  A thousand songs in your pocket.  And this is the one that still had this is a physical wheel.  That rotated.  Remember it was green.  That's it.  That's ten years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You burned CDs right?  Well you didn't have an iTunes store but you had iTunes.  The interface that you used.  You put stuff into iTunes and then put it in.  So the big thing was really ripping your CDs or music you already had from somewhere.

Start time: 2244.01
End time: 2254.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The truth is really the revolution was Napster.  That was really when the revolution happened.  That's when I got excited about music again.  I downloaded 10 gigabytes of music for free.

Transcript:  So Apple's original press release.  June 9th 2001.  Apple introduces iTunes and what they called it.  This was funny because this was something I had read when I was doing some research.  They called it the world's best and easiest to use jukebox software.  So that was January 9th 2001.  They bought a company.

Start time: 2291.16
End time: 2307.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was about importing music into basically ripping songs.  So that was primarily it.  But then the second piece of it with the iPod and music deals, that came I believe later in the year.

Start time: 2307.92
End time: 2328.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the program that they and I and I and I Jeff Robin I've talked to since then.  The program that they bought was released by Cassidy and Green 10 years before that in 1990 was called Soundjam.  Remember that?  And that was the basis.  Apple purchased it in 2000.  The basis for iTunes.  But you're right.  It didn't have a store in it yet.  Right.

Transcript:  There's a great story of Steve Jobs.  This is also from the book and the first prototype for the iPod.  And they brought it to him.  You know, I'm sure those meetings are very tense.  Mr. Jobs, here's what we think you'll want to release is the iPod.  And he looks at it and says, it's too big.  They said, we can't make it any smaller.  It's, it's, it's, we've, this is his, he, and he takes this prototype.  There's probably only one of them, right?  Throws it in a fish tank.  It sinks to the bottle.  Bubbles rise up.  He says, there's air in there.  See?  Get rid of it.  Make it smaller.  So, wow.  There's no air in there, apparently.  All right.  Let's move on.  We can, we've talked enough about Apple.

It's no more curved than the Nexus S that came before, actually, but, you know, so it's  the same sort of experience there.  It doesn't really feel that much different, but it is considerably thinner.  It's about nine millimeters, which does shave quite a bit off of the Nexus S, certainly the  Nexus 4G.  A big talking point this week has been the nature of that display.  It's got a 720p OLED display, which is great, but it's using the older Pentile Pixel.  Makeup, which means it's instead of RGB, it's RGBG, which basically means there are.  Wait a minute, the BGs are in this?  Yeah, yeah, crazy, right?  Basically it means there's 50% more green pixels than any other color.  So that means that the color reproduction is going to be a little bit off on this.  But it's not going to be as noticeable as it was.  The original Galaxy S had a display like this.  So did the Nexus One, right?

Start time: 2557.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the Pentile display and the Nexus One as well.  And I didn't think that was a bad display.  I thought it was good.  I did hear people complain about color cast, a green color cast in it, but I thought it  was a good display.  Now, the Galaxy S2 is stunning.  It will not be as good as the S2.

Start time: 2572.52
End time: 2595.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the Galaxy S2 introduced the AMOLED Plus, and that's what got rid of this Pentile type  of layout.  So unfortunately, it's a bit of a step back in terms of the actual makeup of the display.  But one of the problems with the Galaxy S was the resolution was so much lower.  Since we're talking 720p, I don't think it's actually going to be that noticeable for people  in terms of the quality of the image.  But the color is definitely going to be a bit greenish, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a bit greenish.  I mean, honestly, we were more focused on the hardware, the thinness, the performance  of the camera.  You know, they're talking about a zero shutter lag camera, which was actually very impressive  as well.  The speed of the camera.  Yes.

Transcript:  We did a back to back test with the 4S, and the NetGalaxy Nexus is slightly quicker.  I mean, at this point, it was kind of splitting hairs.  The 4S is very quick.  The Galaxy Nexus is slightly quicker, but it's much, much quicker than just about any  other Android device.  I mean, the Bionic just launched, and that is one of the slowest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Absolutely.  But we have quite a few questions.  I mean, one thing is the software was very buggy.  We saw at least four different builds of Ice Cream Sandwich running on different devices,  some of which were in different states of disarray, some were crashing, some were not  doing the Google Beam functionality, which lets you exchange things wirelessly over an  absolute peak.  Nobody's going to do that.  Yeah.  I'm a little bit leery about that, too.  I mean, HP made a big deal about that with the touchpad in the pre-three, and at that  point, we didn't think it was going to be anything big because how many people were  going to buy touchpads and pre-threes?  Now of course, you'll have much more Android devices around and you can in theory use it  more commonly, but even then, I just don't see walking up to somebody and saying, hey,  check out this webpage, donk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do, but I think that-  So there's only two phones you can do that with?  Very few phones.  There are a few others that have NSC built in, but like the T-Mobile Galaxy S2 has NSC  as well.  Right, that's it.  It seems to be more common, but certainly right now it's a rarity.  I think Google's going to make Google Wallet a big push there, so I think we'll be seeing  that in quite a few more devices going forward.

Transcript:  I do like the thin, and I think that that's one advantage that right now Android, especially  Samsung has over the iPhone.  The iPhone, as slick and beautiful as it is, is thicker and heavier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android is definitely, Android devices, they're making some interesting pushes for bigger  and thinner devices, which I think a lot of people want.  That was one of the biggest disappointments that a lot of people had when all that we  got was the 4S from Apple.  A lot of people wanted a bigger screen and a thinner device.  But they want it on your iPhone.  So Android is offering that.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I don't think anybody's going to be jumping ship from one camp to the other, but  there's definitely a lot of disappointment there.  So Samsung's given you a bigger screen for sure, but it is a very big screen.  I mean, 4.7 inches just about.  That's a big display.  It's not a lot of bezel, but it's still a big device.

Start time: 2788.50

Start time: 2795.34
End time: 2814.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels actually smaller than the current Nexus S because it's a bit thinner, but it  is still a wide device.  So it depends on the size of the pockets in your skinny jeans, whether or not it's going  to be comfortable.  But I mean, I've got pretty big hands, so it feels good for me.  But if you've got smaller hands, I can definitely see this as being a little bit too big.

It almost felt, and I didn't, I kind of hesitated to say this, but it was so light, the way  it felt was slightly toy-like.  There's something about a device when you hold it, these smartphones, that you want  to feel a tiny bit of heft.  You actually don't feel that.  It's got a Kevlar back.  It's got sort of this aluminum body.  It's very different, but wow.  Talk about thin.

Start time: 2858.48
End time: 2887.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing I'm interested in, well, there's a psychological effect when you have a big  screen.  If it's thin and light, it kind of doesn't feel like a big phone.  It just kind of, even with the big screen.  The thing I'm most interested in is pixels per inch.  Is this going to be the resolution of the iPhone 4, which is this incredible resolution?  This is from Anand Tech, pixel density comparison effective pixels per inch, and it looks like  it's very close to the iPhone 4S.

Start time: 2887.92
End time: 2906.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a bit lower, but it's still above that 300 mark, which is supposedly the magic number  for the ability for the human retina to recognize individual pixels.  We've crossed that 300 threshold, which means that to the naked eye, you shouldn't be able  to tell the difference between this one and the iPhone 4 slash 4S.  Pretty impressive.

Start time: 2929.36
End time: 2939.90

Start time: 2943.49
End time: 2986.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's actually stepping back to the old Galaxy S days when we had a much lower resolution.  I think in terms of effective resolution, I think it'll be a very clear picture for  people, and I don't think people will notice that too much.  Right.  I hope anyway.  So one of the biggest questions that I have, though, is battery life on this device.  For the Droid Razr, they gave it an estimated talk time of, I think it was 12 and a half  hours, which is quite impressive.  Nobody was talking battery life for the Galaxy Nexus, and we're a bit concerned that it's  not going to be that hot.  It's got an LTE or HSPA Plus built in.  We've seen HSPA Plus devices with good battery life, but we haven't really seen any LTE devices  with good battery life beyond the promised Razr.  So that's a big question on my mind is, what's the battery life on this thing going to be like?

Start time: 2986.86
End time: 2990.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think we'll solve that?  I mean, remember 3G killed battery life early on.

Start time: 2991.45
End time: 3014.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We definitely will solve that when we see more devices with integrated LTE radios.  Right now, they're all separated, which means you've got extra, you know, something else  sucking down the battery life.  We think that's why the Razr's able to get improved battery life like that, because they've  finally integrated things.  We won't know for sure until somebody tears it down and finds out.  But that's what we think is going on inside the Razr.  Inside the Galaxy Nexus, we just don't know at this point.

Start time: 3014.28
End time: 3028.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are your readers reporting bad battery life on the 4S?  It seems like it's much lower than it was.  If you use Siri.  If you use Siri, is it Siri that's killing it?  Or Find My Friends, or a lot of these other things that keep the radios turned on, is  that what's going on?

Start time: 3029.16
End time: 3040.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, quite a few of these things suck down data, but we're also having people report  extra heat and lower battery life on their iPhone 4, since they upgraded to iOS 5.  It certainly could be iOS 5 more so than the device itself.

End time: 3096.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doing more stuff in the background, doing all the things that Apple tried to avoid for  a long time because they knew it would eat into battery life.  By the way, I was going to mention on the Razr, you know, when I sat down with the Motorola  people at the event, I asked them about that battery life because they were not clear.  You know, they never said that that was LTE, you know, 4G battery life.  They basically just gave us numbers.  So I sat at a table and I said, so the numbers, are they 3G or 4G?  And one guy said 4G and one guy said 3G.  And I looked at them and I said, well, which is right?  And they both looked at each other and it kind of, then they just, they looked like  deer's caught in headlights.  They didn't really respond.  So finally they pointed over at some other table.  And what that says to me is that, you know, it's not.  I bet, I'm telling you that, you know, every experience that I've had and that I've seen  is it's a battery hog and, you know, they gave best possible, best circumstance numbers,  which is almost always going to be a 3G.

I've been talking to my Ford for ages.  I say set the cabin temperature 73 degrees.  I say play some Bob Dylan music.  I say where's the nearest gas station?  I say is there traffic up ahead?  And it responds to me.  You can talk to your car with Ford's great sync technology and you add the MyFord Touch.  And now you've got, I mean, it's like it's just so cool.  You've got the big screen on the console there too behind the steering wheel.  I love it.  It's just little things like the ability.  I know you're into cars.  The ability to set your cruise control.  Normally on the cruise control you're going at a certain speed.  You press a button that says okay I'll remember that.  On the MyFord Touch you tell it what speed.  You say I want to go 67 miles an hour.  And it shows that it's so cool.  It's little things like the fuel is filtered.  And look at this.  The newest thing in the Ford.  They can turn your car into a Wi-Fi access spot.  They've got Wi-Fi connectivity in the new 2012 Focus.  All the new cars with the available sync in MyFord Touch will have this.  They have USB ports.  Two of them on the MyFord Touch.  One of them you put the 3G thing in there.  The 3G dongle in there.  And now they've got antennas in the cabin.  And you can get five people.  It's a Wi-Fi access spot.  Just wild some of the stuff they're doing.  If you want to know more, of course, take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus.  We're going to have a barbecue.  We're going to have the Focus here, aren't we?  On November 13th, the first barbecue.  That's right.  We're going to bring Twit.  We've talked to the Petaluma police.  They're going to block off the street here.  We're going to have a tent.  We're going to have a barbecue.  Ford's going to bring I don't know what cars, a bunch of cars,  including I'm hoping my next car, the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.  And you'll be able to take a look at it.  Take a look at all the amazing technology.  We'll let you know how you can get tickets to this.  It'll be like a golden ticket because there's only 50 people could come.  But we'll figure out a way to get you the golden ticket.  Meanwhile, go to your Ford dealer or the website.  Ford.com slash technology.  You know, Alan Mullally, the CEO of Ford, came to Ford from Boeing.  He's an engineer.  He designed the triple seven cockpit.  This guy knows tech.  He's made Ford into a 21st century car company.  And I think it's just really exciting what he's done.  We're really happy.  He's a really nice guy, too.  He is, isn't he?  He's a sweetie.  I just adore him.  He kissed me the last time.  Not on the lips.  He was trying to kiss you?  Was he wearing a thong?  Just a cheek kiss.  No, it was a nice kiss.  It was sweet.  And he just gave me a little peck on the ...

Transcript:  Actually, there's something interesting about that is that that was a special build of Ice  Cream Sandwich just for that demo that was programmed to not kick out of face recognition  after...  It normally kicks after about two seconds if it doesn't recognize you, but they had  custom built this version of the operating system just so that it wouldn't do that.  And just in case there was some problem recognizing Mattias.  And indeed, there was a problem.  It didn't recognize it.  Yeah.  Typically, after about two seconds, it'll jump out and it'll bring up the swipe pad  or the number pad so you can type in your password that way.  So it actually is much more convenient to use in real life than it looked on stage.  That, unfortunately, was a very bad demo for a variety of reasons.

Transcript:  I feel like it just takes too long.  I don't know if that's a gimmick.  I don't know if anybody's going to use it.  I was hoping...  Was anybody hoping for a Siri-like improved...  I mean, voice commands have always been pretty good on Android.  I thought they would respond.  Lance, you're nodding.

Start time: 3573.32
End time: 3612.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, apparently they're not going to respond.  They don't think it's important for the phone to be...  Here's what's wonderful about Siri is that it is allowed to bring context to the voice  recognition, because it's got its fingers in all that stuff on the phone that all of  these phones have.  I mean, it's got your contacts, your schedules, your reminders, all the stuff that's part  of every single smartphone we have out there.  And Google, of all people, knows this stuff.  They have a Gmail system with contacts where I'm able to get...  I can plug into those contacts from virtually anywhere.  So they've had voice recognition for a long time.  I have tried it out.  Why not bake it in further?  I don't understand.

Transcript:  Or make it improve.  Make it even talk back.  In fact, Andy Rubin, in charge of Android at Google, said, I don't believe your phone  should be an assistant.  It's like, not only are we not going to compete, we think it's a wrong direction.  It's just nobody's going to want that.  Why would anybody want that?

Transcript:  We asked about this in particular.  We talked to Matthias, who's the lead designer of Ice Cream Sandwich, Matthias Duarte.  And he said basically that at Google, they're going for the Star Trek approach, which is  you ask the computer something and it gives you a response.  At Apple, he likened Siri to the Star Wars approach, where droids have personalities.  You can speak with them, have conversations.  He said that that's the wrong approach for your phone, basically.  He said that your phone should take a request and give you an answer, and that's the end  of that.

Transcript:  Well, let me ask.  How many of you have used Siri kind of consistently?  For Lance, you have.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Tim, obviously.  I've been using it all week.  I have come to...  I thought, you know, there's always a toss-up.  Is this going to be another FaceTime where it's a cool demo but nobody's going to use  it, or is this going to be actually of value?  And I found it quite valuable.  I actually think that Siri is a breakthrough.  I think Andy's wrong.

Start time: 3686.74
End time: 3704.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be a real breakthrough for me when it can do more things in a provider standpoint,  when it can read me emails, when it can read me web pages, when I can sit in my car and  have my inbox read to me rather than listening to NPR or listening to a podcast or something  like that.  Yeah, no, I admit it's not tied into enough stuff, but at least just even setting reminders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but nevertheless, I think, and I agree with you, Tim,  it needs to be connected to more things,  but even for the few things it's connected with,  it's kind of a game changer already.  It definitely is.  It's a big first step.  It's a first step.  But I think Andy's wrong.  I think this is... I do want HAL 9000.

Right now, there are these pretty comprehensive voice recognition, you could say.  Set an alarm for 9 o'clock tonight, and it'll set an alarm.  You can get directions by voice.  So a lot of that stuff is there.  It's just going to take another step to catch up to Apple or two steps to step ahead of them.  And certainly Google can do it.  I'm looking forward to see where this goes.  There's no question Google can do it.  It's just...

Transcript:  And don't forget that Apple did something very simple.  They added personality.  People respond to personality.  All the sort of the silliness that's in Siri that people have used  really served a very important purpose.  I think they've helped connect people to the technology  and have made it that much more interesting.  There have been countless stories online about the funny things that Siri will say.  I almost feel like Apple, you know, 100% planned that as part of the marketing push  to get people to think about and talk about the technology.  I love it.

Verizon, by the way, will be getting the Galaxy Nexus.  You confirmed that on Engadget, Tim, today.  So they didn't...  They were kind of unclear about date and time and all of that,  but apparently Verizon will carry it.  Did they say when?  They just said later this year.

Start time: 3891.20
End time: 3908.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, it's going to come down to battery life.  I mean, the NFC functionality in the Galaxy Nexus is something that I want going forward,  but ultimately, whichever one has the better battery life,  to me will be the better phone,  because the Razor will get ice cream sandwich sometime early 2012.  So that differentiation point is going to be gone soon.  Lance?

Start time: 3909.66
End time: 3936.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, I was just going to say, I believe the Razor is scheduled.  So we got pre-orders, and I think it should be actually arriving in November.  I thought they gave a date, but I can't quite find that.  But yeah, it's pretty much scheduled to go.  It's just interesting to me that there's just so many new phones.  So many hot, big, thin, big screen phones, including the iPhone 4S.  And I can't wait to see which is going to be the leading phone this holiday season.

Start time: 3936.66
End time: 3957.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the iPhone 4S.  You think?  Because of the mythology around it and Siri.  But no, no, no.  I think that what the Android phones need to do is differentiate themselves,  kind of like this Nexus One was doing, around the camera.  Because it's still very slow to take a photo with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4.  The 4S is pretty good.  The 4S is fast.

Start time: 3957.74
End time: 3990.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 4S is 1.1 seconds to camera, and half a second between shots.  Here, watch.  Okay, you got a shot of the...  Let's do this.  Here we go.  Let's do this.  One thousand, one, one thousand, two, one thousand.  Well, that's more than...  There you go.  And then picture, picture.  That's pretty quick.  That's pretty speedy.  And very little latency.  I think that this is good enough at this point.  And I think the fact that you can use the top button.  You know what I feel bad for?  It's Camera Plus.  Because they were taken off the marketplace because they used the top button.  And now they can't use the top button.

I did a whole story comparing the iPhone 4S camera to the iPhone 4.  And when I was using the button to take some of the shots, because then you have a certain orientation, I looked at it to load them on the computer.  I'm like, why are they upside down?

Start time: 4565.21
End time: 4597.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called a plan optic system.  Effectively, what it does is it manages to capture lights at every focal depth.  So instead of taking a picture and setting your aperture and setting your focal depth,  you're effectively capturing all focal depths at once.  And then at that point you can go through and dynamically change focal depth after the picture has been taken.  So if you want a shallow depth of field focused on a very close subject, you can do that.  Or you can get a shallow depth of field focused on something farther away after the picture has been taken.

It's like the camera of the future because it doesn't look, you know, it looks like a lot of things, but it doesn't look like a camera.  How do you work it?  Well, you just take a picture, right?  You look at the screen on the back and you hit the button on the top and you really don't have to worry about focusing, obviously, because it's capturing every focal depth.

Start time: 4623.78

Start time: 4629.89
End time: 4695.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It's kind of like embedding a video onto your web page or something like that in order to view that picture and to share it with anybody else who have to have a special embed code to share it.  And at that point, whoever's viewing it can click anywhere on the picture and it will focus dynamically on where you clicked effectively.  So it's kind of like looking at your phone and taking a picture, you know, tapping on the screen to refocus it, except you're looking at a picture that's already been taken, which is which is pretty interesting.  And it seems so far look pretty good.  But it's one of those things I think that we're going to need to spend some more time with it to test that we did get to go and play with the camera for a bit.  But really, you need to kind of live with these things and find out if they work.  This was kind of the same idea as the extended depth of field cameras, which have multiple lenses that capture pictures at different fields.  They offer the same kind of impact.  And the idea there was that you could have a much smaller camera construction for camera phones, that kind of thing.  But what we found with those is that you effectively give up performance for close in shots, specifically for macro shots.  And, you know, that's that's a fear.  Perhaps there'll be some kind of glaring problem with these kind of cameras as well.

They can go to Facebook and they can selectively focus their faces in the shot or whoever's faces in the shot.  And that way, you know, anytime you click on, you know, whatever you get that person's name, you can automatically bounce over to their particular profile.  I mean, it's great because it adds another dimension to a to an image where you're not you can selectively let the user determine what they find most interesting.  You're playing devil's advocate now, aren't you?  I think it's a really cool product.  Really?  Would you buy it? Yeah.  Four hundred dollars.  Yeah. You know, I spend seven hundred bucks on lenses.

See how it is in the real world with low light conditions, with macro shots, with distance shots, the portraits.  You know, there's lots of different scenarios that we want to we want to play with and see how it works.  It's interesting. I think that I would pay four hundred dollars for it.  But I would love to have something like this built into my next camera phone because it would just be right.  Right. It's a fire.  Fire. Forget it. You point your camera in the general direction of whatever you want.  You tap the screen, take the picture and you kind of figure it out later what you want the focus to be.

Transcript:  Good news. You're not going to get cancer.  Well, from phones.  Well, yeah, you probably will get cancer from something else, but you won't be getting it from your.  Well, the odds are you won't be getting it from your cell phone, at least not according to Denmark.  So this was, you know, I was a little disappointed because the World Health Organization a short while ago put out a study that implied that, well, we don't know you might be getting cancer.  That phones are possibly carcinogenic.  And it scared the hell out of everybody who didn't read between the lines.  They just thought the World Health Organization was saying the phones were bad.  Well, it turns out because Denmark has these very bizarre privacy rules, we can pretty much rule out cancer from cell phones since 1968.  Every adult citizen of Denmark has had a national ID number.  Cell phone companies have used that ID number to register subscribers.  So you could basically take the whole Danish population and figure out whether they have cell phone accounts.  And then and this is very convenient.  The country's Institute of Cancer Epidemiology is also tracking anybody born after 1924 by their national ID numbers.  So it was just a matter of matching.  And apparently, with three hundred sixty thousand people who had cell phone subscriptions in Denmark during the study period, a million other control people who didn't.  It seems pretty clear this is that there is no higher incidence of cancer in people who use cell phones over a long period of time.  You can breathe a sigh of relief.  In fact, it looks like you're less likely if you're a male cell phone user to get a meningioma.

I think Windows Phone is the kind of most intuitive, easy to use operating system right now.  Certainly the most visually impressive mobile operating system that we have right now.  But it's really just lacking in terms of apps and adoption.  So maybe Nokia will help.  I don't think it's going to have a big impact in the US, but nice hardware certainly never hurts.
