Transcript:  Thank you. That was a lot of fun to do.  Yeah. Welcome back. Good to have you.

Start time: 153.08
End time: 165.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great to be here.  We also hear from the Houston Chronicle, our good friend Dwight Silverman.  Blog.Kron.com slash techblog.  And he's in the offices today.  Covering no doubt Heartbleed.  No, I'm here for you Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I just don't have a, I moved and I just don't have the wonderful set up that I used to have.  So I'm deep in the bowels of the mighty Houston Chronicle in a conference room.  Much further than I'll be here on a Sunday.

Start time: 178.28
End time: 219.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry that we made you come to work.  Sigh.  Also with us, probably one of the best known security experts in America.  He's a cryptographer.  You may remember, I think he helped, in fact last time you were on I think we mentioned this,  helped with the crypto in Cryptonomicon.  And a perfect guy to have on during Heartbleed week.  Bruce Schneier is here. Hi Bruce.  Hey, hi.  Great to have you.  So at the beginning of the week you said on a scale of 1 to 10 Heartbleed is an 11.  A very serious flaw.  It's funny, we thought this would be the week we'd be talking about XP exploits.

Transcript:  No.

Start time: 221.06
End time: 250.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it turns out you never know, right?  These things happen kind of at random.  Heartbleed, you know, it was real interesting because for a whole lot of reasons.  One, it was potentially catastrophic.  It affected an enormous number of servers out there.  And you can weaponize it with like three lines of shell scripts.  I had colleagues who were up and running and scanning and attacking systems within 10 minutes of learning about it.  Wow.  So it was a big deal. It still is a big deal.

Start time: 252.56
End time: 268.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were able to send a packet using this heartbeat technique built into OpenSSL a couple of years ago.  You're able to send a malformed packet that requests data up to 64K from memory of the server, right?  But you can't be specific. It's whatever's there.

Start time: 271.26
End time: 310.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it has to do with how the heap's working.  And it's kind of random what you get, but you can query that 64K multiple times and you get different data.  You don't always get the same.  So if you're looking to get everything on the computer, you just do it again and again.  Turns out you actually can't get everything.  There are some weird reasons why some data comes and some data doesn't.  We're still exploring that.  But potentially when we heard about this, you could basically grab everything and it left no trace.  I mean, there's nothing in an audit log that said that you were attacked, which made it really scary.  And we had to fix it quick.

Start time: 311.42
End time: 322.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the fact that this has been around for two years,  it's conceivable that somebody knew about it two years ago and has been just pinging servers.  I mean, how rapidly can you do this? I guess every second or faster.

Start time: 323.00
End time: 361.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do it as fast as you can.  And it turns out you can ping the entire internet and see who's vulnerable in about 15, 20 minutes, depending on your setup.  So a bunch of researchers have been doing that.  And so we can watch the decay of sites that are vulnerable.  We do know that we have good evidence that before the announcement,  nobody was doing a sweep of the Internet looking to see who's vulnerable.  So we have data from servers, from honey pots that we've been able to comb through  and have seen no one use Heartbleed at a global basis before that.  We have no idea if they were targeted attacks.  But that's very good news.

Start time: 362.22
End time: 375.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means it seems unlikely that this is a vulnerability known in the hacker community.  They'd be scanning sites looking for vulnerabilities.  A targeted attack, well, you know, at least it's unlikely that you and I were a target.

Start time: 376.68
End time: 404.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Indeed. Right. The good news is the hacker community did not know about this, it seems.  You know, we started seeing scans within minutes of the announcement, but before that we saw nothing.  So that's the good news.  The other good news is that subsequent research over the week has shown that while it's possible in theory  and has been done in practice to retrieve the private SSL key, you know, the master keys you're worried about,  it's actually a lot harder than we originally thought.  That's very good news.

Start time: 405.12
End time: 414.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the concern was that all of these secure servers, certificates have been compromised,  allowing massive man-in-the-middle attacks. You're saying that seems unlikely.

Start time: 415.91
End time: 429.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That seems unlikely. It's certainly possible.  CloudFlare was the company that's been leading this research. They've put up challenges.  One of the challenges was met, so someone did manage to extract the keys, but it's not easy.  It's not a slam dunk.

Start time: 430.06
End time: 434.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for the most part, what do you get? Passwords, logins? What are you getting in these 64K chunks?

Start time: 435.70
End time: 504.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You get the random cruft of what the server is doing.  So yes, you get password changes, you get web pages served.  If there are credentials in the URLs, you get those. You get random stuff.  You get a lot of nothing, but occasionally you get something good.  And what we're seeing, and this is the obvious tactic from a criminal who will be using this,  is you just scan everything constantly, hoping you get lucky.  Now, you know, there's some good news on our side. Some of this stuff is hard to parse.  So, you know, it's sort of interesting to watch, and we don't know really what the effects are in terms of enabling crime.  And of course, it's now being patched.  A lot of the sites are no longer vulnerable. Now, vulnerable to the ping.  There are any number of universities who are basically auditing the net every hour and watching as sites patch their open SSL.  Now, that doesn't mean if they were compromised before the patch, they're not still vulnerable.  They had to change their key and their certificate. There's no way to check that.  Right. No easy way to check that.

Start time: 505.38
End time: 516.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So the initial estimate was about two-thirds of the web would be, or servers would be vulnerable to this.  Is that accurate? And is the number, what is the number now?

Start time: 518.36
End time: 539.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That is accurate. The number is probably 10 percent that, and it's skewed because all of the big, popular, well-run servers have updated.  A lot of the stuff that's left. I see a top 1,000 sites that are vulnerable list that some university publishes, and the sites are getting more obscure every hour that are still vulnerable.

Start time: 540.44
End time: 542.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there any big companies, though, that should have fixed it that haven't?

Start time: 543.32
End time: 607.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I didn't see any, but I'm not going to guarantee there aren't.  It's an easy fix.  You know, like all of these patches, it's an easy fix. You install the patch. But closing the vulnerability is a multi-step process.  I mean, this is one of the reasons it was so nasty, is that installing the patch is just step one.  Regenerating your public-private keys are step two. Revoking your old key is step three. Getting a new key is step four. I guess you can switch three and four.  And then every user on that site who could have had their credentials exposed needs to update their password, which is steps five through a million.  Right.  And all of those things have to happen in sequence.  You know, I mean, I updated my own website and had to go through all those steps. But, you know, for me, it was pretty easy.  If you're a banking site, you know, at a minimum, any customer who logged on between when the vulnerability became public and when the site was patched needs to update their password.  Right.  And it might be nothing, but that's just prudent.

Start time: 608.22
End time: 611.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's prudent. And the good news is it's not a bad thing to do once in a while anyway.

Start time: 612.62
End time: 636.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It isn't. But, you know, we all have passwords that we rarely use and then we remember we don't like doing this.  I'm not going to blame you on this, but, you know, I think it's safe that if you didn't log into the server between when the vulnerability was announced on Monday and when your server patched a few days later, you're OK.  So those obscure sites you haven't been to in a week or two, I think you're fine at this point.

Start time: 638.00
End time: 640.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And second factor authentication hasn't been compromised. Is that right?

Start time: 642.52
End time: 663.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's been compromised is the public key potentially, although it seems unlikely, and stuff that happened to happen on the server when someone did the ping.  So if you got unlucky and your data was in the heap at the time the bad guys did the scan, it was compromised potentially.

Start time: 663.24
End time: 668.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty random, though, and it seems like unlikely that there have been mass compromises as a result.

Start time: 668.38
End time: 703.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's extraordinarily random. Mass is definitely unlikely.  Yeah.  And it'll be individual. You know, I haven't seen yet anybody with any estimates on what sorts of crime has been a result.  We know the hacker started pinging this vulnerability as soon as public.  So they didn't waste it. And it was actually triply easy. Yeah.  What's interesting, some of these other vulnerabilities.  They're now in a computer to write to run arbitrary code. This one you can't. Right.  But this one you could really weaponize within a couple of minutes of learning about it. It's just so easy.

Start time: 704.00
End time: 714.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloomberg said that two sources told them this was an NSA bug or that the NSA knew about it and had been using it for two years.  Given its utility, that seems highly unlikely.

Start time: 715.08
End time: 785.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, so we're all debating this right now. Right.  There was a Bloomberg article that said two anonymous sources at the NSA knew this for two years.  NSA came out with actually the director of national intelligence on his blog, came out with a very strong denial.  This is untrue. You know, answer is we don't know. It seems unlikely.  This vulnerability is so big and so nasty.  And the United States and other democratic countries, I think, are so vulnerable that it would make a lot of sense to the NSA if they found this to alert the community and get this closed.  It's a bigger risk to us than it is value.  Certainly, the NSA probably got an advance notice of a week or so like some of the big companies.  I mean, they I hope they took it and ran with it and attacked everybody they could during that week.  And then you've done not to. Right.  Might as well. Who knows what you're going to get.  But that's what you do. Right. They're good at fishing expeditions.  We know we get advance notice of Microsoft bugs that are being fixed the next patch Tuesday.  And they just roll with them for the week or two they have. That makes perfect sense. We want them to do that.

Start time: 786.26
End time: 794.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw Google said that, honey, one version of Android was vulnerable for one one.  How could Android be vulnerable at all to this? It's not a server.

Start time: 795.80
End time: 817.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, anybody that's using open SSL and responding to pings is vulnerable.  I'm when I'm worried most about right now are some of the hardware devices, the routers cost unpatchable routers and switches and modems.  Where upgrading involves the trash can a credit card or trip to Best Buy. Right. That's not going to be fun.

Start time: 818.92
End time: 822.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These things are laden with problems. We've seen so many problems on these inexpensive routers.

Start time: 823.08
End time: 862.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's because the economics is different. Right.  I mean, essentially, they're like the computers were in the mid 90s.  But they're very low cost, very low engineering expertise.  They're not built with the same care. Then they're not as robust.  So they're built as throw away devices. Yet they have these enormous vulnerabilities.  And in the mid 90s, we got a whole community to embrace quick patching and an open vulnerability disclosure and all of these things that made us safer.  It's really hard to imagine the same systems working on these on your refrigerator just because nobody cares very much.

Start time: 863.96
End time: 874.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bruce, do you think this is some have said is an indictment of open source software that people can commit the guy who did this as a German software developer who I mean, we know who it is because there's a commit log.

Start time: 876.79
End time: 927.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And he's been interviewed and he's been, you know, he's I'm sure really embarrassed about this.  You know, it's not an indictment of open source software. It's an indictment of software that isn't independently analyzed.  This could have easily happened in closed source and proprietary software could easily have been thrown out there.  The problem was nobody was doing the analysis and any software open or closed needs to be analyzed.  Open software is more secure because it can be looked at by more people because it's harder to slip in something of this unnoticed.  But open source doesn't magically mean someone's going to look at it.  And this seemed to have fallen through the cracks.  It was incredibly pivotal, important, critical piece of code that's just being maintained by a few guys in their spare time.  Now, good for them. And I'm glad they're doing it.

Start time: 928.64
End time: 945.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they can use some backup. Yeah, I feel bad for Robin Segelman, who's the the German who introduced the flaw.  And he just said, I forgot to validate a variable containing a length.  It's just, you know, I missed it. And that happens all the time.

Start time: 946.12
End time: 962.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It happens all the time. Now, something interesting to ask.  I mean, if we're going to speculate about the NSA, I mean, they they spend millions of dollars searching for vulnerabilities every year in critical software.  If they didn't find this one, you know, maybe we should wonder how well our money is being spent.

Start time: 963.56
End time: 966.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is like you can't get more critical than the open SSL library used by two.

Start time: 967.06
End time: 979.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. You think somebody in the NSA would have looked at it and would have would have checked for all of these sorts of bounds checking problems.  It would have noticed this. The fact that they didn't or at least claim they didn't is independently interesting.

Start time: 980.26
End time: 997.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've heard President Obama's it turns out President Obama has said, well, the NSA will not have if they find a flaw in software like this.  And there's a compelling security argument, national security argument for not exposing that flaw, then they can do that in general.  They will. But they do have it out.

Start time: 998.52
End time: 1050.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you know, and this is all the weasel wording. Yeah.  As long as the NSA's mission is primarily to eavesdrop on the entire planet, there will be a compelling reason to keep these vulnerabilities secret.  We know the NSA purchases of old abilities on the open market.  We know they keep things secret.  I mean, this is the this is a fundamental problem of giving the NSA both hats that the same organization is in charge of security and insecurity,  which causes some interesting debates inside the NSA.  And it's called this is called the equities issue.  Right. And in this case, you mean, I mean, looking at it, I would hope the NSA would make the right decision.  And if they did learn about it, would try to fix it, because I think we are uniquely vulnerable, you know, more than I'm going to make this up.  The Russians or the Chinese, because we use SSL more than everybody else.

Start time: 1051.88
End time: 1070.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Bruce, can I ask a question about you? I want to go back to the idea of nobody looking behind the creators of this code.  Have you seen as a result of this a movement to create some kind of Q&A, to do analysis arising from this?  Are there going to be changes as a result?

Start time: 1071.12
End time: 1098.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I haven't seen anything yet, but I think it's something that will be discussed in the open source community.  Unfortunately, a lot of the open source community are people working for altruistic reasons, not for pay.  But as long as this stuff is being put in for profit products by big companies, they should pick up some of the auditing functions.  And hopefully that'll happen. I haven't seen any concerted discussion about this.  It'll certainly be something we're going to talk about because it's important.

Start time: 1099.68
End time: 1117.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use LastPass. One of the things LastPass is security check does now is go through the sites that I have passwords for.  And it does a couple of things. First, it assesses whether that site was bit by Heartbleed.  That I think is hard to do since sites often obfuscate what libraries and servers they're using.

Start time: 1117.02
End time: 1129.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but see, the way you tell is you do the ping. If you do the ping and it comes back, you know they're using open SSL.  You know that they're vulnerable. So you can audit this.

Start time: 1130.24
End time: 1132.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You audit it by hacking it. Isn't that illegal?

Start time: 1134.40
End time: 1138.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you know, you do it at four bytes. You don't do it at an amount that actually matters.

Start time: 1139.24
End time: 1151.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, perfect. Right. You take a small amount. Okay, that's good. All right.  And then they also, of course, check to see if the certificate has been updated.  And there's no point changing that password if a site was vulnerable and has the out-of-date certificate.

Start time: 1152.18
End time: 1154.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. And we're trusting that they've regenerated their keys.

Start time: 1155.26
End time: 1158.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we don't know. We can't tell. That part we don't know.

Start time: 1159.94
End time: 1166.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, that's interesting. You probably, and I'm thinking about this out loud, the public key would be in the certificate. So you can tell. Never mind.

Start time: 1167.08
End time: 1173.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the certificate has been revoked and a new one has been issued in this last five days, then you're all right.

Start time: 1174.46
End time: 1180.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. All right.  And then if you have logged in during the danger period, you really should change your password at that point.

Start time: 1180.14
End time: 1196.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such, it's just, it's just good hygiene anyway. Just do it anyway.  It is. Yeah. All right. So that's, I was curious to how well we can assess whether there's a problem.  It sounds like we can do a pretty good job of that.  All right. And so your advice to people?

Start time: 1197.72
End time: 1211.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow. My advice to people is, is, you know, we can calm down now.  Do change your passwords if you have to.  And if the site you care about hasn't corrected itself, you need to bug them.

Start time: 1212.68
End time: 1231.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good. Bruce, it's so great to talk to you. Schneier.com, the website.  Bruce Schneier is one of the, I'm going to say the best guy to talk to on stuff like this.  I promise to get myself better lit next time.  Hey, if you agree to come on every once in a while, I'm going to send you lights.  I'm going to send you cameras. I'm going to send you microphones.

Start time: 1232.02

End time: 1247.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll get you a green screen. Bruce, anything you want.  We'll get you if you just come on every once in a while, because we just love having you on.  That's the deal. All right. Thank you. Bruce Schneier, Schneier on security.

Start time: 1247.02
End time: 1252.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 1257.22
End time: 1266.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1276.01
End time: 1294.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you were talking earlier about there's no real good test for it.  You have to do the hack.  Huh. Because what was funny, I had a debate with somebody online.  They found that cron.com was vulnerable, but the tests I were doing showed it not.  And we were both working on the same tool.

Start time: 1295.74
End time: 1344.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here's the issue. You can't just query the server and say, are you running OpenSSL pre 1.0.1, the fix?  Are you running NGINX or Apache? Because most servers will just not respond honestly.  It's foolish to tell people what you're doing.  So if it's something at that level, that's not going to be useful.  But obviously, it's not so hard to write a little test that says, well, let's just take advantage of Heartbleed.  I'm going to send you a word. So what you do is you say, here's an authentication word.  Cake. And send me back five letters.  And if you get cake plus one back, it's got Heartbleed.  If you get cake back, then you know it's been fixed.

Transcript:  Right. Well, that's the problem with XP. And that's the problem with a lot of things.  In fact, I'm sorry, I didn't get to ask or should have asked, but I didn't get I think to ask Bruce about XP.  This was the week that XP ended its life.  Again.  Again.  We'll talk about that and a lot more.  Harry McCracken's here, the Technologizer from Time Magazine, from the Houston Chronicle, the great Dwight Silverman.  It's good to have you both. Good time to talk about lots of things in just a bit.  And first, a word from our great sponsors, Citrix, makers of GoToMeeting, which I think is without a doubt the number one meeting software in the world.  This is what people and boy, there couldn't be a better time as more and more teams are spread out all over the world.  You know, you don't very often you're working with people in different time zones, different countries.  It's hard to have a meeting and yet meetings are so valuable to get on the same page, to communicate with each other, to understand, to break through the logjam.  We have a rule here, Lisa instituted it. Three emails on a subject.  That's it. Boom.  You're getting in the same room and we're going to we're going to hash this out or have a GoToMeeting.  You know what? Most of our contributors are not in Petaluma.  They're all over the place.  When meetings matter, lots of people use GoToMeeting.  Thirty four million meetings last year, uptime ninety nine point nine percent and and just a great platform.  You could share the screen, but you can also share cameras so you could see each other face to face in crystal clear video.  GoToMeeting allows you to present, demonstrate and simply meet from anywhere with any Mac, any PC, any tablet or smartphone.  We've got 30 days free.

Transcript:  Oh, here in Houston, a lot of oil companies still use XP.  Banks.  Yes, banks.  One of our energy reporters last year did with this deadline looming, did a big story on how it's so impacting the energy industry  because they have so many proprietary programs that have been written specifically to run on XP.  They can't move to seven or eight.  Right.  And they're essentially they kind of have to wait till they can get the proprietary software.

Right, using basis or something and you can't you got to use XP.  It's DTI. It runs on Adobe's suite.  And so it you know, it we simply haven't updated it to run the Windows 7 version.  We're in the process of doing that now.  But, you know, a lot of big companies are in that case.  And then you have smaller companies who can't afford, you know, new hardware and new software.  And they're just kind of stuck on it.  My wife runs Windows XP to run the software that she uses for her medical accounting.  She's a psychotherapist and she has to use the software.  And it's about ten thousand dollars for her to upgrade to the new software.  And she's just not going to do it.

Now, the medical machines, the ATMs, they're not going online.  They're not doing risky things.  But nurses are using those XP machines to send emails and surf the net.  And those are risky things.  So that stuff survives.  And it's expensive to shift.  I understand.  You said it exactly right, Harry.  Microsoft doesn't get to make the decision about who stops using XP.  We, you know, users do.

And he left the New York Times, the Washington Post, the WONC blog to go to work for Vox.  But the funny thing, and maybe you could speak to this a little bit, Dwight, the funny thing is in this article, they said many people go to Vox.  Vox publishes The Verge, SB Nation, Polygon, and now this new Ezra Klein blog.  Many people go there because of their fabulous content management system.  They wrote something from scratch called Chorus.  And apparently this is a selling point that one of the reasons Ezra Klein left the Washington Post and went to Vox is because of Chorus.  You guys both work with content management systems.  I'm sure they're a little bit antiquated.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, we're on one of the problems in the newspaper industry is that we have multiple content management systems.  So we use WordPress, a hosted version.  Right.  We have a separate set of software products for creating stories in print.  And then we have a pretty nice CMS for running our website and managing the website that's fairly modern and up to date.  And so we have to jump back and forth.  The Holy Grail is one CMS that ends up handling both print and online if you have both components.  But I can see people who have grown up using decent software and suddenly you go to work for a company that has a terrible CMS.  It's painful.  Yes.  And so I can see that happening.  I'm not sure I would jump to a company that had a great CMS.  I'd jump for a company that's willing to overpay me.

I have a Glass Explorer number from Google I.O. last year.  When that came up, I said, Jason, you get it.  Because he had a newborn, and I thought it would be more appropriate for him.  I just never really attracted.  According to Google, we're opening a limited number of spots in the Explorer program at 9 a.m. Eastern on April 15th.  Get on in there if you want to get glass.

He got off BART and was walking through the Mission District.  Somebody ran up, tore the glass off his face.  Okay, I mean, that's a little...  Is it a little glass holy to get off BART in the Mission District wearing your Google Glass, especially given the sensitivity right now?  He was a reporter, ironically covering the protests going on in San Francisco about housing prices and evictions.  So he should have been somewhat sensitized.  I think he was.  A guy runs up to him and rips the glass off his face.  At first I thought, well, maybe he's stealing it.  No.  So they give chase.  The guy takes the glass, smashes it on the ground, and runs on.  That's following on a story from a few weeks ago, a woman getting almost beat up in a bar for wearing glass.  I think you should not wear your glass in San Francisco.  It is a mugging. He did call the police. They did take a report, but I don't think...  And he took the pieces of his glass with him.  Chris...  I'm sorry, Kyle Russell.  He's a journalist with Business Insider.  And he was covering those protests.  I wonder...  I don't know. I guess glass and Google in general, but glass specifically is a good kind of... is a hot point for all of this kind of upset.

The idea that the etiquette around it and it changing social mores came almost immediately.

Transcript:  I'm not... I don't find myself tempted at all.  I feel like I understand why Google's doing this. In fact, I don't think they're going to ever productize it.  It's my kind of belief that what Google's really doing is gathering information about how people use wearables.  They understand this isn't the perfect form factor. It's a form factor.  But they want the information. As we know, they're doing a SDK for wearables.  It's more in their interest, I think, to support people who want to make wearables in whatever form they want to make them and get Google on it.  This was the debate over the Google phone.  Fred Vogelstein, I keep quoting this book because it's such a good book, Dog Fight, talks about Google not really being sure whether they want...  They were making so much money, it was so successful putting Google apps on the iPhone.  Did they really want to compete with it? Wouldn't it just make more sense from Google's point of view to support smartphones than to make them?  They ended up deciding to make them, but I wonder if they're going to make wearables or just support them.

If you are a blogger, if you have a website, you know that plain text on a page somehow doesn't grasp the human imagination.  We need images.  And Shutterstock is a great source for royalty free stock photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips, all kinds of stuff.  In fact, I always like to look at the count.  Thirty five million eight hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred and fifty seven royalty free stock images.  When we started talking about Shutterstock a few months ago, it was twenty five million.  They added this week a quarter of a million new images.  They're gathering new images like crazy.  All of them carefully vetted, curated so that they're gorgeous.  They're useful.  Most of them are from professional photographers and artists.  Every time you visit, you'll find something new.  You might say, well, what good is a thirty five million image collection?  How am I going to find it?  Well, really Shutterstock and they keep making this better, has a great search tool that allows you to search for footage, video footage, photos, vectors, illustrations or all of the above.  And you can search not just by noun.  Let's say what should I what should I search for a bicycle?  So I could search for bicycles, but I can then I can add stuff.  I could say blue bicycles.  In fact, they have a color picker that lets you just choose blue bicycles.  I could say silly bicycles.  You can add adjectives and then you get pictures like this.  So I think that's really it really makes it a very useful tool.  Then even by the way, you can use this without having an account or anything.

Transcript:  What do you think?  I think if you were already a big fan of getting stuff from Amazon,  it's a good experience.  Just like the Kindle Fire.  Netflix and Hulu are really kind of off to the side  and nowhere near as well done.  The speech worked really well.  Except it only searches Amazon.  Right, it only searches Amazon.  Which I guess is not surprising.  Also, the other thing which is interesting is on Roku,  they neatly divide the stuff you have to pay for  if you're a Prime member from the stuff which is free  if you're a Prime member.  And on Fire TV, the free stuff and the stuff you have to pay for  are all intermingled.  And it is therefore more likely, I think, that you'll find something  and then pay for it.

Transcript:  I figure Apple is betting the farm.  They're all in on the idea of making this deal with Comcast.  They negotiated for years with Time Warner, then they had to shift gears and go to Comcast.  If they could get live TV on there...  But I don't think Comcast is going to make a deal with just one company.  We had Peter Kafka on our coverage of the Amazon announcement and he said that.  He said that everybody's learned their lesson from the music industry's experience with Apple.  You give Apple too much power and you're in trouble.  So if anything, if Comcast ever makes a deal, it'll be with all of them.  And I think maybe that's why Amazon did this, just so that they at least be in the hunt.  But that would be...  Wouldn't that...  You want the perfect cord cutter device.

Transcript:  Well, I have both. I have Apple TV and I have Roku.  I should be getting a Fire TV shortly.  And what's interesting is I find myself these days using the Roku more than the Apple TV,  mainly because we have Aereo here.  And I watch...  The place I've moved to actually has a very bad signal for HDTV over the air.  And so I use Aereo and Aereo is only on the Roku.  And it works quite well over a very fast connection.  And to me at the moment, it looks like the Roku 3 is probably the ultimate cord cutter device.  So I'd be very curious to see if Amazon comes up with something like an Aereo app,  particularly if Aereo wins its April 22nd...  That's right.

Transcript:  So Aereo has a Houston facility, and I got a tour of it about a week and a half ago.  Chet Kanogia came down and I got to interview him and got to see the...  And it is incredibly efficient.  It's two cabinets on the roof of a data center.  There are a series of circuit boards with their little antennas inside the cabinets  and a fiber connection that takes it down to about three or four servers in the data center down below  and then out to the internet.  And it is... they can expand it quickly and easily.  There's no Houston employees.  Everything is done remotely.  And they're already profitable here and in most of the cities that they're in.

Transcript:  What are the odds on the Supreme Court's decision? What do you think?  I mean, remember the Supreme Court decided on the lawsuit by the Motion Picture Association of America  to try to stop video recorders.  And the Supreme Court in 1984 ruled that you could record for personal use.  It wasn't a violation of copyright law.  And created an industry which, I might point out, the motion picture industry immediately benefited  to the tune of billions of dollars.  So I don't... I think at least there's some history of the Supreme Court supporting new technologies like this.  It was a long time ago.  But that was 1984.

End time: 3301.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But you can bet that the defendants in the case will bring up that groundbreaking...  Oh yeah.  But the other thing is, is there's... one of the interesting side effects on this is that  there was a 2008 case involving cable vision and cloud DVRs.  Right.  Which never went to the Supreme Court. That never went to the court.  The current case law is such that it allows it and that's why you have...  And essentially what Aereo is doing is they're grafting the concept of outsourcing an antenna  to a cloud DVR, which they say is legal.  And so, you know, is putting those two together legal?  There are both copyright issues and there are... there's the issue of the carriage fees  and whether they should be paying carriage fees on that.  But, you know, it's such a complex thing.  Both sides try to paint it as black and white, but it's actually a really complex issue.  And I can see the Supreme Court going either way on this.  Aereo is doing us a favor though.

I don't know if you can hear them live, but you can hear them after the fact,  like within a day.  So I'm sure it'll be very interesting to listen to that.  ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox and others are all trying to get the court to say  Aereo is a violation of copyright.  Aereo, you know, it's Aereo, which was started by Barry Diller.  It's obvious it's a trick.  I mean, everybody looking at it, oh, that was clever.  It's a clever trick.  Oh, no, you're not.  Well, you're just renting an antenna.  It's the fact that they're dime shaped and there's hundreds of them in a rack  that's up in the Houston with no employees.  But it's an antenna.  And you're renting that particular antenna.  And the fact that we're DVRing it for you, that's on your behalf.  But everybody knows it's kind of a wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  See, isn't that clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, the dissent in the Boston case, the judge called it a contrivance.  Yes.  And that's what it is.  But again, I think that all technologies like this where they kind of,  where they graph two things together is a contrivance.  And then it becomes, if it becomes legal, it's not a contrivance, it's an innovation.

Start time: 3401.10
End time: 3456.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason now that these networks, and it's ABC TV is the plaintiff in it,  the reason that these networks don't want it, it's also a contrivance in a way  because the networks have been offering free over the air television  for as long as there's been television and they support it with ads.  And those ads in the free over the air television is just being sucked in the dime sized thing  and sent out to my iPad.  So I'm still seeing all the ads.  It's no different than if I literally were in Houston and I had an antenna.  But what they don't like about it is they have very lucrative retransmission agreements  with the cable companies.  And so in a way, I think you could also look at that as a contrivance,  as in a way the television networks have figured out a way to make more money  for the product they've been offering for free.  And they don't want to do it for free anymore.

Start time: 3457.72
End time: 3503.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's a law that essentially created the transmission fee system  where it made the capture of the over the air local broadcasts legal by the carriers,  the cable companies, and they said, okay, you can do this, but you have to pay them for it.  And they designated them as a certain type of business, and so that's why they have to do it.  One of the arguments that is made by broadcasters is that if Aereo succeeds with this,  then what is to keep Comcast and Cablevision and so forth from saying,  oh, we don't have to pay it, we'll just set up antennas.  Well, there's a law that says you have to pay if you're this type of carrier.  Aereo is essentially because it's over the internet is not that type of carrier.  What could happen is the law could be changed.

So I watched a little C-SPAN this week, watching the testimony,  Comcast in Congress,  explaining why they should become the largest broadband provider in the United States,  the largest cable company in the United States by taking over Time Warner.  Do you think that Congress was moved by the testimony?  Either one of you watching any of this?

Transcript:  Well, in the wake of the failed AT&T-T mobile merger,  I think people, maybe regulators, may be more emboldened to just say no.  That was fairly rare until that.  And, however, the argument that they don't compete in the same space may make it harder for them.  Houston is an interesting case because we're one of the few markets that had Time Warner,  and then it switched to Comcast.  They traded territories.  And so I've seen both of them.  It started out here as Time Warner and Roadrunner for broadband, and then became Comcast.  And there's two different eras.  And on one level, Comcast is much better than Time Warner,  at least, again, from the era that I saw Time Warner.  But on another one, it's just meet the old boss same, meet the new boss same as the old boss.

Transcript:  Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, says, we want to be like Apple,  and we want to invest money in R&D, and we want to be innovative.  Meanwhile, according to Consumerist, Comcast is now the worst company in America.  Consumerist has an annual competition that's only the second company to take this title twice.  Comcast defeated Monsanto.  I guess they do it like in brackets.  I don't know where you go head to head, and then you advance.  And in the Consumerist annual poll to find America's worst company,  Comcast has emerged bloody and victorious.  Send that to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Comcast says, even though we turned a profit of $6.8 billion last year,  even though Time Warner earned $2 billion last year,  those are pretty successful companies,  they want to get together so that they can spend money on research and development  to make themselves a better company.

Transcript:  I would expect, and this is fairly typical in these things, something like that,  where we don't want you to control all media everywhere in every form,  so maybe you could just get some of that stuff off your table.  Yeah, NBC, not just NBC, NBC and Universal, they make TV, they distribute TV, they do it all.  Comcast and Time Warner say we're locked in a do-or-die competitive fight  with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Netflix. That may be true.  I mean, we're seeing these companies come up and start to,  Netflix has done a very good job of offering content,  and certainly they distribute films as well, or better than Comcast does.

Transcript:  Actually, I love how the consumerists does this, and I think it's somewhat just for fun, but they do have a bracket.  So AT&T faced Microsoft, AT&T won for worst company.  Verizon faced eBay, and Verizon won for worst company.  Then Verizon faced AT&T, and Verizon won.  Then Verizon faced Comcast, and Comcast won.  So you have to work your way up. It's much like March Madness.  EA, which has for a long time, I think, been considered one of the worst companies in America, lost immediately.  Kind of an upset victory for Time Warner Cable, which just whooped EA right out of the box.  Then Time Warner Cable faced Coke Industries, and beat them, beat the Coke Brothers.  So there you go.  And then finally Monsanto beat Time Warner Cable.  It's just it's really exciting.  I think we should have next year, let's have some brackets.  We can have the we can really have some fun.  We have our little our pool.  SeaWorld is in there, but we're not going to have a lot of fun.  SeaWorld was in there, by the way.  SeaWorld beat Johnson & Johnson and Ticketmaster.

SeaWorld faced Comcast and finally met their match.  It's pretty hard to beat Comcast in this game.  Those guys are tough, longtime competitors for worst company in America.  Facebook immediately got, by the way, was eliminated in the first round.  Surprisingly.  Anything to say about Facebook this week?  Not really.  They were kind of quiet.

Start time: 4448.04
End time: 4456.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're going to take it out of the apps.  I mean, already, if you have it installed, they kind of jump back and forth and they will force that decision for you by taking it out of the app.

End time: 4471.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have I don't have messenger installed and I very seldom use chat on the phone app.  But yeah, I've been seeing that that message and that's going to, I think, irritate a lot of people.  I think that's not a I think that's not a smart move on their part.

Start time: 4472.34
End time: 4497.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'm not sure why they would do that.  Well, they have the strategy of thinking that you should have different apps for different purposes.  So you have Facebook and you have Instagram and you have messenger and you have what's the direction.  Do you want to consolidate all that?  I think their argument is that if it's easier to do a great chat experience, if that's all an app is doing, I find it disjointed because I'm in Facebook and it boots me out of Facebook and the chat and the messenger.

Start time: 4499.36
End time: 4507.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like they're trying to turn Facebook itself into a news app, which is ironic, like the paper.  Right. And then Twitter is trying to turn into Facebook.

End time: 4523.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dropbox is also following this, this because Dropbox just announced Carousel.  If you're doing photos in your Dropbox, I think you should be using a standalone photos app rather than doing it within Dropbox.  Same basic idea.  And they own Mailbox, which is a standalone email client.

Start time: 4523.22
End time: 4544.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So is anyone still using that? It was called Paper, the app that I like.  I like it.  I found it hard to find the thing to stay up with the things I wanted to stay up with.  It was it looked like the pretty overtook the stuff I actually wanted to see and I quit using it.  It's still there and every now and then I open it.

Start time: 4545.86
End time: 4553.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it you wanted to see? Because Facebook thinks what you want is news.  But I've always thought people join Facebook and want to see their friends because they want to see their friends and family.

Start time: 4554.02
End time: 4563.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like groups. Groups are really hidden in paper.  You use groups? Yes, all the time.  And they are hard to find in paper, which I like even despite that.  Yeah. What are you looking for that you don't get?

Start time: 4564.50
End time: 4603.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm looking for my what my friends are doing and what they think is interesting.  You know, I run our news. I run our Facebook page.  And so I want our readers to find our news through there.  But my personal use of Facebook is not that there was a Pew study a couple of weeks ago about the way people use social media and that most people don't use Facebook looking for news.  But if it comes to them, they're interested in it.  They see Facebook as a way to keep up with their friends and family, not necessarily a way to keep up with the news.  Twitter, on the other hand, has more of the... It's a news feed, isn't it?  It's a news feed. Right. It's everybody's personal AP wire.

Start time: 4604.44
End time: 4618.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, we just saw a study in which Twitter denies, but a study that 44 percent of Twitter accounts have never tweeted.  So people join Twitter to read, not to post, which surprises me a little bit.

Start time: 4619.70
End time: 4640.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They read it to keep up with the news. That's how my wife uses it.  She... The first thing she does in the morning, she reaches over and grabs her phone and starts reading Twitter.  It drives me crazy because, you know, one of the joys about being in the news business is you get to know everything first.  But I can't tell her anything anymore. She knows it all. Right. That's good. That's what she wants. That's what you want.

Start time: 4641.00
End time: 4661.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so this new algorithm, this thing... Facebook seems to want to do... I don't know. They're up to something.  What is their evil plan? They want... They make money from showing you ads. Right.  So everything is around making it a product that you will want to look at more.  The more you spend on Facebook, using Facebook, the more money they make. Is that right? Is that what they care about?

Start time: 4662.16
End time: 4680.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Or is that... So could it be that they want to sell different kinds of ads in chat versus regular app?  That it essentially gives them another avenue to sell to advertisers?  I mean... You can do it in chat and it may be a different kind of ad and may have different kind of results from being in chat versus the main app.

Start time: 4680.02
End time: 4711.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would make sense. I think in some instances it's totally logical. Like with Instagram, I would not want...  No, please don't mix the two. I don't want Instagram to be part of Facebook. It makes sense for it to be standalone.  I think the difference is that right now, if you're on Facebook Messenger, it's because you want to talk to your Facebook friends  and it's not a separate thing from reading their updates and so forth.  And that's why you get into this loop where you're jumping back and forth between them, which does not happen with Instagram.  Instagram, you're probably... I just want to see pictures. You're looking at other people's photos and it's not the same group.

Start time: 4712.66
End time: 4730.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That does make sense. Somebody in the chat room said that's the Unix tools model where you want to do small tools that do things well.  But on Unix, you can chain them together to make a bigger thing that does different things.  There's no piping yet in Facebook apps.

Start time: 4730.32
End time: 4746.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Facebook does have this challenge that it does so many things.  It's a lot.  There's a real danger for it to become bloated and you won't be able to find stuff, which is already an issue.  There are all kinds of things you can do on Facebook I don't know about simply because they're three menus down.

Start time: 4747.22
End time: 4765.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The irony, though, is that they don't have a great track record of introducing new apps that take off.  The Facebook home was a flop. I think it sounds like paper might well be a flop.  And paper is gorgeous. They did everything right with paper.  But people just kind of want the Facebook experience.

Start time: 4766.56
End time: 4774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the Windows XP effect. People understand Facebook in its original form and they don't necessarily want to give it up even for something that is theoretically better.

Start time: 4774.00
End time: 4812.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think part of it may also have to do with just the overall form factor and the design of smartphones and the way they interact with the operating system.  In iOS, when you switch to an app, there's a visual swapping of the apps and that's jarring.  Same thing in Android. It's less so.  But if you chained it so that you didn't realize you were leaving the Messenger app to go look at something that someone linked to you in a Facebook page,  and then when you went back to the Messenger app, it seemed seamless, that might make more sense.  But the way smartphone interfaces work, it just kind of makes you blink and you don't like it.

Start time: 4813.44
End time: 4825.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It strikes me there's a risk in separating Messenger out that people just won't use it.  It'll be just like taking a chunk out of Facebook and throwing it away. I'm not going to download Messenger.  Right. Nobody messages me. Right. I don't need it.

Start time: 4827.22
End time: 4847.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And I use other things. I mean, people already have all kinds of messaging apps coming at you.  There's WhatsApp. There's iMessage if you use that. There's the Messenger built into Android.  You already have many ways in which you can get notifications.  And to separate that out and make just one more seems to be like overload.

Start time: 4848.22
End time: 4868.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's an interesting question. How do you think people like to use stuff?  Would they rather have an omnibus app that does it all? Or would they rather separate all these functions out,  which would maybe allow them to choose in each case best in class?  Maybe it's the Facebook Messenger, but maybe it's not. I'm going to use the Messenger that's best in class.

Start time: 4870.16
End time: 4890.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Remember, like two or three years ago, Facebook gave everybody their own email address?  Yeah. Nobody used it. Or pissed.  And they kind of envisioned becoming a primary email provider, which never happened as far as I know.  I think they see Messenger as getting people to think of it not as where you go to message Facebook users,  but where you go first for messaging, period.

Start time: 4892.30
End time: 4902.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Now I'm thinking, I can't remember any big successes recently in the last three years from Facebook,  any apps that took off, anything that they've done that's been significant.

Start time: 4903.56
End time: 4909.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 4909.58
End time: 4913.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4914.02
End time: 4923.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Their big success is that the Facebook mobile app has done really well, probably better than it necessarily would have,  because I think they've been generally speaking a good job of having a good mobile experience.

Start time: 4923.02
End time: 4935.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been able to go to, and that's the transition everybody was wondering if they could make.  They've been able to remove revenue off the desktop to mobile. People are using Facebook.  In fact, most of their revenue is now mobile, like 54%.

Start time: 4937.50
End time: 4965.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But one of the reasons why is that it duplicates or replicates the desktop look.  It's familiar. When you're looking at it, there's no question, oh, I'm looking at Facebook.  It looks like this on the desktop too. And they kept the familiarity.  Remember the early Facebook apps, because they were using HTML5, were slow and irritating to use.  And once they got away from it, that is what sped it up.  But I think one of the big reasons why people use it is it looks like Facebook.

Start time: 4966.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's funny. Now, I don't use the iPhone version. I use the Android version.  I don't know if you guys are iPhone users, but they have really changed the Android one now.  It's got these columns. It isn't like the old Facebook app.  And they moved the hamburger for absolutely no reason that I can understand.  Remember that the settings used to be over on the left. Now they're on the right.  I don't really understand. They've changed everything kind of randomly.  Does it look like that on iOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. Yeah. It's unchanged.  It's Facebook. It's exactly like Facebook on the desktop.  So it's interesting. Here's a company.  They talk about spending a lot of money on R&D, talking about being innovative and forward thinking.  And yet can you think of a big hit that they've had lately?  Chat faces? Chat heads? Whatever that's called.  I mean, really, what have you done for me lately?  Maybe you just, you know, maybe you just...  It's never... We're not going to see companies on top anymore.  It's just going to be a constant churn of companies going through this cycle.  Although I have to say, I've been very impressed.  We talked, I think, a little bit about this last week.  We certainly have been talking about it on Windows Weekly.  Satya Nadella seems to have brought Microsoft back from the dead in some ways.  They like the new Microsoft. They're open-end sourcing some of their code, .NET code.  They've reduced the price of Windows on 9-inch screens or less to zero.  Unheard of.  Is it a kinder, gentler Microsoft?  And I think, I just, you know, Windows Phone 8.1 looks pretty darn good.  Would you ever consider a Windows Phone?

End time: 5114.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, again, my advice to myself as somebody who writes about this stuff is I need to use everything.  You have to.  So I jump back and forth. I jump back and forth between iPhone and Android kind of constantly.  Yeah.  And Windows, I think, should be in that mix.

Transcript:  Days.  Weave is off the hook, but only because of a technicality.  Weave really became a cause celeb for a lot of the hacker community.  He himself bills himself as a hacker troll.  But what Weave did, which got him in so much trouble, was he discovered a flaw in AT&T's system  and used it to download the names and email addresses of iPad users.  And he says, I told AT&T he downloaded 140,000 iPad owners from an AT&T website.  Maybe he went a little far by publishing it, but it was a pretty...  He passed along the email addresses to Gawker,  although they didn't publish it without redacting some of the information.  He was convicted in the New Jersey Federal Court of a felony for conspiracy to access AT&T's servers,  but the three-judge federal appellate panel turned the conviction over on appeals saying,  well, it turns out none of the servers were in New Jersey.  So AT&T wanted to have the trial in New Jersey for some reason,  or maybe the government wanted to have it.  The addresses were obtained from residents in New Jersey,  but it turns out that the servers themselves, not one of them was in New Jersey.  So purely on a technicality, he's off the hook.  Justice Department has not decided to appeal.

Transcript:  It seems kind of base...  It was a venue technicality that was fairly obvious.  Maybe they didn't know at the time.  The real issue is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,  which is so broad that it really is possible to prosecute people for almost anything.  And so I think that's really the issue that ultimately needs to be addressed.  The third court of appeals said that Weave was charged on the wrong federal court.  So celebration, but for all the wrong reasons.  Hewlett-Packard is going to pay $108 million for bribing public officials.  In Poland, Russia, and Mexico, an international investigation found corruption in those three countries,  and HP is going to have to pay $108 in fines.

And thanks to Scott Wilkinson and Father Robert Balisar.  And if you didn't see our NAB coverage, it's in the specials feed, right?  twit.tv slash specials.  A little out of breath.  I just ran across the studio and back during that promo.  One of the things that they did announce at NAB that we were very interested in,  Skype announced, you know, Skype's now a Microsoft product.  Microsoft had acquired a company called Cat and Mouse.  Is that it?  Cat and Mouse.  And they're going to do a new media product.  So we called them up immediately.  Skype TX.  Skype TX.  Yeah. Have you heard about that?

End time: 5659.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not completely sure what they're doing, but we did talk to them and they knew who we were.  They know we use Skype like crazy.  You're on Skype right now.  And so they're going to get us.  We think they're going to get us a Skype TX pretty quick.  So for all the people who tweeted me.  Will it change what we do here?  I don't think from your point of view it will.  I think you'll just use Skype as you are using it.  But we will have a Skype TX box here that will give us all sorts of capabilities in terms of settings,  things that we under the hood that we haven't been able to dials,  we haven't been able to twiddle in Skype.  Plus it will be integrated better into our hardware setup.  It will have SDI video and all of that stuff.  You should get better video back, better audio back, and we should be able to...  There's all sorts of issues with screen sizes and stuff, weird things happening there,  and we should be able to get better results.  So to me that was the big story.  I know a lot of you probably don't care, but that was the big story.  I know enough of you care because I got a lot of tweets from people  and emails flying back and forth.  What did they announce? What did they announce?  So we're excited about that.  So that's good news.  Do you have a week ahead with Mr. Mike Elgin?  Let's see what's coming up in the week ahead.

Dwight Silverman from The Chronicle, Houston Chronicle,  from Time Magazine, Technologizer, Harry McCracken.  I always call you Technologizer. Is that OK?  Is that your title?  It's flattering.  The Terminator, the Technologizer.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.  Whether you have a computer, a single computer at home,  or you've got external drives or multiple computers at your business,  Carbonite is the place to backup your files to the cloud automatically,  continuously.  They are, I tell you, they are a great company.  What is the number? If you scroll down a little bit,  I think it says 50,000 businesses.  Yeah, 50,000 businesses now use Carbonite to backup 350 million files a day.  30 billion files total.  The thing about it is it's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.  It's continuous.  Whenever you're online, it's backing up.  So instantly, you don't have to wait until the weekend to backup.  You can get to your files anytime on the Carbonite servers,  so it's in the cloud.  You log on to your Carbonite account, there's your stuff.  And it's just really easy.  I'm sorry, 300 billion files backed up.  HIPAA compliant, too.  And in fact, if you're worried about the idea that maybe your files  would be visible to three-letter federal agencies in the Carbonite cloud,  you do have the ability to further encrypt using trust-know-one encryption.  Only you have the key, not Carbonite.  Just things like that that really make Carbonite great.  Now, the best part is a very affordable flat rate plans,  $59.99 a year for everything on a single Mac or a PC,  but they've got plans for networks, servers, and more.  Always one yearly flat rate, no matter how much data you have.  Carbonite.com, you can try it right now.  You don't need a credit card, just our offer code TWIT.  If you use our offer code TWIT during your two-week trial,  you'll get two weeks, I'm sorry, two months free with purchase.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right.  Carbonite.  Actually, I think there's been a lot of interest in Carbonite  since we found out this week that Condoleezza Rice,  the architect of the federal spying infrastructure  that was created during the Bush administration,  is now on the board of Dropbox, so that'll make it easier.  Not that Dropbox would ever turn down a federal request anyway,  but it's just, you know, we've got a channel right into the...  I like Dropbox, but it is a little bit weird.  Here's a good one.  Apparently, the feds were able to get into GoGo's in-flight Wi-Fi.  You know, in case you were wondering,  when you're in the air using GoGo Wi-Fi,  you're automatically sharing your stuff with law enforcement.  Apparently, GoGo has voluntarily shared more than required  with law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be public, right?  Chris Seguian, we love Chris.  You're in the air! What the hell?  Chris Seguian, who is at the ACLU,  tweeted a link to a letter submitted from a GoGo attorney to the FCC  which said,  The Commission's air-to-ground rules do not require licensees  to implement capabilities to support law enforcement  beyond those outlined in CALEA,  but GoGo worked with federal agencies to reach agreement  regarding a set of additional capabilities  to accommodate law enforcement interests.  Do you think terrorists in the air like tweet,  I'm going to take over the plane before?  Is that why you think, because they're in the air?

Start time: 5926.20
End time: 5941.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I sort of assumed that at least the government would be worried about that.  GoGo also said that the only reason there's a cap chop  when you pay for GoGo in the air  is because the government insisted on it being there,  which I always wondered about,  because I didn't understand anybody could spam GoGo.

Start time: 5959.34
End time: 5997.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's bizarre.  GoGo says its primary concession to law enforcement  was to impose a CAPTCHA  to thwart spammers and other network abuse.  So CAPTCHA only finds bots.  It doesn't do a very good job of it, by the way.  In fact, nobody should be using CAPTCHA ever.  It's terrible.  Besides annoying your users,  it doesn't provide you with any additional security.  In fact, we know what bad guys do  is they just make a porn site  and they feed the CAPTCHAs into the porn site  and say, if you want to see porn,  enter this CAPTCHA, tell us what this means,  and then they take the results back,  and there's so many people hitting the site,  they can unlock any CAPTCHA right away.

Start time: 5997.08
End time: 6000.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 6001.02
End time: 6011.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't keep out robots.  And robots are there at 10,000 and 30,000 feet.  Who's writing spam robots?  You're right, it must be like,  oh, we've infiltrated the air-conditioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What if somebody put a bomb on a plane  in the cargo space and it was somehow able to log on to?  Wouldn't it be great if the CAPTCHA would thwart that?  I sort of wondered if that was the reason it was there.  It's bizarre.  Because the stories I saw didn't really explain  why the government would care if there was a CAPTCHA on GoGo.

Start time: 6027.04
End time: 6032.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Of documentaries like Planet Earth and Life.  He's doing a new  documentary, Conquest on the Skies.  They're filming with an 8-camera rig  because they wanted to deliver  a 360-degree video  for wearers of the Oculus Rift.  Imagine...  Now this, to me, is kind of intriguing.  Imagine  watching a movie in the Rift headset  and when you see something going over there,  you look to the left.  And when you see something going over there,  you look to the right.

Start time: 6104.17
End time: 6130.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The middle.  It has to be the middle  because you have to have something on the left and right to look at.  But if it's 8, it's all around you.  It's 360.  You could turn around.  That would be wild.  That wouldn't be weird.  Am I just paranoid?  Because I think one of the problems with the Oculus Rift is  the fact that you are standing with a thing on your head  that means you can't hear or see anything  that's going on around you.  Somebody could just come knock you on the head

Start time: 6131.06
End time: 6159.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and steal your cool glass.  So there's a company here in Houston,  I think it's called Virtuix Omni  or something like that,  that has developed a treadmill for use  with headsets like the Oculus Rift.  Terrible idea.  It's like a little platform  with guardrails around it  and it allows you to move around in this world.  I think they just went up on Kickstarter.  Virtuix Omni is what it's called.  Yeah.  They're based here.  It's only $500.

You'd aim the gun,  you'd physically aim the gun  and then they put the Oculus Rift on me  and I was beating zombies with a stick  but then I got sick.  And it wasn't fun.  But we did get an email  from somebody saying if you put a cool, damp  washcloth on the back of your neck  you'll feel better.  But I didn't get that until like three days later
