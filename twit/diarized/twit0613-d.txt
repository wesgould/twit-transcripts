Transcript:  Yeah, we were, I was talking on Twitter this weekend about,  I would like to open up a grant program similar to what we do with health research  and basically open it up for information security as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well come 2018, you may not be the only technologist in Washington, DC.  See, imagine yourself a small town, Newton Falls, Ohio.  Nothing ever happens exciting.  You get a phone call from a company saying a billionaire philanthropist  wants to have dinner with you next week.  I can't tell you his name.  In fact, I won't tell you his name until 15 minutes before he arrives.  Would you be willing to?  This family said yes.  And here's the picture of Mark Zuckerberg in meeting real people.

Start time: 340.96
End time: 346.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, anytime you'd see this picture, you'd assume she's looking at a smartphone,  but there aren't any smartphones in evidence.

Start time: 346.64
End time: 377.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're eating on plastic plates because apparently Mark won't eat real people's food.  So they had it catered.  Was that why?  Yeah.  Did they really have that?  Did they really have a catered?  They had it catered.  Oh my gosh.  And the article, this is in Business Insider said that Mark, Mark Zuckerberg,  people were tapping away at their laptops in the other room.  Like he brings an entourage.

Start time: 377.68
End time: 408.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, of course he brings.  Yeah.  So here's the thing.  Okay.  I really, I want to, I want to ask the panel here.  So I wrote a piece, I don't know, a few months ago saying it sure as heck looks like Mark  Zuckerberg's running for president.  And there was some people that were like, absolutely.  When you look at all these photos and there are other people like you,  you're completely wrong.  The old, these photos, I, what is going on?  Like, what is he doing?  And don't tell me he's just going around the country meeting people  because if he was doing that, why would he be specifically said to this family?

Start time: 409.32
End time: 414.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you, if when the press calls you and they will please tell them I'm not running  for president.

Start time: 415.90
End time: 419.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I don't think he's old enough to run for president.  Is he?  Yes.

Start time: 419.28
End time: 422.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's when, when he, when in 2020, he turns 35, one month before the filing

Start time: 424.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  deadline for 2020.

Start time: 426.62
End time: 444.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I, I think it's possible.  I think it's highly improbable.  And, and.  Really?  No, no.  Why is he doing this then?  Why is he?  I think he's maybe eventually, eventually doing that.  They've got a massive press problem on their hands right now with fake news and.

Start time: 444.56
End time: 447.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does this make people feel better about fake news to see Mark sitting at this table?

Start time: 448.92
End time: 451.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With catered food.  I mean, really?

Start time: 452.64
End time: 460.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so I think you're right, Amy.  I think he's not running for in this cycle.  He's not running in 2020, unlike by theory is driving a tractor.  Oh, please.

Start time: 461.26
End time: 497.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have to tell you, I feel like I have a special point of view on this because, you know,  I'm out there in fact, right before I got here, I'm out there in hall, Massachusetts.  You're doing this.  I'm doing this.  And the thought of inviting myself over to someone's house is so deeply uncomfortable.  And if you want to meet people, this is a completely wrong, really weird way to go about it.  I have people that write me every week and I go, do you want to have coffee?  And that's sitting down in private and talking.  It's not making it this weird media thing.

Start time: 498.28
End time: 510.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's clear he brings photographers, lights,  look at this picture talking to a fire department.  This looks so canned, phony and staged.  It looks like he's been green screened into this.

Start time: 512.34
End time: 512.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I.  Okay.

Start time: 513.42
End time: 534.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The better question is though, is it does, you know, so Brianna, you're asking people if they want  to have coffee with you, wouldn't Zuck just tell us we're going to have coffee with him through  the miracles of AI and machine learning?  And why bother going out to the real world when you have everybody's data at your fingertips?  I think you're both right.

Start time: 534.55
End time: 578.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think.  Wait, hold on.  Can we look at this?  There's other evidence here.  Okay.  To a politically political campaign.  So they updated their S1 filing with the SEC to note that if Mark Zuckerberg decides to run  for office and he could still remain CEO, why would you put that in there?  If that didn't mean anything, they've been hiring people from the Obama campaign  on the foundation.  There's just all these things that he's been doing.  These photos, it doesn't add up.  There's people that have been telling me, oh, well, it's just a PR push.  But it's giving them more negative PR around this whole president thing.  What the hell does he want to be president for though?

Start time: 578.62
End time: 579.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, honestly.

Start time: 580.23
End time: 584.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a theory.  I don't know if it's president because I do think that it's too small of a job for him.

Start time: 585.22
End time: 589.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wants to be emperor of the world?  What's bigger than president of the United States?

Start time: 591.24
End time: 598.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, maybe he's going to try out for governor or even mayor.  I don't know.  Something kind of as a testing ground.  But there's something going on.

Start time: 598.32
End time: 632.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's clearly something going on.  I think, Amy, you're right.  There is a question.  Many of our panelists have said this in the past.  He's already got a very, probably he's a kingmaker.  He doesn't need to be the king.  Oh, he's better to be the kingmaker, the Rishul Yuh rather than,  because then you have more power, frankly, the kingmaker.  However, so I don't think he's running in 2020.  I think, though, that this is a he's playing the long game that at some point he would.  Look at this.  You don't do that because of fake news.  You don't feed a cow.

Start time: 636.43
End time: 659.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I got to say, because I'm, you know, we advise many, many, many news organizations and also  not this administration, but the previous administration.  And he's got a pretty massive problem on his hands.  And if every news organization in the country, in our country, decided to cut off the tap,  that would be a tremendous problem.  And they're doing it, right?

Start time: 659.74
End time: 663.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instant Articles has lost the New York Times.  They've lost the Washington Post.

Start time: 664.38
End time: 670.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I, there may be part of this may be politics, but I also think that there's a piece of this  that's a PR mistake.

Start time: 670.76
End time: 679.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amy, how does this help fake news or instant articles?  I don't understand how this helps anything.  So if I were to connect the dots.

Start time: 679.70
End time: 683.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I don't, I don't think that it,  This is your job, Amy.  This is what you do.

Start time: 684.98
End time: 686.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're predicting the future for us.

Start time: 687.04
End time: 730.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  My hunch here is that we're all so easily distracted no matter how smart we are and how  prestigious our jobs might be.  We get distracted over and over again.  And I, my first career was as a journalist.  So this is not about me, you know, disliking journalists or anything like that.  I just think we get distracted.  And I think that that, that campaign, you know, whether it was for politics or for straight up,  you know, gratiating Zuck and Facebook, Facebook back into everybody's good graces,  I think was more about, was a lot about likeability.  And I think that that has a reverberating effect.  I really do.

Start time: 731.70
End time: 776.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you have to look at the big picture here too.  I mean, look at, he recently gave away a huge portion of his wealth for philanthropy worldwide.  And well, I know it's sort of, I know it's quirky.  But my point there is he's trying to raise an international presence here.  And when he has a positive view by the mass public,  I think it enables him to do a lot of things.  Like a Facebook is trying to work with local governments.  It's a huge part of what they end up doing.  So I see this as an overall political move meant to open many doors for him.  And maybe he runs for president, maybe he doesn't,  but it certainly makes a lot of the things Facebook wants to do just easier.

Start time: 776.96
End time: 792.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I would mention to Mark's team that just remember Mike Dukakis in the tank with the helmet,  that picture with basketball players does not show it again, does not raise Zuck's stature.  That is probably the one you want to throw out.  I'm just saying.

Start time: 793.54
End time: 810.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, I think here's the thing.  Let's just pretend that the four of us run Mark's public relations team.  Can you imagine, so, you know, oh guys, there's been this huge problem with fake news.  What do we do?  And someone says, I know, let's go take a picture of Mark feeding a cow.

Start time: 811.84
End time: 812.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, remember that.

Start time: 813.36
End time: 819.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And wait a minute, but wait, Nick, how many different places did we all see that photo?  I completely agree with you, but.

Start time: 820.06
End time: 821.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works in that respect.

Start time: 822.03
End time: 822.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.

Start time: 823.40
End time: 857.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he did, you know, Mark does, as we know, these things like he was going to only cook  and kill his own.  He was only eat meat he killed.  He was going to learn Chinese and actually did, which is kind of impressive.  Having tried that for myself for four years in school, it's not easy.  So one of his goals for this year was to go to all 50 states, talk to people in all 50 states.  So you could just say on the surface that he's just doing his weird kind of, I'm a billionaire.  I could do anything I want.  So instead of building a rocket ship, I'm going to meet everybody in every step.  I don't know.

Start time: 857.72
End time: 865.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see photos of him like studying conjure, whatever.  I didn't get any verbs.  Ni hao.

Start time: 865.32
End time: 870.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see photos of him killing his animals?  No.  So why are we seeing photos of this stuff?

Start time: 871.52
End time: 887.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  So we all agree it's PR.  Oh, look at medium generals.  Now that's important.  You got to meet generals if you're going to.  Is that an American general?  What uniform is that?  I've never seen that hat before.  What is that?

Start time: 889.12
End time: 922.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do want to say one other thing.  So there was when I written that Vanity Fair piece, Buzzfeed went along to Zuck.  They got access to him and they said, are you running for president?  And he said, no.  And then it was this big story like Zuck says he's not running for president.  Of course he's not going to say he's running for president.  Facebook stock would literally drop 20, 30% in five seconds.  I think that we should not take it as face value when he says no or don't  tell people I'm running for president.  There is something going on and we should be questioning it.

Start time: 923.44
End time: 923.53
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 923.74
End time: 977.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a Mar- I'm told a Marpat uniform from the US Army.  Thank you.  Our chat room knows everything.  There's nothing goes, nothing gets by them.  Uh, so it's clearly PR.  It's clearly designed to cultivate a certain image.  Do you think that he, I mean, he's hiring people, as you said, with political operatives.  He's, I think this is going to be the most carefully orchestrated campaign we've ever seen.  And that closer to 2020, there will be a draft Zuckerberg movement.  I don't think he's ever going to.  I think he, I think what he will do is arrange it so that he can't the drum beat.  And he eventually says, look, I don't want to do this.  I'm happy running Facebook, but I can see that America needs me.

Start time: 979.30
End time: 985.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he's going to say, and I need this group of people here to be my campaign managers.

Start time: 986.40
End time: 993.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I'm going to call Mike judge and ask him to, uh, to do a new series.  That will be amazing.

Start time: 994.40
End time: 1030.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have to say though, that you can a little bit blame this in the last election, because I think  when people like Zuckerberg, uh, and I'll include Jason Calacanis, uh, who wants to run for mayor of  San Francisco, saw that somebody who has only business experience, marginal business experience  and no political experience and no, no record of, of political service or service of any kind  can become elected color orange and is the color can be elected president.  It's, I think it might've, I can see in their heart of hearts.  They might've said, Oh, well, yeah, why not me?

Start time: 1031.12
End time: 1052.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's certainly why I'm bringing Leo.  I mean, but it's, it's less of that.  It's like, you know, I think there are so many people across this country that never imagine  themselves as politicians and see that they don't have a choice other than to engage this  political system.  Cause the status quo is so terrifying.  I think that is why you're seeing an avalanche of women running.

Start time: 1052.62
End time: 1075.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the thing that scares me the most is that, uh, people are going to get turned off to politics.  That's why I'm glad to see you running.  Thank you.  Because the biggest fear that I have at this point is that all the cynics who've said all along,  see it's rigged.  It doesn't matter.  Are just getting confirmation now and they look at the Democrats and they look at the  Republicans and they, and they throw up their hands and say, screw it.

Start time: 1076.82
End time: 1128.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, well, isn't, isn't a lot of, I think, whatever.  I think, I think some of what we're seeing with, with Mark and, um, I think some of what  we're seeing right now is, is just a reaction to, uh, the two party system that's gone off  the rails in the U S right.  That's be, and, and everything is, is polarized technology has become polarized and politicized,  you know, health and all of these facets of our everyday lives are subject to, um, morning  talk shows and, you know, political wrangling.  Um, and I, and I think that's just, you know, sort of stoke this great frustration that I  certainly feel.  And I'm sure a whole bunch of people feel, and that's certainly, I'm sure prodded some  people to think, well, you know, I'm outside the system.  I guess I'll have to pick a side in order to run, or maybe Mark is starting a whole  third party.  I mean, maybe that's, that's what's going on.  I don't know.  You know, I don't know, but, um, actually that's plausible.

Start time: 1129.02
End time: 1131.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be something to think.  Is it like the tech technocrat party?

Start time: 1132.45
End time: 1171.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  I'll write that idea down.  Wouldn't you want to be in that Brianna?  Well, there I think we need technologists running.  I really do.  I would say this.  I think the axis is not, I think like it's becoming very dated to think of as Democrat  versus a Republican.  What I hear when I'm out there every single week is unmitigated fury at the system.  It doesn't matter if the person is right or left.  They're angry at the broken status quo.  So what I'm always looking to do is just find the parts that I agree with with people.  I don't even ask them what party they belong to.  Cause I think it's just about a system is not working for any of us.  So I hold you.

Start time: 1171.74
End time: 1216.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the system is totally, but it's totally entrenched.  So here's the problem.  The problem is that the system doesn't work.  And I know this because of all the work we do in DC.  It doesn't work without those two parties for a whole bunch of reasons.  The machine, you know,  the machine is set up that way and it would be very, very difficult to introduce,  I think, a third party at all.  Now, that being said, triple AS and Rush Holt, who was a former Senator or sorry,  representative, you know, and is now the CEO of the triple AS,  he's trying to encourage a whole bunch of people in the science and tech sector to run.  And, you know, I think that's all I have to say, though, I worry when I hear that

Start time: 1216.24
End time: 1223.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we should be more technologists in government, because I don't know if that's really the right  answer or we need more scientists.  Okay.  We need more smart people in government.  I'll grant you that.

Start time: 1223.56
End time: 1246.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  So here's the thing.  So I wrote an op-ed in the LA Times pretty recently about that statement and what it implies.  I am concerned because there are so many jobs in state that still haven't been filled  this far into the cycle.  But what I would say is that within the State Department, there was a mass exodus,  but there are still lots and lots of people there with PhDs who put  rational thought before politics.  In two weeks, I'm going to be at the National Academies with some heads of automation and some  car company people and government people hashing out the details of the future of  self-driving cars and regulation.  And quite frankly, that work is going to continue whether or not Trump is in office.  I think that he is significantly outside his debt.  Debt was an interesting slip.  That too doesn't matter as it turns out.  But I guess what I'm trying to say is the future comes whether or not we want it to.  And so there are meetings happening behind closed doors that don't get publicized because they  can't get publicized where people are talking about this and policy is getting made.  And there are stumbling blocks and problems along the way.  Ajit Patel, who's the head of the FCC, is making questionable decisions that trickle down.  But ultimately, we all have to soldier on.

If you know where to look, The Future Can Be Yours.  It's actually a fascinating book that reveals her secrets.  She's the CEO and founder of the Future Today Institute  and the wonderful Brianna Wu, game developer and candidate for Congress  in the Massachusetts 8th.  BriannaWu2018.com.  Our show today brought to you by my mattress.  Let's bring this down earth.  We talk all the time about health and one of the keys we're learning more and more  to good health is a good night's sleep.  This is not like a truism.  This is actually true.  It's not, I know every, your mom told you this, your grandma, but it's true.  And one of the things that makes a good night's sleep is sleeping cool, sleeping comfortable,  sleeping on a bed that doesn't bug you but supports your better sleep.  And that's Casper Casper.  Casper Casper is an obsessively engineered mattress, supportive memory foams that does  both things you want with a mattress.  It's, it sinks where your pointy bits go.  So you like you lie on it on your side, your hip actually is comfort comfortably supported.  But then underneath that is a firm support.  So your back feels great in the morning.  It's hard to describe.  You got to try it and it's breathable.  So it stays cool.  Your temperature is regulated through the night.  They really, they did many prototypes.  They worked hard to make the best mattress possible and they make it in the US and they  sell it to you direct, which means it's very affordable because there's no middleman.  There's no department store.  There's nothing in the way, except there's that one little problem.  You don't get to try it before you buy it.  Now I understand that's a problem and Casper knows it too.  And that's why they've solved it.  Because instead of, you know, lying on a mattress for five minutes in a showroom while the  salesperson kind of gives you the stink eye, you can't take off your shoes in here, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the difference is that the top six richest people in the world today, which are mostly  tech folks, have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 3.6 billion.  Wow.  So there's a difference when you look at the relationship to the ratios of who is wealthy  and who is not.  In Rockefeller's time, there was a thing called the middle class that we no longer have.

Transcript:  You know what else is rich?  Apple's rich.  $250 billion, quarter of a trillion in the bank.  Let's put that in perspective.  According to the Wall Street Journal, that's greater than the market value.  This is not the value of Apple.  This is just cash just sitting around in the cushions and the sofas.  That's greater than the value of Walmart or Procter and Gamble.  It exceeds the foreign currency reserves of the UK and Canada combined.  And what's really kind of hysterical is they really can't do anything with it because  most of it's stashed in Ireland and they can't repatriate it yet anyway.  The question is, why haven't they spent more of that money?

Transcript:  That's what I would do.  I almost wonder if their period of nearly going bankrupt in the 90s  permanently made them a little bit worried about the lean times.  It's like grandma and the depression.  Exactly.  Like look at the Nintendo Wii.  After the bottom fell out of Nintendo Wii sales and then the Wii you failed to catch on,  Nintendo was in the red for gosh, what was it?  I think it was like six years straight.  It was a long time.  You can look at the amount of cash that Apple has in the bank.  It's enough to cover their annual expenses for a little over seven years.  So they've got some cushion there, but I always think that near death experience  has them a little bit worried.  I also have to say, I think if you look at the way like financially,  money moves from country to country with these systems we put in place after World War II  that kind of led to globalization.  It is an interesting problem.  Like how do you bring that money back to America?  Do you just leave it in different countries?  It is a really complex problem to solve.

Transcript:  I did not realize this, but I read an article that said that  Bush had done a repatriation or a tax holiday in 2004.  And it didn't make a very big difference.  Mostly what companies did when they got their money back is buy back stock.  The 15 companies that repatriated the most after the 2004 tax break,  cut a net 20,000 jobs between that time and 2007,  decreased the pace of their spending and R&D.  It did not in fact do any of the things one would hope repatriation would do.  So that's just a little history lesson, not that anybody pays attention to history.  In fact, I had forgotten that this has been done 13 years ago.

Transcript:  I mean, what is Apple going to do?  Go into markets where it doesn't make much sense.  I look at their automatic driverless car system,  of which they had a picture of it this week.  I realize it's just a prototype, but it's utterly terrible.  I think it would be much worse for Apple if they started going into different markets.  It just didn't make any sense to their consumer base.  So I almost like them playing more conservatively here.  It's always interesting to me the difference in Amazon stock price where the margins are razor,  razor thin, and then the valuation of Apple stock where they have these giant cash reserves.  I almost would like to see them looking at, did they give stock dividends so it qualifies  under different rules for people to buy long term?

You've got to be looking over your shoulder all the times.  In fact, let's see.  Let's mention what Microsoft did this week.  Microsoft had their EDU event in New York City on...  Was it Tuesday morning?  Yeah.  And announced a new Surface laptop aimed clearly...  Well, announced a new version of Windows, Windows 10 S aimed at schools.  And they talked a lot about some of the features that they're going to put in the new Windows,  including administrative software in tune for education.  Their Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams, will be available for...  There'll be Teams for Education.  And I think that's actually pretty smart because I'm sure kids would very much prefer to be  talking with other kids over something more like Slack than whatever it is that's in schools.

Start time: 2305.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  I've got a six-year-old and in her school, they're having a major...  So her school is a STEM school and all the kids have to have...  Everybody has to be on iOS or...  That's the problem.  They're on iPad.  In middle school.  Here's the real problem.  The real problem is that chat software...  So the real problem is iChat and the kids are distracted.  They can't get them off of iChat.  Any kind of chat software is a problem.  And if you think about it, when I was in school, we hand wrote notes and passed them along.  Yeah, right.  That was a problem.  But what's the real issue here, and this is why I had a hard time getting excited about  the new Surface, is that the way that a six-year-old sees the world and the exposure  and experience they have to technology is fundamentally different from the 30 and 40  and 50-year-olds who are creating the new systems and who have this sort of top-down  approach for what's going to work best for the kids.  And they don't think through the future implications of what they're building.  And so you wind up with problems down the road where now we've got these...  It's constant kids who can't pay attention and they're constantly chatting with each other.  Nobody in the classroom wants Slack or a Slack competitor or Microsoft.  I agree.

They've just spent the entire evening playing Minecraft or World of Warcraft or  Overwatch with each other while on Skype.  And then now they come in the classroom and it's like they're going back to the  19th century.  You've got to kind of, don't you have to reach out to them a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I have a pretty radically different viewpoint on just kids and technology.  And even with the school that my kid goes to, I think the best possible preparation  for the future is a super hardcore, super rigorous liberal arts education.  Because the kids are going to pick up...  And if they want to be an engineer, that's awesome.  And if my kid wants to be an engineer, that's great.  But a lot of the critical reasoning skills are being sort of pushed out of the  curriculum in a lot of places.

So all of this, like a lot of the STEM programs are very, very intensive when it  comes to the sort of technology and, you know, basic engineering stuff and basic  math stuff, but there's no connection back to philosophy or humanities.  You know, it's sort of like a very, very intensive and sort of just one direction.  I don't understand.  It's not like Bill Bennett.

Transcript:  I do have to say, I feel like my background kind of has the opposite of this use case.  You know, I grew up in Mississippi.  I went to high school in Mississippi that was criminally underfunded in the 90s.  I work in technology today.  And the only reason that I'm able to work in this field is because of privilege and  having parents that bought me computers that were $3,000, $4,000 back then.  And I can very clearly see from some of the play testing my studio has done  about how technology is destroying kids' ability to focus.  We absolutely see that.  But at the same time, I think it's so unrealistic to have kids out there in the real world  engaging in systems that meet your needs and your thoughts every few seconds, and then  expecting them to go into a classroom where it's like chalk and staring into books and  taking notes that way.  The human mind just doesn't work that way.  And because our public schools are so criminally underfunded, I think there's got to be a  better middle ground here.

Transcript:  Actually, it's interesting because Apple is getting lapped now.  They were getting lapped by Microsoft Windows.  Apple put Apple IIs in every classroom practically in the country 20 years ago.  They're being lapped first by Windows and now by Chromebooks.  Apple, I think, has just at this point abandoned the education market.  What do you think, Brianna, of this Minecraft education edition?  I, to me, this is exciting.

Transcript:  I love it.  I absolutely love it, Leo.  Something I think about a lot when we talk about Minecraft, Super Mario Brothers is something  that we talk about like a classic of a classic and a literal exponential number more children  play Minecraft and interact with Minecraft today.  It has wonderful educational benefits for children with autism on the autism spectrum  because they can interact with people socially and not like look them face to face and it  lets them develop social skills over type.  I think this is absolutely wonderful and I'm very happy to see it.

Transcript:  It's not that.  And listen, we voluntarily, it's a private school that our daughter goes to and we chose  it so we have her there for a reason.  My concern is just sort of this global, in our country, this sort of everybody's throwing  money at makerspaces and at, which is fine.  All of these skills are fine.  But and this sort of teach every child to code.  The challenge is somebody needs to then bridge that to other critical thinking, you know,  flexing other parts of the muscle and other critical thinking areas and things like culture  and gender, you know, all of this other stuff sort of is not being addressed.  So Minecraft is fine and collaborative tools for kids are fine.  It's my concern is as I model this out, because I've spent, I'm a parent, so I've spent a  lot of time thinking about it.  But, you know, three decades into the future, we have a workforce full of people who have  good ability to think in a linear, structural way, you know, and whose skill, you know,  technical skills will have compounded over a certain amount of time.  But are they creative thinkers?  Are they?  How do they relate to their fellow humans?  You know?

Transcript:  This actually ties back to the conversation about Mark Zuckerberg.  I do think that much in the same way that in the first part of the 20th century,  Hollywood culturally influenced the world, you know, really had a huge cultural impact  on people's expectations, their understanding of how life was that Silicon Valley is now  doing the same here in the 21st century.  And I do think there's reason to examine and even be concerned about the values  that Silicon Valley, unconsciously probably, is spreading throughout the world.  I don't disagree with you.  Unconsciously?

Start time: 2776.76
End time: 2818.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not unconscious.  I mean, the values that Silicon Valley is spreading around the world are the same values  of Wall Street.  They're just under this complete nonsensical guise that they're trying to make the world  a better place.  I mean, this has been the thing that I've despised about Silicon Valley for a decade.  It's like every single thing that they do and everything they build has an impact and  they fail to look mostly at the negatives.  They just completely don't look at it.  And then you have CEOs like the CEO of Uber and a million other little companies or big  companies that do these incredibly unethical things.  I think it's not unconscious.  It's just that there's this complete nonsensical PR push that they push in front of it.

Start time: 2819.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's partially that, but then there's also a whole entire layer.  My concern is just take AI and voice.  The training corpus that's being used by every AI developer for voice recognition  comes from Philadelphia.  It was a series of 250 phone conversations that were recorded in the mid-1990s.  Yes, that's the base corpus for every single...  So forget the fact that if you have an accent, nobody has thought through the implications of  this.  And the challenge is that technology compounds.  So we have the obvious problems like CEO of Uber doing and saying ridiculous things,  but we have all of these fissures and all of these areas of bias being woven into so many  different facets of technology that we won't even start to realize until several years into  the future.  But the people who are working on them have either been told that there are problems in  the foundation and they're ignoring it or they've chosen not to look.

Transcript:  I think that there's a pattern.  Right?  So for example, I remember when they were building 3D printers, I was friends with Brie  Prez and that crew and I remember saying to them 10 years ago, what are you going to do  with these?  And they said, oh, we're going to build wall hooks and iPhone cases.  It's going to be amazing.  What was the first thing people did?  They built 3D printed plastic guns.  When you look at the news feed, it's like people are going to use it to share pictures of their  sunset or their dog or this, that and the other.  The first thing people do when they finally figure out how to use it for negatives is Russia  takes advantage of it to spread fake news.  Twitter was designed so that you could tell your friends you were at a club and to meet  you there.  What do we have?  We have the biggest center for trolls that the world has ever seen.

Transcript:  Look at Instagram.  Look at Instagram.  They designed it from the ground up.  There were a lot of women on the engineering team.  So when they came up with their fundamental user paradigms, like it makes harassment  fundamentally more different.  Technology tends to mirror the issues in the real world unless we kind of think above it.  And Nick, just to give you a little bit of pushback, I agree with you.  There is a myopic haze over a lot of people in Silicon Valley.  But I also think it's true that certain personality types are attracted to certain profession.  In journalism, I sure know a lot of jaded, very cynical people that really enjoy tearing  things apart.  And that's fine.  It makes them very good journalists in that same way.  I don't think you would be a really good technologist if you didn't see the future  and want to see the best in it and try to bring it forward.

Transcript:  I feel you.  I feel you.  But you are totally wrong.  And I feel like that.  So before I say what I'm about to say, let me verbally give you a cute kitten,  cute cat video, just verbally.  You are totally wrong.  So technologists don't see the future.  If technologists did see the future.  So it's one of two scenarios.  Either they do see the future and they are willfully putting money and personal fame  in front of the practical realities of humanity, doing bad stuff with their technology,  or they're not planning for it.  There is no other way around it.  Twitter had the ability multiple times over multiple years to deal with the troll problem  before it began.  But in order to do that, they would have had to adopt measures that would have been counter  to the network being as big and as productive as it is.  Same thing with Facebook.

Start time: 3064.98
End time: 3118.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still the case today.  Look at yesterday, what happened with the Macons in France, the documents that were  leaked by the Russians.  As my former colleague at the New York Times, Nicole Perloff, tweeted,  there was a certain tiny amount of fake accounts on Twitter that were sharing 80%  of the content around it.  Any algorithm that could exist on any platform would have shut that down in five seconds.  Twitter didn't do that because it's antithetical to what they want.  They want to show they have massive engagement.  They want to show that they're growing so that Wall Street continues to invest in them.  These are very simple solutions sometimes, even after the fact.  A lot of the times we don't see them implemented.  You should point out, Nick wrote the book Hatching Twitter is probably the foremost

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  expert on how Twitter got started.  I think you have some standing when you say that.  I wonder if Twitter hadn't been the free speech wing of the free speech party  if they would have succeeded in the way they've succeeded today.  Wasn't that part and parcel of what made Twitter?

Start time: 3137.16
End time: 3208.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were things that they could have done along the way that would have solved problems.  Wouldn't have solved all problems.  If you look at Facebook, they made a decision very early on.  There was a huge fight inside Facebook many years ago where there was a group of engineers  that said we should be more like Twitter.  People should be able to be anonymous so people can say whatever they want.  There should be no rules about what they talk about and so on.  Zuckerberg actually was the one who finally came in and said, no,  we have to know you're a real person and we have to have guidelines.  There's a set of guidelines on Facebook's trust and safety board.  Twitter decided not to implement any of these things.  The only things that you can't do are technically post someone's name and address and social security number.  They could have built the system in a way, but they could have changed the system in a way  that would have reduced the number of trolls, reduced the way people attack people en masse.  All these things they could have done and all it would have done would have made less people use  the service which would have made the company worth less money.  I think that's another analogy to the valley being just like Wall Street.

Start time: 3209.25

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I want to make this clear because I think that people outside the valley think of people  like Mark Zuckerberg and Ev Williams as futurists.  Yes.  And these are people who I would say are very much not thinking about the future.  And the reason that I wrote Signals, the new book, was in a large part for that group of people  because I would love for all of the technologists who are building things that impact the future to  start thinking like a futurist because what we would do is start modeling out different  scenarios in advance to try to anticipate the various realities of this technology entering  all of these different facets of human life and then just sort of reverse engineer back to their  present day what we should be thinking and doing about it.  And to me, that's a huge concern.  And I know you have to work on the product and I know you've got to ship a product and I get  all of that and the realities of shareholders and everything else.  But these people may be building the future, but these are not futurists.  These are not people who are thinking about the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Capitalism is optimized for one thing and one thing only.  It's not worrying about the ultimate consequences.  It's to optimize for profit.  And what I think has happened with Silicon Valley is that the technology, the tools  that they have to optimize for profit have been weaponized.  And so we really have nothing any different from Henry Ford or John D. Rockefeller or any  form of capitalism.  It's a predatory system, but we have tools that are so much more effective.  But anyway, we're going to take a break because I think it's time for some cute kittens.  And that's a hedgehog, that's a kitten, and you won't believe what happens next.  But you're not going to see it because I'm going to do an ad for Stamps.com and then we'll continue.  We have the greatest panel ever and I'm super smart and I'm thrilled to have you all.

And I will be getting Nick back in a couple of weeks to join us on Triangulation,  where we'll talk about that book in greater detail.  Amy Webb is a veteran of Triangulation.  Her book, The Signals Are Talking, tells you how you can be a futurist.  That's what she does for a living and it's great to have you  and somebody with more than an opinion, but opinion backed by data.  That's unusual here.  Mostly we just make stuff up.  All three of you, really very pleased to have all three of you.  And of course you at home and I'm glad you're here and I bet you're glad you're here too.

Transcript:  I think we're just in a, I think we're in a bit of a holding period.  You know, we're about to cross over into the next wave of  significantly transformative technology, which is all voice driven.  So I think that for the next couple of years, we're not going to see a ton of innovation in terms  of just the form factor and the machines, but all of our modeling, within the next five years,  50% of your interaction with the machine is going to be with your voice.  And then that will start to compound very, very quickly.  So, and all the patents we've seen for, and I'm an old Apple user, so my irritation with them  has to do with lack of innovation and what's coming next.

Evan Blass, EvLeaks on Twitter has leaked images.  This is from Amazon servers of the next Echo.  Seems to be going to come out in the next few weeks.  This has a big screen on it.  In fact, somebody said, forget this is the next business phone.  Forget your business, your entire business phone.  Throw it out the window.

It's like there's no, I don't know, that gives me a little pause.

It's not that the technology is bad because I agree 100% with Amy, it's going to be the  future and I love this stuff.  But speaking very generally, it kind of has the same problem that Google has where anyone  can come into it and, you know, kind of build with these APIs.  So we can't really trust the software they're saying they're selling alongside it.  We actually saw a good example of that.

So we're, you know, I've got an echo in the lab and we're constantly testing different  tools and things.  You know, the reality is that literally every aspect of your life is hackable.  Everything.

Transcript:  Here's my point.  I do think that everybody should have some form of a digital black belt and street smarts.  Wow.  And the challenge here is, you know, it's the year 2017.  The very fact that people opened up that Google attachment should tell us something.  Right.  So to me, the big story wasn't that Google had this breach.  To me, the big story was it's the year 2017 and the majority,  vast majority of people using technology still don't have a sophisticated enough understanding  of how they should be using that technology.  Right.  So, you know, everything is hackable and everything can listen.  And yeah, you know, I've got tape, whatever, over all my cameras, but.

Transcript:  My eye pencil.  Kevin Roos worked for Fusion.  That is such a story.  Yes.  And he, for the listeners out there that don't know the story, he did a show for Fusion on hackers.  And he went in New York and he said,  to this guy who is, you know, a professional security expert, I want you to hack me.  I want you to get everything you can for me.  And he left and didn't think anything of it and didn't think they had succeeded.  And he ended up in Vegas two days later.  And they were with cameras on in the room and he says, so what'd you get?  And they pulled everything up.  And what they had done is he'd walked out of the room.  They sent him.  They figured out that he had like a photo bucket account from like just doing a Google search.  They sent him a fake photo bucket thing to like to log in to check something or whatever.  He clicked it.  This is a guy who's a reporter who's been covering this stuff.  He clicked it, not thinking anything of it as you wouldn't, you know.  And next thing you know, they install a piece of software on his computer that is capturing  a screenshot of his screen every two seconds and taking a picture of him every two seconds  from his camera without the light going on.  And the look on his face was terrifying.

Transcript:  It's a probability play.  I have a theory on where I think we're headed with all of this.  So I used to live in Japan.  And in Japanese, there is no word for privacy.  They had to borrow it from English.  And the word is puraibashi.  And the reason for that has to do with the internet.  And it has to do with people making payments over the internet.  And this was like a novel strength.  Even that Japan is very, very tech forward.  This piece of it was really strange.  And it's interesting to me how quickly everybody's feelings about their privacy  eroded because of the sheer convenience of technology.  And so my feeling is at some point, it's so difficult for everybody to have this massive  coordinated effort to stay two steps ahead of hackers.  That at some point, we all just say, you know what?  The only way for me not to be compromised is to have zero privacy whatsoever.  And I wonder if at some point that's the direction that we start to head in.

Transcript:  I have to say.  I mean, during Gamergate, I was hyper targeted.  My company's mantras were targeted.  I was doxxed in extreme ways.  And it continues to this day.  Leo, this is an utterly rational fear.  John Podesta is a reasonably bright man.  He was tricked by a phishing scam.  If you've read Shattered, it's an excellent book on that.  We saw the same thing.  It appears to have happened in the French election.  So for me, it's not paranoia to worry about security.  It is reality, like born out by the press.  For me, I believe there's got to be a legislative component to solve this.  Because the truth is, if you asked your audience  and asked them how many were engineers and they were asked to compile or save tons of information  about people to then go sell it later, they would all have horror stories to tell you.  And I believe that we've got to say, OK, you know what?  If company A wants to collate all this data, fine.  If you get permission, then you have permission from the user to do that.  But if you don't keep it safe, if you don't hire  InfoSec people to salt and hash it, keep it in a secure way,  if you're not doing due diligence to keep it safe,  I do think we should pass laws that make you civilly liable.  I also believe that we've got to pass an omnibus privacy bill  because we can't compete with the corporate interests in selling our privacy out.  So I really believe if we work with Congress,  I think that Congress can really put a legislative solution forward  because the market's not going to solve it.

Transcript:  The other thing is, I think, so when you, you know, I'm a reporter,  I've written some stories that are, you know, that some people didn't like.  I've had threats and God knows what else.  And especially when I was at the New York Times.  One of the things I think is what I've learned covering all of these stories, too, is that,  you know, people with a lot of money and people that are very famous, they hire these groups,  these security firms to come out and they make sure they have two-factor authentication turned  on. All their passwords are hashed and that, you know, they look at their, they do all these  things for them. They monitor the dark web to make sure their social security numbers aren't  being sold. Most of the time they are actually, believe it or not, that their addresses aren't  online and things like that. So they do all these things. They monitor on social media and so on.  And, and I think that, you know, one of the things I do believe will happen is that will become  part of something we pay for. Everyone does it. The price will come down eventually.  In the same way I hire a locksmith to install a good lock on my front door,  that we will do that with our technologies and devices. I don't believe that,  that most people are just going to kind of throw their hands in the air and be like,

I was saying it more as a sort of collective,  no, I was defensive measure, but Nick, what you just said sort of creates a,  a new kind of digital divide, doesn't it? Right. Yeah. Those who can afford privacy and those who  can't. Well, not just afford, but like understand the implications of that and then have the ability

Start time: 4826.24
End time: 4857.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to do something about it. You know, and I, to be frank, I don't, and we got Brianna back so I can,  I say this now, but I don't have a lot of confidence that even laws will, will do much  to change this. I mean, people who are doing this already are violating laws. I agree the companies  that allow our databases to be leaked should be held responsible. In some cases they have been.  And I think Visa actually took target to the, the woodshed. So sometimes the punishment comes

Start time: 4916.46
End time: 4925.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  money it took to protect themselves. But the thing that's fascinating to me about it is that they,  they did that over and over and over again. And people who were in charge saw each one of those

Start time: 4925.50
End time: 4991.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  incidences as a novel one-off. Right. And you know, the other thing is I remember with the AT&T hack,  sorry, Amy. I remember with the AT&T, remember when there was the AT&T hack by, I forget the guy's  name, Weave in New Jersey. Yeah. Yeah. So, so when that happened, it wasn't really a hack. It was,  they figured out how to, I guess it was a hack, but they figured out how to get people's email  addresses and pass codes from, from hitting the AT&T server with the new iPad software, whatever.  So they ended up first, you know, the news broke and, and it made a big splash in the tech industry  when it turned out that there were people who worked for the white house or for the department  of justice and things like that, or governors or senators whose email addresses became public.  The DOJ came after it like a house on fire and they, and they ended up arresting people  and putting them in jail and so on and so forth. And so I'm sure that the Sony hack didn't  necessarily affect anyone that could have actually done something about it because if it had of,  then there would have been repercussions, but because it's just everyday people, they don't care.

We're going to take a break.  I'm sorry. Brianna Wu was just saying, I wish I weren't here and my camera's not working. And  she's also here. We love Brianna. Brianna Wu, Spacecat Gal. And we will have more in a moment.  Our show brought to you by FreshBooks. If you're in business for yourself, I know you got business  because you have something you love to do, a product you want to make, a service you want to  offer. The last thing you want to do is be a bookkeeper, unless that's your business. In this case,  this ad's not for you. But if you were a normal person and you don't want to do books, you got to  know about FreshBooks. For me, FreshBooks was an eye-opener 10 years ago when I used to have to  send invoices for expenses and time. And I would put it off and I wouldn't get paid. I learned  something that day. You don't send an invoice, they don't pay you. In fact, I was complaining  about it. Amber MacArthur, who was my cohost up in Canada, said, Leo, there's a new company just  started up in Toronto called FreshBooks. I'll tell you how long ago this was. It was a Web 2.0 company.  And you should use it. You can make your invoices easily. I did. It turned my life around.  And since then, FreshBooks has grown and grown. Now 10 million small business owners use FreshBooks,  not just for invoicing, but to keep track of profit, loss, expenses. You now know, and I think this is  pretty true, most small business owners, if you said, are you making a profit this year? Did you  make? They don't know till tax time if they made money. FreshBooks, the dashboard, will tell you at  any given moment how much money are you making, who owes you money, who do you need to invoice,  what invoices are unpaid, what are your expenses looking like? You can manage team time sheets. In  fact, you could do all your hours and tracking in the FreshBooks app on your phone or on the  FreshBooks site. You can make your invoices look sweet, random, send them recurring invoices,  auto payment reminders, automatic late fees. You can even make it so your client pays you  automatically. If your client wants to do that, that takes the burden of paperwork off both of  your shoulders, and that's awesome. In fact, FreshBooks customers get paid an average of 11 days  faster. That is amazing. You got to try it. Free 30 days. FreshBooks.com slash twit. If you'd write  this week in tech when they ask you how'd you hear about us, that would be a very nice thing for me.  You FreshBooks integrates with many of the apps you use already like Stripe and Shopify and Gusto  Acuity Scheduling. You can get those payments integrated in without any typing. This is really  the easiest way to keep your books. FreshBooks.com slash twit for 30 days free. It's a life-saving  service for freelancers and small businesses. It sure saved my behind. We are talking about  the world of tech with three of the most interesting people I know, Brianna Wu running  for Congress in Massachusetts' 8th District. You got your camera fixed? I did. I did. Good.

Transcript:  And yet it was many of us smarter than the average bear types. A lot of journalists who got bit by  this Google doc email that spread like wildfire. When was this? Was this Tuesday or Wednesday of  this week? A couple days ago. Yeah. You'd get an email from someone you knew. This is why it was,  and journalists particularly were vulnerable because journalists get a lot of shared documents,  right? You'd get an email from somebody you knew that said, this person has invited you to view  the following document. You got the button you're used to opening docs. And of course,  when it did that, it would launch Google's official OAuth login, including incidentally,  it would, two factor would, you know, it all worked right because it wasn't illegal. It was a Google  app. But if you paid attention, there were a couple, and I think most people aren't looking  for this, a couple of things. First of all, this HHHHH that it was shared with in addition to the  person you know. But then there was one even more important, which I don't know if I have here,  which is you would receive a permissions request. And in the permissions request, it would say,  Google docs wants permission to open, read, send your email at Gmail and to look at all your  contacts. And if you had thought about it, you might not have clicked the allow button at that  point, because it's exactly what happened is the app then got your contact list and emailed the  same email to everybody you know, embarrassing you. That's the rub, right? If you had stopped

Start time: 5565.32
End time: 5591.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and thought about it. And I, you know, this is what I keep coming back to. You know, I think  that we humans feel very much in control of the machines in our lives and we're not. The machines  are very much dictating our everyday actions. This is why, by the way, the United problem happened  on the United Airlines flight, because the, at every point along the way, an algorithm was making  a decision and people were reading what was on their screens, the staff, they're just following

Start time: 5591.78
End time: 5603.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the directions. And yeah, but that's life. That's, that's called a fiasco. That's always happened,  right? Every horrible thing that happens is a cascade of avoidable small actions that add up to

Start time: 5604.82
End time: 5627.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you. And I guess in this case, in this, you know, what I'm seeing more and more of is  that sort of lack of, of we're just doing what the machines are telling us to do. So the email said  to click and it never, you know, that the first thing I thought of was actually, because I got  one was this person wouldn't know how to send me a Google anything. So what the hell? You are lucky

Start time: 5628.00
End time: 5731.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you got it from that person. I respect where you're coming from. But I think that if you have  ever sat in on like a user testing session, I think good technologists, I think we, I think we  really put the user first. And I think all kinds of bad decisions get made in technology  when we start blaming the user. And I think that, you know, for the hyper educated about these  issues, I think it's really easy for us to lack empathy towards what normal users are feeling.  And I think we've got to put them in the forefront here. So to me, I look at this issue and, you know,  this was spread by email. I think it's almost time for us to update our email standards. And,  you know, like if Microsoft is sending me an email, I'm sorry, a program update, you know,  there are certificates inside of it to make sure that I'm running code from the right person.  I almost want something to be built into these systems that can verify that these requests are  coming from the real people behind it. Because, you know, it's just true. Like we can blame users  or call them dumb or belittle them. But like Facebook's chief security officer, he wrote a  wonderful blog post a few months ago, looking at how, you know, infosec people will look at edge  cases. And we love to talk about zero day exploits. The truth is the main thing that happens is people  get phished. And that's just a fact. That is most of these kinds of hacking vulnerabilities.  So I totally agree with you. I think we've got to have compassion for them and figure out how to  give them better indications of what they're being given.

Start time: 5731.80
End time: 5772.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I completely agree with you. And I'm certainly not calling anybody stupid or anything at all  like that. My point is, my concern is that we are, you know, and I'm, we all do this, right,  in the, in the desire that we have for automation to do more without directly,  you know, while directly doing less, as we outsource more and more of our daily tasks,  what we have started to do is to, you know, a lot of that automation happens without a direct  connection and we're, and we're not thinking about it. And so what I, what I want people to do is to  insert themselves back into the process a little bit more and to, you know, just,  just, you know, wait, thanks to a redditor.

Start time: 5772.96
End time: 5817.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to say one thing. Hold on. Leo. So one of my biggest frustrations is people that are  like, damn you auto correct, auto correct. If you pause before you hit send, you would see that  it wrote the thing incorrectly. We're in such a rush all the time these days because of technology  that even when we screw up, which is us screwing up because we haven't stopped to read it until  after we've sent it, we tend to blame the technology. And I think it's,  you know, it, it, it's a perfect example of the fact that everything is everyone else's fault  except for us humans. But really at the end of the day, it's almost always us humans fault.  If we stopped and pause and like you said, Amy, and thought, well, that person wouldn't send me  this or that's right. That's right. That's exactly right. But look at this is the, so, so you got

Start time: 5817.90
End time: 5864.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this. So this is from the redditor who first exposed us. This is the, the permissions. And by  the way, all of this is legitimate Google. You know, the authentication was real. It was OAuth  too. The second factor if you had it was real. This was the pop-up that Google gives you. Google  docs would like, and the only, by the way, the only spurious thing in all of this is that Google  docs isn't an application. Really, it doesn't need permission. It's a, you know, it's Google docs.  But if you saw Google docs would like you to, would like to read, send, delete and manage your  email and manage your contacts that, I mean, if you're sophisticated, you might've looked at that  and said, well, but it's Google. Why wouldn't, you know, I give that. So you'd hit the allow button.  And that's by the way, you done at that point. This is when it bites you.

Start time: 5865.24
End time: 5888.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would also say to Brianna's point, which was a good one, you know, a lot of times when you're,  when you're linking, when you're using Facebook's auth to log into something, you're also being  asked to give away the farm, right? You're sort of asking to click through to everything.  And the more that, so again, it's become automatic. So we're not, nobody reads the TOS,  right? Nobody, like none of us are doing any of that.

Start time: 5888.94
End time: 5896.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As we now know from Unroll Me, nobody was paying attention. Yeah. Well, but so.

Start time: 5897.12
End time: 5916.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have a question for Brianna. Can I ask?  Yes.  So how would you, is there a, how would you solve this? Right. So, so how do you solve a problem  where people are increasingly used to and want automation? You can't, I don't think you can solve  this through really great UX, right? So what do you, or UI, what do you, what do you do?  What do you think?

Start time: 5917.72
End time: 5986.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think we should look at email standards. I really do. I had a really long discussion with  people on my Twitter this week about, you know, SMTP servers, you know, and you can, you know,  theoretically get two factor authentication, you know, through TLS and other technologies.  But most organizations are not going to pay for that. It ends up being like single password.  I would like us to look very critically at email and see if there's some way we can bake  encryption into email, you know, like end to end user encryption, because typically it's  server side encrypted, but it's not encrypted on like your hard drive. So I think looking at  encryption with email, I think looking at ways to identify who email is coming from.  I think Google has a lot of responsibility here. Like somebody found out a way to cheat that and  make it sound like, you know, Google docs right there. Like that should be impossible if they're  using Google's OAuth system. So I think that, you know, we have a term in engineering,  multifactorial. There are multifactorial solutions here, but clearly it's not working as is.

Start time: 5989.55
End time: 5995.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's, it is a challenge because you don't want to blame users. They're not stupid, but at

Start time: 5995.94
End time: 6021.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the same time, everything's designed. I feel like, again, like, I feel like if you're going to insert  yourself and start, you know, I don't, I don't, you don't need to know exactly how server size,  you know, server side authentication works. But I think that we are setting ourselves up several  years from now for serious problems. If we don't, if you don't require us with the

Start time: 6022.62
End time: 6040.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  amount of digital street smarts. Yeah, exactly. I think that it's, okay,  what's a good analogy? A toilet, right? I don't, I don't know what happens,  how the sewage system works and what happens to the things that go down there. But I know not to  put a brick down the toilet and try to flush it. If you did, it would be your problem, your fault.

Start time: 6040.42
End time: 6054.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a better analogy. You don't, right. So Nick or whoever, like the panel, you don't understand  exactly how your, maybe you do your car works, like the inside pieces of your car, but you know  that you're going to get in a car and put a seatbelt on, right? That's, that's what I'm talking

Start time: 6054.96
End time: 6169.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about. What if though, what if the real flaw here is that you're driving the car in the first place?  What if the very, the very thing that Google docs does is inherently highly risky and really it,  there's no UI that would solve this problem because you are, what you're doing is inherently  dangerous as your documents are out there. You're giving permission. You know, Kerry Doctorow was  on on Monday on triangulation. He says, I don't store my email in the cloud. I use pop mail and  download it because I don't want, but I, all my mail is on Gmail, 11 years worth of email.  And if unroll me or slice or the NSA wanted to know everything about me, it would all be there.  It's not encrypted. It's available. And so what if the very things we're doing are the danger and  that there's no way to design yourself out of that. You are driving a car that has no body that,  you know, put on a seatbelt fine, but it's dangerous inherently. Isn't that the case?  Yes. Yeah, it definitely is. We're telling her we're worried. We're putting tape over  a camera. We are carrying a microphone, a camera, a GPS that's always on the internet in our pocket.  And we're worried about the Amazon Echo. We are part, we are actively participating  right now in many, many technologies that are eminently hackable and very dangerous.  And it's silly for us to say, well, I'm not going to use an Amazon Echo because that's an attack  vector. When there's 3000 other attack vectors, it's just the nature of modern technology. And  I'll tell you why we do it. I tell you why we do it because of the convenience and the value we get  out of it. And we're, whether knowingly or not, and I would say mostly knowingly, believe it or  not, you talk to teenagers, they kind of know what's going on. We are willing to give up this  privacy. We are willing to expose ourselves because of the value for the same reason that  people live in cities, which are inherently more dangerous than the country because of the value

Start time: 6169.28
End time: 6195.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of living in the city. That's right. And so if you spin this out, the earlier point that I was making  about sort of, I mean, it sounds like a fatalistic scenario, but if you spin this out far enough,  you know, do we no longer care? Is the, is the way that we deal with our privacy to completely  give up our privacy. It sounds like a black mirror episode, but if you model this out  and forces continue the way that they're, they're going, you know, is that the ultimate scenario?

If you want to go, Nick,  just take on off, but I, I'm going to, I'm going to read the article. Don't let Facebook  make you miserable. So we want to end on an up note. This is in the New York Times today,  but our first word from hover.com. If you've got a domain name, this is the funnest thing.  Everybody I know does this. You're at a party, you're at dinner and somebody says  fancypants.com and you get an idea, right? Register the domain. You got to lock it in.  Hey, are you pregnant? Are you having a baby? What's the first thing you do before you decide  on the name of the baby? Nowadays, you got to Google that name. You got to check. Can you get  the domain name? I own fancy pants. Don't get it. It's mine, buddy. Boy, I have it. I also have  my kids' names. Abby Laporte and Henry Laporte registered at hover.com. In fact,  I registered for 20 years because I figured if they don't want it by the time they're 20, screw  them. This is important. Domain name registration. And there's one place to go. Don't even think  about going any other place. Hover.com. They have 400 domain name extensions, including dot pizza,  dot ninja, dot horse. This is the best place to go to register your domain names. Of course,  dot com and dot net. And even kind of fun stuff like dot tech. Brianna, you could get dot Democrat.

They know you want domain privacy. That's built in. This is not one of those places where you buy  the domain name and then they go, oh, 50 pages of what would you like this? Would you like to buy  that? Would you want to buy this? It's simple. They're Canadians. It's nice. Best customer  support in the business. Their support team will help you. In fact, I moved all my domains because  I was on every other, I had every other, five or six different places. I got them all moved.  Their concierge service just moved them all to hover. It's easy to manage their DNS  management. So simple. They also, if you're on Google Plus or Tumblr or WordPress or LinkedIn,  they have a very easy way to move, you know, to put that domain name on your service.  I just registered Leo dot social for my micro blog and it was very easy. WordPress,  Leo Laporte dot plug has set it up very easily. Hover dot com slash twit. And by the way,  buy all the domain names because you'll get 10% off your first purchase. Hover dot com slash  twit. I have hundreds. No, it just says 59. That seems like hundreds. There's tunictime.com.  Anybody wants to sell tunics, I got the name for you. Twit dot expert, twit dot watch, twit dot  com. So this was a good article I thought. And we can wrap up with this. I know everybody wants to  go to dinner. Seth Stevens-Dvidovitz is an economist, but he I think catalyzed something  that's been in my head. Don't let Facebook make you miserable. Scholars have analyzed the data  and confirmed what we knew already that social media is making us miserable because everybody  puts their best stuff on social media. For instance, he says, as an example, Americans spend  about six times as much of their time cleaning dishes as they do golfing. But there are twice  as many tweets reporting golfing as dish doing. The Las Vegas budget hotel circus, circus,  and the Bellagio, same number of people checked in. Bellagio gets three times as many check ins on  Facebook because nobody wants to admit they're staying at circus, circus. Owners of BMWs and  Mercedes, two and a half times as likely to like their car company on Facebook as Honda owners.  And on and on and on. He quotes a good old saying from AA, don't compare your insides  to other people's outsides. And he points out that one of the problems with social media is  always putting their best foot forward. Everybody else's life looks great. Your life feels terrible.  So what's his fix? He says, use Google auto-complete. He says, anytime you feel bad,  just type in, I always. And then you'll see the auto-complete, have to pee, feel tired. Just type  in, I always feel tired, bloated, hungry, sick. This is what really is going on in the world  because Google auto-complete is based on Google searches. People are performing. So there.

Transcript:  We looked at this a while back at my game studio because we were asking,  we wanted to know what makes Twitter so wildly addictive. And we started looking into the  neuroscience behind it. And you get into this feedback loop where every time, like if I tweet  something and I start getting likes or retweets, it's a dopamine hit. It's the exact same reward  treadmill like in a game like Destiny, where you might get more and more powerful weapons.  So you keep being compelled to keep playing. So you get that next upgrade. But the inverse of this  is also true. And I think anyone that's a public figure that has said something and had it go a  little bit out of control on Twitter can attest to this, where when you get that negative feedback,  it has the exact opposite emotion on you. Yeah, I was at a campaign event this weekend. I'm on the  beach. I'm with my husband and it's gorgeous outside. And I'm getting a bunch of static on  Twitter. And it's really hard to not let that affect your mood. And the only solution I have  for that is like, just step away. Yeah, just step away. You can't win sometimes. And just,  your life is with your spouse or your children or your friends. And it's ultimately not real.  And I think we've got to all get better about putting those breaks in place.

Transcript:  I think the thing to bear in mind is that in the digital realm, we are far more, we present a far  more aspirational version of ourselves than we are in the real world. And we're far willing to  be more vitriolic and horrible. And so the digital realm is this area of outliers, right?  Personality outliers and behavioral outliers. But again, I think we forget about a lot of this.  And yeah, I mean, the easiest thing to do is also the hardest thing to do. And that's unplug.

But you look at, well, World of Warcraft is a really good example. I'm sure with, I actually  would love to know what you think about this, Brianna, and I'm sure you've dealt with this.  But they're getting feedback all the time, what keeps people playing longer. And this data is so  valuable because they can essentially design a more and more addictive game. And they consistently  get these signals. And every iPad game nowadays, these games that you buy donuts or coins or gems,  they are as every bit as addictive as the worst thing Vegas ever thought of, probably 10 times

Transcript:  worse. Well, of course it is because they've got that much more data on you. You know, I have a  friend of mine that works for a mobile game company. I'm not going to say which one, but I  was down at their studio and he started opening up all the information that they have about  certain people. And they have lists of users and what the probability is, and they will tweak  variables to get them to use that next cash purchase. So it's like a Vegas statistician's  dream to design something that keeps you going back. I do have to say that knowledge can be used  for good. We've seen this with Dota. And one of the really interesting things, Dota is a,  it's a genre called, you know, it's basically a team. Yeah, it's a MOBA. It's a bunch of people  fighting together. And what I love about this is they figured out if there's harassment on their  platform, it drives players away, which is bad for their bottom line. So they use that data to  figure out, well, what are the consequences we can introduce into the equation to make people  like think about their actions a little bit more? So it could be, you know, it could be used for

Transcript:  good and evil, I think. Somebody's saying though that Dota is a troll fest. So maybe they're not  doing as well as they, it's easy enough to think about it. It's hard to make it work. I mean,  if you're losing after 30 minutes. Why doesn't Twitter solve this? Everybody understands the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  problem. And it must disincentivize. There's a, there's a financial disincentive to solve the  problem. We too could solve that problem as users by just like not using it. Right. I mean, if you  think, if you sort of categorize all the digital things in your life that you rely on, you know,  and you, you had to sort of get rid of one by one in a priority order, you know, I use Facebook,  would I not be able to run my business without Facebook? Would I not be able to feed my family  without Facebook? You know, I could get rid of Facebook like that and have no problem.  And I could do the same thing with Twitter. And I was one of the original set of users of Twitter.  And I've enjoyed the service. I enjoyed the service more at the beginning than I do now.  I could get rid of both of those easily without even, without even, you know, blinking. Well,

And because I went to Columbia.  So I just remember at some point using it and not really caring about it, but then seeing a  whole bunch of people who were decades older than me getting onto the platform and using,  you know, just like, you know, so whatever platforms, they grow, they, they launch,  they grow, they change. And ultimately we wind up at this point every time we wind up at a point

Transcript:  where people are. Yeah, I do feel like, I mean, people aren't any worse than they've ever been.  They've always been the same. I mean, people are people, but what's happened is that technology has  in this very strange way provided this megaphone, this amplifier, the tools, the big data tools,  the analytics that we have now have given people literally not literate.

Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. And guess what? Facebook's next target TV.  They have plans to push two dozen shows. They've greenlit multiple shows for production.  They aim to premiere this mid June next month. Facebook TV. And if I were the networks,  I'd be a little bit worried. I would be concerned.  Yep. VR, dating. Now we've seen YouTube try this and fail. So it's always, and Facebook's failed  with a great many things, but it's always possible. And I tell you, Facebook might fail nine times  out of 10, but all it takes is one out of 10 with a billion, with 2 billion users to become dominant.

Transcript:  Leo, I'd be really interested to ask you because I mean, you're the journalist here. It seems to me,  a lot of my friends that are journalists that, you know, Vox or a major outlet,  they do find Facebook live to be worth their time. So I mean, do you, I mean, do you feel confident  about this? Cause I can see them expanding. I can see like twit being a good fit for this.

Start time: 7072.84
End time: 7105.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've never tried to capitalize on it. Because I think the content is short form. And for the  most part, nobody wants to watch a two hour show for the same reason. You know, Twitter, by the way,  is also launching a channel that will include stuff from Vox. Neil I. Patel is going to do a  gadget show. That concerns me a little bit more only because twit and Twitter sound a lot alike.  We predate Twitter, but as Ev Williams once told me, he said, well, I knew about twit,  but I didn't think either of us were going anywhere. So it was okay to just reuse the name.

Transcript:  Nike did this Breaking Two event this weekend and I love to run. So I was watching it and I found  myself up until 2 a.m. watching this live video on Twitter about these people trying to break a two  hour marathon. They failed by 24 seconds. It was amazing, but it was really addictive. So I can see  this being worthwhile for Facebook, but I also think that every single publisher has looked at  the outcome for working with Facebook as a publisher with instant articles and the money  just isn't there. So I would be very worried about getting in bed with Facebook for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've gone full circle. Weren't you talking about that at the beginning of the show, Amy Webb?  These publishers are pulling back now because Facebook's monetizing instant articles. Great.  None of that money's trickling down to the newspapers.

Start time: 7160.54
End time: 7214.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was sort of a thought. I can't sit still for very long, so I had to stand up.  We're almost done.  Again, I was thinking through the future of news and money and Facebook. So I was modelling out  these different scenarios given the data that I've got. It occurred to me, what if every publisher,  and this would only work if everybody did it, but what if everybody yanked their content off of  Facebook? If you look at the UI and the content that moves through it, a lot of that UI is dedicated  to news stories and a lot of the content is news stories. I think the only thing that would be left  would be the obviously fake news stories. At that point, without those other sources,  if you just have cat photos and your aspirational photos that you're posting to make other people  jealous and fake news, how interesting and compelling is the platform? I think the answer

Start time: 7214.80
End time: 7235.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is not super compelling. But wait, there's two ways news appears on Facebook. One is,  the publications themselves putting instant articles there. The other is us sharing links  to stories. That doesn't matter. The New York Times can't stop that. If they did, they did it  at their peril. Look what Financial Times and other paywalls have done to those journals.

Start time: 7235.86
End time: 7248.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I actually thought that through. I thought through when I was talking to a few friends who  are developers. I think there's a way to append the URL to prevent it from being shared,  which is not the same thing as a paywall. But you'd be crazy to do that.

Start time: 7255.30
End time: 7273.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but Facebook is also cannibalizing the revenues of a lot of it. To be fair, this is a whole other  show, but news organizations didn't think this through in advance. They didn't have a lot of  choice either. I think there was an alternate scenario. They could have. You mean at the

Start time: 7276.52
End time: 7368.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. This is my point. My point is that the year 2017 is very similar to the year  1987. 1987 was that part of the bridge where the academic internet became the commercial internet  and news organizations at that point. I was a journalist in the very, very early days of this.  Most of the news organizations were either ignoring it or they were demoting people over  to the website. Nobody was taking it seriously. Certainly nobody had thought through business  models or business plans or anything else like that or modeling out what this might look like.  We wind up where we are today where digital media, social media have completely eroded the  wallet share and the mind share of traditional media sources and they never changed their model.  The year 2017 is the beginning of the next bridge. That next bridge is from  us typing on machines to us talking to machines and voice is the thing that will  reshape the information landscape going forward. Once again, none of them are at the table.  Of the big seven companies that are working in an arms race for AI, journalists aren't there.  Sure, there's all kinds of news organizations on Echo, but they haven't thought through it.  They've put their stuff there because they feel like they need to put their stuff there.  Not a single publisher or television broadcaster or radio broadcaster  has developed a model for the future. They're just giving away their content.  We're going to wind up in an even worse situation years from now than we are right now because

For me,  I pay for the New York Times, I pay for Washington Post, and I pay for the Boston Globe because those  are three papers that are very relevant for what I do. I sometimes go to the New York Times,  but generally speaking, I look at articles that people share. I think that's just the formula

Transcript:  Isn't there a counter example in Europe where the European publishers hated Google putting  snippets of their content on Google search, so they said stop and they immediately regretted  it because they lost a huge amount of traffic by turning off Google?

Start time: 7418.88
End time: 7511.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't wait long enough. Here's the thing. This has to be a transition. Of course, you're  going to see an initial drop and that has to be explained to advertisers and that has to be  explained to everybody else in the organization that's thinking through ROI. Of course, there's  a temporary drop, but again, if all the news organizations yank their content off of Facebook,  and if the place that you have to get your news is on the website- Let's go one more.  Let's say that news organizations band together and buy Twitter. Twitter, whose share price is  going nowhere, but- Let's say that they band together and they buy Twitter and they turn  Twitter into a 21st century wire service. We all still use Twitter, but Twitter is a much better  experience because they're dealing with trolls and we're using it as a discovery tool.  I like it. I like it. It's not meant to turn a profit. It's not meant to turn a profit. It's  similar to the original intent of the AP. It's meant as a distribution arm. Then all of a sudden,  because news organizations don't have distribution- Then they wouldn't need Facebook.  That's right. That's right. I don't think it's fair.  There are solutions, but this is my whole point. My point is that not enough people- That's right.  Not enough people are thinking through far enough and they're not modeling this out far enough.  They're so consumed with right now. To be fair, everybody needs to be consumed with right now  because there are serious financial concerns, but tomorrow is far worse than today. Tomorrow is far

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  worse than today. You know what protected us is I just had an aversion to living on somebody else's  platform. I looked at what Zynga and companies that created Facebook games suffered when Facebook  pulled the plug on them. It was very clear that if you live on somebody else's platform, you die on  somebody else's platform, they control your destiny. I just was never willing to do that.  That's why we're not big on YouTube either. That's right. You are brilliant and you have

Vox  has a tech stack and a media stack that's very interesting, but if I think about true success,  you're it, right? It required you going off platform. I think you had enough sense to do that.  It was a wise choice, but nobody else was thinking that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I think I definitely see what you're saying, Leo, about like Zynga and those game  companies dying. That happened here in Boston. We saw that happen repeatedly and Facebook  wouldn't give them support and they just died. These were people that put a lot of time into  games. I think though, I don't think this is a distribution problem as much as I think it's a  human nature problem because I think I definitely think you've got the problem of authors getting  paid for their content and journalistic organizations getting paid for their content.  But I think the current problem is really human nature problem. The articles that I have to kind  of, even me, force myself to read like a long Wall Street Journal piece on like double default  swaps and securitization of different financial products. That's stuff I need to know.  It's boring. It's kind of terrible to go through. It's much more fun and easy for me to click on  a story about Guardians of the Galaxy, which anyone can write.  I think the human nature problem is I think that people are going to click on things that  they already agree with. I think that's always going to be cheaper and easier to  manufacture. It's why you've seen these fake news organizations just explode.

It's actually not. It was by Max Fisher. It was a listicle and it's what started all the journalists  making fun of listicles, but I will tell you it was incredibly well done. It was incredibly informative.

Transcript:  I think it initially did, but again, listen, I used to write for the Wall Street Journal.  I used to be on staff at the Journal at Newsweek. I'm intimately familiar and aware of the power of  great journalism and of good headlines and all the rest, but the challenge that we're facing is  people have limited attention and news organizations aren't competing against other news organizations.  They are competing against anything now that sucks away attention. That could be a game.  That could be my Fitbit. It could be any number of things. This is a question of being smarter.  Again, mapping out the future. If something isn't done, we're going to be in a far worse place  a decade from now than we are today. If you think we have a fake news problem today,  a decade from now we're going to be even worse off because we're going to have fewer news  organizations, not more of them. It has a lot to do with this burgeoning AI voice ecosystem  that everybody's ignoring.
