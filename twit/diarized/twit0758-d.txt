Transcript:  General Assignment Reporter, what do you cover?

Start time: 180.91
End time: 193.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm covering the startup market and venture capital trends kind of broadly.  I will admit that I bias a little bit towards the late stage market as opposed to the early stage.  But certainly there's a lot going on, so I'm quite busy and enjoying getting back in the groove, as it were.

Transcript:  You don't mind actually working for a living instead of just editing stuff?

Start time: 197.64
End time: 207.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, actually what's really funny is editing is probably more stress, but reporting is more work.  And I'd much rather have more work than stress, so I'm liking the switch back over.

Start time: 207.80
End time: 215.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes sense. Is that right, Daniel Rubino? Daniel's also here.  He's the executive editor at Windows Central. That means you have to work, or you have stress.

Start time: 216.40
End time: 225.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, although I'm not very good at editing.  I edit in the programming sense. You don't ever want me to grammar check you, because I will miserably fail at that.

Start time: 225.76
End time: 228.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in the old days they'd have a copy editor to do that.

Start time: 228.50
End time: 239.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have that now.  You do?  Oh yeah, we have a managing editor and we have a couple duty editors who thankfully handle all that.  And Grammarly has got a long way to making this.  Thank you, Grammarly! The copy editor of choice.

Start time: 260.00
End time: 285.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always. I'm effectively a reporter with a producer title.  I report to and through CNET, but we have wonderful colleagues, as we'll talk about later, who do gadgets, cell phones, that kind of thing.  At CBS News, which is a report there every day and I report through them, I report more on the core technologies.  So AI, cybersecurity, big data.

Start time: 291.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Strangely, I grew up in Iowa and we actually put my parents on there to give an authentic take from Iowa.  And we are, CBS News, we are OTT, CBSNews.com slash live.  If you want smart, hard news and not pundits yelling at each other, our analysts do a really good job.  I actually have been looking for that.

Start time: 312.80
End time: 326.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Both Lisa and I have kind of gotten sick of the 24 hour news channels because they don't do news so much as commentary all the time.  Often obsessively about one little thing for hours.

Start time: 327.22
End time: 367.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, as you have to do, you know very well that if you're 24 hours live, you have to cover things sometimes.  And with love and respect to our colleagues at other networks and other media companies, we do live news with smart analysts really well.  It's CBSNews.com slash live.  It's free.  I don't mean this to sound like a plug, but if you really want to see segments of like here is what's going on with coronavirus.  Here is what's going on with stuff that is under covered, under reported, but is still news.  We do this really well.  It is streaming all the time with real anchors, real news, real correspondence.

Start time: 368.28

Start time: 372.36
End time: 384.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's live TV.  CBSNews.com slash live.  So this is just it is like like it's just news.  It's just news.  I remember news.  Remember that?  Remember that?

Start time: 388.29
End time: 419.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's nonpartisan.  This is what I do 24 hours a day and my colleagues do exceptionally well, which is smart, hard news in a nonpartisan fashion.  You got a new listener or viewer.  Yeah.  So and my colleagues at CNET are wonderful as well.  The CNET YouTube channel is fantastic.  It is a place to go to not just be entertained, but edified.  I mean, CNET's YouTube channel is a ton of fun.  I just spend more of my time reporting on the technologies that influence the news.

Transcript:  Well, I remember, Dan, you kind of made your name embedding during the was it 2012 election or the 2008 election?  Yeah, I've covered.

Start time: 430.30
End time: 474.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, Leo, as everybody on this panel knows, the media industry has its ups and downs.  I've been very fortunate in 2008, 12 and 16 to cover tech on presidential campaigns.  So that's New Hampshire primary, South Carolina, Florida, Iowa and the conventions.  And I always try to focus on, again, nonpartisan.  But here's how tech is influencing the world around us.  Here is why tech is not just a vertical that is full of business stories, but is deeply intertwined with every news story that you interact with.  That is what's happening with technology.  I think as your show has evolved, that is definitely one of the dominant themes that I've seen with Twitter over the last 10 years.

Start time: 475.72
End time: 555.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but, you know, it's certainly fair.  I feel like tech reporting used to be about things.  And now it's more about people and society than it used to be, which I think a lot of our listeners say.  It's funny, I got an email yesterday from somebody saying, can you talk less about phones and all about Android?  And it's like, I'm sorry, what do you want to hear?  What do you want to talk about?  So we can never make anybody completely happy.  And then I hear people say less politics, more gadgets.  And then people say, but the problem is, I think that tech has now become, it's a different thing than it was 15 and 20 years ago when I started.  And we talk about different things.  Well, for instance, Mobile World Congress, which normally the conversation is what new phones are going to be announced next week, what's going to happen.  Now the conversation is how the coronavirus, COVID-19, has shut the conference down.  They decided not to go ahead and do it because too many people had already bailed, frankly.  At some point, it seemed like only reporters were going.  Oh, sorry. Yeah, the reporters with nobody to cover.  Were you going to go, Alex? Was that on your agenda?

Start time: 556.72
End time: 569.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not a huge phone guy, but I just kept seeing people cancel their presentations.  And at some point, really, it was only like eight reporters that follow on Twitter that were still planning on going.  And maybe they would have their own party.  But certainly it wouldn't have been the time to go.

Start time: 570.83
End time: 576.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now's the time to go to Barcelona for sure.  The pricing has dropped.  Daniel, were you going?

Start time: 577.00
End time: 668.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was.  It's funny because I've been taking off to the last couple of years from Mobile World Congress once Windows Phone kind of went away.  But then again, we went last year because Microsoft was there with HoloLens 2.  It was a big announcement. Yeah.  Right. And they were going to be there this year again.  And what's interesting about Mobile World Congress is the phone stuff has become almost less interesting as everybody does,  like Samsung does their own separate announcement, as we saw this week.  But now we're starting to see with connected PCs and how mobile technology is more than just phones now.  Right. So Mobile World Congress in that sense, it's been interesting to watch it transform.  It's IOT, it's 5G, it's phones, it's computers, it's handhelds.  And now, you know, as we'll talk about later, foldable phones and devices like this stuff is like really exciting.  So I was kind of disappointed.  Obviously, a lot of reporters were too about Mobile World Congress.  But as Alex was saying, soon as some of those companies start dropping out, Amazon and AT&T, it just started snowballing.  And then the conversation became, all right, who's who's canceling next?  Should we start going? And once that starts, you know, I feel bad for GSMA.  They really didn't have much recourse here.  And, you know, they tried putting on the show.  But, you know, once you have all these big companies drop out and that that air going around that about, you know, should this continue?  It's hard to recover from.  It's things for I don't feel bad for AT&T, Amazon, Microsoft, forget those companies.  They have tons of money.  They're going to be able to fly their people around and do their announcements.  It's about the small startups.  This is really their event where they get to kind of get a make or break moment.  And they don't have that now.  And that's real unfortunate.

Start time: 669.95
End time: 705.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what the future of conferences holds.  I mean, a conference, if you think about it, is worse than a cruise ship.  In so many ways, you get more people.  It was more than 100,000 people expected at Mobile World Congress.  They're all in a few meeting rooms.  They're all shaking hands.  They're all talking face to face.  That's what a conference is, is that person to person connection.  And it's a breeding ground for viruses.  We're very lucky CES was not hit by coronavirus.  That could have been a nightmare scenario.

Start time: 706.30
End time: 732.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And people will take it back with them, right?  Wherever they go to afterwards.  I mean, you're literally creating an infection point.  It's quite scary.  I think we're starting to see the economic impacts of coronavirus.  I mean, I was going through the rundown.  I know we're going to talk about iPhone production at some point.  But like this is the sort of thing that begins to snowball into real economic impact.  It's canceled flights.  It's canceled hotels.  It's canceled spend, canceled ad spend.  I mean, this is a lot of money.  100,000 people is no joke.  And it's one example.  There's a half billion dollars for Barcelona.

Start time: 733.39
End time: 734.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's there.  Half billion.

Start time: 735.52
End time: 789.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Foxconn is plants are just not effective.  Instead of making the new iPhones, which they were rumored to be working on new iPhones,  they've been making face masks, surgical masks.  We're not doctors.  We're not experts on this thing.  So I wouldn't dream of asking you if this is a reasonable precaution or not.  I'm getting the sense more and more from the people I talked to who are following this,  who are physicians, that it is that China has kind of buried how bad it's gotten and the  potential risks of coronavirus.  And so apparently I just talked to somebody earlier today who said China shut down.  There is nothing going on.  No one's going to the movies.  No one's going.  The streets are empty.  People are staying home.  Speaking of the New York Times.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 790.06
End time: 806.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've done tremendous coverage as well as the Daily Podcast has really done a great job  of taking you inside what's happening and not just reporting, but kind of giving you a  human feel of what these cities of 11 million people feel like when they're shut down.  Yeah.  You know, we've been preparing for this.

Start time: 808.43
End time: 831.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We thought it was the zombie apocalypse, but we've been preparing for this for a few years.  I hope we are well prepared for at some point there will be a 1918 style pandemic.  And because in the modern world compared to 1918, people travel everywhere freely, constantly.  It's a very scary, scary thought.  True.

Start time: 832.12
End time: 860.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if at the same time things have gotten better in the medical world.  So maybe it'll be kind of a balancing act.  It won't get much worse.  I'm trying to be an optimist about this because China, as we said, is locked down, like 760  million people, according to the New York Times.  And the rest of the world's working very hard in conjunction with one another to figure  out a vaccine and so forth.  So I'm trying to be an optimist.  I don't want to get all pessimistic about this, but the 1918 example certainly is pretty  darn terrifying if that hit today, because as Leo said, the spread would be much more  rapid.

Start time: 861.00
End time: 877.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason 1918 was so bad is it was the end of World War I.  You had a lot of troops coming home.  So they did in effect spread it throughout and millions died.  And I don't know what this is going to look like, but you're right.  But we're simultaneously better prepared and less prepared.  We're more at higher risk and better prepared.  Go ahead.

Start time: 879.42
End time: 905.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it really tests this idea that we've had in technology in large part because the economy  for the last 10 years has been pretty good.  But this idea of just-in-time delivery that not only are the supply chains, but the distribution  networks are all stacked in a way that you can order and acquire almost anything.  And this is because of these interrelated economies.

Start time: 905.40
End time: 960.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And nobody keeps anything in stock.  Everything is done just in time.  Including antibiotics.  Right.  Any hiccup along the supply chain affects the whole supply chain.  Everything comes to a halt.  Our next big conference is coming up in San Francisco in two weeks.  It's RSA, the big security conference.  Already IBM has withdrawn.  They withdrew yesterday on Friday saying the health of IBMers is our primary concern.  I don't know if that's overreacting.  I mean, we do have I think there's one or two Bay Area, I think there's one Bay Area case of coronavirus.  But any conference that brings people in from all over the world, especially from China,  is I guess to be something to be worried about.  The problem is IBM is a platinum sponsor.  So withdrawing, and the RSA says, well, that's only 0.79% of the total number of attendees.  Okay.  But this is how it begins, isn't it?  Yeah.

Start time: 962.95
End time: 988.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just in San Francisco last week.  And I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of face masks and fear.  But I was happy slash worried to see that no one was wearing face masks more than I'd seen historically in the city.  I only just moved out.  So like I'm still relatively up to date.  But in the airports, Newark and Providence and SFO and even flights and even on the ground, just nothing.  So it's not an American thing.

Start time: 989.22
End time: 992.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're just not into the face mask thing.  It's kind of weird.  Should we be?

Start time: 993.02
End time: 997.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I know again, you guys are not epidemiologists.  The guys at Costco are all wearing face masks.  Costco.

Start time: 998.00
End time: 1003.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Costco.  I was there this week in the East Bay and there were several Costco employees wearing face masks.

Start time: 1004.06
End time: 1010.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just anecdotally, it's been hard to get on the New York City subway without seeing a handful of face masks.  Yeah.

Start time: 1011.46
End time: 1015.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess if I were going out in public, I might wear a face mask.  Why not?  Let's be prudent.

Start time: 1016.31
End time: 1033.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's debate about it, too.  I think it's better for people who may be infected to not spread versus those who are worried about catching it because I don't know.  There's some debate because when you put your mask on, moisture builds up and it's actually better breeding ground.  There's some debate about the efficacy of this.  You need to rotate your masks.

Start time: 1034.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have five or six in every few minutes.

Start time: 1037.22
End time: 1044.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think the people that I've seen wearing masks were actually people who were sick rather than people who were afraid to get it on people's face.  I'm no expert.

Start time: 1045.36
End time: 1061.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not an epidemiologist.  Initially, they said the coronavirus is too heavy to be worried about airborne distribution.  Watch surfaces.  Wash your hands.  The latest thing I read from WHO is it is airborne.  A mask could be helpful.  You should still wash your hands and stay home.

Start time: 1063.86
End time: 1094.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alex, to your point of optimism, I wonder if you will see, at least around the venture and startup communities, a shift, a reorganizational shift in how people work.  This pushes more remote work and if it optimizes the efficiencies of remote work and as a result, maybe startups that do just that, not just create remote software, but optimize and really push what you can do remotely with teams.  I don't know.  Maybe a little too optimistic.

Start time: 1095.59
End time: 1103.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's ironic.  I don't think so.  They reversed their policy of remote work and have made all their 350,000 employees go back to hubs and get rid of this.

Start time: 1106.22
End time: 1111.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We make people come to work here because we found that people who work at home don't do anything.

Start time: 1112.32
End time: 1161.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is the classic view.  But I want to go back to Dan's point about startups and remote work and all of that.  It is increasingly common for startups to have offices outside the Bay Area, even if their headquarters there.  That's been a trend that's been going on for some time.  But I really think the remote work trend exploded when software got a lot better.  Between Slack and Zoom, you really do have a really high level of fidelity for remote work to kind of keep people in sync.  But I'm curious if we'll see another layer of innovation for remote conferences, for example.  There was a thought on Twitter about that today because so many conferences are being canceled.  Maybe we need to kind of let go of the idea that we all need to go to Barcelona for MWC, even though the food's good and everyone seems to have a great time.  Maybe that's just not the way to approach product releases and so forth down the road.  Video chat's good.  I mean, we're all four here chatting in real time.  Yeah, we don't have to breathe on each other.  I want to smell Leo for once.

Start time: 1162.34
End time: 1182.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only downside to that is I think is that a lot of this in terms of reporting, even deals being made, does happen outside of the main events and chatting with people off the record and all this.  And that you'll lose when you have official stream conference type events.  That face to face is kind of important, isn't it?

Start time: 1184.00
End time: 1204.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, very important.  And you mentioned the classic case of a small startup that is hoping that Mobile World Congress will be the place they can make their debut to the public.  There's a lot of press.  Maybe they're going to get some traction.  And that's an opportunity lost.  And I don't know how they can duplicate that over the internet.  You just you're swamped over the internet.

Start time: 1205.32
End time: 1245.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm making the point you just brought up about things being having the background and so forth.  My favorite CES story that I have is I was talking to Microsoft before CES.  This was probably 2015 or something.  So back in the day and I asked if Satya was going and they're like, no, like, OK, cool.  That's why I won't try to get any of his time if he's not going to be there.  And then I was there and there goes Satya blasting by me with a whole entourage of people.  And I'm like, what the hell?  Like, oh, he's not officially here.  He's just talking to some people.  And I'm like, that's the same thing.  And people really do show up and do that kind of back channel stuff.  So I don't have a way to replicate that.  But certainly it would be cool.  There's a backup option maybe for conferences if they do have to cancel for whatever reason.  They do have something other than just nothing.  How about virtual reality?

Start time: 1246.51
End time: 1256.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember, remember that Facebook had that really horrible virtual reality world that you would go into and nobody had any butts or legs or whatever.  And they still have it.  They still have.

Start time: 1257.68
End time: 1285.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just with a startup in Zurich who is doing exactly that.  They have offices in Hong Kong, in South America, in North America.  And it is maybe a little ludicrous with how technology is now.  But I think five, seven years from now, this could be far more common.  And they were their entire workday.  I know everyone looks nerdy with VR headset on, but everyone was sitting around a table with a VR headset on working remotely with colleagues all over the world.  It was fascinating.

Start time: 1285.66
End time: 1293.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there are quite a few companies working on that technology.  So I don't think it just gets into that whole thing about VR and catching on to the mainstream.  Could HoloLens be used that way?

Start time: 1294.06
End time: 1295.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the kind of thing that Microsoft is doing.

Start time: 1296.12
End time: 1315.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do have the HoloPortation they call it when they're working with Skype and stuff like that.  So that's a more mixed reality type situation, which could be interesting for demos.  Yeah, there's opportunity there, right?  So if any group should be able to solve this problem, there should be tech conferences, especially mobile ones.  So, you know, there's hope there.

Start time: 1315.16
End time: 1339.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to wonder, you know, it's hard to predict which way this is going to go.  If it ends up being a global pandemic and millions die, which is a possibility, I think maybe something will happen.  But otherwise, I think people just forget about it as we forgot about SARS and MERS and just, you know, next year everybody just go to conferences again.  Or what do you think? You think this is a long term, the beginning of the end for conferences?

Start time: 1340.62
End time: 1354.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it depends on what Alex was talking about with the economy.  I mean, so we're hearing a lot of implications for China.  We saw a lot of companies, especially tech, reporting their earnings in the last two weeks and they're now accounting for the coronavirus for next quarter.

Start time: 1354.28
End time: 1357.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is going to be an issue in production.

Start time: 1357.34
End time: 1387.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And so, you know, once that starts to happen and slows down like that could really have dramatic impacts.  There's also the other story that we'll probably cover with China, you know, which is a surveillance state.  And but this is a case where they're starting to use their surveillance technology to help in this situation.  This is the dangerous thing about privacy and security is when you find that one instance of like, oh, this is actually good use of this intrusive security state because it helps, you know, protect people.  It's an app, right? That report. Isn't that when people get scared?

Start time: 1387.94
End time: 1457.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is this is that's why 9-11 really hurt our country because the effect of it was we got scared.  And so once you get scared, then you support security over freedom, over liberty.  And well, you mentioned this. China has a close contact detector app that they encourage you to download on your phone.  You do a you scan a quick response code on your smartphone and then the app.  Once it's registered with a phone number, you enter your name and your national ID number.  And then they can tell you if you had close contact with anybody who has coronavirus because they know where everybody else has been.  They know where you have been.  Close contact means you were in the same train car with somebody who has coronavirus.  Or you if you were on a plane, you were within a few rows, three rows of an infected person.  Or I mean, they they really know everywhere you've been.  And I don't think they see revealing this as a disadvantage.  This might be seen as a good thing. Yeah.

Start time: 1464.61
End time: 1467.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if we get scared enough, we might take it.  Yeah. Well, I mean, we.

Start time: 1468.00
End time: 1478.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  America will.  I mean, I think there's there's always going to be a contingent of the US government that wants more control and stuff like this.  That's the problem is it starts.  Oh, we're going to protect you from coronavirus.

Start time: 1480.91
End time: 1485.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the end game is and we're going to keep an eye on everywhere you go every time you go anywhere and there will be no more dissidents.  Yay. Protests are over.

Start time: 1487.08
End time: 1512.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then you wonder what happens when this collides with the anti-vaxxers in the United States if even a vaccine comes out for this.  Right.  So it's like there's and then you have fake news and all that's like there's a lot of potential here for some just really nasty stuff coming out.  And I, you know, I want to be an optimist like Alex, but, you know, it can go both ways, I think.  My optimism is waning.  The more we talk, the more we see.

Start time: 1513.22
End time: 1514.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1515.78
End time: 1531.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  America's response to the 1918 flu epidemic in part was to force people to vaccinate against the flu.  Oh, yeah.  So when the anti-vaxxers start being forced by the government to take vaccines, Twitter will be real fun.

Start time: 1532.10
End time: 1571.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we'll see these trends of disinformation floating across sock puppet accounts and bot accounts floating across Twitter, Facebook and other social networks.  And this is a real issue because these forms, I mean, sock puppets and bots can push trending topics high enough that they reinforce pre-existing or least seeded ideas with a mass population.  And then when that is constantly reinforced and we see potential conspiracies like what we're talking about here with intermingled with real outbreaks or real things of high stakes importance, then the potential for disaster is exceptionally high.

Start time: 1572.70
End time: 1603.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember, though, when the United States got together and eradicated polio that, you know, it used to be people were afraid to go to the movies because it was so easy to get polio.  There are still people today in iron lungs because they got polio in the 50s and they can't breathe on their own.  And people were really scared.  People were very, very scared.  And when the sock vaccine came along, there was a universal movement, not just in the US, but all over the world to get people vaccinated.  And polio was eradicated.

Start time: 1604.38
End time: 1620.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know why, though?  Because back then you could trust certain institutions.  You could trust institutions.  Yeah.  And now you can't.  Right.  So this is kind of like the big threat is that even if this stuff comes out, you know, people are going to choose not to believe it.  And that's I think what's going to get challenging.  Yeah.

Start time: 1621.02
End time: 1648.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So actually, I take it all back.  I'm now in favor of VR conferences.  Let's just move to that immediately.  And can I go back to the VR thing just for a minute?  I wanted to bring something up.  I changed my view on VR in a way that I think I talked about on Twitter before.  And I'm now a VR optimist.  Now, sorry to go back to the positivity thing, but like I was at a friend's house.  He's a huge nerd and they did an awesome VR setup and I forgot to play with it.  And it was mindbendingly better than I thought.  So small note there, but I thought that was just awesome.  And you didn't have the urge to get VR.

Start time: 1649.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The HoloLens style.  Yeah.  Yeah, that and like, you know, I'm a really big fan of North, a Canadian startup.  They do glasses that look like normal glasses, the tiny projector.  You know, they're almost, I think, way ahead of where they should be on this time.  Can I think?  But that, I think, will be the breakthrough technology.

Start time: 1682.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, well, North is already selling version one.  Actually, they stopped selling version one because version two is about to be announced.  And it's I mean, this is a doable wearable technology today.  It connects up to your Android phone or iOS.  You wear a ring to control it as a little navigator.  They call these Focals.  Yeah, Focals. Yeah.  And it's actually pretty.  Now, what's cool, too, is it doesn't have a camera.  Check out. Have you used them?

Start time: 1740.97
End time: 1744.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the version one.  Version two is supposed to be slimmer and lighter, more comfortable.

Start time: 1745.08
End time: 1780.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a heads up display on the glass of your glasses from the inside.  So it's a little projector.  So unlike the Google Glass, you're not looking at a screen up above your eyebrow.  Unlike HoloLens, you're not looking through a mail slot at the world with stuff projected on it.  It looks like it's able to put that just right up on the glass.  I always thought this... I agree with you.  I always thought, and I call it AR, but I guess mixed reality is probably more appropriate.  I always thought this was a much more compelling argument than Beat Saber in a VR helmet.

Start time: 1781.10
End time: 1797.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, fine. I'll just crap on my awesome VR helmet.  I will say.  VR will wear those focal things because I'm an enormous dork and they don't look that uncool.  And I would love to have a HUD in my digital.  You can put the stock market in your glasses.  Come on. That's amazing.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  Yes. I want this.

Start time: 1823.51
End time: 1830.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  That's all data, man.  That's a huge, huge repository.  And it's one of the only few social networks you can go on and actually have serious discussions.  It's the only decent social network.

Start time: 1842.36
End time: 1850.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 1851.36
End time: 1873.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now we have this tension between what's possible with big data and the combination data and government and people very nervous about what's possible and wanting to regulate it, wanting to cut back on it.  And I fear that what you just talked about, yeah, they got all this face recognition data.  Will they ever be allowed to use it?

Start time: 1874.08
End time: 1923.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's where Google came out a couple of weeks ago saying, hey, we finally support regulation of AI.  Well, they have no choice, right?  Yeah, and Microsoft's been ahead of that game for two years now.  Brad Smith has come out and he wrote a book about the whole topic.  And so that's a smart way.  Like Microsoft, at least, was smart enough to go like this is a lot of opportunity here.  But if we do it wrong, this is going to really screw up everything.  And so, you know, I think these companies being ahead of the game and going, let's call for regulation.  But you really got Facebook on board with this, right?  They're just still the ones that are sticklers on all this privacy stuff.  Whereas, you know, I would say Microsoft, even Google now is coming along.  Apple, of course, as I would say there, too, they're pretty good with security and privacy.  But you got to get like companies like Facebook, who are just still that outlier, who are just kind of driving a thorn in everybody's mind.

Start time: 1924.12
End time: 1941.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't really do this stuff unless you're willing to combine databases from a variety of sources.  All the things privacy advocates are most afraid of.  Or at least have an outside.  Is there a way to do it safely?  Could Apple do it?  See, I think that's why Apple's AI and Siri are so far behind is they're not willing to do that.

Start time: 1942.24
End time: 1960.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  What Microsoft's proposing is an outside agency, government agency that basically certifies what you're claiming on the security aspect of your AI or facial recognition and how it works.  This would have really been useful, you know, for this week for the Democratic caucus.

Start time: 1961.34
End time: 1965.92

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, let's put more technology in Iowa.  Right. Yeah.

Start time: 1966.46
End time: 1980.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I really love a lot of people at Microsoft.  And I think that they many of these people are very sincere when they talk about having third party or ombudsman type authorities.  Facebook has made similar noises as as Google, Apple and the other major face players.  Now has this problem board, right?

Start time: 1981.02
End time: 1981.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Start time: 1982.22
End time: 2017.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is that many of these things appear very nice prima facia superficially.  But when you dig below the surface, they seem fairly cynical or designed to get ahead of regulation or bend regulation in ways that don't threaten the business models.  But do allow them to say we are doing X, Y and Z for the public interest.  That is not a statement intended to denigrate the people at Salesforce, Microsoft and other places calling for these third party boards.  I just want to see them as the 3D chess that they are and that the motivations might not be as altruistic as they'd like us to believe.  True.

Start time: 2018.00
End time: 2038.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's definitely true.  Yeah, because otherwise they don't want to have government hearings and Congress and laws being passed where they're not they don't control the message.  At least this way with Microsoft and Google now they're getting ahead.  They can kind of control the message a bit.  And you're right.  They can control the regulation, which would favor them.  So it's important.  Let's take a little break.

Start time: 2038.00

And then other sources of mine at the DNC, well, formerly the DNC, now third party organization, started to leak a bunch about acronym, the company that funded them.  And they said pretty vitriolic things.  These are these are people who are tech insiders that the the formerly Democrat partisans and the app itself.

Transcript:  We are brought to you this week by Fresh Books.  I have to say I have a real soft spot in my heart for Fresh Books.  I started using it way back when I used to come up to Canada and do the call for help up there in Canada.  And I'd have to invoice them in Canadian dollars and I have to send them expenses.  Oh, Canada.  And it was just a pain.  But Amber MacArthur told me there's a startup in Toronto.  You're going to love it.  It's called Fresh Books.  It helped me do my invoices, beautiful invoices.  It started as invoicing software, but I have to say really it's accounting software without you doing any accounting.  That's the beauty part of it.  Use Fresh Books to create beautiful professional invoices.  You can as soon as you start using Fresh Books, your clients could start paying you online.  They can actually pay you from within the invoice.  That's amazing.  Based on that, by the way, you'll get paid like twice as fast.  That was my experience.  And then because you've got Fresh Books and the invoices, that's accounts receivable.  You also have the accounts paid.  You also have your expenses because I was using the Fresh Books app to take pictures of the receipts, put them right up into the invoice, keep track of it.  It'll even dial into your bank and download expenses.  So essentially, if this is the genuinely easy to use invoice expensing and managing your books program,  if you're a small business owner or a freelancer as I was, you're going to love Fresh Books.  24 million people have used it now.  Four and a half out of five stars on GetApp.  Small business owners love Fresh Books.  I loved Fresh Books.  It lets you focus on the reason you got into business, not on invoicing, not on accounting.  And man, when tax time comes, you will love it.  You can get all the reports you need.  It automatically combines expenses, billable time.  Yes, you could do hours on that.  You could put a timer in there.  You could have different prices for different projects, even if it's the same client.  You've got client profiles.  You've got automation for recurring invoices.  No matter what you do, Fresh Books can transform the way you run your business.  For me, this was always the hard part, was the bookkeeping, the accounting, the reporting, the tax time stuff.  It was the stuff I wasn't any good at.  Fresh Books really saved me.  You can also stop chasing after the money your clients owe you.  It starts with being able to take online payments, whether it's credit cards and ACH transfers.  That's in the US only.  Get you paid twice as fast.  You'll also get notifications the minute your client opens an invoice.  So no more saying, oh, I didn't get the invoice.  They'll automatically send late payment reminders.  They'll bill late fees.  They just make it easy.  Fresh Books, it's easy with great Toronto-based support.  They are the nicest people ever.  I just love the Fresh Books team, and you will too.  Make it easier to run your small business with Fresh Books.  Save time.  Plan for the future.  Even just knowing day to day whether you're making money or not.  I mean, that's just awesome.

Don't forget to put this week in tech in the how did you hear about a section.  Thank you, Fresh Books.  Moving right along, we were talking about coronavirus.  Apple is reopening its stores, but it's kind of a soft reopening.  Temperature checks as people come in the door.  Limited hours.  Crowd control.  And they're only half the hours they're normally open.  It just doesn't sound like a very welcoming prospect.  No.

Start time: 2464.12
End time: 2472.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Apple stores have one of the highest sales per square foot of stores in the world.  And so if they're limiting hours, limiting people, I mean, this is real material revenue that's been lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Costs them a lot of money.  Do you have any word about whether this will slow down?  They were, we expected, going to announce next month probably new iPhones and iPads.  I don't see how they can do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  I mean, I don't know.  That's more of a Rubino question, I feel.  But my answer is I hope so because my iPhone 7 is finally dying and I have to actually get a replacement eventually.  So I feel like I need to get excited about something.  But Daniel, what do you got?

Start time: 2501.51
End time: 2526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't really heard too much about new iPhones.  I wouldn't be surprised if they do some iPad refreshes.  The iPhone, I expect maybe in the fall.  And then there's going to be that question of are they going to finally do 5G?  And there's been talks of a significant revision.  I'm going to say as someone who's actually been iffy on Apple for the last few years, the iPhone 11 has actually been a super impressive device.  Is that what you used?  I did up until this week, which we can talk about this.  Oh, what are you using now?

So Samsung had its big unpacked event on Tuesday.  They announced four new phones, three new S20s.  That's the designation for the Samsung Galaxy S phones for this year.  The S20, S20 Plus, S20 Ultra, like 120 megahertz refresh or hertz, not megahertz, 120 hertz refresh, 18 cameras or something, a giant camera bump.  I mean, it's just crazy.  But all of this looked like kind of, well, that's what I'd expect the next generation Galaxy S.  Then they announced the Z Flip or as the rest of the world calls it, the Z Flip.  That to me is the most interesting phone of the year.  It really is.  So let me see it.  You got it.  You ordered it at Best Buy.  Did you get it Friday or?

Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a it is the most intriguing piece of technology I've used since I drove my Tesla.  It is.  It's really got me to rethink technology in terms of phones.  And it's not all perfect, right?  Like if you opening and closing it is definitely an extra step.  And if you're always putting your phone out of your pocket, there's that trade off.  And that's real.  It's also a little bit more delicate or at least I'm treating it more delicate than I probably would.  You know, something like the S20 Ultra.  That said, the way like I have it right now with it sort of, you know, propped open like this as a little Barbie laptop.

Transcript:  So I leave it on my desk like this and it has the always on display.  So it just shows my calendar and any notifications.  And now I'm using it also with Microsoft's your phone because it's built into Samsung's phone.  So it's Windows 10.  I just launched your phone app.  I can now mirror the phone.  I can actually just run the apps directly.  I get notifications.  I can make phone calls.  I can do text messages all while it's open on my computer.  And that's like it uses Wi-Fi direct basically.  And it's actually a very fast connection.  So it's really just sort of made me rethink about what a smartphone can be.  I don't think it's for everybody.  It's still too early.  I mean, I think it's a question like, is it worth it?  Come on, it's $1,400.  Most people, it's not going to be worth it.  But it really is transformative.  I hate to be cliche, but it really does make you rethink, you know, what phones and devices can be.  And this idea that it's a large phone that folds up and, you know, I close it here and I just drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when you if you open it and you go into the light and you kind of reflect it, you have to do that, though.  Yeah. But when you're using it, you absolutely do not see the crease.  You feel the crease. And that's weird.  It feels felt at first to me like I had a some gunk on the screen or something.  But you get used to it.  And it says it's halfway up. You can actually scroll mostly in the bottom half of the screen.  I see. I can see the crease when you hold it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could totally. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there we go.  Yeah, no, no. You look it's folding.  So I think that there's two ways to go with a folding phone, either unfold it to make it bigger or or start small and make it normal phone size.  And I think this is unfortunately the Moto Razr was announced two weeks ago and apparently isn't very good.  It's crinkly and weird.  Samsung comes along two weeks later and says, well, how about this?  They claim to be using very thin, foldy glass.  Yeah. Although Jerry Rigg.  Have you seen Jerry Rigg yet? Because Jerry Rigg everything kind of makes me mad because Jerry likes takes, you know,  exacto knives and and pointy objects and tries to scrape the darn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So obviously nobody's going to do that, but he is measuring the mo hardness and he says it's a hardness of only two or three.  It is not glass hard. So what do you think?  Yeah, his theory is it's not really glass. It's a polymer with glass particles embedded.  It's glass like. Yeah.

Start time: 2850.14
End time: 2885.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't know. Right. I mean, they're being coy on us.  Let's just be honest. And like Samsung probably could have been a lot of us is marketing.  So the the issue is this when you use it and you feel it and compare it to the fold and the razor phone, it feels way better.  That's why everybody's so excited about it. It does feel smooth.  It feels glass like. And that's why people are like kind of believing it.  You know, but when it comes to it doesn't have the properties of glass in terms of resilience.  And that's sort of the issue. Now, to Samsung's credit here, they're like, you can get a professionally installed screen protector on it, which they offer that at no charge.

Transcript:  So I think we have to learn that if it's a foldable screen, you don't take an exacto knife to it.  You know, treat it with some here he is, though. I mean, I have to say he's using his fingernail. Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's creasing it with his fingernail. Yeah. Oh, don't do that.  Don't do that, folks. Just be very gentle with it. I do like the form factor.  I think this is and it bodes well for Microsoft because they've got now they're doing two screens with a hinge, the Neo and the class.  Yeah. Yeah. But I guess that's where the benefit is. Yeah.  You know, I think there's a good for I love the little Smurf laptop form factor.

Transcript:  They're going to do what they always do, which is they're going to them and their fans will continue to dismiss this as a gimmick, a fad, it's breakable, stupid.  Everybody comes out and does it. And to Apple's credit, they'll probably come out and do it right.  That's all Apple fans like to say. And I honestly don't doubt that's how the company operates.  But they'll probably come out with a you know, by that time that the actual material science we're expecting Corning to actually have bendable foldable glass by the end of this year.  You know, Apple will do I think everybody's going to do this or at least offer a version of it because we keep hearing people talk about is, you know, it's what Leo was saying.  So this is a large phone that folds into a smaller one.  The Galaxy Fold is a tablet that folds into the size of a phone.  And, you know, I like this better.

Transcript:  No, I agree. I like the idea of a smaller phone that gives you all the affordances of a larger phone and then some.  I mean, I think Google knew that folding phones were coming.  They adapted Android for foldable so that a program like Google Duo can know that it's half open and put the picture on the top, the controls on the bottom.  I think there's I hope we see more apps do that.  I think that's a real are all the Samsung apps must be fold aware, right?  Yeah, YouTube does it right now.

Start time: 3066.00
End time: 3090.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Duo and there's a couple other apps.  It's not a ton, but Samsung did say they're going to release the API and work with Google and partners to sort of bring that feature.  But yeah, that's what makes it.  It's that feature really kind of makes it one of the more interesting devices.  But in terms of the experience of it, the cameras are very good.  The battery life has been solid so far.  It's not amazing battery life.  But for most people in this demographic, I would say it's fine.  It's an 855 Snapdragon.

I mean, it's a cool device.  It's not perfect.  You know, it's for early adopters, trendsetters.  And that's the point of it, to get it out there.  I've seen so many influencers and people in tech have it this weekend.  That's exactly kind of what Samsung wanted, right?  We're all talking about it.  But if you go read most of the everybody's doing sort of 24 hour, 48 hour reviews and updates,  everybody's pretty, you know, happy about it.  I would wait though.

And it's funny because you're not hearing fold displays getting scratched, breaking all that.  Like there's not that's not out there right now.  So they seem to have done a pretty solid job with this.  But it's still too expensive for most people.

Transcript:  Samsung has rewritten the bad branding that the fold had last year.  I mean, initially, and Daniel, to your point and the use of the word gimmick, that's all I thought about foldable phones.  Right.  Twelve months ago.  And what they've done is not just say, hey, this isn't a gimmick.  They put it into a product that you can use right now and get the same use that you would out of a traditional smartphone.  But in a non gimmicky form factor.

We've had to put up with them since for the last 10 years.  It's nice to see a different form factor.  And for the first time, I think this is a form factor that might have some legs.  It's not the first folding phone.  I had a Moto Razr way back in the day.  This one doesn't give you the satisfying hang up, though.  Right, Daniel, you can't slide.  You can.  Yeah, you can do.

And so I have a newer iPhone with my old personal iPhone.  And I was shocked at how within five minutes I was bored of it.  There was nothing there that got me excited.

Transcript:  And that's exciting to me because I'm very excited about the duo and the Neo Microsoft's end of year products.  I think there's one Android, one Windows.  I think they're going to be very interesting.  Microsoft this week at the developer conference allowed people to start playing with what is this new version of Windows called?  Windows 10 X.  X. Yeah.  What's what's different, Daniel?  What is 10 X?  So 10 X is a really interesting thing.

Start time: 3292.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been covering it for the last almost like I think three years.  It's based off of a thing called Windows Core OS.  So the core of this is still Windows.  It's also Azure.  This is why the core of Windows is under the Azure group now.  But the shell is unique and different and new.  It's sort of an amalgamation between Windows desktop and Windows mobile.  Although Microsoft won't say that because Windows mobile has a pretty bad reputation at this point.  But what it is, it's a it kind of looks like Windows 10 desktop as you know it.  But it has they removed all the Win32 legacy components from it.  That is all the stuff that's built on classic Windows that runs on your desktop is both its strength and its weakness.  It's been around some of those components in Windows 10 that you're using right now on your desktop is 20 years old.  You know, there's a fax machine and stuff.  So what they did was all that stuff is gone.  It's just core Windows and then this new shell experience on top that's built around dual experience devices.  Although later on we definitely expect this.  It does run on single screen.  So we know their long term plans is to get to some of the initially it's for the duo or the Neo rather.

Start time: 3356.60
End time: 3412.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's right initially planned for a two screen device.  But you know what?  Microsoft is needed to kind of get the cruft out for a long time.  And I think really one of the reasons the Neo exists is not because Microsoft thinks that a future of all computers is dual screen,  but because they wanted something so different new that they could create, you know, kind of OK, but we're going to make a version of Windows for that.  That is because one of the problems Microsoft has is all the people running old PCs that need to run their line of business software on old versions of Windows.  Legacy has been handcuffing Microsoft for decades.  So having a new device and they could say, well, understand, we're going to leave legacy out here.  We're going to create something unique.  They've also they're also containerizing Win32.  And then there were words there separating it away from.  So if there are problems or security issues or crash issues, it's kind of in its own little container away from the rest of the operating system.

Start time: 3413.06
End time: 3430.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're getting the best of both worlds here.  So you're going to get this new UI, this new experience.  It's literally I mean, it was rumored to be called Windows Lite.  That's because that's a you can think of it that way.  It's physically a lighter operating system.  But that's a bad name because it implies it's going to be it does have the functionality.  Yeah. So that's why it's called Windows 10.  So it'll run 64 bit apps.

Start time: 3432.00
End time: 3435.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Will they run it in container as well?

Start time: 3436.01
End time: 3530.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Everything.  Everything. The only thing that runs native is UWP, the Universal Windows Platform.  Those run native, still containerized, but that's how UWP runs anyway.  Win32, including x86, 32 bit and 64 bit apps run as a single container.  It's an abstracted way.  It's a subsystem of the operating system, which means when you're not using it, it doesn't use any resources, which is the benefit here.  So they get a tight security model for the operating system.  It's not slowed down by having legacy Win32 components running in the background like system tray.  But when you need to run that app, you just launch it and it just will show up.  And it actually is launching a version of Windows 10, the actual Windows 10 operating system, but without all the unnecessary fluff and UI.  And it runs the app and the app does everything you expect it to.  If you open up a file, you want to save a file, those directories will exist.  And so it you get everything.  So if you want to run those apps, you can do it.  And then if you minimize that Win32 app, it's going to basically suspend in the background.  So again, what this is prioritizing is performance, battery life, things for that's important to mobile.  And this is what's always been hampering mobile devices with Microsoft is when you run Win32 stuff, it's bad for battery.  UWP is very good for battery, but it's not the app solution for everybody.  So you want to run that Photoshop app, right?  So this kind of solves all those problems.  And the emulator released this week is an opportunity for developers to actually try it out and see what runs and what doesn't.

Start time: 3531.77
End time: 3546.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting for so many reasons.  It's interesting.  The apps will run full screen, but I think that's intended for the Neo.  If you were running on a big screen desktop, it might not.  But the apps run full screen, kind of like tablet mode.

Start time: 3547.01
End time: 3593.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it.  And it was funny because when I interviewed some people at Microsoft about this and I asked them about that topic,  and there's a lot of internal debate even within Microsoft about is that the right approach?  The theory is if you're on a small screen device and the Neo is basically two nine inch device, two nine inch screens that span out to about 13 inches.  When you're on a device like that, having multi windows like five windows on a single pane is probably not something most people are going to do.  They're going to operate it with full screen.  But yeah, if you go to a larger screen device, you'd want that freedom.  But they're not locked into either one.  And if they hear developers go, listen, even on small devices, we want to have multiple windows and windowed side by side kind of things.  They're open to allowing that to happen.

Start time: 3593.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I wonder what you guys think.  I have kind of come around to the full screen app.  Even on my Mac now, I will full screen everything and swipe between separate desktops.  I think this idea of having a lot of little windows doing different things is not really how the mind works.  We are never good.  We don't multitask.  We time we time slice.  And so it makes more sense to have one task full screen in front of you and then swipe it out of the way to do another thing.  There's occasionally you want side by side.  And that's what a tools dual screen device is a very interesting device because you can have controls on one side and the objects you're operating on on the other side or something.  I'm more and more convinced that full screen isn't a bad way is a very good way to operate.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  I agree with that.

Transcript:  But once again, I'm on Twitter and we're talking about a couple of different companies, a couple of different platforms, couple of different devices.  And we're talking about Apple being a bit boring and everyone else being kind of cool.  And it's just such a hilarious inversion from where we were four years ago, five years ago.  I'm blown away.  Like, I mean, that's called success, Alex.  True.  But I just listened to Daniel talk about developer things for like five minutes and I was actually interested in it.  Like, that's how it's like it's evidence that what's being built is like different and exciting and maybe opening up new doors for us to do cool things.  And whereas my new iPhone 11 that I got from work is just I fell asleep taking out of the box.  So it's fun.  I'm excited about the future.

Transcript:  We do have to remember that the human brain is tuned to change.  We were, you know, if there's a tiger stalking us, we don't want to see the landscape, unchanging landscape.  We want to see what's different.  It's the tiger in our brain really embraces change and newness and prefers it to the same old same old.  That's kind of a classic human problem.  And it's a big problem for tech reporters because we're always going, what's the next new thing?  What's the next new thing?  Instead of saying, hey, this thing is perfect.  This is doing exactly what it should do.  So I just want to say I'm going to try to not be too enamored of the new just for news and this sake.  But it does seem to me the windows needed this refresh.  And now I asked we spent a lot of time on Windows Weekly talking about virtual machines versus containers.  And I'm sure Daniel, you're up on this.  So correct me if I'm wrong.  But a virtual machine is heavyweight because it contains the entire operating system.  It's basically everything running in a separate little window.  Whereas a container, the operating system is a single core operating system that all the containers share.  But the containers still are somewhat isolated.  So you get some of the benefits of virtualization without the heavyweight extra operating systems.

Transcript:  So you'll be able to, like I said, run the 32 bit and 64 bit classic apps and they behave.  They're supposed to behave as expected.  The difference is, like, for instance, if you have an app that runs at startup and then it goes and pops in a system tray,  that doesn't work on Windows 10x because there's no system tray anymore because that's a legacy Windows 32 thing.  So what happened?  But what happens is, though, they built it so when it does those API and registry calls, the OS basically hears them but sort of ignores them.  In other words, the app shouldn't crash or shouldn't be unusable because of that.  You'll still be able to run the app.  I just mean some of these classic apps.  So there's no backgrounding?  Not right now, but even there, they're flexible on.  So right now, Windows 32 apps on Windows 10x, if you minimize them or you close it, of course,  it's going to suspend all those processes and gives all the resources back to the operating system.  If you bring that window back up for Windows 32, the system resources will focus on that because that's what you're using.  So that's where you get the smart stuff.  But they are open to the idea of giving basically users a switch, a toggle that would allow this,  knowing the fact that you're going to take a hit now on performance and battery life.  But again, they're open to that idea.  But I think for the consumer experience, they prefer not to have it.  And that raises the question, what classic app do you need to be running on something like the Surface Neo that needs to be running in the background as your mobile?  So that's where this isn't like a desktop operating system.  That's where sort of the thinking is.

Transcript:  How hard is this going to be for developers to get their head around?  Is this a hard thing, a new way, a new paradigm?  Or is it?

Start time: 3851.98
End time: 3921.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's cool about it is right now the default experience on 10x is if you launch an app, it just takes up a single one of the screens.  And then if you want, you can drag it over into the middle and then it'll go to both screens and span and you'll get that.  So there's technically not a lot.  Like even if you have a classic app, companies don't need to go redo anything for their app.  What Microsoft's done with this emulator and the SDK for is basically said if you want to leverage the dual screen stuff and they fully mint, not all apps going to be able to benefit from this.  Right. Doesn't make sense.  But if you have something like Outlook where you can have the email list on one side and then on the other side, you have the email and you can use those independently.  Or if you're on the Skype call, you open up OneNote and you can follow a presentation or PowerPoint.  You know, this is where it starts to make sense where you can have apps span across and do these dual things.  So that's what's neat about it is you don't need to developers don't have to actually do anything a lot of times to just have the app run.  It will by default.  This goes for the duo to for Android.  But they want developers to sort of think about how they could utilize this opportunity here if they so choose to as an experience on this device.  And how about users?

Start time: 3923.60
End time: 3931.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this going to be intuitive for users?  Are they going to say, oh, yeah, I get what's going on?  I think if you have a two screen device, it will be.  In fact, I think users are going to like it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  When you look at the exact boat and our senior writer did a walk through video, it's 20 minutes.  I'm watching the whole.  Yeah, you can see it all in action.  It's a very it's it's like if you combines iPadOS with the power of Windows.  And what's neat about it is it's not a it's not a Windows version of iPadOS because you still get to run all your legacy applications.  But you really need to think about it this way.  Windows 10 desktop is when 32 first and UWP second.  Right. You can run UWP apps on there if you want to.  UWP are those store apps, the store apps.  Right. This is reverse.  This is Windows 10 access UWP first.  But Windows 32 still runs on there and you still get near native performance as well.

Start time: 3987.00
End time: 4028.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It actually solves the virus problem.  In theory, you don't need to even run antivirus on us because of the way it's containerized.  The Win32, if you installed an executable that was a virus, cannot infect the operating system because it's siloed off.  So because of that, again, returns to performance of the operating system better for mobile.  So it's a really kind of neat idea.  They've been working on this for a very long time.  They required ridiculous amounts of engineering, but it's a modular operating system.  So they could actually, you know, some of this part of this runs on HoloLens 2.  They could take out the Win32 subsystem and make a phone if they wanted to.  That was the original plan for Surface Duo.  But they switched it to Android because the app problem still exists.

Transcript:  Yeah, they could.  And that's what the Duo was going to be.  It's going to be Windows 10x.  It's going to be a phone.  But they knew they wanted to succeed.  They want people to buy this.  And the app problem, no matter how much diehard Windows fans want that thing, it would not succeed because you still need Snapchat.  You need Gmail.  You need like all these core apps.  And without that, it wouldn't succeed.  But they could, you know, like five years now, this app story changes, whether it's PWA or UWP takes off, you know, which probably won't happen, but could they could easily put telephony into the system and just make a phone.  They could do that if they want to.

And a lot of new stuff doesn't work that well, including software.  But after 10 years of this kind of one form factor for mobile phones, I'm stoked beyond belief that we're finally going to break out of this box and do some new things.  If it's the flip phone, if it's dual screen machines, if it's a weird hybrid, that brings I you know, iPad, iOS equivalents and Windows together, whatever it is, I'm ready to have new stuff because I'm drowning.  I have so much going on.

I mean, as he's talking, as Daniel's explaining this, I'm like, how can I extract myself from Mac OS and iOS and fully move over to Windows?  I mean, this sounds like what Alex is talking about.

Transcript:  And even more than that, Microsoft's been pushed into this because Windows is such a nightmare.  Windows 10 especially is a nightmare.  They just put out an update that breaks people's windows and people are rolling back because they can't trust the updates.  Microsoft, it's not it's innovation because we need to innovate, but also because we're desperate because we have a problem here.  This is legacy.  This colded code is so old and so messed up and so spaghetti.  They got to clean it up.

Transcript:  Well, it's all really that.  I mean, that's the funny thing is still Windows 7.  That's the problem.  It's this code base, this old code base that just tacking stuff onto.  That's why 10 X is more interesting.  They didn't start from the ground up, though, either.  Well, 10 X is from the ground up.

But there there are some people putting guides out there.  It does work.  Someone's also done on Surface Go and it's LXPS 13.  And it goes to show you that this is fully operational as a standard laptop operating system, because that's what Microsoft's long term plan is.  But what Leo is saying, they're doing this on dual screens to basically raise interest and hype and interest and also so it doesn't scare off.  That's the key.

Transcript:  Yeah, because an IT department is going to be like, wait, what do I know about this?  So it's like new device experiences is how they're going to do it.  That said, obviously, this is an emulator.  People putting it onto Macs.  There's no ISO yet.  We don't know Microsoft plans.  I can tell you there's no plan in place for people to upgrade Windows 10 desktop to Windows 10.  It's probably not going to be able to be done because it's a completely different system.  But as we get further along, you know, who knows how the story may change?  And yeah, maybe we'll see a boot camp version of this happen.  But, you know, make no mistake.  This is the version of Windows that Microsoft sees most people going to in the next, I would say, five to ten years.  This is the real future forward looking version of Windows desktop.  Classic Windows will always exist.  It'll be there for people who need it.  But increasingly, you know, what this allows them to do is create new hardware that they couldn't do before,  including dual screen devices and things that use small processors that aren't always Intel based.  This one is Intel based for now, but we've seen with ARM and AMD.  So it allows them to create new experiences where they were hampered before with classic Windows.  That's really the purpose here.

I mean, we've we've labored really there are only three operating systems for desktops.  And we've just kind of nothing's changed over the decade.  Google has been working on fuchsia.  We've talked about that before.  And I think somewhat of a defensive maneuver because Android is under assault from Oracle.  And, you know, that's going to go to the Supreme Court.

That's the only detail.  I don't know if they're going to change the name from fuchsia to pigweed.  Pigweed is botanical.  It's a plant.  Pigweed, according to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, just around the road, a piece from you there, Dan, are otherwise known as Amaranth.  Amaranth. You know Amaranth.  It's a leafy plant that is edible, nutritious, and some pigweeds, when fully grown, will dry out and form tumbleweeds.  So I think we now know what Google's up to.

Transcript:  Everybody knows now what is there to hide.  Our show, we're going to St. Louis next month.  I'm excited about this.  We're going to do an event for worldwide technology.  You know, if you're an enterprise, you know WWT.  And do you know the ATC, Worldwide Technology, is advanced technology center?  That is pretty amazing.  They started building it 10 years ago.  I think, you know, there used to be, we used to have in Foster City,  Ziff Davis Labs, this amazing testing facility.  Now that there's no longer a Ziff Davis Labs, I'm thrilled that WWT has taken the mantle  and built their advanced technology center.  More than half a billion dollars in enterprise equipment there from hundreds of OEMs.  Key partners ranging from heavyweights like Dell EMC and VMware and Intel.  Emerging disruptors too like Equinix.  Why did they build this?  Well, WWT's engineers use these environments to spin up proofs of concept  and pilots that use the lab environment so that when you come in as a customer  and say, well, I've got, you know, I'm running EMC storage and I use VMware.  They can combine, you know, VXRail, combine it all together in a way that they can show you,  yes, this is going to work well with this.  This is what you need to do.  But what I also do, which is amazing, is they offer lab as a service,  a dedicated lab space within the advanced technology center where you as a customer  can perform your own programmatic testing.  And you don't have to come to St. Louis.  You can do it 24-7 from anywhere in the world.  On demand and schedulable labs, Dell EMC, VXRail.  You've got data protection center.  You've got IDPA.  All of the stuff in primary storage you might want to look at or be thinking about, you can try.  There are hundreds of labs to explore.  Multi-cloud, hyperconverged infrastructure, networking, secondary storage, data analytics, AI.  It's all in the advanced technology center 24-7.  And it's available to you.  They've launched this digital platform.  The entire ecosystem is at your disposal.  And you really get a multiplier effect here of knowledge, of speed, of agility,  anytime, anywhere around the world for customers and partners.  You'll get full access to everything, not just hands-on lab, but articles and case studies  and all the tools you need to really make a difference in today's fast-paced world.  Just go to www.wwt.com slash twit.  Become a member of their growing community.  Create an account.  Get access to these on-demand labs at the ATC.  And if you're in St. Louis, March 5th, we will see you out there.  We'll announce, we're going to have a meetup.  We'll go to steak and shake or something and get together.  It might be a breakfast meetup, so I don't know.  But we're going to figure that out.  And if you are a WWT customer, sign up for the panel that we're putting together.  It's going to be really interesting.  Mary Jo Foley is coming out for it.  We're also going to get Alex Lindsay out there because he has a lot of experience  operating streaming in the cloud.  Mike Doris from Kartner.  It's going to be a great panel.  WWT, March 5th. Ask him about it.  www.wwt.com slash twit.  Worldwide technology, delivering business and technology outcomes  around the world.  That was a very heavy conversation about Windows 10x,  but I think it's really kind of exciting to think about it.  Now, when you, it's just an emulator at this point.  Daniel, can you, it is the actual operating system.

Start time: 4749.02
End time: 4799.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's an emulator, but people are hacking it onto their computers  to use it as an operating system.  I mean, that's the internet for you.  But expect Neo, you know, more information in September, October.  Microsoft always has their surface events then.  And we'll get more.  There'll be more at Build too about it.  And don't forget, this isn't just for Neo.  That's the flagship device.  But Lenovo has the X1 fold, their ThinkPad fold coming out.  It's going to run Windows 10 at first,  but they'll have a version of Windows 10x later.  Dell will have a foldable.  Asus, I think, will have a foldable.  HP will too.  So this is a big thing.  So it's not just for that.  But yeah, expect it by end of year.  Duo, the Android phone.  And I don't want to get too much hope up for this,  but we are hearing that that may come out earlier than fall  or holiday season 2020.  Yeah, so, you know, it makes me crazy.

It was about two weeks ago.  There was someone up in, I believe it was Vancouver, was in public using it.  So what's happened is...

Start time: 4838.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could tell in this Twitter video that the employee knew he was being watched.  Because he's playing with it.  He's like showing stuff.  But he's not actively showing it to anybody.  But he knows somebody's recording this.  So they're clearly, you know, okay, I can see it.

Start time: 4862.00
End time: 4893.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're allowed to be caught with it in public.  They're not supposed to give interviews with it or anything like that.  But if you're seeing...  He's pretty proud of it, right?  Yeah.  And so we may hear more about it at Build.  But they presumably may want to get into developer hands at some point.  Now, pricing will be interesting.  It can obviously vary between the RAM and storage configurations.  But being dual screen, I've been told by OEMs off the record when I've interviewed them  that dual screen is cheaper and easier to do than a folding display.  Right. Okay.  And so...

Start time: 4894.14
End time: 4899.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because all the folding models are premium.  I mean, they're...  Yeah.  The Galaxy Fold's $2,000.

Start time: 4901.24
End time: 4936.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is $1,400.  Yeah.  So for the Galaxy Flip.  So I wouldn't...  Between $1,000 and $1,500, depending on configuration, I think is reasonable.  But we have to kind of wait and see what it's going to be.  But it's a very...  When closed, the Duo is as thin as the iPhone.  That's why I think people don't understand how thin the technology is.  It does have the world's thinnest LCD displays.  See, I couldn't want that.  It's very thin.  So when you open it up, it's crazy to hold.  It's hard to...  And it looks bigger in this video.  I don't let people see this, and I think it's because her hands are smaller.

Start time: 4937.10

Transcript:  And if something like Dex...  I mean, one of the coolest products Samsung makes that almost everybody talks about is  Dex.  I do, because I can take this hyper-powerful supercomputer that I walk around with and plug  it, just put it in a dock, and suddenly this is as powerful as my desktop, at least for  the functions that most consumers need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I noticed that a few phones ago, and they continue to update it, and now it's better  and better.  I have Dex running here on the Windows machine.  But it doesn't seem to gain a lot of traction.  The idea is that you have so much power now in this little thing in your pocket.  What do you need a desktop for or a laptop?  Just plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, and it's your computer.  And now all your data is on the phone, where it's probably safer, and you always have it  with you.  But do you see people using Dex?  No, never.

Transcript:  It's great, but it's aspirational.  I mean, it shows us a future that, much like Daniel just detailed with Windows, is a potential,  whether we get to there or not, who knows.  But this is something that, I mean, really for most consumers, you don't do heavy media  processing or editing.  The spreadsheets you use are fairly functional.  And you have the cloud now, right?  This is what Microsoft's been very smart about.

Transcript:  In fact, they're talking about the edge all the time now, edge devices and Windows Edge.  And I think really, from a 30,000-foot level, what Microsoft's really done is said, our  business is no longer desktop software.  Our business is the cloud, and we're going to see Windows not as our bread and butter  anymore, but as a tool that lets you use our real business, Azure, from the edge.  Yes.

I mean, there's a lot of requirements the Pentagon had.  Oh, yeah.  They bid it out.  Google was involved, but their engineers said, yeah, we don't want to work on a defense project.  So Google bowed out.  Then it was down to Microsoft and Amazon.  Microsoft won it to the surprise of a lot of people who thought Amazon was for sure.  AWS is the obvious choice.  Microsoft won it.  There was some thinking Amazon said, wait a minute, this is because President Trump hates  Jeff Bezos.  And we bet he put his fingers in the works and threw it to Microsoft.  They sued and a judge on Thursday said, hold on a minute.  Microsoft did not win this contract.  He put a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and said, we got to look into this.  That is how important these businesses are now.  $10 billion over 10 years.  And it's more than that, right?

But I will say that little Mac external that I just held up is probably the thing I'm fast at.  It is probably the thing I'm fastest on in the world.  Any keyboard I ever use.  And to me, that is a feat.  And so if Apple could just kind of take that and put it into my MacBook Pro, I would give them more money.

I said, you live there?  He said, yeah, but just a little bit. My dad's a tour guide.  We're going back to the States in a few months.  I said, OK. He said, I have a question about the Raspberry Pi.  I have a Raspberry Pi 4.  I've already written a voice assistant with it.  I said, oh, what do you call it?  He says, it's called Lola.  I said, can you say, hey, Lola?  He said, no, it just tells you the time, the weather, Wikipedia, that kind of thing.  I want to do face recognition, but I can't get my camera with Python.  Is there a Python library?  Guys, 12. Is there a Python library?  I want to do face recognition on my Raspberry Pi 4.  And this is my argument.  He actually had a deeper voice than that.  But this is my argument for when a kid, when a 12 year old says, I want a computer, dad, don't give him a PC.  No, get a Raspberry Pi.  Yeah. Thirty five bucks.  And you just adults do.  Yeah.  Throw it at him and say, figure it out, kid.  And they're motivated.  They're going to. I got to play Minecraft on this thing.  They'll figure it out.

You got that Android device, but do you have that Android mojo?  Every week, I'm going to bring you new insights into how to use your device from giving the UI a facelift  to practicing safe permissions to securing your phone from intruders.  There's tips and tricks for some of the most popular phones.  And when a new OS update is released, I plan to do some deep diving.  And yes, I'll even review apps that bring a little something special to the platform.  All right, look, Android is open, which means its capabilities are wide open.  And I'm your tour guide helping you to use that Android device to the best of its capacity.  Hands on Android comes at you every Thursday.  You're going to want to subscribe right now on Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts, or your favorite podcatcher  to be sure you don't miss any of that magical mojo.

And somebody's saying, does this mean Jason won't be doing all about Android?  Absolutely not.  Jason is doing all about Android, Tech News Weekly, and Hands on Android.  That's three shows. He can handle three shows.  How many shows a week do I do? I'm asking you. He can handle three shows.  So yeah, no, I'm excited about that. We're going to also launch Hands on Macintosh.  I'm going to host that next month.  And yes, people have asked.  The survey says people wanted Hands on Linux.  So we're going to do that as well.  And I'll be hosting that as well.  Speaking of which, it's the last chance to do the survey.  We're retiring it on Wednesday.  So if you haven't yet done the Twitch survey, twt.to slash survey20, or just go to twt.tv.  It's on the front page there.  It's just a few pages, a couple of questions.  We don't track you.  You know, one of the great things about podcasting is there's no way for us to do anything,  but give you nice content and maybe see how many downloads we get.  We can't tell anything about you.  So this survey helps us both understand you better for our own uses and also for advertising.  It's very, we do it once a year and it's very helpful.  So twt.to slash survey20.  It's completely voluntary.  We don't ask for email or any personal information.  We just kind of want to get to know you a little bit better.  But it does help us. Thank you.  I have to say I'm a little nervous because as Spotify starts to eat the podcast world,  maybe we can talk about that next because they just bought yet another big podcast network.  And I'm a little nervous that their goal is to track you because if you use the Spotify app,  they know everything about you, including your credit card.  So we'll talk about that in just a second.  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  If you're, look, if you travel, if you go around the world, I know, Dan,  you've worked with journalists to teach them how to operate securely in countries  where the government's really keeping an eye on you.  A VPN is critical.  The virtual private network, when you're at an online, you know, open access point,  a Wi-Fi at the coffee shop or on the cruise ship or at a hotel,  the VPN is going to protect your privacy by encrypting everything you do as it egresses your computer  and then goes to the VPN server somewhere out there in the world and then into the public Internet.  That way, the people in between just can't see you.  No man in the middle, no spying.  If you think about it, you're just kicking the security and privacy can down the road.  The VPN server you're using is going to get all the information too.  So you've got to get a VPN company you can trust and I trust ExpressVPN.  They don't log your data. They can't log your data.  They can't keep track of what you're doing because they use a technology called Trusted Server.  They developed it themselves.  When you start a VPN session, and it's easy to do.  They've got clients for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux.  When you start a session, it spins up a Trusted Server on the ExpressVPN address that you're going to  and you can choose anywhere in the world, spins it up, you use it.  When you close that session, it spins it down and the entire time it operates in a sandbox, it cannot write to disk.  That means it cannot log anything you're doing.  I mean, yes, of course ExpressVPN says this, but I've got to tell you they've had third party audits  that say they had honored their privacy policy, that this Trusted Server works exactly as they say it does.  We also know from court cases where governments, in the case of one government, Turkey, they didn't use a warrant.  They just barged in on the ExpressVPN, took the servers.  There was nothing on them. They couldn't do anything with it.  So you don't have to just trust me. You don't have to trust the third parties.  Governments have tried and failed.  ExpressVPN is also fast and this is the other reason you're going to want to use it.  One of the reasons people use a VPN is to change their geographic location.  You can choose the server closest to you and most of the time you'll do that.  But you might also want to choose a server, say, in Japan so you can watch Netflix Japan.  Normally that is not a good experience with ExpressVPN.  It is because they're very, very fast. I don't know how they're doing it.  Maybe it's their servers. Maybe it's their network.  But you're able to stream HD quality video with zero lag anywhere in the world.  I know this because I've tried it.  I actually turned on ExpressVPN, went to Japan, was watching some anime on Japanese Netflix and forgot to turn it off.  I left ExpressVPN running on my iPad for days. I forgot.  And I didn't even notice because it's that fast.  It is easy to use. It's fast. It's secure.  It's what you want in a VPN and you don't have to just take my word for it.  TechRadar, The Verge, CNET, many other tech experts have rated ExpressVPN number one.  You will too.  Now, you're going to say, I know I hear from people, oh, I got a free VPN. This is great.  There's no such thing as a free lunch.  If you're getting a free VPN, they're doing something to monetize it.  Most likely they're selling your data or they're injecting ads into your stream.  There are VPN providers that do that.  ExpressVPN does not.  In fact, the best deal is to sign up for a year and get an extra three months when you go to expressvpn.com slash twit for the best VPN service.  You will use it all the time.  It's that easy. It's that fast.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  It's the one I use, the one I recommend.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  Thank you, ExpressVPN for sponsoring the Twitch show.  And thank you, Twit Listener, for using that special address.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.

Can't wait to go back.  But I want to stream TV.  And this is a lesson I learned, which is I've been toying between Sling and YouTube TV recently.  Sling on PC, I can use ExpressVPN and Sling worked beautifully.  Isn't that amazing?  YouTube TV would block though.  It worked on the phone.  I was using an iPhone at the time and an iPhone with a TV is pointless.

Transcript:  I was looking, sir, because ExpressVPN wanted us to tout how you could use Netflix with ExpressVPN and watch Netflix anywhere in the world.  I thought, is that legal?  And I checked.  And Netflix said, yeah, we don't like you to do it because it's too slow and you're going to get a bad experience.  But it's perfectly legal.  You have a Netflix account.  So from their point of view, it's fine if you're in Jamaica to surf to the US with ExpressVPN as long as you can do it.  And that's the nice thing.  Lou in Lou Maresco's in our chat room says he was in Dubai and used ExpressVPN to watch TV at home.  And it worked.  So that's a.

You remember Bill Simmons from ESPN got fired six months, six years ago because he.  I guess he was cranky.  I don't know.  And he said, well, screw you.  I'm going to start a podcast network and do sports quite successfully.  Thirty shows.  They also do a movie you watch along with them.  They do a couple of other culture shows just sold to Spotify.  Can I tell you this was a knife in my heart?  They just because they're basically the same size as we are.  We have twenty five shows or something.  They have thirty.  They have eighteen million in revenue.  We have like eleven.  One hundred forty one million dollars base.  And if they perform and Bill doesn't quit in a huff, one hundred ninety four million dollars for a freaking podcast network.

Transcript:  So I wanted to talk about this because I just got access to the podcast that I'm on with TechCrunch is Spotify Analytics.  And this was a revelation.  What did they know?  Well, what I was really fascinated to find out, it has the usual stuff like where you've been downloaded, where you've been streamed, that sort of thing.  How many people stream your show, whatever.  But the data point that it had that I really found fascinating was because they have the player built in, they can tell you how long people are listening to your show as percentage.

Start time: 6415.76

Transcript:  And one thing advertisers always ask and I bet they ask you is did they hear our ad?  Yes.  And we don't know that.  We only know if the show is downloaded.  It's like asking a magazine.  Did they see our ad?  I don't know.  They got the magazine.  I hope they read it.  I don't know.

Transcript:  You can't prove it.  But now, but now I can say yes, we put in a small teaser ad, say at the 18 minute mark.  And we know that 74.5 people were still listening at that point.  And the cool thing for me, and this was a real like a weight off my shoulders, was that nearly everyone finishes the show.  I was terrified we were going to get this data and find that everyone listens for three minutes and skip the whole, you know.  But that was a it was a data point that I didn't know that I wanted to have.  But once I had it, I couldn't.  I don't want to know that.

Start time: 6480.45
End time: 6509.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Dan.  I'll tell you my theory.  No, no, no, your theory.  So I have a theory because there's no way if a company makes 18 revenue, not profit, they have 90 employees.  We have 25.  So I think their revenue is probably very their profits fairly low, lower than ours, I would guess.  So there's no way they're worth 100 times profit.  What did Alex Europe cover business?  What's what's the typical multiple that companies go for?

Start time: 6509.00
End time: 6524.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're talking about a price earnings ratio, right?  And off of 18 million, let's say they made a profit of two million.  That'd be a hundred X multiple if they're worth about 200, including incentives.  100 seems high.  It seems so.  They're certainly not being valued on their profit.

Transcript:  No, what Spotify is saying is that you will not give up your Bill Simmons, apparently.  You will go to a subscriber.  Exactly.  And we'll put these only on Spotify in time.  All you Apple music dorks don't get them now.  So ha ha ha.  And at eight, ten, twelve bucks a month, you can make your money relatively quickly.  It's a cool gambit.  And the subtext here, the background is that Spotify's margins, their gross margins are quite low because they don't own the content they streams.  They're stuck about 25 percent, which does that's changing.

Start time: 6558.42
End time: 6593.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They now and I think part of this is because the record they worried they have the Netflix problem, right?  Netflix got got pressured by the movie companies and they couldn't get the good movies.  So they end up making their own and that worked well.  So Spotify is looking at that saying we live at the pleasure of these crap record companies.  They could put us out of business any time.  We better have our own content.  Yes.  And that's exactly they're making their own content.  But I think their only way that they paid 200 million for Gimlet, they paid almost 200 million for Ringer.  The only way these companies are worth that kind of money is if Spotify could corner the podcast.

Transcript:  They want to corner the market.  And here's how the here's the methodology for doing that.  And by the way, we will never I believe in RSS.  I want our shows to be everywhere and I want you to be able to use any client you want.  That is a problem because we won't have the information about you.  But we know our audience doesn't want that.  We won't have the information about you that Spotify has.  If Spotify can go to advertisers say, well, you shouldn't buy ads on Twitter.  They don't know anything about their audience.  We know everything about your audience.  We can even tell you if they how many people heard your ad and we'll charge you based on that instead.  Advertising will dry up for RSS.  True podcasts will dry up and it will only exist for Spotify.  Companies that can tell you that kind of information.  And the reason I have this conspiracy theory is that's what happened to the Web.

And I think the only reason Spotify could say, well, it's worth half a billion dollars to buy all these podcasts because we'll corner the market and, you know, down the road, all the all the revenue will come to us.

Start time: 6676.31
End time: 6686.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, maybe.  I mean, Spotify is making a big bet.  Apple is not going to take this laying down.  They'll have a similar.  It's risky.  Yeah, there's also Deezer out there.  There's still a lot of players.  So this isn't a foregone conclusion, but.

Transcript:  And most podcasters want to want to do what we're doing.  I don't think Marco Arman, who makes Overcast, is going to move his podcast to Spotify.  That wouldn't ever happen.  And so and we're not.  And so I have a feeling that what's going to happen is it's going to be a hard battle.  But they're going to.  But but the scary thing is they're going to put pressure on us because advertisers, which is our lifeblood, without advertising, we have no revenue.  If advertisers buy this plan, your favorite podcast could go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not worried about for myself, but you're exactly right.  I worry very much for the vibrant, exciting podcasting is kind of like the Web used to be with blogs and anybody wanted to write about stuff.  And often they could get ads.  Google kind of constant Google and Facebook concentrated at all and ended up kind of squeezing all those middle middle tier and low tier stuff.  You either do it as a hobby or or you or you have to join somebody big because there's nowhere in the middle to live.  And I think that's what's going to happen.  I worry that's what's going to happen to podcasting.

Transcript:  It's going to be too bad.  A lot of a lot of really fun independent creators will lose their revenue streams and then the work will become a little bit too much.  I mean, podcasting people don't realize is tons of work.  Editing guests distribution analytics sales.  I mean, like it's not a simple process.  And if the revenue goes down, that might just not be worth it for this kind of, you know, middle 80 percent of the podcast market, which is a huge chunk of the shows people enjoy and love, but aren't big enough to probably get past this lack of data.  But Spotify, the data they give you isn't always good or welcome because I was told the the artists that equity listeners, my podcast, what they listen to.  And it was disappointing.  So I don't care if you're disappointed.

Transcript:  Advertisers want to know that.  And they're going to say to you, you know, we're not going to pay what you're asking because I can I'm looking at you know, I'm saying is that this is this is all about empowering advertisers and disempowering content.  Disempowering content creators.

Transcript:  OK, but one last point on that, because we have the information from Spotify, we can kind of presume that that works across other platforms.  Right. So because we know Spotify says on Spotify, you have 80 percent listener rated at 30 minutes or whatever it is.  Right. Then I can kind of say, well, probably the same thing on Apple podcasts and so forth.  So I can actually use the Spotify data if I'm smart.  Let's talk about my other platform and maybe give myself more firepower.  A temporary band aid to your broader point.  But I'm hoping that there's some wiggle room there for for folks like my show, which isn't huge, but also isn't small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forget if that was broken up.  That would be a cost of revenue number, I believe, for that.  So that should be disclosed eventually.  But I was surprised by the scale of YouTube.  I thought it was going to be quite large in the billions, but I didn't think it was going to be just under five billion in Q4 alone.  That's amazing.  Yeah. And I'm really curious about the breakdown of who makes that money, because if you look at some accounts on on YouTube, they're shockingly large.  Eminem just did a big thing on Twitter and social media about one of his videos reaching a billion views.  You know, five, six years ago, a billion views was, I think, you know, not even going to happen yet, let alone one artist can have several videos at a billion or more.  So the scale of YouTube, I think we underestimate as an industry and as a group of of watchers of tech.  And I think that there's been more cultural growth there than we kind of give Google slash alphabet credit for.  And the revenues followed it. And dang, fifteen point five billions, a lot of money for for Google.  That's a big chunk of their growth in the last couple of years, I think.

And now they're going after the big corporate money, right?  All the big networks. And that's what the big complaint about YouTube is.  You go to the front page and now it's NBC, CBS.  It's clips from the Late Show. It's it's it's getting away from almost the smaller independent stuff.  But I imagine YouTube sees that revenue coming in from having this content.  And I think that's the funny thing is a lot of people, that's how they get they don't watch the TV show live.

I think the problem is, though, it's sort of like, you know, we hold up the Brownlees and everybody and we look at that like, wow, that's amazing.  But the question is, what's the entry?  Because those people have been doing it for a long time.  Like they got in early 2012, they've been doing it and really slogging through.  That's probably one of the hardest things about YouTube is is being consistent.  Right. It's not just being a hit. It's being hit.  And then coming back next Tuesday, next Thursday, next Tuesday, next and always doing it for years.  And we end up having courses. People learn, you know, that actually it's really hard to do a successful YouTube channel because you have to be.  That's all you have to do. If you take time off, it can ruin it just like game streaming.  Right. So but I do question whether or not it still has that same.  You know, if you want to go do that today, could you do that?  Right. I think it's it's increasingly difficult.  And now having corporate customers come into the mix, you're competing with that.  It's getting really hard.

I have certainly I have worked in Darfur and Egypt and the UAE and trained journalists and migrants in those countries,  not just how to create media, but how to use encryption on their mobile devices so that they can stay safe and secure.

But yeah, I think that's that's an important thing.  I actually use Google's advanced protection on my Google accounts and it limits a lot of the things I'd like to do, like embedding Google Docs and so forth.  But I do it because, you know, that's the there's a few accounts I cannot afford to get, you know, given away, get and get hacked.  And that's one of them. So using these keys, I think is a really good idea.  And I would hope that campaigns, if they're still using Gmail, are using advanced protection.

I have to because I review I review other ones, but I realize that the real risk is I'm going to put a password in one and it's not going to be the other.

No, I put different priority of passwords in in different password managers simply because I mean the same reason like if one password is compromised, another one.  That's clever. Instead of trusting one.  Yeah, not just last pass or one password. Those are my two favorites.  And we should, you know, per election security, this is certainly not about politics, but there are adversaries who have particular strategic goals.  And the strategic goal of Russia is not necessarily with this is incredibly important.  We should care about voting machines and election systems and that kind of thing.

We should pay attention to those, but we should also pay attention to things like influence operations, the use of of propaganda and undermining the way Americans feel and liberal democracy feels about the integrity of our election systems.

Transcript:  Stick around you two though. Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch and Daniel Urbino from Windows Central if you can, because there are a few more things and I'd love to get your take on it.  Our show today brought to you by Health IQ. Health IQ is interesting. It's a life insurance agency that specializes in healthy people.  So as you probably know, thanks to statistics, to actuarial statistics, healthy people essentially pay for the unhealthy people.  But the problem is you deserve better rates. If you take care of yourself, if you do everything right for your health, you exercise every day or four times a week, you get a minimum of eight hours of sleep, you're eating right.  You know what to do. You're taking care of yourself. You ought to get a lower rate.  But how do you get that lower rate? I always use as an example, Ant Pruitt, one of our hosts, who is a lifter. His body mass index is in the 30s, which any insurance company is going to say, well, you're obese.  He's not obese. He's got a 29 inch waist. He's got 29 inch biceps. That's the problem.  And because his BMI is so high, that number to an insurance company is meaningless. You need Health IQ. They're basically a concierge service for people like Ant.  They go to the insurance companies. They say, no, no, no, wait a minute. It's not obese. Ants fit.  Health IQ uses science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for people like you.  And as an example, you can get a million dollar life insurance policy for thirty six dollars a month.  There's no reason to pay more. You just got to let your insurance company know.  In fact, Health IQ works with the top 30 insurance companies and gets rates that are exclusive to Health IQ because these companies know Health IQ is selective.  The way it starts is with the Health IQ quiz. They've created an assessment. It's not a self assessment.  It's a knowledge assessment online. You can take it. Health IQ dot com slash twit.  They put this together with the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts.  Now, depending on your score, after you take the quiz and there's other related qualifying factors, in fact, they say, you know, if you want to give us your Fitbit info, that'll help.  You know, that kind of thing. You can save up to 41 percent on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.  That's almost half off. No commitment. You give them your phone number.

Elizabeth Holmes got the Theranos conspiracy charges thrown out on Wednesday.  I saw that the judge. It's really it's a case against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.  Remember, she claimed that she had a way to do blood tests with just a drop of blood.  It turned out it didn't work. She and her company close, not even close.  Her company president, Sonny Balwani, were on trial, but the judge has thrown out some of the charges.  The defense team argued prosecutors case was too broad and too vague.  The defense team tried to get all 11 charges thrown out, saying that the charges were full of ambiguity and fudging language.  Good lawyers. The judge did rule that they can't charge Holmes and Balwani with conspiracy to defraud doctors and patients.  Since they're still up for wire fraud. Yeah. So insurance paid for those tests.  So the patients weren't harmed. The judge also threw out charges claiming the duo conspired to have doctors make fraudulent statements.  But they are only off the hook for the conspiracy charges.  They still face nine counts of wire fraud. And that trial begins August 20, 20.

I just sat down in the SFO and I finished it when I landed in Boston.  And it was an amazing story to read back to back.  And I ended up watching some of the films that are out there about it. I think it's a documentary as well.  If they don't end up with some jail time, my personal non-legal view, this is just an opinion.  I'm not trying to say anything more than that, is that it was going to encourage more people to be this sketchy with the truth.  Why not take a chance? Why not? It's just a reputation. That's it.  But I mean, because they spent a lot of money. They raised a lot of money. They spent a lot of money.  They projected huge revenues. They had essentially no revenues.  This is like as stretched as things can get, if not blatantly false and fraudulent.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is the problem. Alex is probably very good at speaking of this, but as someone who doesn't cover this stuff, this is the way I see it.  I always find venture capital and startups strange because I remember back in the day where you used to have to make a product.  You'd go to the market and sell the product and then you took the money you made from that product and invested it back in your company.  That's crazy talk, Daniel.  And you just kept doing that. But at least there was a product that you were actually selling and you could make projections versus this idea of like,  well, we have this idea for this thing and if you just give us money, we can actually make it.  I get that as a bank loan to start your business, but this idea that these companies just take billions or millions at least in and get a billion dollar company on the promise of someday we may figure out a business model, how to make money off of this is just so weird to me.  I'm not like, you know, my politics are pretty lefty.  But like when it comes to that, like, all right, we're gonna have capitalism.  But what is this thing? This isn't really capitalism anymore.  Some weird, you know, there's a book out right now, Lab Rats, which are reading really good.  Yeah. Yeah. And that's like just a page turner.  But it goes through talking about how, yeah, these companies now, you know, they build up, they take the money and then they sell off and they run off.  You know, it's just I don't know. It feels kind of weird to me.

Start time: 7807.18
End time: 7841.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so some general thoughts about that.  One, I hear where you're coming from.  There has been an explosion in the amount of venture capital that has been available.  And so that has led to some silly things being funded.  But that shouldn't make you think that the venture model itself is is always a bad idea or always not a good fit for certain companies.  What it lets you do is hire very far ahead of your company's revenues if you have an idea that could have broad application.  And so with this kind of capital acceleration, you go to market more quickly, take market share, disrupting incumbents and do a lot of the stuff that we kind of.

Game studios, which we're essentially talking about here, these kind of app based hits are traditionally not considered to be good investments for VCs for this reason.  Right. And that's why VCs like enterprise software, which is long, enduring revenues and repeatability and so forth.

Transcript:  Right. So that's that's the case when things are incredibly loose and your company is very hot.  It's a bubble. Yes. Yeah.  So historically, there was a moment when we are in a bubble.  We are in a it's so it's really weird.  So the answer is yes, but not in the 2000 cents.  It isn't going to be this moment of implosion and then 10,000 companies evaporate.  What's going to happen is there's going to be a slowdown in economic growth globally.  It's going to lead to a deceleration of venture capital investing.  And a lot of companies that were worth a lot of money on paper are going to be forced to really fight for smaller amounts of money and lower valuations.  And that's going to be a sea change that we're maybe starting to see in the rubble of the Vision Fund.  But I'm a little bit off topic for Twitter.

Remember, Andy was the invented Android.  Google bought him. Google fired him.  Google gave him 90 million dollars to leave without making any noise.  And he started raised a lot of money because he's got a good reputation, except with the ladies as a technologist.  And so he raised three hundred thirty million dollars, got valued at a billion dollars because he was going to make the next big thing.  Came out with the Essential phone, which I like.  I liked it.  I think it got hurt because the camera crashed a lot in the first few months.  They fixed it, but it was too late. Right.  Also, they're going to make those little add on a day.

I think Andy, you know, he had he stayed behind the scenes and just done the investment in this and let someone else be the front facing of the company.  I think it would have fared better.  But like he just got ended up getting in the way of the messaging.  And that's all the stories, you know, and if you criticized him, he would block you on Twitter.  And it was just like it was just it was the wrong way to run a company.  You know, it's a shame because they did have good ideas.  But then it also goes to tell you it's really, really hard, no matter who you are, to come into the smartphone market in 2018 or later and make something that they made.

You can still get Shelby.  He succeeded.  He did.  Putting that VA in that weird car.  That worked. But most most small auto manufacturers don't historically.

No one likes John.  Yeah, that's true.  The judge liked.  Judge was impressed.  Judge said, John will keep the prices down.  So the reason.  So the FCC and the FTC, they've all approved.  You federal governments approved the Sprint T-Mobile merger.  But then there were 10 state attorneys general who sued saying it's going to kill competition.  We need more, not fewer cell phone companies.  The judge threw it out.  He ruled in favor of the 26 billion dollar merger on Tuesday.  There's still one little speed bump.  The California Public Utilities Commission.  For some reason, they have to approve it.  I don't know why, but they do.  There was it.  Is it Neely who wrote a kind of scathing piece in the.  It's always Neely when it comes to that.  That's why I'm just assuming it was Neely.  A scathing piece about the judge and his kind of how can I use on Sprint?  I could put it charitably.  He didn't.  He first of all, I said Sprint's failed, a failed, a failed.  I mean, it's over for Sprint anyway.  We got to let a merge.  Basically, was it was it Neely?  I can't tell.  Yeah, it was.  He says the court let T-Mobile buy Sprint because Sprint completely sucks.

Transcript:  He did pull out some quotes by the judge Marrero that made him sound like maybe less than astute.  He said adjudication of antitrust disputes virtually turns the judge into a fortune teller.  Deciding such cases typically calls for a judicial reading of the future.  Who knows, says Neely, what the future hold.  He says the parties conflicting engineering, economic and scholarly business models essentially cancel each other out as evidence.  So I can't use that.  He said he's basically saying we just we don't know.  How can we tell what the future will hold?  History.  We can look at history.  They're not going to raise prices.  Why would they?  Yes they are.  Why would they do that?  And furthermore, I guess he believed that Charlie Ergen and Dish could create a fourth cell phone company,  which something everybody agrees is probably highly unlikely, although that was the plan.

So I'm fine with that.  But I think they're good because they knew there was competition.  They're also expensive.  Yeah, but I mean, that's just a cost of life now, I feel.  I don't think about that too much.  But I mean, with competition from below to cement their higher status and their ability to charge higher prices, they had to be better.  And now with less competition in general and probably less business model innovation, call T-Mobile what you will, a gimmick or not,  I'm pessimistic about the future of this industry compared to what it could have done with more competition because I'm a capitalist at heart.  And I think this was a mistake.

But if you're a business, you don't want competition.  Your goal is to destroy your competition or to absorb them.  So there's always this weird tension between these systems where, yeah, as consumers, we want the competition.  If you're AT&T, you're definitely you're not like, yeah, we should have come.  No, you would if you could put rise out of business right now, AT&T would do that in a heartbeat.  Right. So I don't know how you reconcile those two things.

And that's going to spend a lot more money on lobbying the government.  And as we've seen from technology industry in the last five or 10 years, there's been a skyrocketing in amount of capital spent on lobbying and building up Washington based teams.  Because these companies are now worth a trillion dollars plus and they do not want to have future regulations bring them down.  And it's it's an under it's an under told story in tech in the last five, 10 years that I think people should pay more attention to because you're not wrong.  These companies are are as greedy as they they're designed to be, which is very by just into the system we live in, which is fine.  You clear on a kind of. And then they're speaking of capitalists.

Transcript:  We had decided that we should make Carson produce the show and Kevin just push buttons randomly.  And it's worked out quite well, I think.  I'm going to let you guys go.  There's so much more we could talk about, but goddamn it, it's a long show.  And we want people to listen as long as they listen to Alex's show.  25 minutes.  If that's the case, we're all in trouble.  I think the way people digest Twitter is, as you would digest any giant meal, spreading it out throughout the week.

Transcript:  Well, it didn't exist when I was a child, but other than that, Carson and I did a check of my Wi-Fi in the office here.  It's like 400 megabits up and down.  So that's why I'm here.  Do you have Verizon Fios?  I believe we have Verizon Fios.  My mom just got it.

Transcript:  I was so jealous.  She has an Eero so I can look at her bandwidth.  And the bandwidth test yesterday was 30 megabits down, two up.  And she said, oh, honey, the guy came in and just connected everything.  I said, oh, let's see what your bandwidth is.  492 megabits down.  How much are you paying, mom?

Transcript:  By the way, that's why you're not going to use Skylink for your phone because it requires a dish about 18 inches wide.  And unless you want to wear that on your back, it's just it's not going to be a good cell phone.  Dude, sign me up.  I know. I'll take it.  So great to see you too, Dan Rubino.  Daniel Rubino is executive editor at Windows Central.  Always a pleasure to have you on, Daniel, underscore Rubino on the Twitter.  Anything you got going?  You want to plug?
