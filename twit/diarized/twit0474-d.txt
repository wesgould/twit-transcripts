They were in the same same building and we actually had to separate them.  By the way, Jill, I'm sorry about the pictures I've been seeing on the Internet of you.  I don't know how this happened and I'm sure that you are chagrined. Can you show this, Chad?  This is this is a shocking, shocking dereliction of duty from iCloud.  And I think you should sue Apple. No, I'm just kidding. I love that picture.

Transcript:  And and and I wasn't searching for pictures of you, honest.  And there he is. Oh, Malik, ladies and gentlemen, the guy in charge at GigaOM,  one of the world's best bloggers and always a great guy to have on the Twitter.  It's good to see you again. I'd see you.  You you you're hard to get in the summer because you travel a lot during the summer, which is great.  I travel I travel all the time. I love traveling. Well, we're thrilled we can get you on.  We did not intentionally I did not last week talk about the fappening,  the release of scandalous pictures of well-known celebrities.  It was breaking news last Sunday. And frankly, I didn't want to publicize it in any way.  At this point, I don't think there's any way anybody doesn't know about it.  And I think there is a tech angle, believe it or not, to this.  And that is the security of the cloud.  And Apple especially is it has to be thinking very hard about this because on Tuesday,  Tim Cook's going to take the stage and is going to tell everybody you should let Apple store all your photos.  That's one of the new features of iOS 8.  And we think that you should let Apple contain all your credit cards and use an iPhone to make your payments.  Apple stock tanked a little bit on Friday.  I'm wondering if Apple has a PR problem and how they're going to deal with it.  Jill, what do you think?

Start time: 284.46
End time: 294.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I think that this very targeted hacking of celebrity photos should be treated as the criminal activity.  Absolutely. Nobody denies that.

Start time: 296.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just horrendous stuff.

Start time: 299.16
End time: 383.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the average user needs to keep in mind that their own personal private photos are probably,  they might have some embarrassing photos, but they're not going to lead to a hacker making money off of them or any kind of big headlines.  So somebody who is not a big celebrity is probably not going to be a target.  I feel like that's something that needs to be said just as people freak out about this.  The other thing is digital content is easy to collect, it's easy to find, and it's easy to repurpose and reprint.  So anytime you have a digital asset, you've always got to remember that it can be republished, reprinted, reproduced.  That said, I think that in terms of our credit cards and our payment systems, we do have fairly secure ways of handling that.  And I think there are lots of other bodies that provide checks and balances to make sure that we're handling it in the secure and appropriate way.  I don't know if Apple is really going to have a PR problem.  And the reason is because anytime there's a big leak or hack or data breach, people worry about it and then they don't change their behavior.  Like if people were genuinely worried, they would have changed their behavior by now and they don't and they haven't.  So I think this is all going to kind of blow over. I don't know that it necessarily should, but I think it is going to blow over and that people are going to look the other way.

Start time: 384.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because the same week Home Depot had a big data breach.  About 64% of Home Depot's transactions are through credit cards.  And I think it's the same flaw that we've seen in other point of sales systems.  And people aren't really talking about that because there's no nude photos involved.  So I do think that, yes, you're right, these data breaches happen. They happen all the time.  But this for some, you know, for pretty obvious reasons, I guess, has captured people's attention.  And I think it is a little bit of a PR danger for Apple. Do you agree?

Start time: 419.90
End time: 488.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there is an element of the PR danger. But the reality is that we live in a world where, you know, all these companies, whether it's Apple, Target, Home Depot,  every time a breach like this happens, it is a breach of trust on their part because we give them our information because as average human beings,  you think they are going to take care of it and they don't, right? Even though they say they are taking good care of security, but they don't.  And in reality is that I'm more worried about what's happening with Target and Home Depot and all these organizations,  which are leaking our personal information pretty much every day. Like it's not just the credit cards.  They have a lot more other personal information they have. So, you know, like Target wants people to give them their driver's licenses so that they can make sure that their identity is right.  When somebody uses a credit card or somebody. I mean, they want a copy of your driver's license.  I'm just like, you couldn't protect my credit card information.  Why would I give you this?  Exactly.

Start time: 489.62
End time: 525.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to that end, Apple can also use that as a selling point and say, look, you know, you don't have to trust Target or Home Depot.  These amateurs trust us. I mean, this iCloud hack, we should also say this alleged hack was not so much a hack as it was a phishing expedition.  And so if anyone is vulnerable, every cloud vendor is vulnerable to an attack on their brand equity.  But I think that Apple can really turn this around and use it as a selling point and say, look, we understand security.  We understand NFC and we understand payments and processing. Trust us.  Don't trust Target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to see Apple be more clear in its apology about the whole whole episode.  I think what you're seeing right now is, you know, in the past, we used to have break-ins and robberies.  People would break into your house and take your things.  And now we see the same thing happening at a larger scale, but a much larger scale, at a network scale on our digital life.  So I think we have these break-ins and I think there is no protection.  I don't think the people who are supposed to protect us actually know what they're doing.  I definitely believe that we need like they should be talking about, you know, two factor security.  They should be talking about, you know, brute force security, but they don't.  They wait till something crazy to happen to actually try and force people into that action.  And I think that is where there is a room for improvement.  And I'm not just saying Apple, it goes across every single company, whether it's a tech company or a non-tech company.

Start time: 591.22
End time: 722.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Apple has an opportunity here, but it's going to take some very careful parsing of language.  Tim Cook already took to the Wall Street Journal.  This is Apple's kind of house organ when they want to tell people something.  They call, hey, can we give you an interview?  And said, in effect, we, he didn't quite apologize, but he came as close as you can.  He says, when I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say, what more could we have done?  I think about the awareness piece. I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up.  That's not really an engineering thing.  There's definitely some culpability on Apple's part.  Christina Warren, who was on last week, who's wonderful at Mashable, did the obvious thing.  She bought the Elcomsoft password, cracked her own iCloud account.  And even though she had two-factor turned on, was able to download her iCloud backup without a warning from Apple.  This was after this all happened.  And that's still the case that you don't, even though Apple has two-factor, you don't need it to restore a backup.  And by the way, Jonathan Jadarsky, who's one of the security guys who's been critical of Apple in the past,  looked at the data that had been downloaded and was pretty felt pretty conclusively that it was, in fact,  in most cases, iCloud backups that the hackers got.  That's why there was video as well as photos.  Some of the file names and folder names were typical of an iCloud backup restore.  So and that would make a lot of sense.  It also raises the issue that even though what you're seeing is pictures, if somebody got my iCloud backup or your iCloud backup,  they got a lot more than pictures. They got everything.  So that could actually be even more severe than just the privacy invasion.  I feel like though Apple does have an opportunity, they could step forward and say, OK, we didn't, you know, we've done,  we more than any company around has cares more.  And I can tell you all the things we've done, but we still got in.  So we're going to do more. And it's a real opportunity for Apple to step it up and make it a win.  But I think he has to he can't ignore it. He can't.  And we shall see. I mean, this is this is very poor timing for Apple.  They had planned a big coming out party on Tuesday.

Start time: 723.50
End time: 751.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that the point one of the points Jill was driving towards is very correct that although this has happened,  we are also moving into an era where this is simply part of consumer expectation and understanding that you or someone you know will be hacked.  Things will happen to you.  The degree to which you have protected your information and and what type of information it is will determine how many people if anyone cares.  But this is just going to happen.

Start time: 751.08
End time: 912.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that doesn't reassure anybody.  I don't know.  I just as usual on the Internet.  That's not my job.  But it is Apple's job.  And I feel like they've they've really got a challenge here.  This is this is pretty poor timing for Apple, I think.  So let's we're going to take a break. We come back.  I want to talk about what happened this week because that's normally what we talk about.  We will also talk about what's going on.  There's some rumors leaking out that that big white structure being built next to the Flint Center for Tuesday's Apple announcement is actually a fashion runway.  You guys are I know you're all you know all week long.  Jill and Dan, you're going to Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in New York City.  You're very excited about the runway.  Well, we're going to have a runway in Cupertino.  Yes, for the new fashion statements from Apple.  We'll talk about that in a second.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.  Citrix GoToMeeting is the way we meet.  We had a GoToMeeting the other day.  In fact, anytime I have a conference call, I just set up a GoToMeeting because it's really easy to create a meeting with GoToMeeting.  I could do it right from my email.  You automatically get an email inviting you to the meeting.  But the best thing about GoToMeeting is, yes, it's a conference call.  In fact, you don't even have to use a phone bridge, although they offer it.  You can just use your iPad's microphone and speakers or your phone's microphone and speakers, your computer's microphone and speakers.  But you can also turn that phone conference into an HD video conference using the camera on your devices.  They look great, crystal clear HD video.  At the same time as you're sharing your screen, so everybody's on the same page, it really is a multimedia extravaganza.  It's the best way to meet.  Use whatever part of it at any time you need it.  And that's why we always start a GoToMeeting, a conference call with GoToMeeting, because it's just, now I've got everything, every tool I need.  You can even say to the person you're presenting, okay, I'm going to let you take control.  You show us your screen so you can collaborate.  You can present together in real time.  You can review documents, see each other face to face.  No more travel.  I know, you're always on a plane.  You could save some time.  You just have a GoToMeeting.  It's like being in person, but you don't have to be.  I want you to try it free right now for 30 days.  For 30 days when you visit, go to meeting.com, click that big orange try it free button.  I guess it's kind of a red orange now.  Start my 30 day free trial, but do use the offer code TWIT so they know you saw it on Twitter, and you'll get that 30 days absolutely free.  GoToMeeting, the next time you have a meeting, make it a GoToMeeting.  Citrix GoToMeeting, the offer code is TWIT.  So no trip to Berlin for you Mr. Malik.  You like to travel, but you didn't want to go to IFA, huh?

Transcript:  I know Gigaom does, but IFA seems like it's more...  I didn't hear much about IFA 10 years ago.  It's been going on since 1924.  Suddenly it's a huge event.

Start time: 929.74
End time: 966.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're more aware of more things because of the network now, right?  All these things were not news a few years ago, and now they are.  And rightfully so.  I think we have a society which is in transition.  And all these things which we have previously ignored, such as legislation and jurisdictions, and all those things are suddenly becoming part of conversation.  And rightfully so, because internet always mimics our real life.  So why should we not be talking about all these issues?  And I think that's why it's become a big issue.

Start time: 966.64
End time: 981.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also has better timing from the point of view of manufacturers than the January CES, because this fourth quarter is a big quarter.  And if you're going to announce a new phone, if you're Samsung or H, you don't think so?  Everybody buys all year round now?

Start time: 982.36
End time: 985.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 986.73
End time: 990.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the week before the Apple announcement.  That's what really matters.  Well, I mean, that is what Apple does, right?

Start time: 992.02
End time: 993.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They set an agenda.  Yeah.

Start time: 995.00
End time: 1008.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's hysterical that Apple's never said they're doing a watch or a wearable of any kind.  But everybody is so sure that they are that every company now has a watch.  And I don't think it came out of nowhere.  I think it came out of the fact that they said, oh, Apple's doing one.  We got to do one, right?

Start time: 1009.87
End time: 1011.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think the others are down.

Start time: 1011.59
End time: 1012.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think they were going to do it anyway, Jill?

Start time: 1013.79
End time: 1025.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that a lot of other companies were already doing it.  And then Apple said, let's see if it's going to be a trend that's taking any kind of hold.  And then let's do one once we've learned from other people's mistakes.

Start time: 1026.08
End time: 1027.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you think Apple's been wise in waiting?

Start time: 1028.79
End time: 1097.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. Yeah. Yeah. I think they have been very wise.  You know, I was thinking about the announcements that came out of CES last year and this whole timing of product releases and launches.  And it's funny because so many of the new products that I saw at CES still aren't on the market.  Like a lot of them are trying to come out in that November, December window so that they can have a big holiday push.  But I think a lot of them still aren't going to be ready for that.  So it's funny because you have, especially with the onset of Kickstarter and Indiegogo and all these crowdsourcing campaigns,  you have a lot of companies that have an idea.  They come up with a prototype.  They release images of the product that they want to develop.  And then you can have two or three years where no product is made.  So if that's what the small guys are doing, right, like they're getting people excited, they're trying to get a little money, a little attention.  And Apple is just kind of quietly behind its closed curtains working on its stuff.  Then when it reveals it says we're going to have a product ready, it's going to be ready to buy in two weeks.  Here are all the details of it. Go.  And that's a very, very different and I think more powerful position to be in.

Start time: 1099.16
End time: 1123.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think if you wanted to look and see what everybody could, what people could do wrong,  we've got many, many examples now in the wearable space of things that just were bad ideas.  So maybe Apple has saved a lot of money that way.  We can eliminate glasses.  Oh, you wore Google Glass for a while, didn't you?  We have for 20 minutes.  Yeah, that's about how long I wore it for.

Start time: 1124.02
End time: 1134.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I got hit by a friend on my face.  That's not a good idea.  As somebody said, Google Glass is injurious to your love life.

Start time: 1135.29
End time: 1139.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if you're wearing them, you're not going to have a love life.  That's what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even the watches are like somewhat.

Start time: 1144.59
End time: 1152.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so too.  So Samsung announced a watch that is the most god-awful.  It looks like you're under home arrest.  It is huge.

Start time: 1154.34

Start time: 1173.20
End time: 1196.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call it a smart bracelet.  I don't even pay too much attention to it.  I don't know what kind of functionality it had.  Was it like a smart watch?  Did it even tell the time?  It looked like it had stones on it.  Crystals.  I don't know.  I look at all these watches.  I actually love watches.

Start time: 1198.03
End time: 1282.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm asking you.  You do, yes.  Most of these are quite ungainly.  They're pretty thick.  They're not elegant.  They are trying to do too many things.  Watches are basically...  There are three issues with all these smart watches.  One is you've got to have a great hardware which has to be thin  and have similar...  Meet the needs of the smart watch.  You have to have a great hardware which has to be thin  and have similar...  Meet the expectations of the watches we have  and the analog watches we have.  Number one.  Number two, it's a UI expectation.  We don't quite know what we need from a smart watch.  Just like...  At least in electronic devices,  we have known what we wanted from them.  For instance, when iPod came out,  we knew exactly what we were looking for from the iPod.  So when we saw the iPod,  the hardware and the software,  which was the Apple software and the UI,  it made perfect sense and we wanted to own one of those.  I think right now it's not very clear  what these things are trying to do,  what problems they're trying to solve.  Hopefully we will have a better answer on Tuesday.  Maybe Apple has an answer for that.  But so far, whatever I have seen,  I have not wanted to own a single one of them.  Well, this is what I mean by agenda setting.

Start time: 1283.02
End time: 1333.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As consumers, we have an understanding of Apple as a company  that has precisely targeted certain audiences with their products.  Sometimes they flop, like the big red stereo,  the big boombox they had.  But for the most part, Apple's brand reputation  is one of understanding what consumers want and how they want it.  Everyone else can flood the market with a device  that is kind of flailing in the closed market.  But Apple, we trust, or at least we think,  we have a guess that Apple really understands  the problems that consumers have.  And once they establish a product in that marketplace,  the rest of the companies will play me too, me too, me too  with products that emulate that marketplace desire.  I kind of like Jill's notion though that  the product is a product that is not a product.

Start time: 1335.08
End time: 1384.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of like Jill's notion though that  Apple, in this case, is sitting back and waiting and watching  as everybody kind of throws themselves against the spears  trying ideas and this Galaxy Gear S watch,  which looks like an iPhone bent around your wrist,  is one of those things.  Although, you know, I shouldn't poo poo it because this is  one of the first watches that has its own phone built in.  You don't need a phone with this watch except to update it.  You can just use this to make phone calls.  It's got 3G so it has its own interface.  It's a big watch, but on the other hand, it does a lot of things.  What lessons is Apple taking from these other failures?  The Pebble, Pebble's not a failure.  I would say Pebble's been very successful.  I don't know why, but people seem to like the Pebble.

Start time: 1385.40
End time: 1395.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Pebble is probably the best known watch at this point  and has done a good job creating an app market for itself.  And it's, what, about two years old at this point?

Start time: 1396.00
End time: 1435.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it that old? Yeah, it was a Kickstarter project.  They raised, at the time, the most anybody had ever raised,  millions of dollars to make it, and it actually came out,  which is kind of nice for a Kickstarter project.  And at least two people I'm looking at are wearing them  right in front of me right now.  They're proudly raising their fist.  And everybody else, is anybody wearing a smartwatch?  You have a pretty big audience here besides you, Chad.  Nobody, nobody in the audience is wearing a smartwatch.  Wait a minute, you are in the back?  Which one are you wearing?  No, he says, no, I'm not, I'm not.  He's embarrassed to admit it.  No, he's just waving at you.  He's just waving, hi, I'm back here.  Nice to see you.  I just feel like humans, normal humans,  are not going to wear these silly things,  whether it's a Pebble or...

Start time: 1437.00

Start time: 1445.00
End time: 1461.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still Apple said, here's what you do.  And that's what Apple's done traditionally, you're right.  And I guess that's what your point was, Jill,  that they waited, they watched other crappy MP3 players,  and then they said, no, this is how you do it.  It's called an iPod.  They watched other crappy smartphones, they said,  no, this is how you do it, it's called an iPhone.

Start time: 1462.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and let's not forget that Apple did dump a bunch of money  into a company that makes other wearables, right?  I mean, we will see the technology,  which is really what will be interesting, right?  Whether they do a watch or not, or when they do a watch,  that's less interesting than the technology  that could potentially be getting into this,  including a ton of wireless stuff, transfer stuff, and NFC.  And I mean, what's the one wearable people do wear  and give a damn about across demographics?  It's headphones, it's cans, and I can absolutely see something,  positions, the same type of technology that would be in a watch  in a number of different small wearable products, not just one.

Transcript:  New York Times did a profile of Johnny Ive.  I guess you could argue this is the first admission by anybody  that Apple's looking at watches.  Johnny Ive said Switzerland should be worried.  I don't know if Johnny really thinks that Switzerland makes most watches,  but apparently he says Switzerland is in trouble.

Transcript:  But that's how Apple's been lately.  They've been big talkers.  You know, NECU said earlier this year at the Recode conference,  we've got the best product pipeline I've seen in 25 years.  Apple's been trash-talking of late, and I'm waiting for them to deliver.  I don't think it's trash-talking.  It was just like they were saying.

Transcript:  They have new products coming.  But I do think that saying that, you know, what he might have meant is that,  you know, the swatch or the Switzerland industry relies on the fact  that people want to put a watch on their wrist,  and Apple will have a watch that's going to be a watch  and they will have a product which will take up their real estate.  Like, it may not be a watch.  It can be something else.  But they are going to occupy the real estate on your wrist,  which is where the watch industry gets challenged.  But I think people buy watches for a whole different reason.  I mean, they're not buying it to see time.  That is pretty clear.  Yeah.  And so it'll be interesting to see what happens.  I'm actually pretty excited about Tuesday  because that would also define in many ways, like, you know, the future of Apple,  whether, you know, they got it or they're just full of, you know, empty words.

The Flint Center is where Apple will make this announcement on Tuesday.  And they have been constructing now for some time this building, a fairly big building.  It's almost as big as the center itself.  The latest rumor is that there is a fashion runway, a fashion style catwalk.  I am too sexy for my watch, too sexy for my watch.

We'll be covering the announcement live starting at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.  I. Justine will be joining us.  Sarah Lane, Mike Elgin, Alex Lindsay.  We're putting a lot...  Apple's events are always a big event for us.  But I think this is maybe the biggest event since the iPad announcement.  It's certainly been a long time since Apple's entered a new category.  The iPad in 2010 is the last time.  And we all agree they're going to announce a wearable?

Transcript:  I have both. I have both.  It's funny. You know, you just said that Apple hasn't really come into a new category since 2010.  And I feel like that's not really that long ago.  That's four years.  I feel so much pressure on companies to come up with something new, new, new.  And people are so hungry for new stuff.  And part of that makes me sad because I want to get a little bit more life out of the existing technology that I have.  I wish that were more the trend.  Is that we would see devices that were made to last, you know, 10 years or even eight years.  But they don't.  I mean, how often do you replace a laptop?  I ask people that all the time and they tell me two or three years or as soon as they can write it off on their taxes.  So I think that there is a lot of pressure for Apple to come into a new category to create new things,  to create an iPhone that is simply a different size with a smaller this and a faster that.  But there's part of me that, you know, doesn't want to buy into all that consumerism and just wants a product that works for a long time and looks good.  And I'd be happy owning it for five or six years.

Transcript:  Charm saying, Amen, Jill, you sing it.  I think a lot of consumers, a lot of real world people do feel like this stuff is moving too fast.  It's Wall Street and investors who want new products all the time, new categories.  And that because that's how you enter a new category and dominate it.  That's where you can really make new money.  And it's pretty clear, for instance, iPad sales, tablet sales in general are kind of tailing off because they've saturated the market.

Transcript:  There is no reason to upgrade, right?  A lot of stuff.  My mom uses her iPad one and she's perfectly happy with it.  Everything is great.  Like, you know, maybe next time I go see her, I'll take a new one.  But she doesn't need one.  It just works.  So, you know, I have I have an iPad Air and I have an iPad Mini, which is the old iPad Mini, not the new one.  However, do you survive?  I don't really need the new iPad Air was just a gift from a friend.  I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

Transcript:  Obviously.  And by the way, that's killed the television industry.  A lot of the Japanese television manufacturers are suffering, bleeding, hemorrhaging money because everybody has a TV and they tried 3D, hoping that you would say, oh, I got to have a new 3D TV.  Nobody bought it.  Now they're trying 4K.  So there is you can see the pressure on the industry to come up with new stuff.  And you can also see the natural conservatism of I guess we've learned.  We've gone through that gadget phase where we just got everything.  The minute it came out, we've learned who can afford that.

Transcript:  But I do love one thing which Apple does is they actually try and move a technology which we don't see all the underlying technology of phones and, you know, the cameras and the and the processors and all those things.  They push that forward.  And I think that is one aspect of tech.  We don't quite appreciate as much because it is hidden from the naked eye.  And I think that is the kind of progress we need more and more.  So products become more useful and they last longer.  Like, you know, like if you look at some of the newer iPads, they're just they're perfect as a replacement for for for your laptop.  The software hasn't caught up to them.  But the power is there.  And I think that's that's the thing they have done really a good job of.  And now the software and the app people should think about how do they they take advantage of that.

Transcript:  I'd like to see improved battery life.  Yes.  We're dying there.  Motorola also announced new phone phones this week.  The successor to their successful Motorola G, which is a very affordable and yet decent phone.  And my favorite phone of the year, the Moto X, which didn't sell all that well, but I think the new one might fix some of those problems.  But they also announced a Scarlett Johansson earbud that you could look a hint that you could put in your ear and you can talk to it.  And I say Scarlett Johansson because it's like the earbud, very much like the earbud that they wore and he wore her.  But it's they're not even saying the battery life on the hint.  They're saying things like, well, it comes with a container, which will give it a 10 hours, three charges.  I'm gathering from that.  It's got three hours battery life.  People are complaining about the Moto 360 that it won't make it through the day.  What's a wristwatch that dies at six p.m.?

Transcript:  These are, you know, I, you know that I'm all into a lot of the fitness wearables and it's really fun.  I've been doing a lot of research lately about what's coming out in that market.  And they the people who are developing those products are really forward thinking about how does it fit on your body?  How can it last a long time?  Because if you're running a marathon or if you're on the field, you need something that's going to last.  So I've been seeing a lot of new products that are coming out that have sensors built into things that we already wear.  So if you think about a watch as an accessory, but your clothing is something you have to wear regardless.  Shirts that have sensors embedded in them.  And then there's usually some kind of a core or a pod that will attach to it.  And that's where the battery is.  That's sort of the hub of all of the information.  But the sensors themselves are just built into the clothing.  And there's a lot of conductive fabrics that have been made that are now knitted or woven into athletic wear so that they may are the sensors themselves.  It's just a bit of a bit of thread, essentially.  And so there's really neat ideas there too, like hats.  So bicycle helmets now that have heart rate monitors built into them.  LED and audio feedback.  It's just built into the helmet so that you're not adding something to what you're already wearing.  And that's the kind of stuff that I think is still really in research phase.  There will be a few products that are coming to market this year and next.  But I think that's the more experimental stuff that I'm personally more excited about to see how is it going to work?  Are people interested in blending these things into their life rather than having a piece that you pop into your ear or a thing that you put onto your wrist?

Transcript:  I'm just fantasizing.  One thing we do think they are doing is talking with American Express Nordstrom,  other credit card makers to put payments, mobile payments into the iPhone six.  That would make sense if they are indeed putting an NFC chip in it, something Apple's avoided for a long time.  This is again, this is going to be something they're going to need to convince people.  Well, we're safe. It's safe to use your iPhone as your wallet.  Touch ID will help. The fingerprint sensor will help.  Do you think that's where Apple is headed? A payments system?  This is something they've had passbook for a few generations and haven't really capitalized on it.  It's just been something you put your boarding pass in.  But now you could really use it as a wallet. Is that what they're going to do?  You know, I wouldn't be surprised by that.

Start time: 2223.04
End time: 2254.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be somewhat of a similar approach they've taken with, you know, the health kit kind of a, you know,  set of APIs which they're working with other developers and other companies to use.  And I think they will do a similar approach to payments as well.  I think they have an opportunity to do that.  And it will be actually pretty awesome if they can figure out a way to do seamless mobile payments.  My guess is that it would be more in the OS layer and which will allow other people.

All the people who have Apple accounts, iTunes accounts have stored their credit cards with Apple.  But I don't think I mean, that is not an insurmountable barrier to somebody else.  Anybody can get people to enter credit card numbers.  And the fact that you have them now does not necessarily give you a big advantage or does it?

Transcript:  I'm willing to bet that Apple has all kinds of metrics that can prove their audience is more valid or that their credit card holders are more valuable, more active and do spend a lot of money.  And I wouldn't underestimate the value of Apple's consumers in major cities like San Francisco and New York, particularly in conjunction with relationships with POS vendors and that's what's going to have to happen.  You can have CVS. Well, they just made a big deal with CVS and well, allegedly with CVS and Walgreens.  And that's where this will go from being something that people might be tentative of to an army of people who are buying crap when they have to check out.

They're going to give me a discount for using my phone.  Like that's great. And I do like the idea of not having to pull out my wallet or not necessarily bringing my wallet.

I mean, you can stand in a Starbucks line here in Manhattan and the amount of people you see waving their phone.  They do it. OK. Oh, oh, even I remember that, you know, when the big Starbucks mobile hack that happened earlier this year.  And I remember thinking, oh, thank God, I didn't put them that app on my phone.  Nope. Getting coffee that morning.  Customer after customer waving their phone.  I know that this is not in maybe Carbondale or Spearfish yet, but it will be.  It's here now and it's actively being used.

I mean, there's a million reasons Square could could determine it's not the business for them that have nothing to do with Apple.  Right. And if any company can get a large block of consumers, there's no way you would see this happen.  I mean, Android has NFC in it. You don't see Google making the types.  I mean, I also see Google Wallet even at the hot bagels around the corner from my place in Brooklyn.  I see Google Wallet. I never see people using their Google Wallet thing.  Apple will get people to do this, especially if it's on a little thing that's on your wrist and all you have to do is this.  And then you look kind of silly. But, you know, you're you're paid.

Start time: 2498.04
End time: 2550.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're paid. Think about this from a different angle for a second.  The way that we handle credit cards and money in this country is completely broken.  It's an insecure system. It's relatively easy to fix or at least to get rid of the parts that don't work.  And there's this this opening now that's it's ripe for innovation and the company.  I think what Dan is kind of saying is the company that has the most reach is Apple because IOS devices are just still wildly popular in the US and Canada in particular,  maybe not worldwide. But IOS is definitely like the platform that everybody uses here.  So they have a way in. And I think if we don't think about it from the point of view of like,  do you want to use your smart phone to make payments and think about it instead of credit cards are a broken system,  the market is ready for disruption, then it might make a whole lot more sense why Apple has this opportunity right now.

I want to talk about Samsung's curved screen when we come back, too.  We didn't get into that at all. The new Galaxy Note Edge.  But first, a word from audible.com. I am a reader once again. I have to say it makes me very happy.  I used to love to read, but then life happens and you get busy.  And who has time to read? You know, you've got so much reading you have to do for work and so forth. You don't get to read fiction anymore.  Who has the time to sit under a tree and read a book?  Well, thank goodness we do have a lot of time in the car on our commutes at the gym on the treadmill, walking the dog, doing the dishes.  Wouldn't it be awesome? Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to listen to books?  That's what audible does. The world's biggest bookstore of audio books, 150,000 strong.  And there are certain advantages to an audiobook. For instance, Joan Rivers autobiography, Diary of a Mad Diva.  Well, she reads it. So that that listening to Joan Rivers do her autobiography, that's going to have a lot more more be more interesting than having just reading the paper words on the page.  There's actually a lot of Joan Rivers. We miss her and she passed away. Of course, this week, there's a lot of Joan Rivers books on audible.com, including Men Are Stupid and They Like Big Boobs, A Woman's Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery.  Very, very exciting. And Joan Rivers performances to live at the London Palladium.  I mean, there's some really neat audio content on here that's not just books. I'm going to get you to audio titles. I shouldn't even say books, audio titles from audible right now.  If you go to audible.com slash twit to you'll be signing up for the platinum account. That's the account I have. I get two books a month.  I love the 22nd of every month when my credits go from zero to two. I get so excited. I get two more books.

You can listen to audible everywhere. These are some of the books I'm going to listen to any minute now. I'm getting a little bit behind.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot from David Schaeffer, which is supposed to be a great. Are you reading that Chris? You like it? It's supposed to be. New York Times said it's the book of the summer.  Russell Shortow's History of Dutch Manhattan. See, I like to mix fiction, nonfiction, fiction. Gone Girl, the thriller from Gillian Flynn, Thinking Fast and Slow.  This is the guy who kind of inspired the whole rational, you know, Freakonomics, the whole behavioral economics field. He's the original Nobel Laureate, the original behavioral psychology, behavioral economics and happiness guy.  Inspired Stephen Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. And I've got this as a recommendation from somebody. That's one of the fun things about being an audible member. When audible folks get together, they always say, what are you listening to?

I thought this was actually an interesting piece that Samsung, there was a failure of nerve at Samsung. They announced the Galaxy Note 4, which is just kind of like a little bit bigger, a little bit better Galaxy Note 3.  As Samsung has wanted to do this very slow evolutionary improvement. And then they also announced the Galaxy Note Edge, which is wacky. It has a screen that curves around the right edge of the phone. It's actually, I think they're two separate screens. It looks like a single plate of glass, but I've been told that they're two separate screens.  And so icons show up there. You could look at the weather if you're at a meeting or at a you're at dinner and and your spouse has said, if you take out that phone, you're dead. You could just put the phone on the table and surreptitiously look at the edge of the screen and it's there.  Is this just goofy or is there a market for the Galaxy Note Edge? Who wants to buy this? Anybody? Om, are you running out to get this? You're all iPhone users. You're sheep.

And the new Moto X, you don't have to say, okay, Google. Now you can say, yo, Moto or whatever you want. You can have it say anything. I could say, hey, needles. I'm going to do that.

Transcript:  About innovation. I think this phone is innovation for innovation sake. I think that you think nobody wants the edge.  I think a small number of tech forward early adopters are going to want it. They're going to be bored with it in a year when something comes out. There's a lot of products that come out. Like we were saying before, you're trying to get something and something different out there because there is this hunger and this demand and this pressure on companies to put out something different. And what I think about from time to time is video conferencing, right? Like 40 years ago, this was everybody's street would be able to have a phone call.  And see each other face to face and the whole experience in color would be amazing. What we actually want in the stay in age is the ability to send text messages.

TechCrunch did have this story. I thought this was interesting that Apple is cranking out so many new iPhones, so many iPhone sixes right now that in fact other phones from other manufacturers are being delayed.  All of China now is basically making iPhones as fast as they can. Apple's shipments via FedEx and UPS said to be incredibly high for the holiday quarter. Pointing pointing to this is Matthew Panzerino writing in TechCrunch.  Pointing to a massive number of iPhones.  Logistics exec John Martin told Businessweek that when Apple and this was a couple of years ago, but when Apple ramps something like this out up, you can't there's no one there's not any air in the room for anybody else.

Transcript:  Mark Gurman, who has been very right on, a 20 year old journalist at 9to5Mac says Apple's wearable, whatever it is, will run third party apps that big developers like Facebook have already received an SDK.  That's not unusual. Apple likes to show off apps at the reveal. And even if the iWatch isn't available Tuesday, they would like to show it at working.  Do you think, actually, Om, do you think some have said you're not going to see an iWatch. They're just going to talk about it.  Do you think you'll actually see a product?

Let's rewind the clock to a couple of years ago when Adrian Chen got that iPhone 4.  You remember what a big deal that was just seeing the casing, the body ahead of time, right?  It was a huge story. Fast forward a couple of years.  And of course, the supply chain with the advent of smartphones, the supply chain will get a little, you know, there will be more leaks if there is an actual product in that chain.  If there was an actual watch that was coming out this week, we would have seen more leaks and more information would be available.  I mean, just the fact that we've seen iPhone casing, we can almost we can almost guess with some certainty that, OK, we will probably see an iPhone within the next two to three weeks.  We will not see for sale and this wearable watch thingamajig.

It was six months from the announced to the release when the iPad came out.  It was what? How many months? Three or four months.  It's pretty typical when you have a brand new category that you you can pre announce this and and it's going to take a little while to get to market.  So I think we can plan on that.

Apple's Apple's owns this space.  Is that right?  Maybe. Maybe.  Could Apple's could Apple really stumble?  I mean, could it happen that on Tuesday we look at it and we go, oh, wow.

We're going to everybody's going to be wearing Apple jumpsuits from now on.  Chris likes that.  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  You know who's really capitalizing on a new iPhone?  Gazelle.  Because they will buy your old iPhone.  And the key on this is to lock in the price.  I know everybody knows what Apple is going to announce on Tuesday.  I don't care. The price for the old iPhone goes down the minute they announce.  So what you do now, and this is no commitment on your part, you go to gazelle.com  and you get a quote for your old iPhone.  And you're locked in now, not just for 30 days.  They always lock you in for 30 days.  You're locked in that October 10th because they know it might be hard to get.  It might take you a while to get it.  It might take you a while to move your date over.  You may not be convinced. Whatever.  You've now got, well, actually October 10th is in much more than 30 days,  but they've been doing this for a couple of weeks.  That's going to give you some time.  And you'll get top dollar for your old iPhone.  Let's say you bought last year, you bought an iPhone 5S last year,  and now you're thinking, oh man, what did I do?  I want this new iPhone 6. Is it in good condition?  Yes, it's in good condition. Look at that.  $295 if you unlock it. They teach you how to unlock it.  If you don't want to take the trouble, $270 on an AT&T locked iPhone.  That's it. 5S. That's a great deal. That's a great deal.  Now here's the deal. You have till the 10th.  You don't have to commit. Just you're getting the quote.  I got the quote.  If you decide to commit, you press the button, you check out.  They'll send you a box, prepaid postage.  They'll turn it around fast.  If you forget to wipe the data, they will wipe it for you and then send you a check.  A PayPal credit or an Amazon gift card.  If you like Amazon, that's a great deal because they bump that up 5%.  And the beauty part of all of this is you can throw other things in this box.  By the time you're done, you've got thousands of dollars sitting in that gadget drawer  you have not capitalized on.  Don't just start with the iPhone, but don't stop.  They will buy old Surface computers, Apple Macs, MacBooks.  They'll buy Google Nexus stuff. They'll buy Samsung phones.  The Samsung tablets. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Cash is awaiting for your gadgets from Gazelle.  To date, they have sent out $170 million to over 1 million customers.  Lots of happy people with cash in their pockets.  Thanks to Gazelle.  Andrew K. Did any of you know Andrew K.? I didn't know Andrew K.  He created the K Pro computer, passed away this week at the age of 95.  I do remember the K Pro very well.  We all wanted one, but this is kind of a bit of computer history  because this was a CPM machine that came with WordStar for $1,700.95.  This was the competition for the Osborne one.

Yeah, yeah.  Kids today.  I think this is interesting. A lot of people tweeted me when this happened.  TwitPic is shutting down.  In the early days of Twitter, TwitPic was how you shared photos on Twitter.  You'd upload them to TwitPic, put a link in your tweet.  I never liked them much because I had that word twit in there kind of stepped on my brand.  But what am I going to do about it? There's nothing I can do about it.  A couple of years ago, Twitter trademarked the word tweet and invited all of the third party developers making stuff for Twitter,  not to use twit, but to use tweet. If they had called themselves twitPic, Twitter wouldn't have mined.  Apparently, a few weeks ago, Twitter contacted twitPic and said, you must abandon your trademark application.  They had applied for a trademark in 2009 for twitPic.  And if you don't, they're not going to sue them, but we're going to cut you off from the API, which basically puts them out of business.  If you can't post pictures on Twitter, well, there's no good.  Remember, Twitter has its own photo service now and really doesn't want people to use third party photo service.  So twitPic said, oh, screw it. And they're shutting down.

I mean, this sounds like when you own a trademark, you have to defend your trademark and you have to send letters that say do this or you will face some sort of action.

And like you said, I think this was like 2009 when they trademarked tweet and it became a capital word.  You know, they've been this has been right.  Ohm is exactly right. This is not just because Twitter was defending their trademark and they do the bogeyman of Twitter.  We have to shut down. This is a nice spin on some background machinations.

Transcript:  They they actually have usage guidelines on Twitter's website for how you can use Twitter's trademark safely and a recommendation to use tweets, not twit.  I always flatter myself that they did that to protect us, but probably not.  A number of people said it can if twitPic's been put out of business by Twitter, can twit be far behind?  I would like to reassure you the twitTWIT trademark predates Twitter.  In fact, we are older than Twitter, have been around longer, and we have our had our trademark for we had our trademark for a year before Twitter even existed.  So no, they're not going to they're not going to go after us.  And I and I think you're probably right. This was just convenient.  But why but why why be so vindictive?  Do you think that twitPic didn't like Twitter?  There's like one last chance to kick them before they die or what?

And yeah, yeah, I mean, that's that's clearly the main message here.  The other the other thing that comes to mind for me is, you know, how is Twitter making its money?  Is Twitter really valued, valued appropriately as a company?  Lots of people like to speculate on that.  And it's worth speculating on.  I mean, anybody I know who lives in San Francisco has just been driven out of the city because of the costs largely brought about by Twitter's headquarters being in the that that really you don't blame Google and Apple.

Transcript:  They're not the factor.  The factor is that there is a whole bunch of landlords who are putting their apartments on Airbnb, which is what is inflating a lot of the real estate prices that people are renting more through Airbnb.  And as a result of that, there is much fewer properties for sale.  And there is also been very little real estate development.  I think there is a lot of it's not an easy and simple problem.  It's a much more complex issue.  And to say that Google that Twitter is responsible for that is just kind of overreaching.  I think Twitter as a company, their valuation is actually much more more reasonable than most people realize compared to let's say something like Facebook.  You know, Facebook's recent growth has come from all the mobile advertising or the mobile installs, the app installs they've been selling to other applications, which is essentially, you know, all these VC backed startups which are out there pushing their apps.  They're giving money to Facebook.  I think if somebody needs to look into the revenues, you should look into the revenues of Facebook because they are, you know, they're not as great as they seem to be.  You know, Twitter is doing what it's supposed to do as a company which doesn't know how to grow its user base to make as much money as it can.  They have struggled in one thing, which is to grow its user base to make it valuable to people who are like we're not we're not hardcore, you know, internet nerds in many ways.  I think average people find Facebook more interesting and you know, Twitter is struggling to find those people and get them on their own platform.  I think that is the real Twitter problem.

As you know, the way Facebook's news feed works is very algorithmically controlled.  We actually talked a lot about it over the last couple of weeks.  Robert Scoble even showed me how to make my Facebook feed better because you don't see everything your friends share on Facebook.  You do currently on Twitter.  Your timeline of Twitter is composed entirely of everything tweeted by everybody you follow.  But the story was and I don't know if this has been confirmed by Twitter that Twitter was looking at ways to change that to make it more valuable by eliminating stupid tweets or something.

Transcript:  Or is that? Well, they did indicate that they will be using more machine learning to, you know, to to make adjustments to their feed.  And I don't know how to what extent they're going to do that.  I have no idea. Personally, I do think that we are all headed towards a future where, you know, you're going to have the machines making a lot of decisions on our behalf.  I think Twitter is probably part of that bigger trend.  I think Facebook is part of that bigger trend.  I mean, why do we assume that things won't change at all these companies?  I mean, they are essentially companies.  And just because they were cute and cuddly in their early days doesn't mean I want to be normally.

Transcript:  This story actually came out of Giga Ohm.  Twitter's CFO implied that the Facebook style, Matthew Ingham's writing, Facebook style filtered feed is coming, whether you like it or not.  And of course, a lot of Twitter users don't like the idea.  I mean, it feels like we should have a place for an unfiltered stream like Twitter.  And if you like the filter stream, go use Facebook.  I'm sorry. I stepped on you, Dan. What were you saying?

Transcript:  Right. Sometimes people ask me about how I use Twitter, like like parents or people who don't understand it.  And I like to say I kind of I kind of like roulette wheel it, you know, like it's all about what time of day I'm looking at my feed and how fast did I scroll my finger on my mobile device.  Like, I really don't have sometimes I have, you know, like my list that I follow and I'll look for specific things.  But most of the time, it really is like a roulette wheel. And I like that. It's a surprise.  It's like flipping through a magazine. So I have people that I follow. I follow a good number of people.  It's a whole bunch of different interests. And I like that, like randomness of it.  And Facebook, I find completely boring. Like, I hope to never again write a story about Facebook because it's just it's just a place where people talk, where people share pictures of their grandkids.  And I'm completely bored by it. And I have I felt bored with Facebook for like a year or two.  And I don't know. There comes a point where, you know, I understand that they are technology companies at heart in one way or another.  But I almost feel like we don't need to cover everything that's going on with Facebook.  And we don't need to have articles talking about is Facebook a trend anymore? Is Facebook dying? Like, who cares?

Transcript:  I think the next big trend, if it if it's not coming, it's already here is is exhaustion.  I mean, I think that you can the feed metaphor is fine.  It's established if it's not already over and people are kind of, you know, Pinterest interest two years ago was in their quick rise two years ago, showed that people are kind of into looking at things that look different.  But I think that if there is a big trend coming, it is just exhaustion. There's too much noise in the system that may be an opportunity for Twitter.  They may be able to say, look, we'll capture your interest graph and not the graph of your your social, you know, the all of the backdoor bragging that you have to do on Facebook.  But I think that people are just exhausted of social media.  And I think that there is just I think like the next big app is no app.

Transcript:  Wait, Dan, I want I want to call Dan out on something for a second.  So a couple of days ago, Dan posted on Google Plus that he had given up Gmail and that he had quit Facebook.  And then today, Dan, it's so funny, I got a Facebook friend request from Dan.

Start time: 4533.10
End time: 4587.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, the reason for that was I had a friend who like I mean, he posted a suicide note on Facebook.  So I came back to Facebook. I mean, there was a reason I came.  Oh, that's terrible.  I mean, Leo, like you, I constantly want to kill my Facebook with strangly.  But I had a friend who I thought was strangling himself.  So I can't like God is right.  This is he is OK.  But that is one thing that I have found Facebook useful for.  I think like you, Leo, and like a lot of people, I'm just exhausted with Facebook in that I don't want to brag.  I don't and I don't want to see other people bragging.  I just want to connect with people I love.  But it is one of those things where my God, when I had a moment of terror, I sure as hell didn't go to Twitter.  I mean, I went back to Facebook to make sure this guy was OK.  No, that's a great point.  No, no, of course. And in fact, I did go to Twitter and I found that he had long ago deleted his accounts.  Why? Because he didn't feel like he was making a personal connection with people.  And Facebook is where he did think he was making a personal connection with people.

Sorry to be a dick about that.  There is a.  I don't mean to shut the story down.  You guys kiss and make up. Well, yeah.  I'm just saying there was a reason for coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but part of my thought process when I approach the social web and social apps is learning the mechanics of how these things work,  just like a video game or any kind of game.  You have to learn the fundamental principles of the things that make these things sticky.  And part of me, I mean, we can look at Snowden's revelations last year and say, you know,  all of the conversations that we've had in the last year and a half or so about privacy.  I am somebody who loves PGP and I do make sure that I take encryption seriously.  But I also when I approach the social web, I really want to make sure that I'm not just that I'm dog fooding this.  The advice I give to people and saying, look, let's look at the mechanics here that make a Gmail almost more sticky than Facebook.  I mean, it's easier to leave Facebook than it is to leave Gmail.  And so I just wanted to see if there is a something that is robust.  I always use Google Apps, right? I don't use pure Gmail.  But I wanted to see if there's something, a product that is as robust in terms of my mail exchange, my mail servers,  and that could handle I mean, I literally have two hundred thousand email in here.  And I mean, I'm on every press release ever since.  So I wanted to see if there's something that can handle the high volume of email that I get,  but filter out the noise and let me see just the signal and could handle, you know, Google Apps is pretty robust.  I wanted to see if there's something that can handle that.  And I wanted to test my own stickiness to a Google product.  I mean, it might be holding to this thing that is Google as much as I am to the thing that is Facebook.  So it took a week, literally a week of IMAP ports.  But I ported everything over to fast mail and did the name server stuff there.  And it seems to be holding up pretty well.

Transcript:  Actually, I've been using fast mail for years.  I just renewed my fast mail account for five years.  But I still use you know, I use Gmail.  The only reason is spam filtering.  It's got the best spam filtering ever.  So I just pump my mail through Gmail.  I don't actually use Gmail.  I just I borrow the spam filtering.  I pump it through Gmail.  And then I yeah, it's great.  Right.  That's to me.  That's the only reason I use Gmail.  All right.

Transcript:  I think there is a more moderate way of doing these things.  I have taken a more you know, not as drastic an approach as Dan.  But what I have done is I've removed both Twitter and Facebook from my iPhone and from my mobile devices.  That's what I did to call.  And I use them twice or thrice a day for Twitter and twice a day for Facebook on my desktop.  That's a good idea.  So if I'm not at home and I'm moving about, I am not looking into the phone every five minutes to see what the hell is going on.  We're sharing their cat videos or whatever.  I mean, and the other thing which I did on my Facebook is I started unfriending people who kept putting up their cat pictures and and their baby pictures.  It's like I'm not interested.  So that was a very drastic move on my part.  But I just think those were the two things which irritated me most about Facebook was cat pictures and and pictures of their babies.

It is a triangulation episode where he attempted to show me how to cultivate my Facebook feed to make it better.  A lot of it was exactly that.  Oh, I'm just getting getting rid of people that don't give you content you want.  And it's gotten better, but it's still not anything I want.

Transcript:  But, Jill, when you saw baby pictures, when you met people, you went to their house, you're meeting them for coffee.  It was in real life. So it was essentially one set of pictures, maybe a day.  This is like 500 pictures in a day is just a bit too much.

Start time: 4894.20
End time: 4942.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, that's what you get if you meet somebody face to face now and they show you on their phone,  you know, the pictures that their dog or their kids or whatever.  And I don't unfriend these people.  Like I don't use Facebook very often, but my sister and her kids, you know,  like that's the main place where my sister posts photos of her kids.  And I have to check in on that every now and again, because I'm a good aunt and that's what we do.  Right. So like this is my selfless act of using Facebook as I go in and I check in on the baby pictures.  You're doing your duty.  No, I think that's more like a socially responsible way to stay in touch with people, right?  Like to show that I'm using these applications even if I'm not deeply engaged in them.  Like I'm still using them. I'm still participating.  It may be very lightweight, but I'm at least presenting that appearance that I'm there and I participate.

So that's been really interesting.  Digging into it from a different side and interviewing a lot of doctors and people in the health care industry and trying to see, you know,  what do we see happening in this first generation of fitness and health trackers?  But where is that going to lead in 10, 15, 20 years? Transhumanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're no longer going to be in our bodies. We will be in space in the galaxy.  Actually, one of our viewers just sent me an FDA document about the rules for health trackers.  And those have been changed a little bit, probably to accommodate this new wave of health trackers. Is that right?

Start time: 5124.32
End time: 5292.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From what I understand, there's a very clear line about something being FDA approved and something that does not need to be FDA approved.  And that's does it make a diagnosis?  So if it makes a diagnosis, you have to have FDA approval and you have to have some kind of usually some kind of oversight with your doctor.  So you can't just use these devices on your own generally when they are FDA approved.  If something is not making a diagnosis, then it doesn't have to be.  One of the blurriest lines is with sleep trackers.  Well, I shouldn't say it's a blurry line because the people who make the devices know exactly where the line is and they never cross it.  But something as common as sleep apnea is considered a disease.  So if you have a sleep tracker, you cannot with it diagnose someone as having sleep apnea.  You have to say, here's the data that you've collected.  You should look at it, decide for yourself what it means.  So that's that's the very fine line that fitness trackers try not to cross because if they do, they have to go through this long approval process.  One of the most interesting products I've been following that is pending FDA approval is called Scanadu Scout.  So this has been in the news for the last year and a half or so.  People like to call it the Tri-Quarter.  So if you're a Star Trek fan, it's a handheld device.  I have actually tried it on myself.  So it's a little disk and it has it takes a number of your vital signs.  So your heart rate, your EKG reading, temperature and a few other things.  So you hold it up to your forehead.  And while you're making that other connection with your finger, it's completing that circuit to take the EKG.  And the idea is it's giving you an overall picture of your health because it's taking so many different data streams.  So one of the criticisms of modern day trackers is they usually have only one or two things that they monitor, whereas Scanadu is collecting.  I don't know. It's about five or six different data points.  And the guy who made it is actually this really interesting inventor.  He developed it. I believe if I remember correctly, he has a story about his son getting sick and they go to the doctor.  They go to the hospital. They're collecting all this information in the hospital.  Nurses are coming in and taking his vital signs every so often.  He's hooked up to machines and this guy, Walter DeBrauer is his name, was just like, this is crazy.  This is my kid. I should be able to have this information.  I should be able to see this data myself. We should own this stuff.  So he's a really interesting guy because he's a proponent that the FDA shouldn't be as strict and that we should be allowed to have more devices that collect information about ourselves because it's our body.  It's our data. We should be allowed to have that.  So that's one device. I'm just like on the edge of my seat waiting for this thing to be approved, but it could take years.

Start time: 5294.56
End time: 5339.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so this document is kind of interesting. It is non-binding, but it says the intent of the FDA to no longer require pre-market notification requirements for some medical devices because they're well understood and do not present risks.  And if you look through the FDA database, current database of devices that have been submitted to approval for the FDA, Apple has nothing in there.  Remember, Apple did meet with the FDA and I imagine that part of the meeting was to say, well, how much do we have to get approval for?  And it feels like the FDA has decided that at least when it comes to these Apple devices, either it's going to be third parties applying for approval or Apple may not even need to apply for approval.

Everybody else is going to handle the devices.  Some of them are even going to handle different software and apps.  We're just going to be the platform where everything comes in.  I wonder if that was kind of the direction of the conversation.  But, you know, it's Apple. They have meetings with everybody.

You know, got a jacket too.  Yeah, you'll be all dressed up. It'll be great.  Our show today. We have a final few final words in a second.  I showed today brought to you by our good friends at stamps.com.  Anybody who does a lot of mailing ought to know about stamps.com.  It happens to me. It just happened again the other day.  People send me stuff for review to look at postage due.  And I was like, you're expected to pay a dollar forty nine to me.  The post office says, if you want to see what's in this package, that's crazy.  That's not a good way to introduce yourself to somebody.  If you send stuff out via mail and you're not using stamps.com,  you're not looking as professional as you could.  Stamps.com, let's first of all, eliminates the trip to the post office.  Let's you print your own postage with your computer, your printer,  you know, your postage meter, a special link or anything.  They have a great USB scale that would eliminate the postage due problem  because it automatically prints exactly the right amount of postage.  So you'd put neither too little nor,  I think a lot of people do this, too much.  Before I got stamps.com, I was always putting a couple extra stamps on there, just in case.  That's a waste of money.  Stamps.com also looks more pro because it can go right on your envelope.  You put it right to the envelope with your company's logo,  the postage of course, the recipient's address and your address, all pre-filled.  It will read the information from eBay, Amazon, Etsy,  so you don't have to enter anything in, all of the sites.  It will automatically fill out customs forms if you're mailing internationally.  And you get discounts you can't get at the post office at stamps.com  on Priority Mail, on insurance.  It's all automatic. It's all simple to use.  And we have got a really good trial offer for you.  If you visit stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner  and use our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T, for an offer.  I don't think they even offer this on the front page anymore.  This is a great deal. $55 in free postage.  You get a free digital scale. You get a $5 supply kit.  And of course, a four-week trial of stamps.com.  Stamps.com, give it a try today.  Absolutely the best way to start sending your letters and packages.  Over two billion letters and packages were sent this year via stamps.com.  Apple is going to live stream the event, by the way.  And if you go to apple.com slash live, you get the countdown clock.  They're really treating this like a big deal.  So I'm glad they're streaming it.  A little word, you have to use an Apple device to watch it.  You cannot stream it on a Windows PC.  Oh, don't you love Apple?  Live streaming video requires Safari on OS X or on Apple TV.  I presume you could do it on an iPad as well.  So can we find a chat on Apple TV so we can watch?  You don't have an Apple?  I think we have an Apple TV.  I think we already have one.
