Yeah.  When we had Seamus, they had two nurses, one for Sarah and one for Seamus.  And they had this really amazing system going where 29 minutes after Nurse A woke up Sarah  and Seamus to take Seamus' vital, Nurse B would show up and wake up Sarah and Seamus  to take Sarah's vital.  So they had it really work so that everybody got woken up every 30 minutes.

Transcript:  And he will learn the wrath of Norton.  What was the year that you got married?  So it wasn't Twitter.  I think, you know what it was?  I mo-blogged with them.  I put them on my mo-blog.  Whatever happened to mo-blogging?  That.  That's what happened to mo-blogging.  Also with me from CNET and the Editor's Roundtable, Mr. Rafe Needleman, good to have you.  Good to be here.  You were at that sad day this week, the last Buzz Out Loud.  Oh yeah.  It was weepy.  It was weepy.  Tom was there and...  Jason was there.  Jason was there, of course, as was Veronica and Molly.

End time: 256.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was very emotional.  That was 1,588 episodes.  Wow.  I know.  We've got a long way to go before we catch up.  Well, let's start now.  Yeah.  We are.

Start time: 265.16
End time: 268.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CNET kind of backed off the live stuff, but they're still doing plenty of...  We're doing a ton of shows.

Start time: 269.16
End time: 277.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm doing Reporters Roundtable, which I'm on episode 115 or something, is a weekly show.  And that was live, but now it's going to be recorded.

Start time: 278.42
End time: 291.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we've discovered this.  I put a bet on live because I want people to watch live.  I think people will watch live.  But it's expensive and it's not necessary.  It depends.  Because most of our...  Almost all of our views are downloads.  I mean...

Start time: 292.60
End time: 318.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the flexibility of doing a recorded show because I can get guests whenever they're available.  Right.  Yeah, we have to have you here at 3 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon.  But I'm going to miss being...  Have the chat room.  Even no matter how big or small it is...  That's what I like.  The live studio audience...  I agree with you.  Makes all the difference in the pace of the show.  So I'm going to miss that.  I think that's the real argument for doing live is the interactivity.  Yeah, it makes the show...  It's just a different show.  Right.

Start time: 319.00
End time: 336.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is much more complicated and costly.  And really it's a small number of people that watch live.  We have, I don't know, how many thousand, maybe a couple of 3,000 right now watching.  We'll get to maybe five or six before the end of the show.  It's just not a big number compared to the overall downloads.  Right.  But did you, did Tekzilla, you were streaming live off and on?

Start time: 337.30
End time: 361.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did it once in a while.  It was DLTV we did live, but it was kind of funny because there was always like, you should do it live.  And it's like, well, we always do it live.  We do it to a TriCaster and we have to do it in one take because we can't edit it before we post it out.  Right.  But it was so funny because I remember explaining to people, especially from the magazine side, it's like, okay, we got 5,000 people watching live.  We're going to get 500 to 2,500 downloads for every person watching live.  Right, exactly.

Start time: 362.00
End time: 376.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a small number.  I just, I like it because I just, I like to have that, you know, you know me, I like live TV.  Yeah.  Because there's a certain energy.  I also like it that you can't force us to do a second take because it's done.  And I don't want to do another take.

Start time: 376.00
End time: 388.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's also the whole like, things go sideways, they go unbelievably sideways.  Right.  Like I remember explaining to people, what happens when you make a mistake at work?  Well, they clean it up.  See, when I make a mistake at work and it's live, I've shared it with thousands or hundreds of thousands of people.

Start time: 389.00
End time: 417.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who can forget that time that you opened up a hard drive and took a hammer to what turned out to be glass platters inside.  Nobody do that.  Right.  And it's lucky that I didn't lose an eye, but I didn't.  Next time I'm going to wear eye glasses.  We got much better about wearing eye protection.  Also with us, IAAS Actar, who is one of our hosts on TNT.  And IAAS and I are going to be launching a new show a couple of weeks from now.  Patrick, don't feel bad, but IAAS is going to play the role of Patrick Norton.

Start time: 418.06
End time: 427.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm working on that.  I'm not going to be using a sledgehammer.  I'm going to be using a spudger because everything's all sealed in there.  It's all about spudging.  And a heat gun to make sure I can unglue everything.

Start time: 427.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you going to be doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to do a how-to show, kind of like you and me, where he's going to break glass in my eyes, things like that.  It'll be fun.  That's why everybody have eyewear.  So it's helpful.  One of the things that, one of the reasons I built the studio is I really wanted to have the space.  And you know, you guys on Twitch, every time you're in studio with Ryan Shroud, it turns into the screensavers.  Where it's that real kind of here's how it works.  Here's look inside this box.

Transcript:  So we want to do a help and how to show.  And IAAS has been pitching it for a while.  And so we're going to launch that.  I won't say the name until we reserve the domain.  OK, Doug.  Let's hold off on that.  I've learned my lesson.  I'm excited.  I think it's going to be a lot of fun.  Let's see.  Lots to talk about this week.  It is Easter Sunday as we record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There already was.  In theme parks, wasn't there?  No, no.  I think that.  No, I like a feature film.  Yeah.  That there already was.  Rio was based on.  Rio is not Angry Birds.  They made an Angry Birds Rio, but there's going to be an actual Angry Birds the movie.  Oh, is that the Hitchcock one?  How far can they push this?  Wouldn't that be good?  With Tippy Hendren?  That would be good.  James Cameron directing.

Start time: 553.08

I'm looking forward to that.  All right.  Enough of that.  Let's get to the news.  The top story.  Nokia and Microsoft introduce brand new Lumia 900 in stores today.  The stores are closed.  Are closed.  What the heck were they thinking?

Start time: 670.22
End time: 672.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  My friend Paul Thoretto, who does our Windows Weekly Show, tweets, that's it.  I give up.  He's so frustrated.  What the heck?  No lines.  You know opportunity for lines.  I love this phone.  Really?  Yeah.  Have you played with it?  It's a nice phone.  Oh, it's beautiful.  It's a nice interface.  It feels good.  It's a 4.3 inch OLED screen.  It's a gorgeous screen.  You're about to explode, right?

Start time: 696.00
End time: 716.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you like it?  No, I'm about to melt.  I haven't actually, fair disclosure, I haven't actually tried this particular phone, but  I have another Windows phone.  Well, you don't like the OS, is what you're saying.  I don't like, it's not true.  I think the OS is really beautiful and different, which is great.  It's just without the apps, it's impossible to get excited about it.  85,000 apps.

Start time: 718.01
End time: 729.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's plenty of apps.  There's no Pandora.  There's no Instagram.  There's Angry Birds, but only one Angry Birds.  I mean, there's apps, there's Evernote.  There's a lot of the apps.

Start time: 729.36
End time: 730.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is Evernote, which makes it okay.

Start time: 731.38
End time: 736.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in better shape than Android was when it launched compared to iPhone.  Where iPhone was when Android started picking up some games.

Start time: 737.00
End time: 741.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but when Android launched, there was no Android.  So these guys are kind of-

Start time: 741.24
End time: 795.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been around for a little longer than, yeah.  I think what David Polk said I thought was fairly interesting.  He actually did a good review in which he talks about,  he says it's two underdogs produce, is it in time?  But he talks about the big complaint, which is the app complaint,  and lists the apps that he uses on his iPhone,  of course he's an iPhone user, that are there and the apps that aren't there.  So he says many of the essentials are there.  Netflix, IMDB, Flickster, Yelp, OpenTable,  check-in apps from Delta and American Airlines, Groupon, Foursquare, Kindle,  Spotify, Twitter, Facebook.  But then he says the only bank is Bank of America.  No American Express, no HSBC, no Capital One, no Chase, no Citibank,  no Words with Friends.  So it is a hit and miss thing.  I think that this phone is spectacular.  I think it's very nicely made, it's got a great camera, it feels good.

Start time: 796.00
End time: 804.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You think the phone is really good?  Nokia didn't bother to put in anything fancy.  It's the same old hardware in another body in a big plastic shape.

Start time: 804.14
End time: 820.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think blame Microsoft on that.  You know why?  Because Microsoft is, and they're responding to the fragmentation in the Android market,  they have very specific standards.  There is no dual core Windows phone.  The screen resolution is what, 800 by 940?  It's not because it's a Windows phone and Microsoft's controlled this.

Start time: 820.04
End time: 825.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nokia doesn't need fancy, Nokia needs a product that's actually bought by a bunch of people at this point.  And so does Microsoft.

Start time: 826.00
End time: 837.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what drove me nuts is that this is their flagship phone, this is their premium brand one,  and it's only 99 bucks.  It's affordable?  It's affordable, but if this is your top of the line thing,  maybe it should look like it's in line with the other stuff.  Kind of anchor the price and then go to 800 is the $99.

Start time: 838.24
End time: 851.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point, Nokia doesn't want us.  They don't want somebody who's the worst person for them.  Who do they want is the question.  They don't want you because you buy a phone every six months.  Although they would like to have you.  No, I should buy a Nokia phone every six months.  What they want is like a whole slew of people to go out and start buying their phones.

Start time: 851.48
End time: 861.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing the Google strategy.  They want dozens of manufacturers, 100,000s of apps, sold on all the carriers everywhere.  And that's a strategy that has worked for Android and they want to do it without the fragmentation.

Start time: 862.00
End time: 864.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is the market for a Windows phone?  Everybody.

Start time: 865.02
End time: 867.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Everybody who's not going to spend $400 on an iPhone.

Start time: 868.08
End time: 882.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think anybody who's ever used an iPhone is the market.  In fact, Walt Mossberg made that point, which is if you're used to doing it the iPhone way,  Android is fairly similar.  The Windows operating system is so different that you will be at sea immediately.

Start time: 882.72
End time: 896.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Android can be a very frustrating, I mean, I like Android.  Android can be a very frustrating experience.  Fragmentation, UI inconsistencies.  So they might get some Android people who are frustrated with the Android ecosystem.  They might get people who would otherwise go to Android.

Start time: 896.16
End time: 902.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're never going to get an iPhone user.  I think it's mostly Android people who have not purchased a smartphone yet.  Yes. Which is still a lot of people.

Start time: 903.38
End time: 929.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android and iOS have basically destroyed the rim market.  They've taken out, smartphones are 50% of the phones sold in America right now.  That means 50% of the people buying phones right now are still buying traditional cell phones.  That means there's a huge number of people who don't want to spend $400.  They don't want to spend $300.  $100, they know Windows, hey, why don't I try it?  That looks really cool.

Start time: 929.00
End time: 954.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is really going to take off when Windows 8 finally hits.  And you see all the tiles everywhere.  When you go, oh, this looks familiar, I already know this.  It's almost as if Microsoft's got this reversed.  They have to teach with the phone first and then go with the operating system.  When the operating system hits, and I think it was late this year,  then people will go, oh, this looks really familiar.  I get this, and I think that's when it's got a better chance.  But right now, it's just kind of like floundering while we're waiting around.  I don't think it's floundering.

Start time: 955.57
End time: 972.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what's going to happen is it's going to hit at $100.  By Christmas, this is going to be like $50 or $25 or a gimme on the sign up for the cell phone service.  And then they're going to have another phone that's going to come out that's going to step it up.  Or they're not going to care.  They want volume at this point.  Nokia is used to huge, massive volume, and that's really what they care about.

Start time: 973.06
End time: 981.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything I said bad about Windows Phone, at $50, I take it all back.  Well, it's $50 at Walmart right now.  That's an amazing deal.

Start time: 981.12
End time: 1015.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Walmart audience, isn't it?  It's somebody who might wander in who has a Nokia candy bar phone, and you still see them everywhere.  My mom.  Who might say, gee, I'd really like to say use Twitter.  Twitter is really starting to appeal to a very mass audience.  I'd like to use Twitter.  Can't do it on the candy bar phone.  Oh, I could do it on this phone.  It's $50.  Maybe I'll do that.  What they don't see, though, is this data, this sudden jump in their monthly bill because they're now going to be paying for a data plan.  It's another $30.  And I think people are sensitive to that.  I would guess that most people who don't have a smartphone don't have a smartphone because they don't want to pay for the data plan, not because they don't want to pay for the phone.

Transcript:  See, again, this is Microsoft's chosen partner, right?  They could have done something different.  They could say, future-proof this phone.  Yeah, right now, we can only take advantage of that one core, but in one year or less than a year when we come out with Windows Phone 8, this phone will still be relevant.  Because this is not going to be relevant when Windows Phone 8 comes out.  This thing is going to be deprecated entirely.  It's going to get in the hands of people at that price.  But at what cost in your future?  I mean, the thing is, this is not a future-proof phone.  This is good for right now.  No phone is future-proof.  Well, isn't that a bit of a problem?  I'm only on my third iPhone in four years.  Well, isn't that a bit of a problem?  How many phones did you buy in the last week?  I'm at one, though.  That's the thing.  I don't buy phones very often.

And updating people's phones is actually a very good thing to do for the telcos because they get more data use.  They get more use overall.  The apps guys get to sell more apps.  So why we're still on a two-year cycle in this country is just nutso.

Transcript:  Well, and I had thought that Microsoft was really making an effort to change the way cell phone companies work.  You know, one of the problems is holding back Windows Phone is that AT&T just wasn't recommending it.  If you go into an AT&T store, they'd sell you an iPhone much more likely to sell you an iPhone than they even mention the Windows Phone.  And I heard from lots of people who went in to say, I want to buy a Windows Phone.  They said, no, no, no, no, no, you don't.  You want to buy an iPhone.  Or, you know, or maybe an Android phone, but you definitely don't want a Windows Phone.  Microsoft's trying to change that.  They're giving big payouts to employees.  They're giving phones to employees.  They're doing all they're pulling the strings.  And then AT&T says, and by the way, day one, Easter Sunday, when no stores are open, no lines guaranteed because nobody's open.  And it just shows that you could try all you want.  These cell phone companies have 10 years.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They hate you all more than you know.  They hate us all.  I'll agree on.  I want to take a break.  When we come back, I want to talk about the hottest fashion accessory.  We'll all be wearing these sometime next year.  Are you excited about Google Glasses?

But first, a word from our friends at Citrix and go to meeting.  Do you work in a company?  Are all the employees in the same building?  Rarely, right?  Nowadays, we've got colleagues, clients all over the world.  It's almost impossible to have a meeting unless you use an online meeting service.  Go to meeting is the best.  Share screen, yes, but even better.  Video, HD faces.  This is something new in Go to meeting, and it's just fantastic.  If you visit gotomeeting.com, you can actually see it in action.  The HD faces works with the camera in your computer or, this is new, in the iPad.  You can actually attend a meeting from the iPad using the iPad camera, the iPad headphones,  the iPad microphone, and you can join this meeting.  People will see you.  I got to tell you, seeing your clients and colleagues is so important.  We're attuned to seeing facial expressions.  We're attuned to body language.  Those things mean so much.  When you're pitching somebody to frown or fold their arms or smile, it means everything.  So Go to meeting is really kind of exciting.  It's a very cool way to make those meetings come to life.  I want you to try it free for 30 days, including the HD faces.  Just go to the website, gotomeeting.com.  Click this orange Try it Free button.  The offer code is TWIT.  When you sign up, you'll get 30 days free.  By the way, the iPad app is free.  You don't have to pay extra for that.  So it's all part of it.  Go to meeting.com, try it free button, that orange button, and use the offer code TWIT for 30 days free.  Really the best way to meet.  Now that it's got iPad, you could be meeting anywhere.  You could be in the John, frankly.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Don't flush, anyway.  Because that's rude.  So how long before Go to Meetings on Google Glasses?  You've seen all the parodies of Google Glasses videos, have you?  Have you seen the original video, the Google Glasses video?  It's gorgeous.  Yeah, it's totally bogus, right?  Except that it was in the New York Times, which gives it some credibility.

He has written a nice little email to the investors, his 2012 update.  It has been a very mixed year for Google.  And I don't know if we can give Larry an A plus in his tenure as CEO.  This is the year Google launched Google Plus, killed a lot of kind of moribund projects.  But it's also the year it got a lot of black marks for breaking iOS's privacy, for the Kenya thing.

Apple very noticeably in their iPhoto app used OpenStreetMaps with their own dressing.  And now Wikipedia has announced they're going to start using OpenStreetMap, the open source for it.  They should have used it all along instead of Google Maps.

So Google started charging in March between $4 and $10 per additional thousand loads to  any site loading more than 25,000 maps a day, which is probably a lot of sites.  And of course, Wikipedia decided, well, we shouldn't have to pay for that.  But I frankly think it's a really good thing because after all, it's the Wikipedia of mapping.  Yeah, it makes perfect sense for that.  A lot of apps are starting to, even on iPhone, are starting to use OpenStreetMaps.  I think it's a great thing.

Transcript:  I think there will come a time sooner than later that the iPhone has no Google on it at all.  I think that's their goal, right?  Although another interesting story, Larry Page, the day before his anniversary, gave an interview to Business Week magazine.  And one of the things he said is, oh, the Apple thing, it's all theater.  Apple doesn't really hate us.  It's designed to rally the troops.  Don't look in your notes.  I'm making this up as I go along.  Now, Larry, if you go to Larry Page, Business Week, you can see the interview.  Larry does not give a lot of interviews.  I have a feeling this is one of the things his advisor said.  You got to talk.  So the April 3rd, the day before his one-year anniversary, gave the interview.  And he says basically, in fact, it's in the second page.  It's right at the bottom or the last page here.  Brad Stone, formerly of the New York Times, now at Business Week, asked the right question.  He says that he asked him, did you go to talk to Stephen Jobs for advice?  According to Steve Jobs' biography, when you became CEO, you went to Jobs for advice.  I know you had your differences at the end around Android, but what did you take from him as a mentor and a friend?  Larry kind of offhandedly says, well, I think the Android differences were actually for show.  He talks about his relationship with Steve.  And then Brad says, wait, the fury around Android was for show?  Yeah, I think that served their interests.  For a lot of companies, it's useful to them to feel like they have an obvious competitor and to rally around that.  I personally believe it's better to shoot higher.  You don't want to be looking at your competitors.  You want to be looking at what's possible and how to make the world better.  Yeah, like Google's not looking at Facebook.  Right. Hello, Google+.  Oh, no, we didn't think about Facebook.  So do you think that's credible?  Because Steve Jobs basically said, I will spend every penny in our considerable coffers and I will work to my dying day to destroy Android.

But I mean, I could see it being both ways.  I mean, Jobs would go every which way in personality.  He'd pull every lever he could.  Yeah, I mean, even with iOS team fighting the Mac OS team happens right now, let alone with the original development of the Mac.  He's like, I'm going to split you guys up and I'm going to make you fight each other.  It'd be easy to go those guys fight those guys and also still go.

On the other hand, when he's saying to Walter Isaacson, literally on his deathbed, I will spend every dollar I have to kill Android.  That sounds real.

I mean, the Android strategy is to get it out to everyone.  The Apple strategy is to control the market and have the total world's market.  Control the experience.  And the experience.

You've got Facebook, you've got Facebook, Twitter, check, you have these check marks.  Like, close enough.  Angry Birds got it.

Transcript:  It looks like Tom brought a gun to a knife fight or something.  What happened there?  If you saw, first of all, this is for video only.  If you watched the show last week, you know what was going on.  If you're watching video.  If you're on audio, what are you talking about?  This show brought to you today by Carbonite.com, automatic backup.  I was just pricing some of the other guys who do cloud storage.  Pretty typical, couple hundred bucks a year for cloud storage.  Carbonite does backup and gives you cloud storage.  59 bucks a year.  That's less than five bucks a month.  And it's not for 50 gigabytes or 100 gigabytes.  It's for whatever's on your internal hard drive.  59 dollars a year.  Carbonite is backup done right.  Anytime you're online, you're automatically, continuously backing up to the Internet.  So your data is always safe.  You can access it even before disaster happens.  From any computer you log on to your Carbonite account or you use,  they have a smartphone apps, they have tablet apps.  And there's your stuff.  So it's cloud storage plus backup.  And if disaster, what am I saying if?  When disaster happens, you just go to your Carbonite account.  You log in, you restore it all just like that.  You're always safe.  I can't, if you've not been backing up, you've got to do it.  And Carbonite is the way to do it right.  Go to Carbonite.com.  They've got the 59 dollar plan is for your internal drive.  If you have multiple drives or external drives or multiple computers,  they have plans for that to just look at the different plans.  Use our offer code TWIT to sign up for two weeks free, no credit card needed.  Just TWIT.  That's it.  And then if you decide to buy, use TWIT again, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.  One of the features I know you smart people are interested in Carbonite does support.  Encryption, you keep the keys.  They have no access to your data.  So absolutely private, strong encryption along with everything else.  You got to try it.  Carbonite.com.  Offer code TWIT.  Don't come whining to me if you lose your data.  I told you Carbonite.  I get calls every week on the radio show if somebody says I lost everything.  A woman called me.  She said, I got a new computer.  I gave my old computer to a friend.  He said he'd backup all my data and give it to me.  And he didn't.  And I said, and you didn't have a copy?  No.  OK.  She says, it's been eight months.  Is there anything I can do?  I said, no.  What are you talking about?  Of course not.  You're nuts.  But then she said, I had a massive database with 360 records.

Transcript:  Ooh.  In the year of big data, 360 records is not exactly massive.  So, Macintosh, this is the end of innocence.  I've proclaimed it before, but it really is now.  According to most of the security experts, Dr. Webb, which is a Russian security site,  if that's not an oxymoron, I don't know what is.  Dr. Webb has now detected over 600,000 Macs infected with flashback.  57% in the US, many of the rest in Canada.  This was originally a Trojan horse that started last fall with a fake flash installer.  But it's been morphing like crazy.  And the latest version uses a hole in Java.  A hole that was fixed by Oracle, which of course I remember bought Sun and isn't responsible for Java.  In February, Apple didn't fix it till Wednesday.  But they finally fixed it.  If you have a Mac, you should probably run your update and get the latest Java.  And meanwhile, if you go to F-Secure's website,  they have a couple of terminal commands that will tell you whether you've been infected or not.

End time: 2806.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easy enough to do.  I'll tell you why.  And there are.  Dr. Webb has a program, the number of people who have written Apple scripts and stuff.  The problem is, it's really risky.  I feel like Apple users are going to be more vulnerable to this because they're innocent,  wandering in this terrible landscape that Windows users have been suffering battles, scars.  And the problem is, Windows users, no, you don't download a fix from a source that says,  oh yeah, you got the Trojan?  Well, I got some initial fiction for you.  And you run the program and the Trojan is still there and you got some more.  So it's always a little nerve-racking to run a script.  It's two terminal commands.  It's very straightforward.  Yes, there are scripts out there.  Dr. Webb has one.  If you trust a Russian security site.

Transcript:  They should know how to fix them.  Exactly.  Exactly.  They're virus virgins, says Wallfly in our chat room.  Very true.  You virus virgins.  It's kind of scary.  But this kind of also answers the question that has been going around for a long time.  Are there no viruses on the Mac because it's inherently more secure or because nobody cares  about the Mac?  I mean, it's not inherently more secure.  I think we can acknowledge that, right?

Start time: 2836.46
End time: 2842.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point, I think at this point it would be enormously difficult to prove that one  is more secure than the other.  I think Windows is working a lot harder at it.

Start time: 2843.00
End time: 2853.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what happened.  They have to.  I think that the virus authors said, well, I'm not going to spend any effort on a 5%  platform like Macintosh.  But it's such a rich ground.  Such fertile territory.

Start time: 2853.90
End time: 2863.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is what's happening.  It is very fertile.  It might only be 5% of the market.  Well, that's the problem.  But these 5% of the users, how many of them are running the antivirus apps?  None of them.

Start time: 2864.68
End time: 2872.68

Start time: 2979.84
End time: 2993.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you don't... if you aren't secure on your website, and I know about this because ours  have been attacked, people can get in and they put stuff on there.  So you go to a reputable site.  D-Link didn't intentionally put any virus on there.  But because their site was hackable, somebody was able to do that.

Start time: 2993.50
End time: 3014.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the kind of thing though.  for my D-Link router.  You're like, oh, I clicked the wrong thing and now I'm redirected because this was working  off of Java.  And you didn't have to do a whole lot to even get infected with this.  But I believe the botnet was taken over by authorities anyway.  So even if you were infected...  It's pretty safe.  Yeah.  So it's a lucky break, but if you were thinking you're in this Mac bubble and you're safe,  you're not.

Start time: 3014.54
End time: 3022.17

End time: 3087.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Greener passwords.  Yeah.  Little Snitch was the one it was looking for.  Now, Little Snitch is kind of interesting because it's not a traditional antivirus.  All it does is let you know if some program or process on your computer is trying to contact  the outside world.  And of course, modern viruses, they have to do that.  That's how they get their commands.  They join a botnet.  And so Little Snitch would be very effective, not preventing the infection.  You'd get the infection, but you'd get a warning.  So as soon as it saw Little Snitch, flashbacks said, never mind.  And somebody my own size.  So that, yeah.  And that just shows you how it probably is a good idea to have a little something, something.  Little Snitch is a good program, but there are antivirus programs.  And T-Go has been around for a long time.  We have an advertiser, ESET, that makes a very good one.  You used that for 32 on Windows, right?  You've used it.  Back in the day.  Yeah.  And they have one for the Mac.  Facebook ID threat, according to somebody on CNET, threatens all iPhones and Dropbox.  So this is nice.  This is a Dropbox vulnerability.

Are exposing your login, the apps are exposing your login.  They're not supposed to, but there's a flaw and they do.  And is this something that...  So Facebook itself is secure, but if you sign on to like, what's that game, Draw Something,  then that using Facebook sign on there will expose, people can then get your Facebook  credentials from that sign on.

End time: 3207.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say in modern mobile operating systems, iOS is really a big culprit because Twitter  is everywhere.  Twitter authentication just kind of persists throughout the whole phone.  For instance, a new app, I installed a new app on my iOS and it says, can I access Twitter?  And I say yes, it doesn't have to ask me for anything because the iOS is already authenticated  for Twitter.  iOS authenticates it and says yeah, yeah, take his Twitter credentials.  Enjoy.  That makes me very nervous.  And that one has access to Twitter.

Start time: 3207.32
End time: 3213.74

On a mobile platform, you don't want to be entering passwords every time you use an application.  So the idea of connect through Facebook and connect through Twitter is great.

Transcript:  Wall Street Journal, which we've talked about on this show before, really seems to be making  a lot of hay, accusing others of failing us in privacy.  I mean, they did the whole thing on cookies.  Now they're talking about Facebook applications and how they might leak your data.  And yet they looked at 100 Facebook applications and found no problem with any of them and  still went ahead with the story yesterday about how it could happen.  And it just seems like there is also a certain amount of hysteria going on around this as  well.  And there's a lot of pressure on any publication that wants to generate clicks to say, oh,  you're in trouble.  Oh, it could be bad.

And that's so true online.  Right.  Especially with Facebook and people sharing things that you say and putting it out there.  What you put out there cannot be retrieved.

They're like, oh, I'm supposed to be paying attention to this.  So we get these incredible sensationalistic headlines or like, oh, your apps are putting  out all this data about you.  And we knew this for a long, we just kind of like, yeah, duh.  We just have to go into the settings and do this and the other thing.

It would be so easy for a company or an application that is getting data from Facebook or Google  or your ISP or whatever to do such stuff that is so horribly awful that there would be a  giant outcry.  But most of the companies that get this data are so subtle with what they use it for and  how they let you know or don't let you know that they have it that people are like, yeah,  I guess I'm technically concerned about privacy, but I haven't really been affected.  So you know, whatever, I'll keep putting my kegger pictures on Facebook.  What would it be to be affected?  Well, what would that look like?  Money, money, losing money, not being able to buy a house because your credit rating  has been damaged somehow that you have no idea.

They filed lawsuit against companies that create tools to automate posting to people  on spam on Twitter.  That's what would presumably that's where I would have gotten flooded is just automated.  Oh, he said iPad.  So they named five defendants, tweet attacks, tweet adder, tweet buddy, and then two people,  which Twitter says are the biggest defenders in the spamming racket, arguing they're the  arms dealers to those who fill the surface with fake profiles.  Well, that makes sense.  Go after the guys who provide the tools and you know, you shut down the tools, you might  shut down the spammers.  So this is good.

I can't use it because I could get sued.  We'll talk about that.  Well, we've got Australians in the audience.  So we're going to talk about how the Australian government invented Wi Fi.  Isn't that isn't that cool?  Thank you.  Or not.  Or not.  And the latest on mega upload.  They're pissed.  The mega upload to Kim dot com is mad.  Not in English.  And he's and he's going to take a step.  Let's before we do that, talk about what to do if you want a new iPhone, a new iPad.  How many of us have a gadget closets or drawers or in Patrick's case, entire rooms filled

Transcript:  So gazelle dot com go there right now.  get those gadgets moving so you can get the new gadgets that you want.  Visit gazelle dot com.  Now I have to say one thing that they've done is they've they've reduced the range of products  to basically the stuff that most of us have the Apple stuff, Blackberry's, lots of people  with Blackberry's, and rides from the big manufacturers and Nokia.  So they've really kind of narrowed it down.  That actually makes it a lot easier because if you have an iPad, for instance, you just  click iPad, click get an offer.  And then you've got a whole menu of items here.  I have my 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad.  How much is that worth?  Hey, I'll take it.  I'll take it.  Two hundred eighty bucks.  Now you can get paid with cash by a check PayPal.  My suggestion to the Amazon gift card because it gives you a bonus five percent when you  choose Amazon.  Their data specialist will remove your data.  You don't have to worry about that.  And you get the cash to buy something new.  They pay the postage even.  So you know, and if you can say, is it good or is it flawless?  It's 20 bucks less if it's good.  Be honest.  You know, that's fine.  Sometimes I've actually get a lot of messages from people say, you know, I said it was kind  of flawed condition.  They said, no, no, this is fine.  They gave me more money than I thought.  Sign up for the Gazelle account or give them your email address.  They'll send you shipping details and they'll show you how it's going as the stuff is on  its way to you.  Gazelle is really a great way to trade in your old stuff and pay for your new stuff.  It is fantastic.  And I want you to try it right now.  Gazelle.com G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Don't sell it.  Gazelle it.  See if Patrick could only know.  You have literally five or six dollars with the stuff you could have.  Only Gazelle had existed back then.  Were there bowling balls in there?  Things like that?

Mega Upload has now these are servers in Virginia.  They asked the Virginia judge overseeing the case to spare the data on its servers from  deletion.  They had at least 1100 servers holding 25 petabytes from Carpathia hosting in Virginia.  The government froze the assets.  Mega Upload couldn't pay the bills.  Carpathia said, hey, it's costing thousands of dollars a day to maintain these servers.  And they go to the judge say, you either give us money or give us permission to erase them  and reuse them.

Start time: 4145.76

Start time: 4163.04

And a defendant has the rights to have that evidence preserved.  It's in the hands of the feds.  Preserve that data.  If the government won't pay the bill, Mega Upload says, we'll cover the cost from our  own funds.  But in order to do that, you have to unfreeze our funds because we don't have any money.  But this is a mess.  And the feds are saying, no, no, no, we're not going to.  The feds are basically saying, scorched earth, we're not going to give an inch.  We're not going to give Mega Upload anything.

Because the other thing, the side of this, yeah, okay, a lot of people, maybe a lot of  people are doing nefarious stuff on Mega Upload, but a lot of people are just storing stuff  cheaply there and they cannot access their data.  They are locked out.  And that's just messy.

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is going to get a fairly  massive payment, $229 million settlement from Broadcom, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Lenovo because  Siro had also got $205 million in 2009 from a similar settlement in East Texas because  Siro invented Wi-Fi.

Transcript:  So Siro was founded in 1926 as the Australian government's research lab.  Yes, we have Australians in the audience who are nodding.  So it must be true.  During World War II, it focused on things like food preservation, but they've researched,  it's kind of like their DARPA, right?  They've researched all sorts of stuff.  Most of the budget comes from the government, like the National Institutes of Health, 6,400  employees, most of them are scientists.  Siro astrophysicist John O'Sullivan was tasked in the early 90s with building a high-speed  wireless network.  You know about this.  This is famous in Australia.  Nobody else has heard about this in the US.  After many of the key technologies already existed, and the ultimate relevance and success  of O'Sullivan's project is now one of the most heavily litigated issues in the history  of technology.  But these companies, Acer, Atheros, Wi-Fi chipset, Broadcom Wi-Fi chipset, AT&T, Gateway,  Lenovo, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sony have agreed to pay $229 million to Siro.  Siro now says 90% of the Wi-Fi enabled device market has licensed its patent.  Have you ever heard of this?  That's amazing.  Congratulations to the Australians.  Yes, there they are, ladies and gentlemen.  I want my peeps back.  That's great.  Fascinating.  I had no idea.  The Australians invented Wi-Fi.

Transcript:  Wi-Fi.  I wonder if they invented this little thing.  This is something that was reported in the Brian X. Chen writing in the New York Times  Bits blog said...  He's actually talking about Justin Watt, who's a web engineer who was staying at the courtyard  Marriott in Manhattan.  And he noticed something odd on his personal blog.  There was just kind of this blank line.  And he realized...  He's spent some time on the coding for the web.  He realized the hotel's internet service was injecting code into every page you visited.  A little research, a conversation on hacker news, and it's turned out that there's a company  that does this.  It's a revenue extraction gateway or an RxG from a company called RG Nets.  The system rewrites every web page you're using on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel on the  fly so that it can include a banner ad.  Oh my God.  I don't think the Australians patented this.  They wish they had.  There's some guy in Jersey patented this.  The online store selling the hardware to hotels to provide this service calls it web experience  manipulation.  They admit it.  So apparently the courtyard Marriott's marketing director referred inquiries from the New York  Times to the head office in New York.  And the spokesman said, I have to talk to the national office.  The automated phone system at RG Net hung up on them.  And they didn't respond to email.  This guy was smart enough to say, well, there shouldn't be that extra space in my blog.  Is this really that bad?  Well, that's a good question.  You're getting free Wi-Fi.

But I mean, I just wonder how often when we sign the back of something like, oh, I'm going  to get my hotel room and there are all these things I'm not reading.  What if it's actually included in there?  And people are going to say I had notice.

It's only 57% of Pinterest users are women, which means according to my careful calculations,  43% are men.  Or to others.  Or others.  I have a Pinterest account.  There has been some talk lately that Pinterest is kind of letting you take the risk.  Apparently, when you pin stuff and then the EULA and so forth, there's a big warning now  that if you put copyright material on here, it's on your head.  Let it be on your head.  And there's a lawyer and a photographer named Kirsten who's gotten a lot of attention because  she's saying she's tearfully deleting her Pinterest account.

And when I say paper wall, I mean paper wall in front of a Mack truck.  I think if somebody decides to sue Pinterest because of copyright violations, the one line  in the EULA that says, our end users are responsible for what they post, not us.  Talk to YouTube.

Transcript:  This person is a lawyer and lawyers look at the world differently from the rest of us.  Yeah, I was laughing.  If you've ever had a friend go through law school, you spend like six months of your  life hearing about torts, which is basically like why a five-year-old getting caught in  railroad tracks in 1903 changed everything about seat belts.  And you're sitting there and they map out this really insane thing of logic.  It's a different way of looking at the world.  And then you realize that the law controls you because we're a republic.  And then you twitch a lot for a while.  And then you realize your friend's insane because they're in law school and you move  on.  But this woman's like, I could be, I'm posting images from this website that I think are  pretty, but I'm being, they're telling me that I am personally responsible legally for  posting those images.  And if they decide to sue me, then I'm SOL.  Right?  But the problem is you already are SOL.  The mere act of creating anything.  And nobody's going to sue you.

I mean, it doesn't make a difference.  I've been through law school.  And the thing is, I'm like, you know what?  Go for it.  If you want, if, if, if I already know that I'm responsible for this, every single time  you do almost anything, if I start humming a song or talk about a baseball game, I'm  breaking the law all the time, apparently.

Nobody, no court's going to give me and give anybody anything.  It's a frivolous case.  Well, technically, it's different if I'm claiming responsibility, claiming I did it  or I'm making money.
