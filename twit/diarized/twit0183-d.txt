Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are the LePert Truman Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is exactly what it is.  And it's so much fun.  It's really, what's neat about it is, you know, of course podcasting makes it flexible  for everyone you download when you want to listen to it.  But it's not interactive.  And so it's really nice to have people, you know, so we have 700 people in the chat, one  chat room, 500 and other.  People yelling at you in real time.  It's just like Jenny Cam.  It's just like Jenny Cam.  What happened to her?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was married, raising a family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How old is your baby?  I want to say, I don't want to read her whole name.  Poezy is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We call her Poe or Poezy.  She's one.  She just turned one.  Got the one-year molars to prove it.  Oh, that's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's been a year.  I think that's right about when you were on last time then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a busy year.  Last 14, 15 months, we changed continents.  My wife changed jobs.  We had a baby, published a book, went on a book tour, published two more books, wrote  two books, spent a month in Asia researching a book, got married three times on two continents,  went on my honeymoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a great year it's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been a busy 15 or 16 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We welcome him back for the first time and about that long, Cory Doctorow of CrapHound.com,  of course, a great novelist.  What's your new book, Little Brother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The book that I'm working on now is called For the Win and it's about union organizers  and gold farms.  The next book I've got coming out is a book for grownups called Makers.  And then the book that just came out last year was called Little Brother and it's a  young adult novel.  It's doing really well.  It's in its eighth hardcover printing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you did the same thing with that that you've done with your other novels.  You Creative Commons licensed it and released it.  Absolutely, yeah.  And it's still in its eighth hardcover printing, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  The book is bestseller.  Everyone's bestseller lists up for all the awards.  Just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, will you call For the Win FTW just to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the code name as we speak.  The file is called FTW.txt.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also with us, Ryan Block from GDGT.  Great to talk to you, Ryan.  Hey, thanks for having me back.  Always great to have you back on the show.  And now I'm just wondering if there is any strife in the Block household when Veronica  became a Twitter-suggested celebrity.  She's already...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all know that she's the celebrity in the family.  Leaving the rest of us in the dust.  I'm just happy to be associated and to get that little bit of runoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have you.  I actually invited Ryan and Peter Rojas, and we will get you both on another time, but  Peter responded too late and I'd already booked the panel up.  But we'll get you two on again then soon, maybe next week.  Who knows?  Yeah, we're not going anywhere.  Good.  I'm so pleased to have him on.  Robert Heron, an original Twit.  He was on the very first Twit episode, many subsequent to that.  And then I just...  My fault, Robert, entirely.  I'm so glad to have you back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, we're busy people.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for inviting me.  The occasion is kind of sad because DLTV went into hiatus last week.  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unnecessary hiatus.  It really was just a personnel thing, just not having enough bodies to get stuff done  and basically getting that to everyone's attention who needed it to be told.  So we're working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the plan is...  It really is a hiatus and not a cancellation.  The plan is to bring it back.  Totally.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  I'm glad to hear that.  Along with continuing all the other content we're doing through the relationship we have  with Mevio and PCMag as well, including Dvorak's great cranky geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's still doing that.  He is.  Nonstop.  Yeah.  And there have been personnel changes there as well, as we all know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  And it's partially the economy, just partially to just about getting everyone on the same  page in terms of what we need to do to make it a better show for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Good.  I'm glad to hear it.  I'm also really glad, and I'm going to add her right now to welcome...  This is a big panel today, so I'm going to have to ask everybody to be polite and let  other people talk.  Gina Trapani, who I've been a big fan of for ages, ever since she created the most singularly  useful blog in history, Lifehacker.com.  And she's kind of semi-retired from Lifehacker.  So we'll ask her about that and has a new site that we're going to let her talk about.  Gina is on the phone, I think.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi.  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm calling you on Skype.  Oh, I have you on Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, you just got me on Skype.  Just switched from my cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so cool.  So we had her in two different locations.  Glad to have you on.  Let me introduce you around because I've been introducing everybody, but we're getting up  to my...  I put a dot instead of a dash in your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was my fault, I think.  I told you the wrong thing.  My apologies.  It's like Morse code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a big world of difference between a dot and a dash.  Also with us on the line, Cory Doctorow, he's in London right now where it's late at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Cory.  How are you doing, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are you?  I'm tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You two actually, between the two of you, have the biggest blogs in the world, Boing  Boing and Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've got the largest blog in the world called Boing Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does.  Cory does.  I'm not in that sector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the biggest podcaster that's on video 30 hours a week at Twitch Live.  We're all in good company.  Also with us, Robert Heron from DLTV, my old friend, longtime screensavers and lab rat  guy.  Hey, hello.  Pleasure to meet everybody.  And Ryan Block from Engadget.  Do you know everybody, Gina?  Are these strangers to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, to varying degrees.  Robert, you and I haven't met.  Ryan, I can't believe we haven't met, but Cory and I have certainly met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really surprising.  We haven't crossed paths before now.  That's the best thing about it.  He feels great at connecting people.  That's what he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you know what?  I was about to say it's a great thing about the internet is that you can get to know people.  You can read their work.  You can feel like you're practically buddies with them through things like Facebook and  Twitter and have never met.  And then to meet like this is really great.  Serendipitous.  I've never met Gina, but I've been a fan for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Likewise.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So lots to talk about this week.  We have such a good group.  I guess we should probably start with the New Zealand blackout.  This is, I'm sure, kind of something Cory Doctorow has something to say about New Zealand  passed a law.  If you find out more about this, there's a short URL that I use, tr.im slash freedom.  That'll take you to the creativefreedom.org.nzblog.  New Zealand amended their copyright law with something called Section 92A.  And correct me if I'm wrong, Cory, but essentially what 92A says is if somebody complains about  you, a record company or movie company, your internet service provider just pulls the plug  with no due process.  It's done.  You're guilty by accusation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is actually like not sui generis to New Zealand.  This has been a feature of copyright proposals all over the world in the EU and the UK.  Something called the Anti-Copy Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that the US and the EU and  Canada have been negotiating.  It's a feature there.  And it's this three strikes, you're out rule in which if you're accused three times of  infringing copyright, they cut off your internet access.  So my friend Kevin Marks, who works with me on the advisory council, the Open Rights Group  here in the UK and also works at Google, he said, well, why don't we have a three strikes,  you're out rule for copyright holders?  If someone accuses you three times of making false accusations, we cut off your internet  access.  So like if universal music gets accused three times of getting it wrong, we go with the  bolt cutters to every universal branch office in the entire world.  We cut off their internet access.  From now on, they can be a music label that does all its business by fax.  The thing about this is that it treats your internet access as a thing that you use to  as opposed to the single wire that delivers freedom of speech, freedom of the press and  freedom of assembly, your health information, your education, your job and everything else.  And not just for you, but for everyone else in your household.  You know, I just got the latest time out here in London and they had an article on Life  Inside, one of the most notorious prisons in the United Kingdom.  And they asked all these inmates, these convicted felons, what they're doing.  They're all getting degrees at open university by internet.  So these people who've been like convicted of felonies get to use the internet.  But people who've been accused of downloading music won't.  So you know, it's a really bad piece of policy.  It should be a self-evidently bad piece of policy.  And you know, the fact that the New Zealand government passed it doesn't reflect well  on New Zealand.  And, you know, to their credit, the New Zealand geek community, who are big and strong and  intelligent and clever, have really brought this to the world's attention.  And I think the reason the world needs to pay attention to this is not because, you  know, we bleed for our brothers and sisters in New Zealand, although it sucks for them.  It's because this is the first of several dominoes that the entertainment industry is  hoping will fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the first country they've been able to get this three strikes law in effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  There was a bill floated in the American Congress in the last administration that didn't go  anywhere.  There have been proposals here in the UK and there's an administrative proposal in the  US.  I think Sarkozy may have actually gotten it in France.  I'm not entirely sure.  I know that in the EU, when they talk about it as a model, they call it the French model,  the Sarkozy model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the French are to blame for everything, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Sarko is like possibly the weirdest ringmaster that ever ran a three ring  government. I tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the US Congress, people who don't like the stimulus bill say it's the Frenchification  of America. There's something in the air about France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, if we brought back the guillotine, maybe we could, you know, for the people who  got us into the economic mess, that would be a truly French solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look on my Twitter friends list and I see so many black avatars.  This is the protest is to black out your avatar on Facebook or Twitter or the social network  you're on.  And it's kind of it's now through the 23rd as this podcast comes out, it'll be kind of  the last day of the blackout.  But the first day of this new law and I don't know if they're having any success in New  Zealand and quashing it, but I'm glad that the attention is being brought to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a 21st century version of the old EFF Blue Ribbon campaign, which is really  EFF's first public campaign.  And they won, right?  CDA, I mean, it took 25 years or whatever, but the Communications Decency Act essentially  has been completely gutted as a result of the activism that started with that Blue Ribbon  campaign. And I think the important thing to keep in mind here is that repealing the  law in New Zealand may not be a big bang.  It may be a series of court challenges and other actions that go on for a long time.  But by keeping the world's attention focused on what's going on in New Zealand, it will  keep us on our toes for when these proposals come to our own home countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a leaked letter from the R.I.A.N.Z., the New Zealand Recording Industry  Association, that came out 10 days ago.  It's now just being published in Computer Word New Zealand, in which they basically say  they want to determine what happens to copyright infringers.  They want they basically want to be the police, the law and the letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So, you know, the amazing thing about these self-help proposals is that the record  industries and the film industries own record on self-help where they've had, you know,  because they've had self-help measures with the DMCA where they can send takedown notices  and so on. And with the bulk litigation campaign against against downloaders shows you just  how little care they take. Right. So they're arguing, oh, well, we're sober grownups as  opposed to those crazy anarchists in their funny black t-shirts that say things that  judges don't understand. So, you know, we should be allowed to act as judge, jury and  executioner because we would never fly off the handle and do something weird.  We will always behave in a responsible way, except when we're seeing like dead people  and people who don't own computers and, you know, people who have done.  Little old ladies. Yeah.  People who are in, you know, comas and and you know, they there's some there was just  a stat released on the number of suicide attempts related to to people who've been kids who've  been targeted by the R.I.A. I mean, you know, this they sent up a DMCA disconnection or  disconnection threat to a laser printer at a university that they said was downloading  an Indiana Jones movie. You know, not only is no one suited to replace the judiciary  and due process for when it comes to disconnecting people from the Internet or any other substantial  area of law, but the record and movie industry are especially not suited to replacing the  judiciary and the rule of law when it comes to this sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, are you a pirate genus, Trapani? Do you steal music over the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, not that you'd ever admit.  I think my Skype connection is a little flaky.  Let's talk about that later.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what, every time I give a speech, especially at an entertainment company,  because I go to entertainment companies a lot because, you know, they're not monolithically  evil mustache twillers. They tend to be filled with people who care about this stuff, some of  whom think that they're going the wrong way. I always say, is there anyone in this audience  who doesn't think of themselves as a copyright pirate? And no one puts their hands up. Disney,  no one put their hand up. Really?  Pam McMillan, no one put their hand up. You know, everyone knows that they're pirates. I mean,  I compare it to like the Victorian taboo against masturbation, where everyone claimed that they  never masturbated and everyone assumed that they were the only hypocrite in the room. You know,  one of the nice things about asking that question in public is that when no one's hand goes up,  everyone realizes we're all hypocrites. All hypocrites here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, my question is, I mean, I think that you did a really succinct job at kind of  summarizing where we're at. But my question is, are we doing enough, right? Are we doing enough  to raise awareness? Are the actions that we as a technology community taking enough to really kind  of get this stuff out there? I mean, yeah, this topic definitely has its place on a lot of the  really geeky blogs. And this blackout avatar thing is something. But is it enough? You know,  is this really the kind of attention that is going to actually change that legislation? I mean,  we have legal parties who are getting involved and, you know, those legal parties are definitely  going to put the pressure on the government officials responsible for this kind of legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is it enough just to black out your avatar? You say, what more can we do? I mean, what should

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we do? I think you're asking the wrong person. You know, I would not call myself a great internet  activist. But I mean, something feels like, you know, we need to take this, you know, not to the  internet, but to the streets. Yeah, it seems like it's more of a, I'm thinking it's more of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  complaint. Just with that type of legislation just being promoted under pressure from apparently  lobbyists, where's the public discourse in, in, in forming those kinds of laws? Well, this is it. I  mean, unfortunately we are, it seems like the default where if you're a business that's under  attack, supposedly from some say a rogue element that's downloading your material or copyright  infringement of some kind, it seems like they just automatically get a law put in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, the problem is that I'm not a New Zealand citizen, so I don't really have standing in New  Zealand. So Corey, what, I mean, you know, for the Blue Ribbon campaign, that was, that was a little  more straightforward. You could be an activist, you go to EFF and fill out the petition and  participate. What do we do as citizens of the world here? Well, I think that, you know, speaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as, as like a, putting on a movement strategist hat here, what we need is an ecosystem of different  kinds of activity from, from different kinds of people. Cause there's no one size fits all  mode of engagement and people move through different kinds of engagement as they, as they are,  as their lives change. You know, when you're a student, you have different priorities and so on.  But I, you know, there are, there, there is that ecosystem now. So there's a group of people who  go to the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva and negotiate copyright treaties and  stand up for that stuff. And I just heard you talking, I think it was, you know, someone else  talking about this new pharmaceutical deal where they're, they're, they're cutting the rates for  pharma in the developing world that comes straight out of those people. There's a group,  there are groups of people who take to the streets, including some of the Kiwi activists  who are on parliament hill, shouting and waving placards. There are people on Facebook. There's  one absolutely amazing group is the free culture clubs, which are a global network of campus clubs  at high schools and universities of students who do all kinds of stuff to promote free culture.  Creative Commons and, and iCommons are two closely related organizations that work on this stuff,  recruiting artists, recruiting through Science Commons and CC Learn educators and researchers.  So there's really like the, you know, I hear what you're saying, Ryan, and I think that that's  where the movement has gone in the last like five or six years is expanding out from just being EFF  and maybe the Free Software Foundation to being this giant ecosystem of organizations and  individuals who have different ways to engage. One thing that I'd love to see more of, do you  remember a few years ago they had the install Firefox on your parents computer this Thanksgiving?  I think that there's a movement that there's an opportunity of wasting for like a toolkit of  things to put on your parents computers to make them more free and more private every time you  go home. That's a great holiday. It's like a Christmas DVD and a Thanksgiving DVD and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've heard Larry Lessig talk and say this is not an occasion to become a pirate. This is,  you know, resist that urge and instead use your energies to change the laws, not to break them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You agree?  Right. And you know, for me, you know, there's an, I don't think an equation that you can put to  reaching out directly to legislators. But when you compare knocking on doors, making, you know,  writing a physical letter or a fax, you know, calling an office versus sending an email,  you know, I mean, emails get thrown in the trash. Emails get filtered. Emails don't really go  anywhere and there's only so much, you know, it's very easy to tune out what's going on online when  you know, you're in a government position and you're living in your little world.  So, you know, these legislators tend, I think, to pay attention more to offline type activities.  And that doesn't necessarily mean picketing a government building. You know, it means calling.  It means writing a letter, right? Things that we don't normally do as people who are spending  most of our time on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, do you think, let me ask Gina, do you think the geeks are a little too insular and we do  things like the blackout avatars? That's easy to do, but are less willing to actually go the extra  mile to write a member of Congress or to be active?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so. I think to some degree. I mean, you know, Ryan's question about whether or not  the black avatar is enough. I mean, I did it and it's not and I wouldn't. It's the only thing that  I've really done about it. And really I became aware of the whole situation because a bunch of  friends were in New Zealand and made me aware. And so I changed my avatar and then people asked me  about it and I told them. So I think, you know, it definitely did raise some awareness. But yeah,  I think we are still a very insular community, but we're still a very large community, larger,  I think, than we realize. And there's still a lot of education to be done, you know, between within,  you know, inter geek communication. So I think that it does help for sure. But yes, I do think  we're less likely to start writing letters or picketing. It is possible to use these tools to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  organize. EFF's shown that President Obama did it very effectively in his campaign. Definitely.  So the tools can be can be used to organize. You know, and we did this with the last Canadian

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  election, two Canadian elections back where the liberal member of parliament who'd proposed a  really bad copyright law, who was actually my old MP when I lived in Toronto, she lost the election.  You know, we did grassroots on the ground door knocking, organizing to get well, not I say we,  I was living in London at the time. You know, my colleagues in Toronto did this and she lost the  election by the largest swing of any candidate in the greater Toronto area. Like she just, she was  just basted by this. And you know, the industry minister, Jim Prentice, the old industry minister,  when he introduced a similar law, you know, his, when he threw like a Christmas constituency party,  it was not mobbed, but filled with very polite constituents of his who are nevertheless  incredibly forceful on the question of why he'd introduced this legislation.  And really put it right front and center on the political agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, what's really irritating me about the situation though, is the fact that we still  don't really have a position in our government, someone who has a voice on this type of topic,  Obama is supposed to be appointing a US CTO, you know, quote unquote CTO.  And that would be a great, you know, it's like when, when there are human rights abuses  in the world, someone in the administration speaks out against that. Right. And, and when,  you know, there are things happening internationally that are, you know, indefensible.  People speak out against that within the government, but we don't have that. We don't have a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The irony is it's, it's, it's, it's us agencies that are promoting this  through white power. It's the US trade representative.  So I don't know if we would, I don't know, do we have the political will to speak out against it  when the record industry, the movie industry, and these copyright holders pump so much money into  lobbying and campaign funding, you know, and you got David Geffen throwing parties. I don't know  if we would have the political will to do that. I wish we would. But I mean, that's, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  theoretically going to be the job of a CTO. Yeah. Right. That's it doesn't, you know, that's,  that's a position that stands aside from, from the lobbying and from the industry.  Yeah. So that's a position that ideally would, would be in a position to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to really speak out. If not, let's throw those sons of guns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And here's a, here's a real time interjection from a Yuhasa Arun and apparently a Finn in New  Zealand. The labor minister introduced the NZ copyright law, Judith Tizard lost her seat,  lost her seat to a nobody in the last election. So it does happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's hope so. All right. Well, I got another one to throw at you. This is the Internet Safety Act,  HR 1076 S436. The Internet, these acronyms, the Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating  the Exploitation of Today's Youth Act, which would require internet service providers to keep two  years of records for the benefit of police investigations, but not just ISPs or it's really  could be broadly interpreted to include hotels, wifi access points, coffee shops, even home users,  anybody running a DHCP server might be required by this bill to keep two years of records available  at any time for the police. Now they always use this, you know, MacGuffin of child pornography,  but it's not about child pornography. This is just another-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get anything passed in terms of restrictions if you put enough child pornography clauses in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they said this is the record industry retirement fund, they wouldn't go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You know, it's like no congressperson is going to vote against a bill that says,  you know, in its lead, this is a bill designed at mitigating child pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news is they've tried to get this in in 2006. They tried to get it in in 2007.  It has failed up to now. I just, I really worry when I see these bills introduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, even the Bush administration had reservations about this.  That's right. Until Gonzalez said, I want it.  That says something. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So you know what I think the biggest risk to kids from this is, is that, you know,  the only way to make kids safe is not to keep them safe, but to teach them to be safe. And the way to  teach them to be safe is to teach them to value their privacy, to, you know, to avoid wiretaps on  the internet and so on. And when you tell them, okay, well, what you need to do is whenever you're  on the internet, you need to be very cautious of your safety and your privacy and not let people  know where you are and who you are and, and, and not, you know, be in public when you're saying  personal things and so on. And while you're doing that, we're going to wiretap everything you say  and record it. And if you take any countermeasures to avoid it, we're going to expel you from school  or send you off to internet rehab camp or whatever it is we do to kids these days.  You know, kids are pretty good at detecting hypocrisy. And when they detect it,  they decide that the person who's saying the hypocritical thing is just lying to them and  doesn't need to be listened to. You know, stuffing your face with ding-dongs while you tell them not  to eat sugar is not a good way to convince them not to eat sugar. You need to model the behavior  you don't want, you want kids to engage in by wiretapping everyone on the internet and saying  you have no privacy and your personal information belongs to everyone. You're fundamentally saying,  you know, don't value your privacy. Your privacy has no worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie It's a depressing thing. Another thing you might want to write your, as Corey,  as you say, your congress critter about and say, we don't want the, we believe in protecting  children, but we don't believe in the internet safety act. That's not what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Corey Johnson There's a great report commissioned by several attorneys general, I think like  almost all of them on the incidents of child predation on the internet, in which they got a  bunch of Mimi Ito, Joey Ito's sister at USC and her grad students to research just how much kids are  approached by strangers on the internet to do terrible things to them. And, you know,  the answers that they were allowed to come back with were like a lot, a scary amount,  and you wouldn't believe how much. And what they came back with was, you know, actually not very  much. It's not a big risk. There are risks, which is like kids who are kind of screwed up,  sometimes try to form relationships with slightly older people, like, you know, kids in their early  teens trying to form relationships with people in their early twenties. And sometimes they're  successful and that's really destructive for all parties. And those kids really need help. And  that's really bad. And that should really be fixed. And, you know, the attorneys general just, you  know, many of them, to their credit, were good about this. But a few of them were like, no,  this wasn't an acceptable outcome. You guys are crazy. We need to protect children from  stranger danger because that's what they're really at risk from. And it's, you know, it's like  protecting them from tyrannosaurs or something. It's just, it's not an appreciable risk to kids,  as opposed to predation from family members and their own lack of appropriate risk containment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  behavior. I like to- Corey, I don't know if this 100% kind of meets with the realities of life today.  And that is that there's a huge generation gap in terms of technology. You know, it's hard for  parents to teach their kids about, you know, how privacy and, you know, data is protected on the  internet, personal data is protected on the internet, when they themselves don't have a  complete understanding of that sometimes. So- Well, that's why they're scared, isn't it?  Because it's- Right. And that's, I think that that's kind of the root of some of these bills.  You know, they come to pass and, you know, they get voted through or they don't, but they start  because I think oftentimes because of a fundamental lack of understanding about the  way things are versus the way things ought to be. And, you know, I just know that, I mean,  you know, you're a father, you're very progressive, obviously, you would know exactly how to do this.  But I know many, many people who are, you know, in the 20 to 35 age bracket, who are just not as  well-versed in this stuff as people like us are. And I don't think that they would be in a position  to raise their child with such an acute awareness of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. And I think that's why, you know, experts, particularly experts in government,  need when they're asked to do something about what is a real danger, which is kids behaving  inappropriately on the internet and exposing themselves to risk, need to come back with,  we've hired some experts to go and study, we figured out that these are the risks,  we've got a strategy for containing it. And we're going to help you, the parents and your kids  overcome this risk. I mean, it's not just computers, you know, every major technological  innovation, you know, that kids were more into cars than their parents when cars were invented.  And we needed to kind of sort that out too. And I think that one of the roles of an expert agency,  like the entire administrative branch of government in the United States, is to find  technical experts to come up with actual solutions, not things that make hysterical people feel less

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hysterical, but actual solutions to actual problems. I like the, I'm going to read from  your post, Cory, on Boing Boing. This is quoting Dana Boyd, who's one of the researchers that  you talked about. She says, why are we so obsessed with the registered sex offender side of the puzzle?  And she's talking about booting registered sex offenders from MySpace and Facebook. When the  troubled kids are right in front of us, why are we so obsessed with the internet side of the puzzle  when so many more kids are abused in their own home? I feel like this whole conversation has  turned into a distraction. Money and time is being spent on focusing on the, and this is really great,  money and time is being spent on focusing on the things that people fear  rather than the very real and known risks the kids face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And again, I think that this really comes, this stems from the fact that there is a lack  of understanding and that there is this fear and they feel people who are looking at this kind of  thing feel like they can control it through law and through legislation and through blanket tactics.  Clearly that doesn't work and I think we would all agree on that. But I also understand where  that comes from. It comes from ignorance. It comes from not understanding this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Sure. Now, you know who she'd be afraid of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dana's amazing, by the way, and everything she's worked on is fantastic. Her PhD thesis was just  published and she's got her own lab and Microsoft Research in Boston now and she's doing amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff. That's great. That's really great. We're going to get back to the conversation in just a  bit. I do want to talk about the Pirate Bay trial, if that's what you can call it, circus  and lots more news. But first I want to remind you that this show brought to you by my friends  at GoToMyPC. I say my friends because I've known them for a long time. The guys who designed  GoToMyPC, the Citrix folks have been around, I'm thinking particularly of Ed Iacobucci,  I remember fondly hanging around with CES with Ed. Ed's the guy who did, he was at IBM at the  time, did OS2. But I think, I don't know if you remember, there was this little thing where  IBM helped Microsoft with NT and Microsoft helped IBM with OS2 and Ed really did a lot of the core  of Windows NT, as I remember it. And in the process became an expert on remote access  and really knowing how to do that. That's why Microsoft licenses the Citrix technology.  GoToMyPC takes advantage of that great knowledge to give you the ultimate and remote access,  wherever you are, anywhere in the world. You can log into your office computer.  It's amazing. Well, here's the deal. You can do it right now. Go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  Go to G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C dot com slash twit. And before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed.  It's really just a couple of clicks of the mouse. Do it now. In fact, you'll get it free for 30 days.  So do it now. And then when you travel, just try. You go to the website. You go to GoToMyPC.com.  You give them your login, your password, and you have a secure 128-bit encryption right to your  office PC. So what that means is you can surf the net, you can open programs, you can send and receive  email, you can copy files, all in safety, security, even if you're at the sketchiest internet cafe in  the world. It's remarkable. I mean, you just, and it's fast. It's very easy to use. You can even  watch video. It's that fast. GoToMyPC.com slash twit. PC World gave it their world-class award  for best remote access software. They've been doing that year after year. Frankly, I just don't,  there are our competitors. Of course, there's even open source free competitors. There's nothing like  GoToMyPC. It's the easiest, the best. And I want you to try it free for the next 30 days. Go to  GoToMyPC.com slash twit. And if you, especially if you're planning a trip in the near future,  you're going somewhere, this thing is amazing. GoToMyPC.com slash twit. We thank them so much for  making this Week in Tech possible. We're talking with Corey Doctorow of CrapHound.com,  great author, Gina Trapani. What's your new, your new site is, you kind of semi-retired from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lifehacker, Gina? Yeah, yeah. I'm writing on Lifehacker once a week, but my new site is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SmarterWear.org. And it's a software or just a personal blog? Yeah, it's a personal tech  blog, let's say. That's cool. Also, Robert Heron of DLTV. And he of course does home theater and  reviews of HDTVs for Ziff Davis and Ryan Block of GDGT.com. New, change of pace, a little bit of a  change of pace. Missouri man, 70 year old man in Joplin, Missouri, his cable went out and he said,  no problem, I've got one of those digital TV converter boxes in my closet. Plugs it in,  it won't work. He does the most sensible thing. He shoots his TV. Unfortunately, he's arrested for  firing an unlawful fire, discharge of a firearm. I don't know what's so weird about this. I do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  every time a product is over for me. Elvis shot his TV. This is like routine. So the DL, the digital

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  transition was put off till June 17th. But all they did was say, you don't have to to the TV  stations. You don't have to, but some have. Has there been howls of pain from the stations that  have? Have you heard, Ryan, anything from people saying, I can't see my TV? I haven't heard a ton

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from people writing in stating that they, we do that now. Of course, your listeners know better.  We have listeners who work at stations. They're the techies who are keeping the broadcast online.  I haven't heard a bunch from people who've gotten complaints like that. I'm sure that they're out  there. One of the stories that I saw in this week's feed is that 28,000 some odd people,  I think, complained to the FCC that their television was no longer working. I think it's  a fraction of a fraction of a percent. If you look at 28,000 people as the total percentage of the  United States, it's like one one hundredth of a single percent of the population of the country  is apparently upset about this. You sneeze, you're going to get 28,000 calls.  Right, exactly. I'm not super, super worried about it. We've talked about this on Twitter before.  This is going to be an inconvenience for some people, and there's no doubt about that. It's  a temporary inconvenience. It's not something that can't be easily fixed. Although there is  a dollar amount associated with fixing the problem, if you didn't get the coupon in time,  and if you haven't gotten your converter box already, it's not an unreasonable dollar  amount. If you have to have television, $20, $30, $40 for a converter box, not going to kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you covered this at all, Robert? Have you reviewed digital boxes, anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. I've also received the main complaints that I get from that percentage of people who haven't  made the switch yet are the folks who are really stuck in the analog side of things where they're  using the VHS stack as their tuner. When the analog signal stops, it essentially becomes a  useless brick for them. They're either unable or unwilling to upgrade to either something like a  digital TiVo device or something else to basically handle their recording. It's usually the people  who are on the least expensive side of things that are feeling it the most.  But these are people who are emailing you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's true. At least they do have internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've gotten slammed because sometimes I'll come on the radio show and say,  oh, come on. This is little old ladies who are still watching their 13-inch analog television  set who have rabbit ears. I always get slammed by people saying, no, there are a lot of people  watching analog TV. If you're in a rural area, right now the best deal in high-def TV is free  high-def TV through the airwaves. There are a lot of people out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're able to receive free high-def TV ATSC signals, then you're set. You don't have to change

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. But not everybody can get ATSC. You might have a high-def TV that doesn't have a tuner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you have a high-def TV with an analog tuner,  is there a...  I guess you're right.  ...over the last couple of years and you're watching analog television,  there's something wrong with you anyway. Of course they're going to call you up and be all  pissed off at you because they're just not quite doing it right to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the other complaints I'm hearing too are the folks that have cable. Yet now,  before they weren't using a cable box, they didn't have to. But some of the cable stations  are actually converting to digital. So they're now being, quote unquote, forced to buy these or  rent these or lease these converter boxes. And then they don't get that that signal is different  from the signal that they're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're not getting locals, you mean? So they're using the antenna for the locals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Or that's just... Cable is providing an analog signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think cables jumped on this. Cables said, hey, we can trick people into... Because they've  always wanted to get you to buy that converter box or rent that converter box. So cable's saying,  oh yeah, it's digital now. You need a box. It's just a way of getting in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's actually some legislation going through specifically to address this issue, which is that  signaling over clear QAM, which is basically when cable provides free television access,  it's kind of an alternative to analog television, that they are exactly, as you're saying, taking  advantage of the situation and claiming that they have to switch on a lot of their channels  to digital in order to drive new subscribers. I don't know. I haven't checked in on that bill  for a little bit. It may have passed, may not have passed, but it is very, very despicable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've got a prediction that about the third weekend in May, we're going to see a huge uptick  in complaints about this as people go to the cottage, take their portable TV out to the garage,  all that stuff. It's like when they tried to ban smoking in Toronto on January 1st,  and it was completely unsuccessful because none of the smokers were willing to go outside  on January 1st in Toronto. And then they tried it again the next year on like May 25th.  And it was no problem because all the smokers were already outside and they just didn't let them back  in again when it started snowing again the next autumn. It worked like a charm, but this is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to be in reverse. Again, I just have such a hard time feeling pity for people who at this point  have not heard of it. I don't understand how you could not have heard of it. I'm not saying the  government has done a really great job of getting this messaging across. I'm sure that most people  don't really understand. Even people who'd heard of it probably don't have a full understanding of  what it all means. But you can't have not heard of this date. This date has been floating around for  years. It's been on regular television, constantly seeing commercials for it over the past six to 12  months. You really have to have been tuning everything out at this point not to have heard  anything about this over the past few years. And if you haven't, again, I don't want to see anybody  put in a position where they can't get the information that they need or that there's  an emergency or something like that and they don't know what's going on. But there are no  national emergencies going on right now as far as I know. And we have to make the switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The majority of the complaints I'm getting are really just about, it's not so much the switch.  They get that and they understood that it was coming. It was really just the fact that they're  realizing how much of their old hardware is going to be rendered obsolete. And that was one part of  it. And it was everything from the people who are still using VHS decks and the people who are still  using those portable TVs that they take to the ball game. Those were two of the more vocal parts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the community. Yeah, the portable TV thing is certainly one. But I mean, if you're using VHS  deck, just put the converter between your signal and the VHS deck and nothing changes. But then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you get the arguments about being able to record one channel or... Oh yeah, you lose your programmability.  It was... I was just so wanting to tell this person to just get a TiVo and you're going to be so much  happier. Trust me. Just dump the tapes, get the hard drive. I do try to be sensitive to people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have older hardware. Not everybody needs to upgrade every single year. Well, that's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people like you and me get accused of, well, we're the shiny objects guys. But that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we get accused of that for sure. But my thing has always been use what works.  Me too. Don't upgrade if you don't need to upgrade. I tell people, you don't have to buy a new computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just because everybody else is. You don't have to buy a new computer. Exactly. The industry thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you, but you don't have to do it. I think at a certain point, if you're using 20 year old technology,  that's kind of beyond the point of reasonability for support period. You can't expect things to be  supported forever. The world moves on. We're not burning petrol lamps in order to keep our houses  lit anymore. We have to build infrastructure and make changes in order to progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like most of the support calls though, sorry not to interrupt, but it sounds like most  of the support calls are people that knew about it. Gina, if you don't interrupt, you're never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to get a word in edgewise. Please interrupt. I can figure that out. It sounds like most of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  support calls are from people who knew about the transition, got the box, and just didn't figure  out that they had to have it scanned for the digital channels. It doesn't sound like these  are people that were freaking out because they weren't ready or they didn't have what they needed.  I don't know what the percentage is, but 20,000 is a big number. I'm sure it was people that were  just like, why isn't this working? I was ready, but now it's not. To point the finger at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  consumer electronics industry, which is so complete, anti-consumer, and so un-user friendly.  This could have been a totally brain dead, completely simple thing to teach people how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to use this hardware. You know who really gets screwed? Really, this is a problem I think you're  going to see a lot more of. People who are on marginal analog areas, they just don't get a signal  in digital areas because analog degrades more gracefully than digital. You can actually be  getting a signal and it will not work once they go to digital. There's no easy way for consumers to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know which of the tuners that are available are more sensitive or the most sensitive tuners that  are available. It will pull in those weak signals easier. Gina, do you watch Hulu? Do you watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  your TV on the web at all? I do, I do a little bit. I've got a few different setups. I watch  stuff on my Xbox 360. I've got a TiVo. I actually have cable, but just because of my living  situation, if I could opt out, I probably would and just go straight Hulu. A lot of people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  opting. Cable is terrified in fact that people are moving off of the cable system and either trying  to use them just as a data channel or not use them at all. Yeah, I mean, it's the economy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right? Why not? If you don't have to pay that bill, why would you? My cable bill is 100 bucks. I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get this stuff from the Pirate Bay. We've been asking for all the card systems for a while now  from the cable industry and they're never going to do it. That's never going to happen. There was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that bill, I'm sorry, not that bill, that movement this week on part of the cable side, cable  company side, which is basically putting out this concept for let there be many Hulus and let them  be run by the cable companies. Let us do it, please. They get to bundle that in with service  so you get the best of both worlds. That's the Comcast fan. That's that fan idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where you're on Comcast, but you're watching through their system. Yeah, it doesn't meet either need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't meet the need of letting me cut my cable television bill and it doesn't meet the need  of letting me have all of my great content online. It's a half movement in both directions at the  same time and it doesn't meet either need properly. I have a feeling we're just going to keep seeing  this from the cable companies until it's way too late for them. This kind of leaves Corey out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but Hulu, which is I think a great idea and I know a lot of young people, Colleen watches most of her  TV on Hulu, has pulled itself off of XBMC, the Xbox Media Center, which Gina, you've really turned  everybody onto. It's a great way. I love it. I love the XBMC. But without Hulu, I mean that's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it also just pulled itself out of Boxxy. Yeah, well Boxxy is a fork of the XBMC. It sucks. It  really sucks. I was trying to figure out surely there are good business reasons to do it, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from the user side it's just crappy. I can't think of a good business reason. I mean the ads are in  the video. Don't they want more people to watch? It's like they said, if you're going to watch this  on a computer, watch Hulu, but if you're going to watch this on a TV, you better not watch Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got to watch the networks. I think that's exactly the thinking, right? That's crazy.  I mean, right. Well, it's crazy, but at the same time, if they can't get the same CPM that-  Well, they make, there are more ads in the TV version, that's for sure. Well, there are more  ads, but it's also the value of the ads, right? If they stream a show on Hulu, let's say one show,  let's say whatever, the latest daily show, and they make $10,000 for a million streams,  compare that to what they would make on television for a million viewers, which would maybe $100,000  or $200,000 or $500,000. From a numbers standpoint, you can't ignore that, right? You have to say,  well, we need to delineate. Now, I mean, granted, it's completely insane, right? For us as users,  there's absolutely no reason why we would ever want to watch it on television if we can already  have it through Hulu and we're already watching those ads. In fact, we can't fast forward those  ads. We have to watch them now. But it's just this disparity where you've got the bean counters and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're like, whoa. We make more money if you watch it on TV. These guys are like dysfunctional

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  romantics who won't break up with their current partner until the next one's there. And you know  what? That doesn't make either partner happy. That's right. That's exactly it. We've got all  you cable refuse and ex-beat. My wife is a television executive and we don't have cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you guys think it's the first step though for an Uber aggregator service like Boxxie,  seeing that, okay, they had Hulu and they could easily add any other online distribution service.  Is it really just a fear from some of the content owners not wanting to see that become-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Hulu is not the only service that they have on offer, right? Boxxie has those with  Central and CBS. There's a bunch of content on there. A lot of which overlaps with Hulu,  some of which doesn't. So their job is going to be going forward, continuing those kinds of deals  and continuing to be a platform through which you can get and watch digital media. And they've been  pretty good about that so far and hopefully they'll be able to keep it on. But-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, isn't there a hack to get Hulu back on Boxxie? I think there is a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, there is. There is. I believe that there is. I actually have a try to myself and my co-authors  at Lifehacker wrote it up this week. And yeah, I mean, who knows how long it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that just shows you can't in the long run really fight this. I mean, if you're going to  put it out on the web, people are going to figure out a way to get it integrated into their Boxxie

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or their XBMC. And you have services like Netflix now just moving into more and more set-top devices,  everything from the Xbox 360 to Blu-ray players, do you name it? And I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Cory, what do you do? Do you use iPlayer, the BBC player? How do you watch your- if you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have a cable connection? For the most part, well, so we've got previews. So we got 20- this is what  the British did instead of what the Americans did for their DTV transition. They said, we're  just going to light up 30 broadcast channels of standard definition digital television for free  forever if you go and buy a converter box. So it's basically get free cable forever if you buy a  converter box. So we had a man come in and put an intent on the roof, but we never watched that  either. I mean, for the most part, the TV we're not watching is nowhere as good as the books we're  not reading, the websites we're not looking at, the three minute YouTube highlights of the TV  we're not watching, the games we're not playing. My wife's a former professional Quake player.  She plays a lot of games. We just don't have a lot of time in our lives for TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG That's the fear. It's really not about whether it's on XBMC. It's that people,  their screen time is shared with a lot of other compelling content that's not television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, all the numbers you hear about how, oh, people are still watching TV.  People are still watching TV. They're watching this wallpaper. Actually the offcom, which is  the bureaucrats who regulate TV here have coined an eulogism. They call it stacking. When you stack  your media, which is a game and you got the TV on in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG That's what this is. This is, in fact, I designed  TwitLive, the live stream of this stuff, to be stackable. The whole point of it is you're  doing other stuff. You put the window behind or you minimize it. You keep listening in the background.  It's just kind of chatter. It's somebody keeping you company while you work on your  bash shell to-do list technology. And if something interesting happens, you switch to it.  We're all living in this kind of multi-stream world now. I mean, we're so ADD now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TG I have my widescreen computer monitor in front of me and behind that,  across in the living room is my TV running in the background just as wallpaper, literally.  TG Isn't that funny?  TG Well, the weekend sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG Gina laughed because that's in fact her one of her projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  TG I love that you love it, Leo.  TG I love it.  TG Because everyone else just kind of makes a kind of blank expression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG It's todo.txt.com, right?  TG Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG I'm keeping my to-do in a Git repository.  TG I love this. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG Oh, nice.  TG It's called FreshBake. What is it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TG No, FlashBake.  TG FlashBake.  TG It's from my first novel, Down Under the Magic Kingdom. The command line,  from the command line podcast cooked up some Python scripts for me to take all the fiction  I'm working on in my to-do list and anything else that's a hot text file on my computer  and checks it into a CVS or a Git repository and logs with each check-in logs the time on my system  clock, the time zone of my system clock, the weather in that time zone according to Google,  the last three headlines I wrote for Boing Boing. I think the next version is going to record the  last three songs I listen to on my media player. It's like it's kind of what was on my mind when  I wrote that paragraph in that novel 10 years ago. I'm going to be able to pull that out.  The reason I started thinking about it is I met an archivist who told me when you're archiving  novels, you go through these multiple drafts back in the old days where you could see how  the writer changed the book.  TG There's marginalia. You could see what it was.  TG Yeah, all of that stuff. Now that stuff just doesn't exist anymore. There's one file that just  gets modified as the book starts and the book ends. I thought this would be really useful.  Then for my to-do.txt, I just delete lines out of it as I'm done with them. They often have useful  information like phone numbers where I'd love to be able to go back and search that all without  having my to-do file grow to 150,000 lines. I just keep it in a database now. It even tells  me what day I deleted that line so I know when that to-do item is from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep track of every change you made. I downloaded it immediately and then I installed Git on my Mac.  Gina, you need to write it up because I need Lifehacker to explain it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GINA I think you need to open source this stuff so we can add some talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG Well, it is open source. It's Python code so you can download it.  TG It's really early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  GINA Yeah, it is pretty early. I'm still figuring out too. As soon as I get it down to working,  I'll write it up for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG It's so cool and I want to do this. Corey, one of the neat things about Git is it keeps a  full copy of the repository unlike SVN in every copy. You maintain one locally. Do you also  replicate it to an external server so it's preserved forever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  COREY That's my next step is I'm going to start  replicating it and use the permissions to do things like allow my editor to check out the  book as I'm working on it and then when it's done, allow the public to check out the book.  TG I love this.  COREY And even do stuff like typo diffs. I get sent typos after the book is finished because  you never catch them all. I change them in the electronic file that I make available under my  Creative Commons license and then when the publisher says, well, we're going to do a new  edition, we sell out the editions, which is nice, we're going to do a new edition, we're going back  to press, what changes do we need to make? It'll be really nice to be able to say, well, the last  one that I checked out for you was on May the 13th. It's now August the 10th. Let's just diff  those two versions. There's your list of typos to fix in the next print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG So if you want to read more about this, Corey's written it up on craphound.com, his blog. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  called Flash Bake. COREY Yeah, and it's on the command lines blog as well. He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The next version is going to support plugins too. TG Oh, man. I think this is a whole system. I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Git. Git is a really great system. COREY Using programmer tools to do other stuff is like using  chef knives to cook. It's dangerous, you can really hurt yourself, but they really work.  TG It's true. COREY They really, really work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG That's so cool. When I was working on a collaborative novel, we actually did want to  set up SVN and have people check in and check out and stuff. Git's better because it keeps a copy in  every repository, so you really have great backup as well. Good. So Gina, you know about it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you're working on it. GINA I am. I'm doing some coding and we're using Git as our repository.  I'm collaborating with a couple other developers. Up until now, I've always been subversion, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm slowly getting wooed by Git. TG I love this idea of having a Git repository that records  all the little marginalia in your life and then you can go back. Of course, Corey, I always worry  that we're recording all this stuff for posterity and posterity is going to have absolutely no  interest whatsoever in what grandpa was up to. It's like, oh yeah, grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GINA That's like saying, oh, get rid of all those pot shards. What's the future going to need with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  those? TG Well, you don't know what they're going to need. But think about it. Our generation is  going to leave terabytes, petabytes, exabytes of stuff for the future. GINA That's right.  TG Crosse calls it the beginning of history. TG Yeah, the beginning of history. Exactly. Go ahead, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  RYAN I was just saying, it's a good thing that storage is so cheap. Storage is so abundant,  there's no reason not to. TG I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  GINA At least if you're storing it for your own benefit. I take the other side when it's like,  we should put a CCTV out in front of every building and record everyone who walks past it.  But the difference between spyware and myware is whether you're using tools to find out more  about yourself for your own benefit or whether someone else is being a creepy curtain twitcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG Of course, if you live in London, you might as well also get all those pictures of you as  you walk down. How many cameras? What was it? 27?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  RYAN It's 14 cameras per red blood cell now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG I saw an estimate, and this was a year ago, so it's probably doubled. In your day-to-day life  in London, pictures have been taken of you at least 27 times walking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  RYAN Yeah, and they just passed a law making you liable for up to 10 years in prison if you take  a picture of a police officer that made you a helpful terrorist. And the police don't want it.  The head of the Policeman's Union was on the CBC last week going,  we think this is a terrible idea. What a ridiculous law to pass. Why do they pass this?  We don't know how to enforce it. We have to go up and arrest tourists now?  TG Yeah, we have to enforce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  RYAN We've got real work to do.  TG Thomas Hawk writes about this a lot. He's just constantly battling. But see,  Thomas is aggressive about this. I mean, he really tries to defend the right to take photographs.  And it's just amazing how many public places you can't take pictures of. You'll get harassed by the  police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as Bruce Schneier points out, no one has ever found a cache of photographs in a terrorist lair.  There's no reason to believe that terrorists take a bunch of photos. Unless they're in a  Mission Impossible movie, taking a million photos of the target is not a prerequisite  for committing a successful act of terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TG Once again, we're spending money to fight the things we fear instead of the actual threats.  It's all theater. Speaking of theater, Pirate Bay is on trial. It started Monday.  I don't even know where to begin on this story. Does anybody want to talk about this at all?  The Pirate Bay, of course, the BitTorrent site, the place everybody goes when you're looking for,  the movie, the TV show, the software. I mean, this is the, let's say, let's admit it,  it's the pirate place to get those torrents. Pirate Bay's founder said Peter Sundy,  Peter Sundy, comas, snuppy. I don't know how you say his name, but he says, well,  we did a survey and 80% of the torrents on our site are legal.  Which kind of makes it less useful. I thought it's a different Pirate Bay than the one I've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  visiting. You also have to wonder how many of those supposedly, you know, non-legal, illegal,  20% are dead torrents or don't work. Not that I would do a whole lot of downloading or anything,  but BitTorrents rarely seem to work as promised. There's never enough peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find it very frustrating. They also talked about a contract that he signed saying he would  police the site and saying, well, actually I didn't read that. So I don't know what it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just, it's a strange trial I've ever heard of. I think that the coverage on TorrentFreak has  been pretty good at kind of pointing out there's just a kind of expectation sheer  and reality sheer between the prosecution and the defendants here. They're not doing this because  they're lawless nihilists. They're doing this because they've got like an actual developed  political agenda about why it's good to share stuff. But what they also have is an institutional  structure that makes no sense at all to the kinds of people who can be hired by record labels  because they're like an institutionless institution. They're just a bunch of guys  doing stuff. The Pirate Bay is like an emergent phenomenon of beer and Swedes. They're like,  well, where did you plan the Pirate Bay? And it's like, we didn't plan the Pirate Bay. Well,  who controls the Pirate Bay? Well, I guess there's like nine guys who've got the root  password and there's like 15 more who've got admin access on this box. And I think we put a box in  Romania and we gave a password to that guy. I don't remember. So you don't think they're obfuscating  this is really how it is? No, I think this is really how it is. I think this is like the trial  of Chicago 8 where they said, you know, you guys conspired to come to Chicago and make a riot.  And Abby Hoffman said, conspire? We can't even agree on where to have lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did agree on where to have the party on the Friday night in Stockholm at the  Spectra Kopimi party. It looked like a pretty good party. They're not taking this seriously.  Do you think they are at risk of getting jailed? I have no idea. I mean, I don't know what Swedish  law looks like, but- They don't store anything illegal in and of itself on the Pirate Bay. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just torrent metafiles. You know, my experience of copyright laws is that they often have a very,  very high maximum penalty that is at the discretion of the judge. And so it may be that they get  almost everything thrown out and there's one technicality on which they're found guilty and  the judge uses the maximum penalty. This sort of like Capone going away for tax evasion. But I  don't know. I don't know enough about Swedish law. I mean, they seem pretty confident, but you know,  we've seen confident people come and go. You know, we were pretty confident in DFF about  Grokster and we won that in the appellate division. And I think the Supreme Court were completely,  you know, out to lunch. When you read the dicta, they just didn't pay any attention to  the law or the argument. They seem to have gone in with their own conclusions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you defend Pirate Bay? Do you think what they're doing is defensible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that what the Pirate Bay does is represents a complete collapse of the way that we  treat copying. That by treating all copying, including non-commercial copying, as an industrial  act that needs to be negotiated by contract between copyright lawyers, what we do is we  create this entire outlaw society of people who are vulnerable as a result to being spied on having  their network connections disabled and so on. And we also fail to compensate artists. And that  this is like, it's a bad deal all the way around. You know, I think that when you, I think that it's  within the realm of plausibility for Swedes to say, we want to have our own copyright law and we  want to exempt this kind of thing. I don't know if that's what Swedish copyright law says. That's  what the Pirate Bay people say that it says. You know, the United States spent a hundred years  pirating all the copyrighted works of the world. You know, their first century of American copyright  law was foreigners don't get copyright. That the word Yankee comes from a Dutch word meaning pirate  because the Americans were pirating the Dutch. China designs, the Dutch porcelain designs that  the Dutch had stolen from the Chinese. You know, and every pirate who gets successful wants to call  himself an admiral and punish anyone who wants to kind of sink his ship. And so, you know, you have  the record industry started off pirating the sheet music people, now calling the people who  are pirating them on the internet pirates. Piracy is kind of a natural outgrowth of a  disconnection between copyright law and technology. And usually we fix that by changing copyright law  to kind of bring the pirates into the, into the Admiralty so that they stop, they stop kind of  destroying things and instead become part of the status quo. The fact that we haven't done that  yet, you know, here we are, whatever 12 years after Napster, 10 years after Napster is really  shocking. I mean, you know, you've got 30,000 people deprived of their livelihoods by the record  industry and no money for artists as a result of it. And, you know, who is this good for apart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from full employment for copyright lawyers? I would like to actually go around and ask all of  you what you think of Pirate Bay and this trial. Gina, you have an opinion on this?  I don't. You know, I want to say, you know, I don't want to sound like I'm pro-piracy,  but at the same time, it's hard not to like these guys. I dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true. It's true. I actually, I don't use Bittorrent and I read a bit about the trial and  I honestly, I think someone like Corey is so much, can speak to this stuff so much more  intelligently and has much more experience. I'm just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but he dodged the question too. He dodged the question too. I just want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did find Corey's response to be, you know, pretty, pretty interesting and very spot on in  a lot of it. But I mean, I don't necessarily think that I agree with this whole disparity  between technology and piracy and that's kind of what moves the industry forward. I mean, yeah,  I get that opinion and I completely see where it comes from. But the point we're at now is,  you know, the industry is now in a position that the works that it creates can be taken from anyone  at any time without permission, essentially anonymously. And it's arguable that, you know,  there's a very big difference obviously between cost and value, right? There's no cost associated  with that, but there is value that they could argue is lost. That wasn't really as much the  case in the past. And so now when we're talking about, let's bring the pirates into the fold,  let's push everything forward by, you know, figuring out a way to kind of legitimize all  this stuff. Well, I mean, I think that the industry is trying to act on that, right? I mean,  if you go back five years ago, I really would not have believed if you'd have told me that by 2009,  iTunes, the biggest online music store in the world, would be completely derrame free. I would  have laughed in your face. Yeah, you're right. So, you know, we are going there, but that doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean that piracy has to become normalcy. So, Ryan, I just say that the jukebox is actually totally  parallel to this, where you had jukeboxes were essentially placed by organized criminals. The  mafia ran jukebox distributions, putting records into diners and other places, not paying the record  companies for it. The record companies had no way to control it. It was totally anonymous. And what  they did was legitimize jukeboxes with blanket licenses. That was the origin of blanket performance  licenses that are now standard all over the world. So there is a lot of historical precedent for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's different, right? I mean, it's different to have a jukebox or to have a radio or to have a  device that can play back something on a one-time or a two-time basis, right? When it comes on,  so to speak, versus actually having a copy of that media and playing it back whenever you want.  You know, again, this is the difference between value and cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good point. But jukeboxes, remember, were always commercial, too. So it was always someone  making money off the record without giving the artist anything. Whereas with file sharing,  it's often the case that there's no money changing hands, although it may be happening at a greater  velocity. There's no money changing hands. So, you know, they're different, but there are ways  in which jukeboxes were far more grave for a rights holder, you know, that there's someone  getting rich off your stuff and not paying you than, you know, non-commercial file sharing.  They're not totally exactly parallel, but there are lots of cases where you had anonymous  file sharing or anonymous infringement and infringement that deprived artists of money  where we legitimized it because it was just too hard to stamp it out. And, you know, a war,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a cold war just kind of bankrupts everyone. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think that we could  probably go back and forth on this for a while. And I do really understand where you're coming  from. And I believe in a lot of what you're saying. I just think that we also kind of need to keep it  in perspective as well from, you know, the fact that there is an industry that is trying to make  money on creating a product. And that industry is obviously changing very quickly. And in fact,  my business partner, Peter, has built another company around the concept of the artist making  money from ancillary avenues, either from advertising against the music or from using  music as a promotional tool. And that's an actual business with an actual record label.  So clearly, these shifts are happening. I just don't think it's quite as tectonic and  quite as black and white as saying, okay, well, now, you know, this is how it's, you know,  these parallels have been in the past, and now it's going to happen again. And, you know, then in,  you know, once the pirates have been brought into the Admiralty, so to speak, then, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things will be well again. Robert Heron, you said, I like it. I, well, without a doubt,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pirate Bay's legal page remains just one of my favorite sources of entertainment in terms of just  the way they answer the letters. It reminds the world of how copyright law in one country is not  the same. It's not worldwide in any way, shape or form. And I'm just, I'm really curious to see how  the result of this trial will, you know, either highlight that or perhaps, you know,  maybe take another step toward making some sort of a worldwide standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're clearly in a, well, Corey, is this, I love how you bring history into this, but  is this a typical time or are we in a completely disruptive era where everything's falling apart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, certainly I think that, actually, I don't think those two are mutually exclusive. I think  it has been typical for a long time for everything to be falling apart. And, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there have been other times like this. I'm not, where you have these kind of complete shifts in  how it all works, but this does seem to be particularly universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think that there are some elements of this that are really atypical. The speed and the  globalness of it all are certainly atypical. But the fact that it's disrupting business models,  totally typical. I mean, you know, my little rap on this goes, first the record companies  ripped off the sheet music people, then the broadcasters ripped off the record companies,  then the cable companies ripped off the broadcasters, and the VCR people ripped  off the cable companies. And now the internet is ripping off the companies that made the VCR,  like Sony. And, you know, at every stage, they said what we did was progress, but those jerks  are doing is piracy. And at every stage, we just, you know, fixed it by saying, well, you know,  criminalizing the dominant form of entertainment is probably not the right way to solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So what is the right way to solve this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so I think it depends by media. Some media, I think you just say, well, you know, die. But  back in the, back in the Napster days, there were, there were half of Napster's users said  that they would pay $15 a month for it. Napster went to the record labels and said, tell us how  many billions you want. We'll give you that much to be legit. Today, if you want to play music in  a club or on the radio, you don't need to license each song. You just buy a blanket license. So,  you know, you could imagine that either file sharers or ISPs, and as you say, ISPs can be  anyone, including a university or workplace or whatever, might choose to buy licenses,  blanket licenses for their users or for themselves and say, you know, get EarthLink,  the ISP that comes with all the music ever recorded using any protocol you want. You collect  that music, you disperse it to artists. And there's a guy at Harvard named Terry Fisher,  who's written some really good scholarly stuff about this, where he kind of breaks down how  much money you could expect to collect based on user surveys, if you got sort of 50% compliance,  and what that would mean if you could disperse that to artists and labels. And, you know,  one of the things that you can do when you're doing this kind of blanket collection is you can  earmark a fraction of it directly to go to artists. And groups like the International Music Managers  Federation have done work on what a transparent collecting society would look like. Not one of  the old, weird, corrupt ones run by the record labels, but one that was truly 21st century,  where everyone could see exactly how that money was being collected and where it was being  disbursed. So, you wouldn't get, you know, at SoundExchange, you do the web radio did,  where they were sitting on all this money. They said, we can't locate these obscure artists.  And they finally were forced to name the artist that they couldn't find. It was like Chuck D.  You know, he disappeared off the map. Does anyone know what a Charles D.  What D stands for.  That's right. Yeah. We just, we don't have a last name for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and maybe that's really the answer that these pirate bays of the world are really just,  you know, agents of change. And they're just forcing us to move to these new,  better systems and maybe it'll all resolve soon. I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the idea too of getting the cost of the media itself out in the open where people can  discuss it and see really what it is. Cause if you can keep the price low or very reasonable,  that really goes a long way, I think, toward just eliminating, you know, rampant piracy in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a guy in, it was Canada, I think, who said that it should be a Nicholas song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it also takes away from the whole argument of going, okay, yeah,  pointing to the, the illicit content is somehow a crime rather than the illicit content itself.  And moving that around, it's just, there are better ways for all this energy to be used. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just be glad you're not in the newspaper business right now.  Oh, the pain.  Terrible. But, and yet I love that paper newspaper. I mean, how many of you read the Sunday paper and  sit down with it and go through it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I load ny times.com  on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you too, Robert, you're an electronic guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More so. I'm really hoping that the E Ink type products take off to where you can get  a more portable device, that really low power, really durable, you know, a bookish durable  for doing that very thing, you know, away from the computer or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, or you, you seem to me like a cup of coffee Sunday times kind of person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, once in a while I do get the paper version, but I have a Kindle. I enjoy,  I love reading books on the kindle. I guess I'm just an old fart. I think that.  But mostly news, I'm going to go online. I'm just going to check my reader or hit  ny times.com. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Save me, Corey. You like a paper paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the weekends, I admit, you know, we spent two hours today at our favorite breakfast place,  curled up on the sofas while the baby had her nap with the weekend observer. I tore stuff out  to take home and blog. You'll see there's like three or four things from the observer up on  Boing Boing today. I do love it. And whenever I get on a plane, a BA plane, I always grab the  pink paper. I always grab the financial time. Yeah. And, uh, do you think, do you think Posey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will, um, will be, uh, reading in paper newspaper, uh, and her adulthood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I think the future composts the past. So old media tend not to die, but they  tend to get sort of folded in, you know, I wrote a column. It's up on, um, it got slashed out at  about 10 seconds before this thing started. Uh, so it's up on the front page of slashed out right now  about the future of media. And one of the futures that I talk about that I think often gets ignored  is, um, what happened. There's two actual models for semi extinct media. One is opera, which is  basically, it's really expensive and it's sustained almost entirely by rich weirdos and has almost no  cultural currency, but will never die. And the other one is poetry, which is really cheap. And  there's more of it being written ever before. And it's an entirely non-economic proposition.  And I think, you know, I can imagine either a newspaper, like in the diamond age, that Neil  Stevenson novel that's, you know, printed on, on rag, uh, paper and ironed by butlers and delivered  to rich weirdos or, or, you know, a future like poetry, which is what newspapers are looking like  now, where there's probably more news and opinion being written than ever before. And it's, and being  read by a wider audience, but almost entirely as a non-economic activity. And you know, like, I think  as a matter of policy, if we're going to like make a technology policy to promote newspapers, it should  be to promote newspapers, not to promote the profitability of a newspaper company. And so long  as we're getting newspapers, I think, and we like the newspapers we get, that should be enough.  You know, it's, it's like, it's not the government's job or policy's job to ensure that, you know, that  the industrial heirs of William Randolph Hearst forever put a quarter in their pocket every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you find out what the weather is. Well, the only problem there though, is that there is actually a  great disparity between a non-economic media and the newspaper, you know, capital. And, and that is  it costs a ridiculous sum of money to print a paper, right? So you can't, you can't have a  non-economic media offline, right? That, that has to exist on a device, on the internet. It has to  exist in a, in a, in a medium that is not costing on a per printed basis, right? So I don't disagree  at all that obviously, you know, this media is going online, it's going that direction. I mean,  that's what Gina and I have made a career out of, is bringing our respective medias online and  being obsessive over it and, and, you know, trying to kind of redefine that small amount of space.  But what it really is, you know, New York Times is going to have to kind of undergo a shift at some  point where it has to make the decision, do we keep the legacy paper? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sir, sure. I, someone asked Clay Shirky last time he was here in the UK,  do you think your kids will read printed newspapers? And he said, sure, they'll have printers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great answer. Great answer. You want the Sunday Times? Print it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I once stayed with my wife and I, we review hotels sometimes for this guide to hotels  to go for romantic weekends called the Mr. and Mrs. Smith books. And you get a free weekend in  a hotel and we stayed in this really swanky high roller suite in Las Vegas at the MGM once. And they  had like 170 daily papers. They had a service that printed them out on giant sheets of, you know,  11 by 17. And then they bound them in silk ribbons and they delivered them to your room. And you had  the suite came with a butler and the butler would come and lay out your papers and make your  cappuccinos for you in your living room. Unfortunately, we only got two nights there,  but we read a lot of newspapers. It was pretty cool. Now that is luxury. That's the way to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. I love it. It's Vegas, baby. I don't know if Vegas has, does Vegas have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is Vegas. That was Vegas. That was Vegas? It was the MGM Skylofts. It's where they put the  whales. So if you've got $1,600 a night to spend in a suite, that's your suite, man. Take you up at  the airport in a Mossbach and take you to the 78th floor. And there's a guy who takes you to  the front of the taxi line when you want to leave the hotel. It's all very swanky. Not that we could  ever afford to do this on our own, but if someone else is putting the bill. What fun. That sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fantastic. Yeah, it was pretty awesome. Corey Doctorow is at craphound.com, C-R-A-P-H-O-U-N-D.com.  And of course, everywhere else. I mean, that article that you were talking about that's on  the front page of Slashdot is very good. Actually, that was what kind of prompted my question about  the New York Times is on the internetevolution.com site. Yeah, that's informationweeks site. Oh,  I didn't know that. This is the first time I've seen it. I'm going to be irregular because this  is a great looking site. Very interesting site. Thank you for joining us, Corey. It's great to  have you on the show. I really appreciate it. We'll have you back soon. Also, Gina Tripani  from lifehacker.com. Great to have you once again. The website is?  Smarterware.org. That's the one you want to plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. This is a lot of fun. It was nice being the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fifth and final Cylon. We now know. She's got those lights that go up and down her spine. We know that.  We know the truth. It's out there. Yeah, Smarterware.org. And also, don't forget the  to-do-text.com. And I'm going to look for your write-up with Flash Bake. I need that badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan Block does a podcast at GDGT. Soon we'll be unveiling something new there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a community of sorts, I guess. We've got a site coming. I don't know when it's going to be out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be fun with Peter Rojas. Peter will be on the show soon. I wanted to get him on too,  but it would have been too many people. It's great to talk to you again, Ryan. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what you need until you launch is one of those under-construction animated GIFs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we were totally thinking about the little guy with a hard hat with a shovel. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Throwing bits over his shoulder. Yeah. Email us in a mailbox that opens up.  I'll get on that right now. I'm sure the Wayback Machine has some samples you could use.  And Robert Heron, DLTV is not dead, not forgotten. We'll be coming back, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do. We're working on it right now. It's all in the process of just putting things back  together and getting the people we need to get it done right. And on top of that, we're still  doing things like Extreme Text Podcasts and the other video work we do. Of course, I'm always  doing my home theater and HDTV stuff. Is there a good site besides DL.TV to go to to see? I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they have the buying guide and everything on there. Is there another site you'd like to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just the PCMag site for anything HDTV related. I mean, my reviews are all up there and I get to  see just about everything in terms of what's afoot in the home theater space. Can you believe Pioneer  getting out of the business? That made me cry. I just hope that companies like Panasonic license  the technology that was exclusive to... That Kuro technology. They were two or three years ahead of  everyone else, but they just weren't making any money out of it in the way of the sign of the  times. But Vizio also announced they're getting out of plasmus as well. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's the end of plasma TVs or are we going to... No, not at all. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds a lot like our conversation from a few episodes. Ryan, I got to ask you now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you at that time said Pioneer's dead, they're out of the business. And we all said,  no, no, no, they're in the business. They're just having Panasonic make their panels. And you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  adamant. Did you know something? I'm not going to say what I didn't. I think you knew something.  Well, look, you can tell things sometimes and you can see where things are going. You're right.  So I agree with Robert that I don't think it's dead, but it's not looking good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love plasmus. That was the sign of the times at CES when Pioneer didn't show up with any TVs  and you're like, okay. That's weird, isn't it? Yeah. That was. But they have the best stuff going,  but there are other companies out there who can pick up the ball and run with it. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember, Robert, when we built the ultimate gaming machines?  Oh, yes. The giant monitors. You got to see this one we built. Colleen really gets the credit for  it.

We're overclocking the thing to over  4 gigahertz. It has the fastest benchmarks I've ever seen on a stock machine. This thing is  in it's not stock. It's incredible. So you sent us the 10 reasons why you want to win this to  uggm at twit.tv. We, the twit crew, will select the five best, what we consider the five most  creative, most interesting.

And then we will actually Colleen will come to your door with uggm because she has to, you  know, it's water-cooled. She has to put it all together.
