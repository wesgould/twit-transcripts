You always got to have  a towel. Hot, very hot. Yeah.  Wow. I don't even know if we  should waste our time with  tech news with a panel like  this. We should just talk  about whatever the hell we  want to. Hang out. It'd be  like a... It is Easter Sunday.  Thank you all for joining us  on one of the holiest days of  the year. Big Facebook meme,  which apparently is phony,  which is that it was named  after Ishtar, the goddess of  fertility, the Babylonian  Assyrian goddess of fertility.  Wait, what was named after?  Easter Ishtar. Oh. And then  Molly McCready wrote a piece  on the beast saying, no,  that's bogus. Yeah. So you're

Start time: 360.02
End time: 371.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't seem like a bad sign,  right? That doesn't feel like  a bad sign. Google decided not  to celebrate. Easter's been  around for thousands and  thousands of years and just  today there's a new rumor about

Start time: 371.50
End time: 373.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the name. But where the name

Start time: 373.12
End time: 397.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  came from. Actually, I don't  know how long Easter's been  around, really. Well, in  theory, not since the year zero  or 33 or whatever. Anyway, I  don't want to get into that.  Somewhat close to that.  This week in religion.  Apparently Google didn't want  to either because the Google  doodle today is Cesar Chavez,  not Easter. And of course, not  a bunny. CNET says it ignites

Start time: 397.76
End time: 418.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a furor. Furor. Now, do you  think this is a little bit of  making hay out of nothing  because when you look at the  actual tweets, right, there's  certainly surprise and there's  certain people like, wow,  that's surprising, Google.  Like especially Glenn Beck, the  moment you mention his name,  it's a lightning rod for  whatever. But they're all like  people up in arms.

Start time: 418.64
End time: 419.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He tweets about it, yeah.

Start time: 420.73
End time: 426.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What he says is it's clearly  surprise, not anger or  annoyance or I don't know.

Start time: 427.18
End time: 431.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody who was, apparently  everybody who was upset,  according to CNET, was from  Fox.

Start time: 432.44
End time: 439.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they went to the place  of upsetness and then found  upsetness there.  But when are they not upset?

Start time: 440.26
End time: 446.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Google doesn't celebrate  religious holidays of any  denomination, as I remember.

Start time: 446.72
End time: 449.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but they got to do some  kind of Christmas thing, right?  They do.

Start time: 450.16

Start time: 459.54
End time: 472.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was surprised that there  wasn't Easter eggs in the o's  of Google.  done that before or not.  I was surprised that they went  with Caesar Chavez's birthday  instead.  So it's like, yes, I mean,  people have a legitimate point  to be surprised.  But I don't think it's awesome.

Start time: 473.50
End time: 485.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just they keep you  guessing.  You don't know where Google is  going to come out on these  issues that are very, very  important, like what the doodle  on their home page is going to  be.  So we all must remain vigilant,  I think, in these trying times.

Start time: 485.86
End time: 492.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And really, you know, the  conversation, the national  conversation, the international  conversation is driven by the  doodle.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Start time: 494.12

Transcript:  I know.  I mean, you have to really  acknowledge that it's important.

Start time: 499.40
End time: 506.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And regardless of what they were  really trying to say, the fact  that we're talking about it  right now, that's the good part.  That's what we can all share.  It's trending.  Yeah.

Start time: 506.84
End time: 512.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's trending.  Well, so was the fake name of  Easter.  So be careful.  Right.  It's the trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Before the show, I don't know  what happened this week because  I got Bioshock Infinite and I  haven't left my room, my  bedroom.  Before the show, Brian and I  were talking about, and I don't  know if this is a spoiler from  Kotaku, these secret covers.  There are apparently musical  covers.  Bioshock Infinite takes place  in 1912.  OK.  Right.

Start time: 543.30
End time: 550.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think as far as like  disclaimers, we should say like  if you want to go in pristine  and virginal, maybe skip the  next couple of minutes.

Start time: 550.80
End time: 551.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a definite, Leo, this

Start time: 551.94
End time: 558.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is a spoiler for sure.  Well, then I won't say anything.  Just listen to the music  carefully.  How about that?  There is a moment of magic.

Start time: 558.64
End time: 574.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those of you who aren't  going to play Bioshock Infinite,  there was a delightful moment of  magic as I was scrounging around  looking for coins or for health  or ammo.  All of a sudden, I'm about to  leave room and I notice  something that's playing on the  gramophone and I walk back in.  And that's what this is about

Start time: 574.64
End time: 579.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  on Kotaku.  I'm about that.  Keep listening.  We won't play the video.  We won't spoil it.  It is a great game.

Start time: 580.06
End time: 620.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you finished it, Brian?  Already, man.  It was like it took me.  I played it on hard mode.  So it took me about 22, 24 hours  of gameplay.  And in fact, it's one of the few  games that I immediately went  back and played again from the  beginning.  And I went back and replayed the  ending just to make sure I  understood everything correctly.  I'm not going to open myself up  to being torn apart by saying  it's the greatest narrative  game ever.  But I will say that it is my  favorite narrative experience in  all of gaming in my entire  lifetime.  It is echoes of Stephen King's  Dark Tower.  It is big beyond time and space.  It is mind blowing, literally  draw dropping at the ending.  Loved it.  I will say something.

Start time: 621.74
End time: 659.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While playing it, I had this I've  been having this repeated thought  about this.  You know, the conversation can  video games be art?  You know, are they considered  art?  Can they be as compelling as a  film?  And this is one game where I  feel like the kind of the  suspension of disbelief and this  thrill of experiencing a  narrative is happening throughout  the game.  And it's kind of like I feel  like I'm playing just to get to  more of the story, whereas in a  lot of games you feel like  you're playing to beat it.  This is like you're playing to  experience this story, this big  epic, amazing story.  It's really it's very cool.

Start time: 659.82
End time: 679.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Agree 100 percent.  Somebody asked in the chat room,  is it better than the original?  Yes.  The original I love Bioshock  because it was so different.  But this they take it to a new  level.  It is beautiful.  It is.  I you know, it's funny.  I had exactly the same reaction,  Joshua, which is, OK, this  answers the question.  Our video games are.  Yes.  Yeah.

Start time: 679.34
End time: 695.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a I tweeted out a quote  from a post this week.  Kill Screen Daily's become one of  my favorite sites.  And actually, I know the guy who  created it, but they have a story  up.  Bioshock Infinite creator, Ken  Levine talks Occupy Wall Street  and how his game almost wasn't.  It just came out last week.

Start time: 695.94
End time: 698.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How does it have to do with  Occupy Wall Street?  We got to read the article to

Start time: 698.48
End time: 698.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  find out.  Leo.

Start time: 699.42
End time: 702.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Play the game.  But don't you know, don't you

Start time: 702.54
End time: 734.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  see there's a huge I mean, in  that game, there's this.  And again, I don't want to  spoil anything.  But this the strains of of  politics and social political  issues that are happening are  totally reflective of the  America that we live in right  now.  I think.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, I just think it's amazing  how how strangely how the  commentary is is so perfectly  about like what we're going  through as a nation right now.  And yet it's so very much about  something completely insane and  not real.  Which is what art should do.

Start time: 734.56
End time: 796.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, in many ways, this is  this is a stated aspect from  Irrational Games early in the  development.  They said that just as Bioshock  Original took on took the idea  of Ayn Rand's philosophy from,  you know, Atlas Shrugged and,  you know, of course, because  it's a video game, you have to  have some go terribly wrong and  kill people.  But they wanted to take the  ethics of the Tea Party and  play with them in Bioshock  Infinite.  And by putting it in the context  of 1912, you know, again, these  are minor spoilers.  The city that you go to that  floats in the sky seceded from  the Union at some point because  they have essentially have  elevated patriotism to the to  the level of a religion where  you have the key, the scroll and  the gun and and you have, you  know, Thomas Jefferson,  Washington and George Washington  as these icons that you pray to.  And it's amazing.  Like that start.  And this is again, this is the  first 15 minutes.  I hope I'm not spoiling  anything for anyone.  But but you walk in and you  experience Columbia and it's so  sweet.  You almost want to cry.  It's an Americana that never  existed.

Start time: 796.70
End time: 799.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Disney's Main Street  America.  Yes.

Start time: 799.76
End time: 810.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Correct.  And then there's one moment  when all of a sudden it becomes  instantly horrific.  Exactly.  Wow.  And again, I don't want to  spoil it.  I will.  By the way, Baratunde, it's

Start time: 810.82
End time: 838.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about racism.  Well, so and here's the let me  it's I'll do another plug.  I'm not getting paid by Kill  Scream Daily here, but Jamin  Warren is a guy who runs the  site and he wrote a piece very  recently about race, Obama and  gaming.  And he had this quote that I  tweeted out.  Excuse me.  When the time comes for a child  to ask, who am I?  Games like all great art forms  should have an answer.  I'm talking about representation  interest in gaming and who the  heroes are.  When you take the mask off, I'm  going to be very curious what

Start time: 838.66
End time: 851.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  your reaction is because while  racism is a thread that runs  through it, there are no black  people in the game.  It's all a bunch of white guys.  No, maybe later.  All right.  Don't spoil it.  No, I don't know.

Start time: 851.12

Start time: 859.98
End time: 874.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's you know, this is early  days in gaming as art and it  doesn't it's not I mean, we're  not talking David Lynch here.  We're not talking high art yet.  It's still popular art, but it's  starting to reach into more  thorny, interesting, difficult  topics.

Start time: 875.16
End time: 895.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, it's more here's a go  ahead.  I was going to say it's you're  right that it's still somewhat  in the popular realm.  But I mean, it's not national  treasure.  And I mean, it's smarter than  that.  You know, it tackles it's  tackling real issues.  I think it's asking big  questions and also doing a  brilliant job of making an  exciting action.  Wonderful.

Start time: 895.32
End time: 899.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, as a game, it  certainly succeeds.  So it's a little smarter.

Start time: 900.34
End time: 962.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, and here's the  progression that you see, right  in the early days of gaming,  one of the first.  So your goal is to create  emotions, right?  So the first thing you do is  you tell stories.  You use video games as a  printed medium.  And that's why you get your  old, you know, your  Transylvania's or your  multi-user dungeons back from  the 1970s and 80s.  But then but then when you  want to evoke emotions, the  first thing you go for is fear  because that's easy to do.  And that's when you have your  doom experience where you  turn around and corner.  monster there.  And for the first time, you  experience fear.  And then you you evolve  through that and you get to  the point where where you  start to deal with difficult  choices.  And we've seen a lot of games  in the last few years that  have dealt with difficult  choices.  Then like The Walking Dead  last year, I think was for me  game of the year because it  was the first video game that  ever made me cry.  Like I felt such an  attachment to the characters  and situations like that to  me was the Holy Grail.  But I think it's great in  some ways.  Bioshock Infinite goes  beyond that.  Like, OK, now we can make you  cry. We can make you afraid.  We can make you elated.  Now let's start making a  discussion.  Yeah, let's make you think  that's a great way.

Transcript:  What was the game that came  out?  They previewed it last year  at South by Southwest.  I remember seeing someone  give a TEDx talk.  I can't remember her name,  but she talked about the  spectrum of emotions and  feelings that games can  evoke and how narrow most of  the industry has been  focused on aggression and  fear and through violence  and warfare.  And their game was this big  canvas where you have this  little creature and you're  kind of you start off in the  middle of a desert and you're  wandering through the  journey.

Start time: 990.42
End time: 1004.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a journey?  Journey is such an amazing  you'd probably think of Jane  McGonigal.  I don't know.  It wasn't Jane.  She talks a lot about  gaming.  Journey is there's no  shooting.  Right.  So it answers the question,  can you have a game without  actually killing anybody?

Start time: 1004.96
End time: 1066.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Journey is about the  mechanics like the people  who make Journey did a  fantastic job of  understanding that what the  reason most people play  video games is for the  experience of doing the  thing, whatever it is, you  know, and in this case, they  make jumping and running a  joy and it's fun.  And there's moments when  you jump farther and  jump.  And there's this one moment  of Journey that I will  remember forever until I die  where it's like you're  going you're sliding down  this sand hill and the  camera pans sideways.  The sun is setting and it's  golden and beautiful and  it's something iconic and  beautiful.  It's like it's like an  impressionistic painting of  a moment from a character  who never existed.  And in that way, I think I  think, you know, games like  Journey will do well.  And then there's other  there's other ways to tell  stories like we're seeing  with Bioshock Infinite.  And of course, with the  with the Walking Dead,  there's more.  I think we're for the first  time.  And this is an exciting  time because gaming has  gotten mature enough that  we're starting to see the  splintering.  We're going to have to  start describing what you  can't just say.  It's a game.  You got to say, well, is  it a narrative game?  It's a story.  It's a world.  It's a not only is it

Start time: 1067.36
End time: 1116.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  narrative, but what kind  of narrative?  You know, is it a drama?  Is it a romance?  Is it funny?  I mean, because I mean, I  think that with with art,  at least with film, you  know, you have these  sub genres, right?  Like it's a film, but  there's lots of different  genres of film.  And in games, it really is  very much about, OK, you've  got to shoot something or  figure something out.  this strata, right?  There's the violent games  where you have to shoot  everybody.  And then there's the games  kind of like Journey where  it's more playful and it's  almost cartoonish.  And, you know, it's not  quite as it's not quite as  real.  Right.  And now we're starting to  see those two things come  together where you have all  these different mechanics  emotions and all this  narrative stuff happening.  But it also happened to be  a game that feels real or  that feels more like a  story that you can relate  to.  I do think it's odd, though,  that you're still killing  everybody in Bioshock.

Start time: 1116.88
End time: 1126.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's almost too bad.  It really is almost too bad.  You're still shooting  everybody you come in contact  with for the most part.  And you're looking for the  you're looking for the head  shot, right?  Yeah.  And that kind of takes the

Transcript:  right to party.  Let me real quick give you  guys a heads up for when  you do finish the game.  There is after the credits,  there is a delightful,  delightful moment that's  reminiscent of the end scene  in Inception.  You remember the very last  scene of Inception when the  top is spinning and you're  waiting to see whether it  falls.  Yeah.  There's stick around for  after the credits.  That's all I'm going to say  about that.  It is about good movies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  too.  So that's amazing.  He's a good pitch man for  Bioshock Infinite.  They say there's some  debate about how much it  costs.  The New York Times  estimated that the game  might have cost as much as  one hundred million dollars  to make plus one hundred  million dollars to promote.  Ken Levine said that's  crazy in Twitter.  But I bet you it's not far  off.  I bet you were talking  certainly a game that was  in the in the realm of the  cost of a major motion  picture.  One hundred million dollars  or more.  That'll live longer.

I mean, it's like you can  do some crazy numbers when  you're charging sixty  dollars ahead for a video  game.  So it doesn't surprise me  that they would be at that  level aren't video games

You know, it's not an  experience.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  What do you Brian is  saying 20 hours, 30 hours.  I would say I'm playing on  a hard level too.  I must be a better player  take me about 10.

Transcript:  See, it's funny that you  guys play on hard.  I learned a lesson from a  friend who I'm not going  to name because I don't  want to sell him out in  the video game industry  who was like, you just  want to you know, if you  really want to enjoy the  game and you don't want  to deal with having to  learn how to play it  really well, just play it  on easy because if you  just want to get through  it and have the experience  of playing it.  So I made the mistake  with dead space of  playing it on medium or  something.  And for literally for four  years, I stopped playing  it because I could not  get through one of the  levels.  Yeah.  And I was just like, I'm  never going to finish  this.  I picked it back up  recently and did finish  it.  It was extremely  rewarding.  But but for me, like I  have such limited time.  I've got maybe like an  hour or two at night  where I can play a game.  And so I'll just put it  on easy because I want  it.  By the way, for Bioshock,  the new one, it's  particularly good because  the story is so  compelling.  You just want to keep  going.  stuck somewhere.  So maybe also maybe I'm  just out of it.  By default, I'm the same  way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I got I got convinced  that what you should  always do is whatever the  normal mode.  That is the intended  gaming experience.  But in this case, Evan  Lottie over at PC  Gamer magazine, made a  little video that he put  on there saying saying  here's a case for why you  should go for hard.  And he swayed me.  So I went ahead and I  did that.  What is the case?

Start time: 1317.40
End time: 1342.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is the reason?  Well, it's funny that  you should say that,  Brian, because I  started on the middle of  the road because I agree  with you.  And I read that article  and I restarted the  game on hard.  He says you're going to  see more of the game  thing.  This is, by the way,  riding those rails.  Don't show this because  this is a little bit of a  spoiler.  So let's not show the  whole thing.  But but riding those  rails is there.  He said his point is and  I guess I don't know.  I'm not having played it  on easy that you will  see more of the game.  See it. How like what?

Start time: 1343.42
End time: 1359.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It all sticks like like  like when you play through  on normal and you only  die like four times in  the first four hours,  like like death feels  rubbery and it's like you  don't care.  But it's like if you want  to care about the  experience playing on  hard, if you're an  experienced gamer, I  think it's not my point

Start time: 1366.38
End time: 1396.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing about death that we  just did an article on a  panel that was a GDC.  And the gist of it was  basically we've diminished  the danger of death to a  point where it doesn't  matter every game.  Like you can die a million  times. There's no  consequence.  So what's the point of  dying at all?  You know, like what's the  there's no risk involved  anymore.  And actually, Bioshock is  a game where I've only  died a couple of times  playing on easy.  Maybe that's why.  But I've been really  surprised and like it  took me out of the moment  and kind of places you  somewhere you don't  expect to be.  And I hope I'm not  spoiling this story.

Start time: 1397.02
End time: 1408.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's story in that,  by the way. Keep playing  because there's a reason  why you get placed there.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'll tell you  something else.  When you jump off a  building, you don't die.  You immediately just get  put right back.  So they have both  modes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, where it's like  like they they  acknowledge the  difference between like  an oops versus like,  oh, no, you died,  which I thought was  interesting.  When you fall off the  building, it's like it  just jumps you know, you

Is there any is there  anything in the game that  would lead you to believe  that that's actually a  function of the floating  city?  You know, the technology  is it not that I know?

Transcript:  And I should say really,  I know you want to probably  move on. But but if you  haven't played the original  Bioshock, which has is  another game with an  with an incredible  narrative and also is a  very exciting game.  I think it's a lot more  action heavy than this  game and less heavy on  the narrative. But the  story in that game, that  took me a while to eat as  well. It's a long game.  But when you that's one  of those really rewarding  like, wow, you know, it  kind of a revelation as  far as game storytelling  goes, I think.  Oh, absolutely recommend  it. If you if you if  you're bored after playing  this and you don't know  what to do, you should go  play the first one if you  haven't. But if you have  to play the first one,  why do you even you know,  you should get off the  planet. I think I think  the PS3 version of

There's a little bit on the  sides you can see, but once  you're in, you kind of don't  see that stuff at all.  And the second thing is that  the the lag that the the  tracking is very low latency.  So when you move your head,  it feels like you're moving  your head.  It doesn't feel like you're  waiting for this thing to  catch up with you.  Like I'm watching my Skype  window right now and I'm  waiting for my head to do  what I think it should feel

They went with they went with  a lower resolution display for  the first version because they  wanted to focus on low latency  and getting that field of  vision big.  And I got to say, I I use this  CS and it completely blew my  mind.  My my my jaw was on the floor.  We had people in a room in our  trailer and there was a line  out the door because the  Oculus guys came by and people  were just lining up.  And every time somebody would  try it, their jaw was on the  floor.  I took it on late night and I  was like after after I got the  day before, I had been using it  a little bit and then we went  on the show and I was like,  maybe I have blown this out of  proportion.  Maybe I'm crazy.  And they brought it in the  morning to set it up for late  night.  And I went in in the afternoon  to go on and Gavin Purcell,  the producer there, was sitting  in the studio playing it and  literally his mouth was like a  gape and he was just like in  awe of the experience.

I was so sure we were going to  be living in like our it was  going to be like Neuromancer.  We were all lied to.  It's fine.  You know, but yeah, we were all  lied to in this.  When I put this thing on a user,  I was like, oh God, I'm going  to check into this and I'm  never checking out like so.  It's good.  Sounds like Ready Player One.  It'll make you sick.  Yes.

So we used to, you know, we  used to joke when we played Doom  or whatever.  It's like, you know, oh, you can  wear these glasses and it's kind  of 3D.  It's like it's all 3D to me,  whatever.  And he used to make fun of us  for the goggles.  He was so impressed with what he  saw from the tracking and the  field of vision that even though  he'll get no benefit from the  stereoscopic vision, he ordered  one for the full of what was  like fifteen hundred dollars for  a dev kit or whatever.

I mean, these are the guys who  pretty good people think.  Yeah.  And they're saying we love this,  we support it.  We want to do something with it.  I think that this has a real  chance when people start  creating software for it and  when they get this, you know,  they're only it's like I said,  it's only going to get better.  I really think this is it.  I think this is the start of  something pretty amazing.

Transcript:  But here's the other thing  that's exciting.  Not only do they do they figure  out that the field of vision  matters, that latency matters  and that resolution is  obviously, as you said, low now  to get things started, but  they're figuring out the right  products to associate it with.  For example, it's problematic,  the fact that you can't  physically run around in circles  wearing a VR goggles without  tying yourself in knots.  So it's being tightly tied to  titles where it makes sense to  where you're locked in but have  freedom to look all around.  For example, Hawken.  with Hawken, but Hawken is a  mech game, so it makes sense  that your hands would be tied  to the mouse and keyboard, but  you would be able to look all  around from inside the cockpit  of this vehicle.

I'll be able to lie in the bed  with the thing on and I can be  walking around Paris and then I  don't I'll be happy.  And but then I just felt like  that the promise was it failed  us.

And we went to Japan where all  things robot are a little too  close for comfort.  But I got to go into this dome  of a sort of virtual reality  environment.  You could walk 360 degrees and  vertical as well.  Really look all around.  The resolution was really,  really poor.  But you got to see a little bit  of where this is going.  But this is a huge it was a room.  You physically walked in the like  Professor X walked out into this  plank and you had a rail and you  stood at it.

I said I'm not going to you're  not going to do this hardcore  these hardcore gaming  experiences because it's not  that powerful.  She's like I think they  actually see it as a  companion like if you have a  PS3 or you have like this  is something you get it's ninety  nine bucks is not expensive  and it's you know people can  make games for anybody who  wants to make a game can make  it's not locked down right with  its own station.

Transcript:  addition to what I think  what's interesting for me  about it as someone who  doesn't play a ton of games  anymore but is excited about  new insurance having a  platform and a market place  and a store you can publish  to this right.  You know I still remember  publishing to the app store  on Apple versus the Play Store  on Android.  You just do it in the ladder  and it's people can download  it and you're done.  It creates more noise you  need curators help you figure  out what's good what's not you  might get flooded with a lot  of nonsense but the cost of  distribution and discovery  may be a bit lower.

Generally letting people  letting anybody make a game  that could be a 12 year old  kid it could be a person who's  just doing it as a hobby or  it could be like somebody  who's a serious contender but  can't pay ten thousand dollars  to get this thing put through  all of the channels you need  to go through to get it onto  Xbox Live.  I think that's a really  powerful you know before I  you know actually Chris Grant  the editor in chief of  Polygon who you should have on  the show if you haven't had  him on.  He brought that up to me and  we were talking about he's  like that's what's really cool  about this not that it's  going to be super powerful.  It's just that anybody can  publish to it and it's going  to read a door as a word for  this living room which we  haven't had.

Start time: 2549.52
End time: 2582.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Journey which we were kind of  raving about is also an  independent development it's on  the PlayStation 3 not on Ouya  or something like it but it's  an independent and very  innovative game.  So I agree I think we need  both.  I think we need platforms that  you can do a hundred million  dollar game like Bioshock  Infinite which just blows one's  mind but we should have a place  like YouTube which is a place  for people to start getting  their chops and video a place  for gaming developers get their  chops and games and it's ninety  nine bucks and roads free the  development tools are simple  and widely available.

Start time: 2583.56
End time: 2620.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I like that analogy with the  YouTube thing.  It's like you guys.  What because what YouTube has  done has given people a choice  like do you want to taste sugar  or do you want to be sugar.  And so it's allowed people to  discover like oh I get more joy  out of making someone laugh then  laughing at something myself.  And if we could do that in the  gaming world and if we are the  portal by which we're able to do  that that would be amazing.  I do have a question for Joshua  I don't know if you happen to  know but at ninety nine dollars  is the Ouya profitable or  because of course we're accustomed  to seeing all these game  consoles come out at first you  know as leaders so they can make  money on the on the software  later on.

Start time: 2621.62

Transcript:  Yeah well they said their goal  on Kickstarter was nine hundred  fifty thousand they made eight  point six million.  And they've continued to sell  them since then and beyond that  I mean they haven't been they  haven't talked about outside  investment but what I will say  is the guts of it are  essentially a smartphone with  hardly any storage and no radios.  So those are readily available  they're basically off the shelf  components and in fact Julie  Ehrman said look this is off the  shelf stuff this is not we're  not using some fancy custom GPUs  here.  So I think that the actual you  know there are a lot went into  R&D a lot a lot is obviously  going into production of these  things but when you've got like  eight point six million handy  plus you know maybe some outside  investment once you get rolling  and you're using off the shelf  components I think it brings the  cost way down.  profitable but I don't think  that they're I don't think  they're losing a ton of money  doing what they're doing right  now.

Yeah you don't see any of them  ahead of time.  Your job is to go and present  them in as cogent and clear and  so much like convincing away.  Yeah and then you leave the  room.  And then another person comes  up and does a different deck.  Same deck ideally what they  might switch it up on.  But it's ideal to see him do  the exact same deck because  then you see where people's  comedic and like improv instincts  take them.  It's good.

It's the moment when you put  on the glasses and they say  is everything OK or is  everything set up right.  And you say to them you're  like yeah yeah it says OK  glass.  And there's a moment you kind  of squeeze until your head.  And I guess the glasses heard  you say OK glass and  responded at that moment.  Like the fact that you in  casual conversation said  that and all of a sudden it  got picked up like that was  very very exciting.  Someone like that's how you

Start time: 3547.98
End time: 3572.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah that's how you trigger  that.  That's how you get the glass  to listen for a command is  that when you you have to  get them you have to wake  them up.  up.  You can touch the side of the  glass which is like a little  touch panel or you can tilt  your head up like that.  And when you do that it  wakes them up and then you  say OK glass to engage  command like OK glass Google  whatever or you know  navigate to you can do all  sorts of different take a  picture.

It's a very cool idea and I  think actually makes there  are a lot of good arguments  for what they're trying to do  with the product.  Like I think they made some  compelling arguments for why  it should exist.  And I think the biggest one  is like look everybody is  basically taking these things  out of their pockets and  staring at them all the time  and just to get little bits  of information it takes you  completely out of the moment  takes you away from what  you're doing and there might  be a better way to get that  information without it being  so totally controlling as  far as your attention goes.  And I think that's a really  compelling argument.  I also think it's kind of  amazing to be able to just  suddenly take a picture or  suddenly take a video when  something is happening like  my example is my dog does  hilarious stuff all the time  and I by the time I get my  camera how you own your dog

But the problem is they do  look ultimately completely  stupid on a person.  I mean like they just look  silly right.  And I I spent a long time  trying to find glasses that  look right on my face and  they don't write they're  making them so you can put  lenses in them but they  still look like glass.  I think this thing is going  to be really meaningful when  they partner with somebody  like Warby Parker which  they're thinking right.  Here's these cool chunky  hipster glasses.  And if you want to spend an  extra five hundred dollars  you can get them with Google  Glass notifications.

Transcript:  I think I think the way  though thinking on this needs  to be not.  It's like look.  You can't think about it like  I'm like Google Glass is going  to be a cool new thing that  everybody wears.  about it is Google Glass is  the beta version of what will  eventually be something or  could eventually be something  that everybody really wants  and uses.  But it has to get to a point.  It's like look at smartphones  OK.  Smartphones used to be bulky  used to have to use a stylus  with them and you know it's  like I had a trio.  I mean you've used the old  smartphones you know Windows  mobile devices.  They were terrible.  Only businessmen or people who  really needed a smartphone  used a smartphone.  And now it's like it took the  iPhone for us to all go oh  wait a second.  This could be really cool and  really useful and we want to  have them like with us all the  time.  It's going to take a moment  like something that is cool.

Transcript:  I think that you guys nailed  it when you compared it to the  segue.  The problem with the segue was  not that it was a bad device.  It was a fantastic device that  when you asked well who would  use this they didn't have an  answer for it.  Yeah.  So hold on.  Was the segue.  To tell a story they have to  they have to construct a  narrative.  They have to say when it's  appropriate and more  importantly when it's not  appropriate and then how you  can get it because nobody is  going to wear these when they  go out to dinner.

You want to take a walk now or I  don't want to get you angry.  I'm going to have this drink of  water.  I'm sure you share.  Actually no share file is really  amazing.  So we've all had this experience  you attach a file you know you  want to share a spreadsheet or  presentation or I don't know a  sales contract something you  attach it to email and you mail  it either bounces back or they  I mean it's just a mess.  They didn't get it.  You don't know if they got it.  Share file is a better way of  sharing files.  You can still use email because  it has an outlook plug in but  it's not email.  What you're sharing actually is  a secure link size doesn't  matter.  You can send files and almost  giant files almost any size you  control not only who gets to see  it but you'll get an email when  they check it.  You can say for how long they  can see it for how how many  times they can download it.  You have total control because  your share file stuff is synced  automatically with the cloud.  You can check your share file  anywhere from any device  smartphone tablet laptop and  that's nice too because that  means if you forget as I often  do to send a file out I use it  for sharing audio with radio  stations on the radio show and  they call and say we didn't get  the ad you recorded.  Oh no but I got it on my phone.  I just press a button and it's  there and shared.  I'll tell you what if you're not  using share file yet it's great.  Look at all the industries  hundreds of industries.  It's HIPAA compliant.  So you know it's compliant with  a lot of government regulations  in a variety of industries.  If you're not shooting using  share file yet I want you to  sign up for my free trial.  No credit card required.  It's very easy.  Nothing to lose.  You know go to share file dot  com click on the microphone at  the top of the page and enter  twit T.W.I.T.  That's all you need.  See at the top of the page  there's a there's like a  microphone or as I heard it on  a podcast thing.  That's the one you want.  And then you enter the offer  code.  Twit thank you so much share  file and Citrix for sponsoring  the show even though Josh.  Was on it.

It's still almost as expensive  as the other companies.  They've always been a little  bit cheaper.  They're still a little bit  cheaper but it's not like  super cheap.  The interesting thing is the  idea that if you're buying a  phone right like I've got a  phone or I have an iPhone and  18 and I'm sick of 18 T.  You can go to T-Mobile with  your phone right.  Get service.  You hate it.  You're like I'm out of here.  There's nothing stopping you  from doing no contracts back  and money.  So okay.  And the word what was that

This is something that we  talked a lot on frame rate  about the fact that you know  Amazon following the  footsteps of Netflix is  investing a lot of money in  originals which is which is  good news like more  competition is better  whether or not you're an  Amazon Prime fan or not.  The fact that another  player is deciding to  bypass the traditional  television medium is not  here's the libertarian I

Transcript:  But anyhow you know look a  few years ago AMC just  showed old movies right.  And they were like hey let's  make a show.  And they made some amazing  television.  I see that like as we bring  down the barrier of what  looks like television like  I turn on my Xbox and watch  TV.  Right.  Like I don't make a  distinction between Netflix  and Hulu and my cable box  very much at this point.

Start time: 5497.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I'm like I watch TV as  much as possible.  Me too.  Me too.  Me too.  Love TV.  Extremely relaxing and  entertaining.  Exactly.  But.  But so the thing is when  that when that comes down  like when there's no  difference for the viewer  between where they're  getting it from why  shouldn't Netflix why  shouldn't Amazon.  Why shouldn't Hulu be  making their own stuff.

Start time: 5521.36
End time: 5538.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not as sanguine about  this as being as you are  Brian as this being a  great development.  I see this as purely  economic.  They look at who's making  the money and what is the  future of offering  streaming content as  Netflix is doing versus  being an HBO and they  want to be an HBO.  That's all they say.  This is where you make  the money.  And that's good.

Start time: 5556.92
End time: 5571.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean Hollywood uses  Hollywood uses their the  rights as leverage the  cable companies use rights  as leverage.  Everybody's trying to use  the access to the content  as leverage.  If Netflix suddenly has  its own content they  don't have to worry about  the leverage.  They've got it.  Good.  This is good for comedy.

Transcript:  This is also good for  freedom.

Start time: 5572.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is great for television  in general because all  these companies that are  right now studios that  are making television  shows aren't going to go  away even if television as  we know it right now is  going to go away right now.  Their relationship is  having a cost per  subscriber model with  cable companies and  there's no reason why that  model can't continue to  shift further and further  to a direct to consumer  right relationship.  So right now from a person  who wants to make  television you now have  more places to go and  companies like Amazon  Netflix because they want  to establish themselves  are outpacing budget wise  established and entrenched  people even the ones that  do it right like HBO.  You know Netflix outbid  HBO which is an important  distinction to make.  It's not like they just  went to Netflix because  they think it was going to  be a better thing or they  were the only people who  wanted to make it.  They were the ones who  wanted to pay them way more  than HBO did and I think  Amazon's going the same  route which really lifts  all tides for people who  are fans of good  television and not  necessarily just common  denominator television  which is currently what is  dominating.

Start time: 5715.80
End time: 5764.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a good shot.  It's a weird shot.  Here's here's something  that is going to happen.  That's too much reality.  So we have TV has  succeeded in part I think  and I don't have data this  is just me making things  up that sound reasonable  because it's simple and  when we start diversifying  the different outlets that  all these shows can come  through Netflix over here  Amazon over there who knew  over here iTunes only in  certain cases plus  traditional pay cable  premium cable over the air  broadcast.  There will be a mess made  of trying to find the  market for some of these  things.  And how does the person  who just hears about a show  from their co-worker from  their friend from someone  in their family know oh I  need this kind of box or  this type of subscription  that may end up being a  bit of a mess down the line.  I don't think we're there  yet but it is a matter of  time.  We make an assumption we

Start time: 5764.38
End time: 5808.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  make an assumption because  we're in the media lead or  whatever that is that is  actually not true which is  that these shows that we  love Game of Thrones and  Mad Men and stuff are  actually getting gaining  audience.  The truth is far more  people watch Honey Boo Boo.  In fact 7 million people  watched American Idol.  That's more than watch Mad  Men.  That's more than watch a  lot of these shows.  National Treasure was a hit.  It's a hit movie.  So but what is really to be  celebrated is that a show  with a much smaller audience  than traditional network  television can can be made  and can be made profitably  and that's what's  celebrated.  And so really the truth is  that's why we have so much  of diversity now and that's  a good thing.  And it's why people like me  and Joshua who are actually  brilliant intellectuals can  admit to liking TV again.  Yeah.  I think I think part of it

Start time: 5809.20
End time: 5847.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is when you when you kind  of democratize this and  look it is a mess.  You're right.  It's a mess right now.  But when you democratize  the production of this  stuff and the distribution  of this stuff what you find  is first off it's it's way  cheaper and easier to make  really high quality stuff  now than it used to be.  It's way cheaper and easier  to distribute that high  quality stuff.  When you democratize that  what you find is you can  build very passionate  smaller followings that can  make things profitable and  make things viable.  You don't have to convince  every person in America  that they've got to watch  the show.  And I think as HBO  demonstrates they found  small groups that love  shows and they're willing  to pay for it.  And so their business is  profitable.  But the other thing that

Start time: 5847.62
End time: 5866.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you also the other you're  on the right track Joshua  but I think you're you're  looking in the wrong place.  If you want to see the  place where fleet footed  agile cheap television  compelling content is made  it's going to be in YouTube  and that's the reason that  you're seeing Google just  throw millions of dollars  of stuff like the free space  down in LA.  You're just talking about

Start time: 5867.14
End time: 5871.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the fact that that was  thrown down the hole.  None of those channels  made their money back.

Start time: 5871.62
End time: 5910.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's right.  And actually are one of  our sister sites SB Nation  is one of the channels  and they've and they're  doing a different deal.  Now it's a much smaller  deal.  I think they threw a lot  of money and stuff in they  didn't know exactly what  they're doing.  I actually think your  point is right.  But it's not just about  YouTube it's about  creators on the Internet  it's about people who are  like us for instance.  We make I like to think  pretty high quality video  content.  We make it at a budget  compared to you know it's  tiny budget compared to  what most people would  spend on it.  And we have a huge  growing audience who loves  that stuff and I think  that we wouldn't be able  to do that if it weren't  for the Internet existing  as a distribution method  and the cost of creating  that stuff coming way  way down thanks to new  cameras and new editing  technology that's made its  way easy.  I would think that.

Start time: 5915.08
End time: 5954.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I didn't have my  ultimate point is just  that it's not about  YouTube or some other  particular channel  channels are over.  That's the thing.  The idea is the content  can live on the Internet.  You can go get it when  you need to get it where  you need to get it.  That's the whole point of  House of Cards.  I mean yes Netflix is  making it and  distributed on Netflix.  But the idea that you  can make a show here 13  at 12 episodes go get it.  We've already done it we  paid for it.  It's on there for you to  watch like that's the  thing that has that has  happened.  It's a big deal.  YouTube is a big part of  it but it's not just  YouTube it's everywhere.  It's all over the Internet  people are doing.  I mean YouTube is a  distribution method  right.  But it's not so you know  it's not the creator of  the content they're  looking for people who  will create the content  for them.  And it's it's about the  crowd.

Start time: 5962.64
End time: 6004.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick so it's just one  more depressing view from  you on life.  We just got to do this  all again because you  guys have so much stuff  to say.  It's great.  So I just I want to  challenge a little bit the  idea that channels don't  matter at all because what  I think is also absolutely  true along with general  more freedom being  generally good more shows  being created lots  terrible lots of bad  sloppy stories out there  bad shooting bad audio  but getting attention to  the good thing is possibly  harder because not  everyone's looking in the  same place to find it.  So marketing that stuff  is a great challenge  finding your audience  saying vaguely good people  make good things and  other people find them  doesn't actually solve the  problem of how people  actually find the show.  I agree we were just  looking at a great video

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  objectively amazingly good  stuff.  It's hard to get noticed  search is like  discoverability right now  is broken because you've  got a hundred you know  a hundred different  services a hundred  different boxes.  I think that's going to  come together it's going  to it's going to move in  a direction where it's  about it's the Google of  finding shows not so much  like picking a service or  a box and going with it.  But I think to your point  like yes it's hard to get  noticed but hell on wheels  followed madman or  whatever and like who  watches hell on wheels.  I mean it's canceled as  far as I know.

Start time: 6046.50
End time: 6059.02

So the thing about it is  discoverability and getting  notice is always going to  be hard when it comes to  entertainment or something  you want people to you  know you want people to  love the stuff you make.  It's hard.  It's becoming less hard  for more people.  Yeah that's right.  It's hard in general.  You know the people can
