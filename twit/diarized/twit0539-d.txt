Long tradition between Microsoft and Intel fact  I'll never forget interviewing Andy Grove remember him when he was the CEO of Intel and he said it's all Microsoft's fault  We make great 64-bit chips and they keep giving us these crap operating systems. So it's never ending  It's a never-ending. Sorry boys Andy Grove. I loved Andy Grove  Whatever happened to him. He was a great story he he would  He told he was a Hungarian refugee who tells the story of crawling on his  Through a minefield and barbed wire to get out of Hungary in the 50s when of course it was still a Soviet satellite  Crawling through a minefield to get out of Hungary came the United States  There's you know  Not to get political but there's so many great stories of people who emigrated here and and really made a difference

Definitely worth picking up only the paranoid survived  Was that one of them something like that? Only the paranoid survive is a good one. And then the other one is  about leadership and I can't think of what it's called now, but it's

No, I had a lock screen  So I had a phone and it said please call this number if you find the phone  so I get this call yesterday such a nice person and  I said, okay  well  let's figure out a way for you to get your money back first because that's the most important thing at this point and then we'll  Figure a way to get it back because my work phones property the New York Times and then eBay they called the seller  To let the seller know the buyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the seller immediately messaged the buyer of the phone and was like I'll give you your money back  Just send the phone back to me. Don't report it. I know  Totally insane totally insane. So I did reach out to eBay and I said hey, how do we get this taken care of?  So this nice honest person gets his money back and I can return this phone, which is now broken also  He was also sold a broken phone  Get this broken phone back to my office and I haven't figured it out yet a little note to crooks who watch twit

Start time: 547.86
End time: 564.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard that one of the reasons they ask for you to when you take a phone to be fixed at the Apple Store  They ask you to unlock it and turn off find my iPhone  One of the reasons they want to do that is they want to verify that it's your phone  And you have a password to it so that would be a way around right like oh it doesn't work  Get me a new one and then you've got a

Start time: 567.52
End time: 569.96

Start time: 570.24
End time: 573.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 574.22
End time: 589.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your your Apple account it may also be because Apple isn't that great at  Dealing with phones that haven't been properly logged out and keeps them around as kind of ghosts  But but that's my understanding is that it may it may be in part because they want to verify that you actually own that device

End time: 662.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're working it out. I think that originally they gave  Originally they gave the buyer who was really trying to do the right thing  When he went to them because he's not a reporter when he went to them  He got well if this hasn't been reported to the police and it doesn't show up on check mend calm  Which is a phone verification website that I can't imagine many people, you know are using they don't it doesn't show up  there's no way to prove it was stolen and  It's just you got to send it back to the seller and get your money back from him and work it out with him  This guy was like a thief  possibly  And of course the gentleman didn't want to send it back to the seller he thought that was wrong so  He he got back in touch with me and let me know what's going on. I said, you know what?  We'll figure it out and an honest guy money back. Yeah, he's really honest. He's a nice person. How much did he pay?  He paid a hundred dollars. Yeah  Yeah, and he fixes iPhone screen. So when in the description it said that the screen was cracked  He thought oh, that's no big deal. I can fix that and then I'll have a working phone  He was buying it for a friend's mother for Christmas because she didn't have a smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting story you think with you know, you're clout and I know you've brought this to Twitter  So it's in public that they would respond more quickly, but they're being quick. I just don't really know

Start time: 687.12
End time: 691.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't want to criticize them too hard. So we figure I might come out. Okay. Yeah

Start time: 696.18
End time: 712.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So as we're talking iPhones we should talk a little Apple news Samsung says  we're gonna pay the  The amount that the court has dinged us for in the patent dispute and it's not the full amount is it Katie?  548 million wasn't it over a billion?

Start time: 713.54
End time: 729.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Originally but a lot of the a lot of the pieces of the case were dismissed or  Relevant so the number got whittled down and whittled down. I love this story so much  I really want like Tim Cook and Phil Schiller to be photographed outside Apple HQ holding like one of those big checks

Start time: 733.60
End time: 744.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The way I view this is that it's gonna be Samsung's gonna play it pay entirely in coins wasn't that the rumor  They're gonna bring it all in coins  Dump truck and nickels and an apple give him back some Apple store credit

Start time: 746.62
End time: 760.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just to be as passive aggressive so Samsung says we'll pay it  But we also want to be able to get it back  If the judgment is reversed modified vacated or set aside on appeal, which I think doesn't seem unfair

Start time: 762.34
End time: 783.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I guess that's not how these things work and it's also sort of setting the company up for bringing the case  Somewhere else and when you think where else could they possibly bring it one of those places is the Supreme Court which they  nod to in their statement as well, so I think that  We can probably expect some sort of move on Samsung's part to bring this case before the Supreme Court

Start time: 784.46
End time: 811.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung's called  Called the Mount Apple's grossly exam or exaggerated damages claim and frankly it is  Because it'd be pretty hard to prove that Apple lost half a billion dollars in iPhone sales  Because of Samsung's crappy copies  It was it was the first Samsung phones that looked yeah admittedly were copied from the iPhone  But I doubt that it cost Apple half a billion dollars in damages. Well, it got Apple

Start time: 811.58
End time: 830.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it got Android in the game, right?  Yeah, so even if that generation of phones didn't sell very well  It was the it was generation of phones that proved Android could make something that was even vaguely comparable  Which then set the market up to go forward?  I think if you were Steve Jobs, you'd probably be thinking that half a million half a billion was an absolute steal, right?  You know

Start time: 832.94
End time: 843.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Billion in the original lawsuit. They said it'll be two and a half billion  Please I don't know how much of that is damages and how much of that is statutory probably mostly damages, right Katie

Start time: 844.42
End time: 871.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and there were some things that were also dropped as well  Like to other people's points things like pinch to zoom Apple just really you know that that patent they said  That's just not something that you can say really was just yours. So  Slide to unlock was another one, right? Exactly. Exactly  So it'll be interesting to see what happens is these companies continue to drag out  What is a drop in the bucket in terms of money for both of them? Yeah. Well certainly for Apple

Start time: 871.78
End time: 890.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although Samsung's phone sales haven't been great of late. It might be that like I can't say they need the money  they still make bulldozers and  refrigerators and chips and ships  full of money  Hey, even even for a giant caretsu. It's a half a billion is not insignificant

Start time: 892.28
End time: 896.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that a waste of all of our time and all the companies time and money to do this whole thing?

Start time: 896.50
End time: 920.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the what is the cost the court costs? What are the costs?  We the people are paying for this and I think it was became very clear. In fact, I have to say Tim Cook has kind of  Toned this war down considerably, but it was clear  There was some cost to Apple and just in the discovery phase in the in the revelations  About how Apple works that they really didn't want people to know I think that that's a bigger cost in some ways to Apple

Start time: 920.91
End time: 937.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree  I you know  This was Steve Jobs being angry and I think maybe rightfully so about feeling like they got ripped off by Samsung and that Samsung was building  Their business on something that was a ripoff of an Apple product  I think that's all true but to go nuclear as he said and and do this know there are no winners here

Start time: 938.88
End time: 947.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely, and you shouldn't let emotion like that run a business that's that's a risky although  Gosh, you can't knock anything Steve Jobs did he certainly whatever he did it worked

Start time: 948.16
End time: 951.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think I think letting emotion run the business was the Steve Jobs. Yeah

Start time: 953.66
End time: 964.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to take the good with the bad there  But this was I would put this in the bad column where he's got a vendetta against them and it's not necessarily gonna do anything  Good for Apple, but he feels like you know, he felt it was right to do this. So they did it

Start time: 964.96
End time: 981.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kudos for Apple to Apple they open source Swift  They said they would when they announced Swift Swift is a new programming language Apple designed initially for writing software for Macintosh's and  Ios, but they have now  Literally, I mean quite literally open sourced it

Start time: 982.68
End time: 987.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that means it's a good week for open source, right? Because Microsoft has just done the same thing with with the edge engine

Start time: 988.06
End time: 1023.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, the browser engine. It's called. What is it Karma? What is the name of the browser engine?  Catmandu it'll come to me  It's interesting how my brain works. It's it's it's with a K  So Swift we already we've seen it's on github. We've already seen I think a Linux implementation. In fact, I found a  really cool site  This is the playground at IBM. Yeah, IBM is doing a swift sandbox  They already have it up and running so you can go to IBM Swift sandbox and literally type in Swift code  Online and see the output. Yeah, it all runs

Start time: 1024.14
End time: 1035.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know it's running on the server and you can put the Swift code in there and it's a pretty cool idea  You know whether it spreads far and wide or not  It is a it's a nice gesture by Apple to to make it open source

Start time: 1035.82
End time: 1060.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know one of the things that's really great about Swift is not part yet of this and that's the playground  The playground is a great teaching tool as we get this is the week of code  Of course the hour of code this week code org  trying to get kids all over the world not just the US to spend at least an hour learning to code and  Swift is really great for that because of this playground which gives you an opportunity to kind of like this see your code run and  mess around with it in a

Start time: 1061.32
End time: 1079.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Graphical way and the way Swift is structured my understanding. I'm not a programmer  My understanding is that it's actually pretty good for education because yeah kids can get going  Fairly quickly and see the effects of small changes in their code without a lot of the code overhead  That's required for some more complex languages. Yeah more familiar

Start time: 1079.96
End time: 1133.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, it would be great for Apple if more people were coding in what will be I think it's  Its official language  There's issues with objective C. We talked about this on security now, and I've never really verified it  Maybe maybe you could ask your  developer friends  Steve Gibson says one of the problems with security on iOS  Comes down to objective C and the way it resolves function names  It's possible to hide access to internal functions to non published functions in an app because you don't have to call them by name  You can hash the name and objective C. There's no way to turn that off  It's just part of how it resolves function names  He says it's a it's a we've already seen an exploit based on that. He says that's not going to be the end of it  There's gonna be a lot more so maybe Apple knowing this is anxious to move off of objective C on objective C

Start time: 1133.32
End time: 1200.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean this goes back to the next day's this is the reason objective size to development tool of choice for  iOS and OS X is because it was the development tool of choice to the programming language of choice  For next step back in the day and when the OS X came out there was a long  progression but pretty much now you need to use X code and you  Basically need to use objective C and Swift is the you know eventual replacement and is simpler and is higher level and has a  lot of features that just weren't you know weren't there or weren't available or weren't practical when next step was being worked on but  It was a long time ago. So, you know in the background they worked for whatever five years something like that on Swift and and  You know, I what I hear from developers is that for certain tasks it is fantastic  But it's also new and it's still growing and they're still making changes  2.0 version of the language spec that actually sort of changed some of the rules which on one level if you learn to write in  Swift and then they change the rules that's scary  but on another level it shows that they're listening and  They want to progress the language and not just sort of say oh well, we made a mistake  We can never go back which would be they were very clear about that when Swift 1.0 came out

Start time: 1200.88
End time: 1237.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an unfinished language. It will change and it has Swift 2.0 is current every seems like though  There's also boasting rights. Every company has to have its own language, you know  Microsoft's got C sharp Apple's got Swift Google's got go  Yahoo's got Brooklyn ease. I don't know what Yahoo's got. They got nothing  Hey forget about it  I want to I want to talk about what's going on at Yahoo because that's an interesting story  Also the grand unified theory of Apple products and John Gruber in a surprising  Breach of his relationship with Apple calls says the Mac app store is rotting

He's parsing some things that Phil Schiller Apple's VP of product marketing  Has talked about in an interview and sort of put it in line it's it's interesting to see you know with Apple sometimes you've got a  You got to look at what their statements are and try to divine from that what they're what they're  Behind it is Kremlin ology. We are reading the tea leaves here and in this case  It's how they describe these individual products and it's an interesting  Way to look at it  Which is they sort of say the watches for things that you used to be able to do on the phone  The phone is for things that you could do on the iPad the iPads for things you could do on a laptop the laptops for  Things you could do on the desktop and the desktop is for us to invent new things and that's literally what they seem to be saying

Transcript:  It all has this cascade this natural flow and it you know there's a  Yeah, yeah, like  But rush cause it kind of makes sense because and you almost need this because you wonder well  How does the watch fit into this overall scheme?  And I think there's some concern because Apple's don't remember when Steve Jobs came back to Apple the first thing  He did was slash product lines  He very famously went up to the whiteboard drew a big plus sign and said we're gonna have four quadrants business consumer  Portable desktop and that's it. That's it anything that doesn't fit into that is gone  And they killed many many product lines and always said the most important word in business is no  Remember, what was this one of the one of the biographies where or maybe Johnny I've I think he mentioned this in an interview  He said every day Steve would come to me and say how many times you say no today Johnny and he wanted to hear a big  number  Well in two in though four years since jobs passed away Apple has doubled the number of products from 12 to 24  And if you take in the various skews, it's even more. I mean, it's really gotten fairly complicated  Neil points out that part of this is is just Apple's ability to manage a supply chain better an ability to manufacture better  But it's nice to hear that there's still a rationale. Maybe you don't have a quadrant  But there's a rationale behind what is Apple's doing. Does this make sense to you? I think so

Transcript:  I mean  Again how much of this is is marketing and how much of this is what they think behind the scenes what?  criminologists like to believe is that Apple statements to the public can be  Reverse engineered to be something about the understanding about how they run their business  Yeah, I don't think so and I think it's part of it, but it's not it's not the whole picture  What's that that I'm gonna I think I'm quoting dr  Who here where I say that a footprint doesn't look like a boot, right?  Just because there's a footprint there  It doesn't mean you know what boot the person was wearing and what the shape of the boot was and I think there's a little  Of that going on here, but look this is the only information we have to their behavior and their statements to the to the press  That we can use to understand sort of like what does Apple think their business is and where are they going and?  Why do they make the decisions they make and so that's why criminal analogy happens very important though

Transcript:  It's one of the nice things about the this above-eval piece is that when you parse what is said you can see?  That it is very disciplined you can see that every statement that Phil Schiller makes about every product is  parallel with the others like they're so obviously there are lines and everybody knows what to say and  when they ask what who's the Apple watch for they have an answer and  It's gonna be the same answer and they're very disciplined about that in fact again  We talked about Steve Jobs and and how you you know when you have Steve Jobs you get what you get good and bad  He was the most undisciplined person in some ways  he would say all sorts of crazy stuff from time to time because he he was mad or because he wanted to and  Tim Cook's Apple super disciplined

I'm wearing an Apple watch, but I've said myself  It's a feels like a flop. It feels like it didn't live up to its promise  You know and it doesn't it's more complicated.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's so I think it's just so early right we have this vision that whenever my whenever Apple comes out with with anything  It's gonna be perfect from day one  It's gonna revolutionize our lives from day one and actually we have that idea of it  And it's never been the case like it's that's never happened like when the iPhone came out  It took years to revolutionize while they had the app store right when the iPad came out  It was just like an iPhone  You know you remember they had the thing where you could double the size of apps so that you could use like apps that weren't  Out on iPad you could still use the iPhone versions  I mean that was a horror show and  Yet we still sort of continue to think that Apple's gonna release something is gonna be fully formed and perfect from day one  I think this is you know much better than  The iPad was on was on day one  It's much better than the iPhone was on day one is it as good as the iPhone or the iPad on now?  Absolutely not will it get there you know it?  I'm absolutely convinced it well, and I agree with  With with the with the guys on the blog like I think it's completely underestimated

Transcript:  You're very interesting to to see this in light of the comments that Angela Arendt's made  She was at the fast company festival in New York City  And it's really one of the first times they put her out in public it was it's been very odd  I'm trying to figure what is I keep expecting her to show up on stage somewhere  she finally does and and  In if you look at look at the context of all this is what all the different products are for and these are the kinds  Of people therefore her push was really more around  Productivity like how she wants to rearrange the stores by how we'll use the products or what use cases they can solve whether that's music  or making music or videos or  business tasks and how each product can somehow fit into  Our lives in in the way that we get up and work and live so something like the watch  That feels very much to me like a product. It just hasn't really found its use case yet  I mean how long does the iPad existed and only now are we seeing it being given a real business tool?  purpose with the accessories necessary and the size necessary for people who are architects or designers to really use  The iPad and that's just happening now, but I think that there's a chance that could be successful, right?  So the watch is for us. We had high expectations for it because we own a lot of Apple stuff  And we wanted to be as cool as our phones are  But for somebody who doesn't own a lot of Apple products or as new to the company for them  It will probably be a much more natural process of oh  I wonder what I can do with this in my daily life  Like maybe my watch is going to be the thing that I only use for business purposes  Because I like the way it reminds me for meetings every 20 minutes  I'm never late again and that in and of itself is a wonderful  Tool that maybe somebody who is using their Katie that for me doesn't care about that for me has changed my life by the way

Start time: 1904.96
End time: 1932.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like I just always tell people the Apple watch makes me like a  Way more polite person because rather than checking my phone every 10 minutes when I'm in a meeting  If I get a little tap on my wrist  I know it's time to go and there's no need for me to be looking at anything else  Apart from the personal thing that I'm supposed to be doing it would be worth  It'd be worth it just for that in my view and I know that's like a really niche use case  But actually that's a niche use case that a lot of people wouldn't appreciate unless you ever actually tried it, right?

Transcript:  And if you're if you're looking at life in the bigger context of okay, what's productivity for me?  And what is business for me? There's your use case for the watch say you're not that person say you're a physician  Maybe there's a use for the watch that's totally different from timekeeping or if you're an artist  There might be a use for that's totally different and again  it's just going to be a matter of those purposes coming together over time with experimentation and  App developers creating tools that will like or we won't I'm open to that notion

Transcript:  But I think like the iPad Pro the Apple watch is a  Concept that's yes to be proven. It's it's all potential and  And actually I've started mostly potentially I start wearing again. Well, I'll give you an example  We flew to Vegas on the Thursday and I thought coming home, you know  I really should put the boarding pass in my phone and then transfer it over to my watch and  The only people are gonna do this. I think having done it now  Are people are really kind of?  Geeks who are dedicated to getting this thing working because it's not as convenient  Let's I'm be completely honest as going up to the kiosk putting out your boarding pass and carrying it  You have to kind of fuss with it as you're walking up the line to make sure it's on the screen and then you and  Then you saw on the watch and you have to and then you can't with this Virgin America  So you can't fit the watch on right scanner

I think I'd like to be right now  but I think I see people flying like at the like I'd fly a lot right for work and  I see you use electronic boarding passes. Yeah, absolutely  Because you get you know, if you have something like the the British Airways Apple the Virgin app that's integrated with passbook  You get a little reminder that says hey  Do you want to check in and you swipe and you and you and you check in online?  It says hey  Do you want to add this boarding pass to your passbook?  Can you go? Yeah, sure  And then as soon as you get to the airport it pops up on your screen and you're like, okay  It's right here on my screen as soon as I walk into the terminal and I see more and more and more and more people  Doing that, you know what? I'm queuing up for over a domestic flight now or like a European flight  I see, you know at least maybe 20% of the people with mobile boarding passes on their phones

Transcript:  Well, I'm open to the idea and but  Katie about Angela's comments are  Exactly as you said Jason in alignment with this whole notion of the watch will grow into  Tasks that the phone does right now, but you will find more useful on the watch Mike only  When I say flop, I don't mean in sales flop  I don't judge a new technology product by sales. That's not I'm not in a business reporter  I'm judging it by utility  Applicability to what purpose and it hasn't made itself indispensable to you farf. Yeah, and so I understand  I'm also an individual case. I'm not a universal case  All right, but but I try to look at it with a kind of a universal mind. It's fiddly. There's there's there's there's touch  There's a knob. There's a button. There's a the UI is complex  Maybe overly complex. I feel that there and as Ken from Chicago said in our chat room  This is one of the first Apple products  We've seen he says that didn't have a cohesive story about how people would use it. They just say here's some features, you know

Transcript:  Think that it's going to be interesting to see how this  Plays out. I'm not like a big watch advocate because I don't use mine as much as a lot of people  I know but it kind of reminds me of very early days of the PC where people would get these boxes to their houses and  Be like what the hell do I do? It's a thing like I it wasn't until desktop publishing. I think that people were like, oh  Now I understand there's a real use case for this enormous  Ugly machine. I keep lying around the house that all I've done is play games on  So I think that the watch if it works out is going to be similar people  It could be a while before we're like, oh, of course, we're all going to pay for things with this watch

I think there's we're in the the  Well, the watch is in the checkbook balancing phase, you know when you first got a PC all you really could  I'll balance my checkbook again and again because it didn't do anything  And and so this is a product full of potential waiting  So I'll be I mean I'm open-minded about that, but I just feel as of as of today  It's not a particularly compelling product for those of us who have it, you know, we already paid for it  So, you know what gave one who is our 13 year old?

Transcript:  All right Gruber  Gruber's been straying off the reservation a lot lately  He talks about the fact that sketch which is an app actually an internet that's been in the conversation a lot because  Bohemian coding the folks who did it  Said that they were not going to do an iPad Pro version of an app that would be great on the iPad Pro because they didn't feel  like  They could sell a $99 app on an iPad without a demo version or something, you know  Apple wasn't really helping them now they pull it from the Mac app store  Because of a bunch of gripes about you know, I mean there's issues about  Updating there was a certificate expiration problem. That was a real issue with Apple  They let their certificate expire and a lot of apps said hey, you know, I can't run anymore  So so he says there's a lot of reasons why we're taking sketch from the Mac app store  App review takes at least a week. There are technical limitations  Imposed by the guidelines  Sandboxing and so on upgrade pricing unavailable. That's a big issue for expensive apps  If you spend if you buy Adobe  Photoshop, you don't want to pay a full price for an upgrade and Adobe does want to make some money on the upgrade  in any event

Start time: 2512.08
End time: 2536.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's this is a problem. That's a problem with the iOS app store to the  The the differences are that Mac apps tend to be more professional and they tend to have bigger  Prices and what that leads to is issues about you know, how do I charge for upgrades? Well, you can't how do I give people a trial?  Well, you can't so you can restructure your app to be sort of freemium within an app purchase of some features

Start time: 2536.76

Start time: 2544.88
End time: 2595.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I can you can build it that way  And you've got to architect your app to have features that are behind and in that purchase and it gets complicated  And on the Mac you can just bail out  That's the bottom line is the Mac app store was seen as a place you wanted to be despite all of these limitations plus the technical  Like the sandboxing and security limitations  You'd like you would go through them because you needed to be there because it was gonna be a rocket that you could strap yourself  To and it would drive your app into the stratosphere and it would sell just like iOS apps sold and you'll be a millionaire  And the fact is Mac App Store  I mean all the anecdotes are people who rank in the top ten with their app and then report that they didn't really make  Very much on it. It looks like there's not a lot going on in most parts of the Mac App Store  And so at that point  Why would you put in the money and time to build the Mac App Store version of your app when it's easier to just sell it?

I never thought I'd be saying that and  Vulnerabilities in the mobile app and cloud storage used by the doll could have allowed hackers to eavesdrop on  Children's intimate play sessions  So they're gonna fix it toy talk says alright they've showed us we've fixed many of the issues they've raised  The researchers say they told toy talk about this weeks ago. The company has been very responsive good news, but that's a concern  you know, you know, you know a  Number of people have been kind of concerned in general about the privacy impact of hello Barbie the way it works  the child has the Barbie presses a button on its stomach and talks to it and  It's sent then to the internet where a server processes it and the doll responds with one of thousands of pre-recorded messages  So people are you know understanding that that's a little effect there was this petition that said that that's creepy I  Don't know you find that creepy.

Yeah, it's it's just um  Security flaws should probably be thought of before things. This is always the problem, right?  It's not whether or not they're creepy at the end of the day because this is sort of what life is becoming  We don't love it, but it is happening  it's that the people who are making the  speakers or the dolls or the teddy bears  Might think of security as an afterthought in part because they're like, well, what the hell would somebody do?  It's like 24 hours of audio of some random kid talking to a doll  You know, it's not like with those conversations  But it's still sort of like the idea that people and manufacturers are irresponsible and don't care that I think it's probably more disturbing

Yes, let's be real  So there has been a surprising amount of snark about this by the way  So Mark wrote a long letter to our daughter published Tuesday with the announcement of  Max her name is max max's birth and kind of buried the lead because in the final paragraphs he mentions  Oh, and by the way, we're gonna give away 99% of our Facebook shares currently worth 45 billion dollars during our lives  To advance personalized learning curing disease connecting people building strong communities  Wonderful, they created the Chan Zuckerberg initiative  and they formed now and this is where the snark began an LLC not a  charitable foundation as most most would but an LLC and I  Think there's it's a little bit of an unfair  Bit of snarking going on. I mean, I think it's genuine that they plan to give away  45 well currently 45 billion is probably gonna be a lot more  99% of their fortune. That's what Bill Gates is doing Warren Buffett is doing  How do you all feel feel about the the notion that because it's an LLC they can for instance  Channel tax away they can make profit

Transcript:  I mean any charitable donation is taxable. I mean we right so so we and we do that because we want people to give to charity  there's a reason why that exists, so I don't think that should be criticized and  the LLC structure is  It gives them a little bit more optionality in terms of what they give their money to you know  So they can give the money to they can even invest in stations  Yeah, they can also invest it in the same way that like I don't know Harvard management company invest the endowment so that they can  Always have a lot of money to give to Harvard you know what I mean even increase that amount of money and increase the amount  Depending on how well the investment goes so I I don't think this is bad  I just I was surprised by a lot of the criticism as well  But I think that part of it is because Silicon Valley does seem really cut off from the rest of the country  The amounts of money that are sort of made here seem really unreal to most of the US  Frankly you know it just this is a very very different place and the amount of wealth that's here is very different from  Your average town in the Midwest or New England or pretty much anywhere else in the country, so there's a natural  Suspicion I think of things that happen here because they seem so divorced from the reality of what other people face day to day and

So I mean that  These are there's some blowback there, but I don't think that essentially what they've done is bad  I think it's kind of great  I mean it's like a lot of money to to put to use other than just making other people rich  Right on

You got a problem with that and  And and really explains why the LLC why this is  Not a bad thing and and praises him as I think we probably should  For doing this there is often the question though. Hey, these guys have so much money that 45 billion is so much money  It could really do we want?  people like Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg Warren Buffett  kind of  unilaterally determining  The future of the world but better than as you say Katie Katie better than that than you know building a mansion

And I think you're right Katie if the if our government were doing a better job on those things these questions wouldn't be  Wouldn't be raised but you know one of the things  One of the things  Zuckerberg says he's gonna work on climate change. I think in the light of the Paris climate talks  This is absolutely an appropriate thing for all of them to work on there. So I think this is great. I I don't I  Think if you read up on it and understand what he's doing  It's nothing but good here  But I did want to raise the issue in case of a case of anybody wanted to explain why it wasn't such a good thing  It's tough to do. I mean Bill Gates always said I'm not gonna become a philanthropist until I have the time to decide  What's the right way to spend the money?  He advanced that timeline a little bit  He I think initially said I'm not gonna do it till after I leave Microsoft because I'm too busy running this company  but when he got married Melinda, I think  kind of advanced  The foundation and started running some of the foundations giving efforts before  Gates left and now that of course that he's no longer at Microsoft.

We'll talk about Yahoo because the board met right this week, but we haven't heard anything  There was all sorts of wild talk about selling off the assets  Maybe firing  their CEO a  Lot of talk about her severance package nice severance package  Not 45 billion, but a good amount of money our show today brought to you by Harry's  I feel like this should be a British company  Harry's for guys who want a great shave experience for a fraction of the fraction of the price. Yes  Harry's is they actually they bought the company in Germany that makes the blades  There's only a handful of really great razor blade companies and manufacturers and they bought it so they can make better  razors at half the price of the drugstore blades and  But now I want to mention this as a great gift idea  I know I by now most of you are shaving with Harry's and if you haven't yet go there right now  Take a look at the Harry's kits  Fantastic price you start as low as $15 and you get but but this would be a great gift, too  If you've got a secret Santa at your office, you can get them the $15 get a kit  He'll think that's pretty special by the way. I'm gonna tell you how it can cost $10  Just a second, but if there's a special man in your life, look at this  This is the kind of the Harry's gift set.

Oh, yes, you can get this as part of it too and  Your choice of shave cream or the Harry's foaming shave gel now if you're not sure which to get I like the shave cream  It's it's so smooth and soft and gives you a really great shape, you know, 1 million guys have now made the shift to Harry's  easy to use website takes less than 30 seconds to place an order be great to get all your  manly holiday shopping done at Harry's comm and  And  And everybody will be happy including you because the price is right the winter Winston set  $30 plus then you can get engraving.

It's Harry's for the holidays  So is was this all BS it was started with the Wall Street Journal article saying that the Yahoo board was gonna meet earlier  This week to decide what to do with the business. They might in fact even  Sell it one of the issues was they they did have a plan  To spin off the Alibaba investment, which that's worth billions and maybe even Yahoo Japan also worth billing billions  But then the IRS would not guarantee that that would be a tax-free transfer  So some of the investors went whoo hold down hold on there a little bit  So  Now they're thinking maybe we just sell the whole damn thing  They're gonna halt the Alibaba perhaps according to the Wall Street Journal halt the Alibaba spin-off and sell the internet business  This of course coming from the activist investors on the Yahoo board now  Most most the value of Yahoo. It's got 31 billion dollars in market cap. Most of that value is Alibaba and Yahoo Japan  32 billion dollar worth for its 15% stake in Alibaba  Which Alibaba is kind of like the Amazon of China, right?  Is that the best way to describe it?  Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, and  In fact, you can use it here. I know a lot of people use it here  And as it is literally

Transcript:  Like it's totally not so and that's what puts it kind of upside down, right?  The the stock market values are the 31 billion the Alibaba stakes were 32 billion if they just sold it  the Yahoo Japan stake eight and a half billion if they just sold it and they have cash and  investments totally five point nine billion  But it's only worth 31 billion.

Transcript:  Fifty dollars is a measurement of of Meyer  You know, it's investors saying that they don't believe that she can actually steer the company  Without the buffer that she has with all these really valuable assets  so  That's fine and it's great that the market thinks that it's great that a bunch of activist investors may or may not have  Fed a story to the Wall Street Journal  But this is still a decision that's made by the board of yahoo a board which is squarely in Marissa Meyer's corner  You know, these are people many of whom are handpicked by her Charles Schwab is a San Francisco luminary and close to Meyer  Scott comes from Walmart. She served on the board of Walmart. They're very tight, you know, I doubt that you know  somebody like  you know Scott Scott and and  David Filo David Filo is not going to try to push her out, right?  I highly doubt that max Lev chin is going to try to push her out  So she has support of people who are making a decision of whether or not she's going to run the place and then to sell  The core business what would that give her to run?  What would she be overseeing a management company an investment management company a stock management company? She doesn't come from BlackRock  She doesn't come from you know an investment firm. That's not her expertise. She's not going to do that either  So I really highly we're going to see that happen. So you know, there's no story here in your opinion  I don't think that there's no story. I mean I the board it has a  fiduciary responsibility is the jargony way of putting it but just means that they are responsible for  weighing every single option sort of like CYA so that if something happens or  That they can prove that they were doing all they could at all times to maximize value for shareholders  So yeah, do they have to have everything on the table and talk about it?  Of course they do but I just don't think they're gonna push Marissa Meyer out the door not anytime soon  and as long as the  Alibaba spinoff happens that's a lot of money for them. So I think I don't know  I I just don't see her getting canned in  2015 or even early 2016 that's just my read loyalty only goes so far

I mean at some point these activist investors are gonna  Are gonna start waging a battle over this  The good news if you're Marissa Meyer is according to USA Today, she's got a pretty hefty  severance

Transcript:  Anybody well, I think I think under you know as much as we all  Derided the management prior to Marissa Meyer  There was a really clear goal for Yahoo  Which was kind of taking the a OLL route of trading in its existing business for a media business, right?  For building an ad funded business that owned lots of media assets traded off its enormous scale page use brand recognition, etc  She didn't really want to go in that direction and wanted, you know it to be a tech business, right?  Rather than necessarily a media business  so most of the media assets have slightly kind of stumbled and dwindled and apart from acquiring, you know something like tumblr which is  Enormous but kind of financially not exactly exciting  She hasn't really sort of put anything in place where you go. Well, I can definitely see you where you're going with that  They've done a lot of acqui hires  In terms of bringing in talent, but you know, there was a great I call I saw a couple of weeks ago about  You know  Acquihires can be terrible for everybody else that works there because you sort of realize that you've been working  You know if you're an engineer, you're here  You've been working for however many years and you're getting paid X and the guy  Next to you has been working there for three months and there's just cashed out, you know, 10 million or something  It's sort of totally demotivating. So I'm not really sure that she's put in a  You know really a vision that anybody may be outside her in a circle kind of really understands I

Transcript:  Don't think it's too early to say that whatever strategy Meyer had has failed  And it may in fact be that she didn't have a coherent strategy. I mean, I I'm not sure I saw  Anything, you know from Yahoo. I've seen anything in Lafayette in the last three years  It looked like it had even the remotest chance of changing Yahoo's fate their Flickr app redesign. I don't think so

Start time: 5668.58
End time: 5740.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's tough because she inherited a lot of stuff that would have been  Potentially successful if they had moved faster earlier  But it was too late like Flickr being a good example Flickr probably could have been Instagram, but they didn't  See that but how often does that happen and they they buy these things and then they and then they have kind of abandoned them  and and so I don't know what she was supposed to do the  Content strategy might have done something  But yeah when people talk about Yahoo now, they're saying the same things  They said when she got hired which is is Yahoo still around and what does it do?  It seems very it seems like nothing has happened and things have happened. But in the end it hasn't changed anybody's perception of it  It's not like they did something radical and broke it apart and turned it into something like Google with a bunch of  products and services nor did they turn it into a  Media machine that could take advantage of their huge audience because Yahoo still has a pretty large audience  It's just not a cool audience. It's a very non-technical older kind of audience Yahoo  In fact, I hate to say this but it's more like a newspaper than any other site on the internet  It's got an older audience and it's got a really broad general audience, which is nice  But it's not exciting and I think not necessarily a growth area. Well and also a web pages I

I have to say it's yeah  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

Transcript:  I'll buy it. You know what just to see i'll buy it. I love his stuff  News from the u.s  Court of appeals for the second circuit breaking your computer  Your employer's computer policy is not a crime  This is actually surprising news because the courts have traditionally upheld the rights of employers when it comes to digital stuff  An employer has to hang up if he picks up the phone and hears you having a personal conversation, but reading your email. No problem  Uh digital stuff has always been treated as you know the under the ownership of the employer  Um, this is kind of a creepy case  It comes from the cannibal cop case a new york city police officer was charged  With conspiracy to kidnap he never kidnapped anybody  he wrote  fantasy posts on a cannibalism fetish site  And he did during company time  and he was also charged with violating the policies of the uh  Actually was charged with the computer fraud and abuse act  For violating  New york police department policies about accessing a police database without a valid law enforcement purpose now. That's an nypd policy  but they decided to make a  An example out of him and they charged him with a computer fraud and abuse case  He was convicted on all counts  The trial court reversed the jury's conspiracy verdict saying  That you can't really have a kidnapping conspiracy in which no one has ever kidnapped no attempted kidnapping ever took place  No real world steps were ever taken to kidnap anybody. It's not really it's thought crime. It's not a crime to think about it  so the court overturned that one and then  But they did upheld the conviction under the computer fraud act  Interestingly though the second circuit has overturned that saying  We declined to adopt the prosecution's construction of the computer fraud act which would criminalize the conduct of millions of ordinary computer users  While the government might promise it would not prosecute an individual for checking facebook at work  We are not at liberty to take prosecutors at their word in such matters a court  Should not uphold a highly problematic interpretation of a statute merely because the government says oh no  We're never going to use it on facebook. It's only when the the guy's doing something really wrong  So but this is probably good news  It means that while you could get fired or you know reprimanded for breaking your employer's computer computer policy  At least you can't get charged under the computer fraud and abuse act

They don't do it by phone  So they were able to compile these statistics  Look at this  more people  are cell phone only  Than have landlines in the united states  47 are land are cell phone only  42 have both like like you and me jason have landline and so only reason I have a landline is for my burglar alarm  I don't use it. I wouldn't have it. Why do you need one? You got a cell phone  There are eight percent in the united states who do not have a cell phone but have a landline  Probably the the older people and the very poor  But yeah, isn't that interesting?  I think actually that's the statistic is more interesting now. There are more people don't have a landline than do actually  That's not strictly true because if you add landline and cell phone to landline no cell phone you get 50  But it's close. It's neck and neck

Transcript:  Yeah, this is um as we're going into a presidential election year  This is something to keep in mind the pollsters are better at it than they used to be but the entire polling industry was  Predicated on this idea that you could reach people at a certain time at a number  Was a location and that meant a landline and and while they were all trying to grasp the right way  To poll with cell phones. It's been an issue and it may continue to be an issue where the kind of people they want to reach  Who do vote?  Um, but if they can't reach them at a statistically accurate level  Um, you end up with distorted polls. Well, you understand the young people exactly. Yeah
