Start time: 161.81
End time: 177.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually pretty awesome.  We're still in the same place doing kind of the same thing, but we're bigger and better and better and all that.  We've hired, I think it's nine or ten people since January.  So we're going through a kind of a crazy growth spurt, but everyone who was there before is still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I got to ask you a question, and you don't have to answer this.  I don't see a lot of Walt. Is he semi-retired?

Start time: 194.89
End time: 198.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Walt's still there.  Okay.  I'll tell him he said that.

Start time: 199.00
End time: 203.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, tell Walt, you got to write more. You got to get busy.

Start time: 203.70
End time: 209.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. I'd love to see his stuff more. Now he's not restricted by the weekly columns.  So he should write all the time.

Start time: 210.06
End time: 211.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like he's just kind of...

Start time: 211.34
End time: 216.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says he's going to tell us what it all means about Apple and all that. So look for a column on that at some point.

Start time: 217.22
End time: 220.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, he's taking it easy.  We're talking about Walt Mossberg.

Start time: 221.14
End time: 228.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, honestly, Walt and Kara have done a ton of stuff around the company.  So I think it might not be obvious from the day-to-day writing.

Start time: 228.00
End time: 229.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's running the business is what he's doing.

Start time: 230.08
End time: 239.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he does business, and he's the main guy on all the product stuff as well.  So everything goes through him. So maybe he's been less out in front, but he's very busy.

Start time: 240.14
End time: 252.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and I read his review of the HTC One, which is my new phone, too.  But it just seems like he...  Maybe it's just because he's probably not writing any less than he did at the journal,  but it just feels like I want to see more of him, I guess.

Start time: 253.44
End time: 254.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I want to see more Walt, too.

Start time: 255.08
End time: 267.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, more Walt. Boy Walt, boy Gafford.  Anyway, we're thrilled to have Liz on, and we've got lots of Liz Gaines there at recode.net.  I just went to recode.com. It's Nero.

Start time: 268.10
End time: 277.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're sending them lots of traffic.  You know, URLs don't matter anymore, right?  They don't.  Social web.

Start time: 279.01
End time: 304.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't. It's exactly right.  Oh, look who's here. Also from France. Not Patrick. Patrick Béja.  It is me. Hey, how's it going?  Great to have you to give us the European angle on all this. Going really well.  We had a very busy week this week.  It kicked things off with Amazon's announcement of their new streaming TV,  and I only apologize. I'm going to mention this because US only, right?

Start time: 306.35
End time: 320.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's not available for sale in France or Europe,  but I'm sure that if you order it from the US, you can get it delivered.  So Amazon's been pretty good about those things, unlike other companies.

Start time: 320.64
End time: 374.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's a me too product. There's nothing to get real excited about.  It's quad core Android.  If I fix it, tore it down, and it's a Snapdragon 600 in there,  which is not the latest greatest, but a nice little processor.  It's got its dedicated GPU, which means you can game, and that's the biggest difference.  Netflix, you know, Hulu Plus, all the usual streaming stuff.  And of course, it's Amazon is on there, Amazon streaming.  But they really pushed the gaming. In fact, this is a hundred bucks for the, you know, roughly this size.  It's like an Apple TV without rounded corners because they don't want to get sued.  And then they also sell for an additional 40 bucks a game controller that looks just like an Xbox controller,  only as if somebody sat on it. Same buttons and everything.  And there's voice control. Oh, let's not forget in the remote, there's a microphone and you could talk to it.

Start time: 375.16
End time: 379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you played with it at all, Liz? No, I'm actually really interested to see you holding it up

Start time: 379.00
End time: 390.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because I hadn't seen it except on the demo. You know me. I bought it right away and everything.  And did you go to the event in New York? No, I didn't.

Start time: 390.10
End time: 395.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I actually don't know where it was. I had it in my head. It was in Seattle, but I can't say that I know that.

Start time: 395.79
End time: 422.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it was. I don't know. I just thought it was in New York.  We had Peter Kafka on during our conversation. He wasn't there either. I said, is Kara there? He said, no.  Is Liz there? No. Maybe nobody knew where it was. Maybe that was part of the problem.  Seattle would make sense. They made a giant living room with big screen TVs.  I think it was New York because Christina Warren was there. So I think it was probably New York.  You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to fire it up tonight and I'm going to watch Game of Thrones.  Oh, no, I'm not because HBO goes not on here.

Start time: 425.23
End time: 462.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's, you know, it is it's not revolutionary.  It's not going to be the one that makes everyone convinced that they need a box like this.  But it definitely seems like they've put a lot of work into it and it's fairly easy to use from all reports and it's very responsive, unlike some of the others that we've seen.  And that voice control, that voice search element is kind of so simple that it's almost a throwaway feature, but it is interesting.  And it's almost the kind of thing that you wonder, why has no one else done it before?  It's pretty obvious that if it works, it's it's cool.

Start time: 464.32
End time: 482.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Others have done it. My Samsung TV has a microphone in the remote.  It also does gestures. And as I'm sitting, in fact, it happened last night watching TV, everyone's a lot of handle point up show up on the screen and controls come up and I have to go like this.  No, actually, no, I thought I got a Samsung TV too.

Start time: 486.30
End time: 497.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Roku or, you know, I mean, this is basically a Roku from Amazon actually works better because it only does the things you want it to do.  Right. The Samsung Smart TV is like, Oh, do you want to do a workout?

Start time: 498.10
End time: 547.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm watching TV. Stop it.  That's the problem with with Samsung.  A lot of the time is that they add so much so many features.  A lot of designers often say that an Apple says that as well.  One of the design principles that you have to adopt is that not including a feature is as important as including a feature.  Steve Jobs saying no is critical.  Yeah, exactly.  And so the Amazon one seems like it's got just the right amount of stuff and presented the right way and working the right way.  So it seems like it's a good choice if you want one of those devices.  I'm not sure that is going to convince a lot of people that don't already have the need to to jump to jump the boat and get one.

Start time: 547.72
End time: 580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, Google is not going to be left behind Android TV.  The replacement for Google TV is rumored to be imminent.  The verge says it will be much simpler than predecessor Google TV, which I liked a lot, but it was a bomb.  They have some screenshots from a leaker and it looks very similar to the Amazon Fire TV.  It has, of course, have more front and center Google stuff like Hangouts.  It will have YouTube, which Roku does not have, although the Amazon box does.  It's this is the real problem.

Start time: 580.34
End time: 582.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Amazon box can't believe you can keep all that straight.

Start time: 583.49

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  Thanks to Veronica Belmont.  She made a spreadsheet, which she no longer maintains, but has been maintained by the community of set top boxes.  If you go, I'm going to do it first before I give the URL, but it has every set top box and people have maintained this over the years.  It's bit.ly slash set top is the short URL.  And this is what everybody needs because and they've already added Amazon for it has every.  This is you have to be the rain man to know what does what you know who has HBO go who has YouTube.  They all have Netflix.  That's one thing you can be sure of.  It's just crazy.  But some of them do Netflix better than others.  The Apple TV, for instance, is a winner with Netflix because Apple runs its own CDN.  And so the data is better on.  It's just crazy.  Thank you, Veronica Belmont.  Anyway, this does not have HBO go, but it does have YouTube.  But the Google TV will have YouTube, but won't have.  I don't know.  That's the problem is there's no one device you can buy.  And how many I don't know what it's like in France, Patrick, but every single device I have in the United States plays Netflix.  Every single one. My TV does.  My Xbox one does. By the way, the Xbox one I can also talk to and wave at.  In fact, I don't know when I wave if it's the TV or the Xbox one that's listening.  Sometimes I get two hands of different.

Start time: 676.95
End time: 683.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, in France, we don't have Netflix.  So you don't have to worry about that. But not yet.  Yeah. So that's not that's not a problem.

Start time: 684.92
End time: 735.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I do, I'll tell you, my biggest takeaway from the Amazon Fire TV is that this hardware is now fairly commoditized.  That because Android is free and open.  Of course, this is not the Android with Google services.  This is just the open source Android, which Amazon has customized because the chips from Qualcomm are widely available and it's easy.  It's well understood how we integrate them.  All of this stuff now can be made in a very high quality package at a very low cost.  Ninety nine bucks easily. It's a commodity product.  And it just it strikes me.  That this is just the beginning, because anybody can people come to visit us all the time with Android streaming sticks.  Oh, yes, I have a new Android. I have a new and I have a new Android streaming.  There's a million of them.

Start time: 738.22
End time: 782.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of a consolidation of the of the market, isn't it?  There's been a lot of slightly more niche products for a while.  But now the big all of the big boys want the TV.  We're sort of stabilized in the mobile landscape.  And now all of the big boys are sort of seriously taking another look at the TV and even Apple, who's probably not going to be making an actual TV.  They're getting they're graduating the Apple TV, it seems.  It's not right. It's a hobby, but a hobby.  They they look like they're taking pretty seriously.  So it wouldn't surprise me if some of the smaller players in that market start going away slowly over the next couple of years.

Start time: 783.48
End time: 813.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think one of the things that's going to happen is at some point.  And I know Apple's negotiating hard and I'm sure it will be fruitless with Comcast.  At some point, one of these is going to stream live TV.  One or all Peter from Recode said it was his opinion that the content companies wouldn't give it to any one player.  They're afraid of what happened with Apple, that Apple would just dominate it.  So he says they're all going to get it at once.

Start time: 815.22
End time: 818.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you guys don't have IPTV at all in the US?

Start time: 819.08
End time: 821.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean like broadcast? No.

Start time: 822.00
End time: 877.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because, yeah, in France, the triple play system, I guess, or trends started here with an ISP that was very innovative and still is actually a cold free.  And we actually have TV live streaming.  It's not even well, yeah, I guess it is streaming.  It's live TV going through IP services.  And the thing is, everyone, all of the ISPs do it now.  So you pay for your Internet connection and you have obviously Internet, phone, TV, and sometimes you even have a package with mobile.  But the point is the TV services also go through the IP.  Now, they're relayed from on a special part of the bandwidth and they have special servers at each ISP so that you have consistently good quality.  But that's something we've had for years and I'm a little bit surprised it hasn't happened.

Start time: 878.04
End time: 887.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not. And the reason is because you have government run television and we have Comcast.  Oh, it's not government.

Start time: 888.04
End time: 891.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do want to get back to this.  We will.  Kevin Rose has joined us and I want to bring him into the conversation.  Kevin, thank you.  We'll just keep you for a few minutes.  I know you got things to do.  First of all, it's great to see you again, buddy.  Good to see you as well.  Thanks for having me.  I was so pissed off when I saw your Instagram post this morning.  I couldn't believe it.  This is not an April Fool's joke, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everybody probably knows there have been these protests in San Francisco.  This week a protester vomited on the Google or the Yahoo bus on it.  Not a rider, a protester.  They've been all sorts of stuff.  The feeling is, I guess, that the cost of living in San Francisco has just gone through the roof,  particularly the cost of housing, because of rich yuppies from the Silicon Valley  moving in, taking their fancy leather-clad Wi-Fi-enabled buses back and forth.  It's making it hard for San Franciscans to live.  I got to point out the real reason for that is because San Francisco is  landlocked, it's actually waterlocked, and it's a small region,  and the rules the city has created on creating new housing are so prohibitive  that just nobody's building housing.  And that's what puts pressure on prices.  Nevertheless, there have been these protests, and I'm sad to say,  Kevin specifically is now being targeted.  So on your...can I show this?  You put it up on...

Transcript:  That's just a handout. That was just a little leaflet they were handing out to...  But there was also a big banner, right?  Yeah, they brought like a ten-foot banner that it took a few of them to hold it up.  In front of your house!  Yeah, in front of the house, and they were chanting, like,  Kevin Rose is a douche, Kevin Rose parasite.  Oh my God, Kevin.  This makes me so sad.

And I'm just...I'm so saddened.  Greetings, your neighbor, and then it gives you your address.  So they're public-seeing your address here.  A man named Kevin Rose is a parasite.  Perhaps not of you, but of us.  This is why we are here, to reveal him for what he is.  As a partner venture capitalist at Google Ventures,  Kevin, you bad man, you, directs the flow of capital from Google  into the tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco.  The startups that he funds bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs that have ravaged...  My God, you think they're like...what are they, eating the trees?  That have ravaged the landscapes of San Francisco and Oakland.  Like locusts!  With each...there's no more corn in San Francisco, and I ask you why?  With each new tech corporation comes a wave of fresh techies,  who on average earn four times more than a normal service worker.  We are the ones who serve them coffee, deliver them food,  watch...I'll skip the next one...watch their kids and mop their floors.  Nearly all of them are just like Kevin Rose.

Start time: 1104.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They complained about Dignation, and they were upset about a joke that I made many years ago.  Wait a minute, that's real? I thought you were being silly on Twitter.  They were being dead serious.  They were just going through the internet and trying to find any dirt that they could possibly find.  They mentioned Dignation?  Yeah, I don't have the flyer here with me,  but it said that it was an awful show that ran for six years.  Oh my God.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it certainly... I wasn't home at the time actually,  so they rang our doorbell, and Daria just went downstairs thinking it was someone delivering something,  and she opened the door and they handed her a flyer, and she's like,  what is this? And they start chanting and yelling, and she just kind of like closes the door and locks it,  and then calls me up, and I was down the street helping some buddies build a skate ramp actually.

So I came home, and I walked out, and they recognized me, and they walked up to me,  and they were like... Hi, Tester. Tester's got home.  They basically walked up to me, and they were just like...  Started throwing... First it was like a lot of insults, and then it was just like,  how can you live with yourself, and what you're doing all this bad for our city, and...  Do you think they're crazy or...?  I recorded the entire thing on an Android phone.  You guys realize you're on an Android phone.  You probably have an iPhone or something. That's Google stuff.  And I asked them where they were going to post it, and they said YouTube,  and I'm like, do you not see the irony in all this?  I'm serious. They told me they were going to post it on YouTube.  Well, YouTube because it's free bandwidth, man.  The thing that really gets me at the core is I understand their frustrations.

Transcript:  You don't throw up on people's buses.  There's a conversation to be had here, but it's not by throwing rocks through windows,  throwing up on people's buses.  I think that... I mean, Leo, you know how it is.

And it doesn't even make sense.  It's like, there are certainly issues, but they're issues.  Don't go back to Google or even startups or any of this.  And I know you're sympathetic to that.

Landlords are kicking out longtime tenants and then instantly jacking up the prices  because they know they can get it with some of the tech folks that are making more.  And so people are getting displaced.  That's frustrating. It's frustrating to a lot of people.  So there are complaints to be had here and a conversation to be had,  but I certainly don't think that Google and some of these other tech companies are necessarily at fault.  I mean, yes, they are bringing in more tech workers,  but I think that there's a lot of good being done here as well.  I mean, I certainly know what we do at Google Ventures in funding tech companies.  And Foundation Medicine is one of our big companies that is working on cures for cancer.  And we're trying to like, it's not just funding companies for the sake of funding companies.  There's a kind of a bigger mission here.

But, you know, there's no real concern here.  My house is pretty locked down. I have cameras all over the place.  And, you know, I've kind of created a little bunker here, so I'm not too worried about that.  But it is obviously, you know, it gets your stomach grumbling and your little tense and your shaking.  Of course, my wife, Daria, was spooked out by the whole thing.  And you just don't know how far it's going to go.  You know, right now, yes, I was able to sit down outside and actually have a conversation with these folks.  And it wasn't aggressive. Like they weren't here to throw rocks.  They were upset and visibly upset.  But they weren't like, I didn't feel at all like they were going to start a fight.  And then the cops showed up and then they just kind of ran. They took off.

And I consider it to be home.  So, you know, I think there's a lot of really positive, awesome things that are happening here in a bunch of different sectors.  So I think that, you know, this is certainly for me, it's just something to pay attention to.  And it's something that I think that, you know, I saw Ron Conway at the Crunchies give a long talk about how the tech community in general has to come together to solve some of these problems.  And I certainly believe that's the case.  So, you know, I would like to take part in that conversation and sit down with some folks that are willing to have a conversation that isn't aggressive.  And hopefully that will happen.  But yeah, this is home. So we don't plan on moving anytime soon.

It's a good topic.  But first, let's talk about audible dot com.  When you're riding in the Google bus and you got the Wi-Fi, the leather seats,  there's nothing better than also having your headphones on.  Maybe those maybe those Bose QuietComfort 3 headphones on, you know, the titanium model and listen to an audio book.  I'm sorry.  I should just stop.  I should just stop.  Oh, look at this.  Mary Roach's gulp.  This is a great book.  In fact, any of Mary Roach's books are great at audible.  I'm going to get you two books free.  So maybe you could do Gulp, which is the story of the Alimentary Canal with Bonk, the story of sex or stiff,  the story of cadavers.  She also wrote a great book called Packing for Mars, the curious science of life in the void, Spook, Science Tackles the Afterlife and My Planet, Finding Humor in the Oddest Places.  She is actually one of my favorite authors.  I think this is when I first became aware of her a couple of years ago.  It's the study of death.  Stiff, the curious life of human cadavers.  And then you can go on to Gulp and Bonk and really, really have some fun.  Audible is a great place to go to get audio books of all kinds.  Those are nonfiction books, but they've of course got fiction books too, like Danielle Suarez's latest.  I think I just made Daniel a girl.  Danielle Suarez's greatest in flux.  Wow.  Is that a that is a page turner.  Page turner.  What do we need a word for page turners on Audible?  That is a.  Unpossibles.  Unpossible.  Oh, I like it.  That's an impossible.  That's a drive around the block three times because I don't want to stop listening even though I'm home in your car at work on the treadmill at your desk.  Audible is a great companion.  One hundred fifty thousand titles in every category.  Oh, this is cool.  Mike Elgin was talking about this last week.  The Biz Stone book Things a Little Bird Told Me Confessions of a Creative Mind is on Audible as well.  Audible has the best readers, by the way, and that's a that's a big part of this is you're listening.  Oh, I really want this one.  I think I'm going to put this on my on my Audible next.  Listen, Flash Boys, a Wall Street revolt.  This is the new Michael Lewis book about high frequency trading.  It is the talk of the town.  One of the things about Audible that's great is you're not getting last year's books.  I mean, you could.  In fact, they've got classics and great literature, too.  But all of the new books now come out on Audible dot com day and date of their release in the bookstore.  And that's awesome.  You're never left behind.  Anything by Michael Lewis is a must read.  He is just one of my favorite authors.  But his latest Flash Boys about high frequency trading is really hot stuff.  Audible dot com slash twit two.  That's audible dot com twit.  And the number two will get you two books.  You're going to sign up for the Platinum account.  That's two book a month subscription.  It also includes your daily digest of either the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  That's nice.  You're going to get some great listening.  You can cancel anytime in the first three days.

Oh, and that new Haunted Empire.  And what did you think of that, Liz Gaines?  I'm sure you did.  You know, you carry it.  I haven't read it actually.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, I kind of my this is obviously an uninformed take given I haven't read the book.  But I think it might be a little bit too early to write a book about Tim Cook's reign at Apple.

Start time: 1993.08
End time: 2022.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little early.  The premise is that it's haunted by Steve Jobs ghost, of course.  And it does, I think, imply that Apple is not going to do too well in the future.  We don't know that yet.  But the criticism I've heard from some and I haven't read it either.  In fact, I'm going to put that in my card as well.  Is that it's a lot of anecdotal stuff, some of it not accurate.  Some of it people deny, say it's not true.

Start time: 2022.46

Transcript:  Yeah, maybe they just, you know, I think it's a little bit of a surprise.  Yeah, I think, you know, so let's see.  Should we?  We can move on a little bit.  There was a big event in San Francisco this week called Build Microsoft's Developer Conference and they announced a ton of stuff.  Let me go through a few of the big stories.  One is, of course, that Windows is now free on devices with screens under nine inches, which would never have happened under Steve Ballmer or Bill Gates.  That was the crown.  They're giving away the crown jewels.  This is a response, obviously, to Android and to get Windows on mobile devices and maybe to get Windows 8.1 out there.

Start time: 2121.66
End time: 2128.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does that mean because they're saying phone and tablets.  Does that mean that Windows phone is free for everyone?  No, no, no, no.

Start time: 2129.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2132.83

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they are saying phones and tablets, right?

Start time: 2135.20
End time: 2179.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are. Well, they're saying anything with a nine inch less screen or under nine inch screen.  That means, though, there are a lot of eight inch tablets like the Dell Venue that are windows, full windows on an eight inch tablet.  Lenovo has one.  I think Toshiba might have one.  I know Dell has one.  So those guys, that that's a big deal for those guys.  They also cut the license costs in general significantly.  So this is I think you could make the case that such in that this is a such in the delamove.  Some of the things like Windows Phone 8.1, obviously in the works for a long time update, the new update for Windows 8.1 in the works for a long time.  But he's I think such as really taking Microsoft in a new direction.

Start time: 2182.34
End time: 2228.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they want to get everyone involved in their ecosystem.  And obviously, Nadella is very much cloud and services oriented.  So and I mean, Windows on these types of devices has not been doing too well.  No.  So they do need to do something to get it a little bit more popular.  And obviously, that is one of the things that they could be doing.  And hopefully by emphasizing the services aspect of Microsoft, then maybe they can pull people in with cheaper devices that get the juice going on the services.  But the sad thing is, I'm not even sure that that will be enough.  Too late.  Too late.

Start time: 2247.44
End time: 2345.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to talk about an off the record conversation I had with two very well known Windows watchers who may or may not do a podcast on this network.  And what we were talking about, and I don't know why they haven't said this more forcefully on that podcast.  But what we're talking about is the idea that apparent what seems to have happened is for reasons no one fully understands.  Microsoft said to Stephen Sienofsky, go make Windows 8 and we are going to let you rethink the whole thing and we're not going to weigh in.  Anything goes, Stephen.  And Sienofsky went off and created this kind of nightmare hybrid of touch and desktop.  And not one person at Microsoft, not one person on the board said boo to Sienofsky.  Sienofsky is the right guy to do it.  He had great success with Office, the Ribbon.  He was very forceful, apparently, in the way he communicated his ideas.  I asked them, I said, well, is Sienofsky that persuasive?  Is he is it like perceived at Microsoft?  He's the genius.  And they said, no, he's just very forceful.  Windows came out.  Sienofsky was terminated.  Balmer, I think, was forced out as a result.  It has been a very, I think it's safe to say, big failure.  And Windows is the crown jewel.  You do not mess with the crown jewel, Microsoft.  And the real flaw goes back to management saying, go ahead, do whatever you want.

Start time: 2347.43
End time: 2437.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a key thing which you said right there.  You talked about the Ribbon and how, you know, Sienofsky was the one who made it.  And the thing is, a lot of people still hate the Ribbon.  Oh, yeah.  It is incredibly better than what was before.  You know, that forest of menus and everything.  But it still has a horrible image.  So I'm wondering if, you know, they were getting some feedback or maybe themselves were thinking that thing that he's doing with Windows were not sure that, you know, we don't like it.  But we also didn't like the Ribbon.  And it turns out the Ribbon is actually better for productivity.  And we we need to move in a different direction.  So it's easy in hindsight to say, well, you know, obviously, Windows would never have worked the way it is now.  But they had to worry about the touch interfaces and the tablets and all of that.  And they needed to do something radical.  So basically something that a lot of people said at the time as well.  If Windows had not done this, we would all be sitting here saying, criticizing them for not moving and thinking differently and doing things in a different enough direction.  So I can understand definitely why they would leave him free rein to change everything and not hold it back in when when they realize maybe it's not, you know, maybe they as individuals don't like it as much.

Start time: 2438.14
End time: 2458.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems clear that it's why Balmer had to step down.  And I think Satya Nadella was chosen.  They wanted somebody inside Microsoft.  Maybe they wanted some people outside Microsoft who said no.  But I think he was a very good choice because the future of Microsoft clearly is in the cloud.  Yes, the future of computing is in the cloud and the future of everyone.  Yeah.

End time: 2542.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So it is a new Microsoft.  I think there's I think there's no question in my mind it's a new Microsoft giving away Windows.  When I have to say Windows Phone 8.1 is the first I've always thought highly of Windows Phone.  I think they did reinvent that.  In fact, that's one of the reasons I think they let Sanofsky do what he did is because they said, well, this interface is working really well on phone.  Let's try bringing that to the desktop.  It's good.  It's just late to the party and doesn't have the apps.  But Windows Phone 8.1 fills a lot of holes, especially with Cortana, which is the voice activated personal assistant for Windows 8.1.  Microsoft has a unique position.  Apple has Siri, of course.  Google has its own voice.  Microsoft's a little Apple's a little hobbled by the fact that it's made the decision.  And I think a lot of people embrace this decision to protect its users privacy.  The unlike Google, they are not willing to aggregate all the data from all the different things they know about you and make Siri better because of it.  Siri, a lot of people I felt like Siri was better before Apple got it.  It did more.  Apple, you know, can't do a Google.  That's definitely that's true.

Start time: 2543.58
End time: 2593.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Siri was different before Apple bought it.  It tied into the APIs of a whole bunch of different services.  So it let you do all sorts of things like, you know, plan your whole date for the evening without ever leaving the app.  But but I think that if you look at the little incremental updates, I'm an iPhone user.  And if you look, it's starting to get much more like a personal assistant.  And you see that in the voice thing.  But it's not just about voice.  And Siri, it's also about, you know, if you if you pull down your screen, it'll tell you things like how many meetings you have that day, what the weather's like.  And it's becoming more and more kind of useful and doing that kind of like anticipating your needs rather than waiting for you to search for things,  which is where Google is going.  And it's a better experience in a lot of ways.  As long as you're willing to let your phone know where you're located and look at your calendar and stuff like that.  But you've already done that if you're using an iPhone.

Start time: 2594.88

It knows what stocks I follow.  Oh, look, it knows that I ordered a Fire TV.  I expect to see more postings there because that came in through Gmail.  So Apple is not willing to do that.  And rightly so.  I think they provide an alternative to people.

Google is willing to go to any length.  In fact, they just updated their the way that logging in to your Gmail works on your iPhone.  I'm sure you knew this, Liz.

Transcript:  I mean, I understand that I'm doing a trade off of privacy for convenience everywhere in my online life.  And I also have an Android phone.  And by comparison, I think that there's a lot of things that does a lot better because it's a more cohesive experience.  It's not as all these discrete apps split out from each other with no knowledge of what the other ones are doing.

Start time: 2729.26
End time: 2735.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.  I was impressed. I like Cortana.  Cortana is the name of the personal assistant, the voice.  She's got a good voice.  In fact, she's got arguably a better voice than either Siri or Google because some of the speech is prerecorded actual voice.  Some of it synthesized, some of it's not.  It's a little disconcerting when you listen because it's the same voice, but it's one sounds more synthesized.

Start time: 2769.52
End time: 2844.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's OK, but it doesn't feel like, oh, that was the virtual assistant I was waiting for.  It's good. It's nice that Microsoft is getting in on that game as well.  But what I felt was really interesting in all of those conferences was I guess what Microsoft does best is ubiquity.  And, you know, they made a lot of noise about the fact that you'll be able to develop apps that will be, you know, they're unifying the binary.  That's a huge thing, too.  That's yeah, exactly.  Windows runtime will run the same across all its platforms.  Including Xbox and, you know, they're going really, really wide with this.  And they're even, you know, they're announcing availability in the car.  There was even a leak about Windows for devices where they were talking about, I can't remember, coffee mugs and, you know, just wearables in general.  So it seems like they're I think that Nadella is going to get the credit for a lot of the changes that are going to be happening this year.  But it feels like a lot of those have been in the works for the past couple of years when, you know, Windows 8 first came out.

End time: 2864.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's only been on the job a few months. He obviously didn't have anything to do with Cortana.  But yeah, nevertheless, I do think that he is more willing to say, you know, on the iPad announcement, he said, let me give me my iPad.  Never. You would never, Mr. Ballmer, say that.  He stomped on an iPhone, mock stomped on an iPhone in an all hands meeting a couple of years.

Start time: 2871.18
End time: 2920.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nadella is putting a stamp on it.  And I think it goes along with things like getting Windows Phone 8.1 up to parity with iPhone and Android phone.  You can ask one of the things you can tell that see, this is where Microsoft has a little bit of an advantage.  They own Skype. So you can say, call my mom on Skype and it will not only open Skype, but call, you know, it has your Skype contacts.  It'll call her. They did a deal with Facebook.  You're going to get similar kind of functionality with Facebook.  Cortana scans the email on your phone.  See, Microsoft's been really careful.  You know, they're going to have to stop doing the Scroogle campaign because the Gmail man, they read you.  It's over. It's over.  Cortana scans the email on your phone, recognizes items like flight schedules and other reservations.  So she will remind you, hey, time to leave for the airport.

Start time: 2925.60
End time: 2933.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's their argument with Scroogle.  And it's also I'm sure it's, you know, the people who do the Scroogle campaigns don't talk to the people who develop Cortana.

Start time: 2934.40
End time: 2952.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they may, because Mark Penn, the guy who did the Scroogle campaign, has been promoted to Microsoft and is now in charge.  What is Penn in charge of? Digital strategy.  He's like in charge of strategy, I think, at Microsoft.  So, yeah, he's executive vice president, advertising and strategy.

Transcript:  And you were saying earlier, you know, is it too late for Microsoft?  I don't want to say it's never too late, but we have a tendency in the consumer space as consumer space watchers mostly.  I mean, we do a lot of enterprise. It's very important.  But we have a tendency to underestimate a little bit how important and how big Microsoft still is in a lot of places.  And I really don't think it's too late for Microsoft ever.  You know, they're they're so ubiquitous and and and have such a big presence in some of the spaces that that matter  that it would take a lot, a lot, much longer period of screwing up for them to be out of the game.  Now they just need to spend so much time on idiotic things. Right.

Start time: 3006.02
End time: 3012.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but you can't you can't get ahead of your competition if you're just internally messing things up like that,  where you're putting your focus on things that are totally not improving what people actually like and use and want to be loyal to your company.

Start time: 3036.34
End time: 3063.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably. But again, let me take you let me take the other the other side of the argument.  You're just coming out with a tablet computer with a brand new system, with a brand new OS.  It does look very strange if the next day you come out with, you know, with an office on the iPad and you don't have the touch version of office on your brand new system.  So I'm not saying it's the right choice, but I definitely understand why they wouldn't want to come out with office on the iPad immediately.

Start time: 3064.50
End time: 3081.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't want to say that other companies don't do stupid stuff. Right.  I mean, Apple is so pissed off about this whole Samsung patent thing that they're allowing like their internal emails and strategy from not that long ago, just from like a year ago to be exposed in court.  Like, I mean, companies do really, really bizarre things.

Start time: 3083.14

Start time: 3093.24
End time: 3130.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There wasn't a lot of it, I think, except for the for the runtime, the universal, which is good, runtime.  Yeah. Which is which is great. That's for everybody.  I mean, the fact that the fact that you can have. Well, I guess that's not surface, but those store applications on the desktop.  There's a lot of stuff happening in there. But but yeah, I think that what he's been saying, what Nadella said when he announced the iPad version of office was that there was going to be a number of announcements in the next few weeks.  And build is part of that, of course. But I wouldn't be surprised if we heard a little bit more specifically about tablets in the in the near future.

I asked this mythical couple who don't or may or may not host a podcast on our network.  Why doesn't Microsoft just say we blew it? Eight was a mistake.  Let we're going we're going back to they don't need to.

You can control everything with the mouse, you know, including Windows Metro style applications.  You can put them in a in a window on the desktop.  Eight as a synopsis he conceived it is is pretty much gone.  I think it's safe to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll give it some time.  OK, I mean, I I I look forward to seeing how those things can come together in a useful way.  I think there are still, you know, smart people who have a lot of experience selling phones who are trying very hard to make something interesting.  But yeah, I mean, even, you know, in the course of defending Microsoft, we're talking about how Cortana is just catching up.  Right. So there's there's more to be done.

Start time: 3250.29
End time: 3261.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to answer your question about should they be giving up on on surface,  I think the big problem is if they're not going to be building one, then probably no one is.  So they really need to keep doing it.

Start time: 3264.51
End time: 3322.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to. Yeah, I guess they do.  I think Nokia actually has some great products and I know the camera is phenomenal.  And now that I've seen a one, I'm thinking maybe.  Maybe we don't. I was I was saying for a long time, they should just abandon Windows Phone, go Android, because I want to see that hardware with Android.  Maybe we don't need to. Maybe Windows Phone is actually getting better and better and that cameras are good.  Maybe they've got a strong.  A strong I boy from the point of view of users having three major choices would be great.  Apple, Android and and Windows, Microsoft.  I'd like to see that. Hey, guess who's going to join us in a little bit?  Jeff Jarvis is just sitting around not doing anything on a Sunday afternoon.

Look, I am from the Bay Area and I understand there's a lot of different nuances here.  But to have someone come to your house and say that without like kind of cracking up, it's almost it's hard for me.  I have to get my mind around it.

We benefit from technology being here, benefit tremendously from this.  We you know, so some buses come by.  Yes, prices go up. Welcome to capitalism.  Welcome to the market.  But at some point, it's really going to hurt the city.  It's really going to harm, I think, the image of the city.  And I lived in San Francisco in the days when it was known as nutty in the days of Jonestown and other craziness.  And it's always been known as somewhat nutty.  But I think this is harmful to the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically, the EU, the European Parliament had a very important vote on net neutrality.  I believe it was this week.  Yes it was. It was this last week.  Yeah, last week, obviously. Sorry.  Nellie Cruz.  Yeah, Nellie Cruz had a somewhat semi-controversial text before the Parliament.  But then a number of very active left-wing Parliamentaries just swept in and changed it completely.  They changed the text, passed a number of amendments that makes this text very, very, well, makes the text very net neutral in the sense that we as techies would think of it.  There are very few, very, very few exceptions.  No special services that were a big point of contention in the text that would have allowed the ISPs to create special channels for certain deals that they would want to make.  All of that is gone and what remains is a text that makes it, that enforces net neutrality in all of Europe.  And that's absolutely amazing.  We didn't think it was going to happen like this and it was the best news of the year for people like us.

Transcript:  I salute you. I sometimes make fun of my European friends. I sometimes make fun of the EU. I am wrong. I salute you.  Excellent legislation. As Patrick said, the law came in when it was done with all the EU politics, had a lot of exceptions.  And as Patrick said, all the left-wing people pulled one by one amendments to pull the exceptions out.  And it is real net neutrality legislation in the EU. And it's, it leaves us in America in the dust.

End time: 4227.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It needs to be adapted to each country. But essentially, yes, it needs to, it has to be adapted in every country that's a member of the union.  So it has force of law and it comes in opposition of certain rules that people were thinking about putting in place to counteract Netflix coming in France.  For example, there were a number of those special services that people wanted to implement.  And but yeah, it's essentially law within the next few months, unless something incredible happens that I'm not aware that could happen.  It is now law and net neutrality as we think of it.  And that's very important because a lot of a lot of people have been starting to sort of, you know, to try and rebrand net neutrality, to try and say, yes, OK, you need to be neutral.  But if you have this case or this case, then you can make exceptions.  But that's not the way the law was passed.  So, yeah, again, it's it's law in all of the member states of of the union.

And I'm not sure exactly what happened, but within two days, it completely changed and it passed.  It was very strange.  And of course, in the in light of what happened in the US a couple of months ago with the net neutrality being not debunked, but rejected.  Now, that's very I think I so to make it a little bit more global, I do think that is going to make it a little bit more difficult for other countries to to to  reject their customers.

Transcript:  I agree with Larry Lessig that money is is unbelievably corrupting to our legislative and government branches.  I believe it's the root of our mess.  I don't think the companies are people and have rights.  However, at some point in a media economy that's that's built on buying TV time, artificial limits are difficult to put forward.  So I don't think the solution is trying to limit the money.  I think the solution is is not having five year campaigns.  But I don't know.  I don't know how you do that.

There's a tech angle to this, frankly, which is why I bring it up.  There is a solution to this.  So really what they're buying with all that money is votes.  They're buying ads.  They're buying influence.  But ultimately, the voters still controls who's in Congress.  And I think the Internet offers a real alternative to making your decision about who to vote for from television commercials.  So so maybe maybe now there is no limit.  But here's the question.  You can donate to a campaign.  But, folks, there is an opportunity to figure out who you like and who you don't like by going on the Internet and doing your research and then voting.

Transcript:  The key here is to me, we're only going to end the hegemony of television in this country.  I mean, it doesn't happen in Europe because you are limited in what you can spend on campaigns and the campaigns are short.  So once again, I salute Europe.  But in this country, Mark Andreessen was talking about about about in Twitter, he went off on another Twitter rant, you know, saying, well, but don't even poor people all have one vote.  So how do they limit this?  But clearly there's there's money spent that has an impact on opinion that has an impact on everything.  The question is this.  The first person who's who's elected to, let's say, Congress by the Internet without television, that's when the revolution starts.  And we're nowhere near that.  We are nowhere near that.  Everybody still gets elected by television.  But if you could possibly use the Internet to get elected, that makes the Internet an equally powerful tool.  And don't.

And he has an idea that turns out to be technically significant.  And in the first episode, his company wants to buy it from him or a VC that's modeled  on Peter Thiel wants him to wants to invest in it.  So like the drama is is actually the drama of running a startup.  It's like, should we take the money?  The second episode is all about, like, can we involve the guy who's not really contributing  to the project?  How much equity should he get?  So does that have large mainstream appeal?

I think one of the reasons it didn't get a lot of attention is the world has moved on a little bit.  Stewart and Colbert, who is supposedly number one to replace him, they've replaced him already culturally anyway.  I'm very much influenced by David Letterman.  And Carson.

I have to quickly type in the site and then tell them the URL because it brings every site down.  Squarespace.  I don't have to worry about that.  If you're running your website on a Squarespace site, you cannot bring it down.  We've tried a hundred times that that's because they are doing the best hosting out there.  And part of the reason the hosting is so good and they explain this to me and I'm not going to try to explain it because I'm not going to explain it.  I was in New York with the Squarespace team.  Great people.  They were explaining, well, the integration of the software with the Java virtual platform allows us to do virtualization on the servers and we can turn up the bandwidth whenever they there's a whole technical reason.  But it's because the software and the hosting are so tightly integrated that they can do this.  And man, are they always working on their platform?  Smart people, designers, engineers who are really making it work.  The twenty five templates now that that's where the starting point is not a cookie cutter because you don't you know you can move stuff around point and click.  You can get everything in there.  They've got the logo creator tool, the mobile apps, which are the best in the business.  They're truly gorgeous.  It's very easy to use, but they also have brilliant support.  Live chat and email support 24 7 a completely redesigned customer help site for easier access.  These guys can't sit still.  They got to make it better all the time.  Better all the time.  Easier access to self help articles, video workshops.  They've now got e-commerce on all subscription levels, which is great because for the low, you know, the eight dollar a month plan, which would be great for a school or a nonprofit.  You can accept donations that's built in.  You could have a cash wedding registry.  I mean, there's it's eight dollars a month and you get the free domain name when you sign up for the annual plan.  That's the hosting plus the software.  Full e-commerce for 24 bucks.  And that includes shipping calculators, inventory control, integrated accounting.  They do the fulfillment, everything.

Apple says we got a patent in 1999.  Background data syncing.  Not allowed unless you're Apple, apparently, or license it.  They have a patent for asynchronous data synchronization among devices while in use.  You know, if the court rules this is a good patent, they got them.  Universal search.  When you search for something on your iPhone, it searches, it gives you an option to search the web or Wikipedia.  Apparently, Apple owns that too.  They got a patent in 2005 for a universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system.  It seems like Google's been doing that for a while.  Yeah, it's also offensive.  Slide to unlock.  We invented that too.  I'm reading Fred Vogelstein's book.  He's the Wired writer who wrote the book Dog Fight.  And these two companies do not like each other.  This is the legacy of Steve Jobs.  Autocomplete texts.  Again, and something seems like I've seen before, the iPhone.  Apple has a patent called Method, System and Graphical User Interface for providing word recommendations or autocomplete.  Apple says we own autocomplete.

Start time: 6048.36
End time: 6062.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, aren't those like super like when you hear the title of the patent, it seems like it covers a very large type of operation.  But actually, when you dive into the patent, it's very specific.  No.

Start time: 6065.00
End time: 6137.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's how our patent system works here in the United States of America.  Every and every patent lawyer knows this.  When you write a patent specification, you write it absolutely as broadly as you possibly can.  Intentionally.  Because for this very reason.  And as long as you get the patent, you're golden.  And the problem is the way the patent office seems to work is they feel that, you know, barring any substantive dispute, we're going to approve this patent and let the courts decide if there should be an issue.  The problem is software patents, plain and simple.  These should not be allowed.  So do they ever adopt a patent?  It's this it's this term.  They've heard the they are the arguments.  I think they've heard the arguments.  You know, I understand.  I mean, reading Vogelstein's book is great because you really go back in time to 2007 when Apple.  Yeah, it did a lot of brilliant work.  The iPhone was not a given by any means.  None of this had been done right down to touch screens.  On a screen that size, multi touch.  This was all brilliant, brilliant work and they deserve all credit for that.

Start time: 6139.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a smoke of the smoking gun.  We've seen the email that said, oh, Christ, we just saw the iPhone back to the drawing board.  And it's it's really true when I hold up this this HTC, the new HTC one, you know, this is all it's all it's all slide to everything.  It's all in there. It's not just Samsung.  In fact, I think it's pretty clear that this Samsung is a proxy for Google and all of this. Right.  Yeah. But still, I mean, I think that go ahead.

Start time: 6180.02
End time: 6221.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I had a chance to look through the documents yesterday since I am on weekend duty.  And it's pretty clear in some cases that Samsung was just looking at like there's a there's a document, there's a mock up where they have here's our slide to unlock feature.  It doesn't really work. Here's Apple's slide to unlock feature.  Like, how can we make it more like their feature?  But I can't I just don't understand Apple's rationale here, why they're they're going to court to deal with, you know, the to defend themselves for for things that are that are really quite obvious and not that obvious.  Quite obvious and not that they just they seems like they are really, really upset about something that doesn't really matter.

Start time: 6221.26
End time: 6234.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I feel. Steve Jobs initial upset over this.  We're going nuclear, he told Walter, Walter Isaacson, we're going nuclear against Google on this that still lives on.  And I really did think. Yeah.

Start time: 6234.24
End time: 6266.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then actually, the documents that came out, there was him saying he was mounting a holy war.  That was his plan for 2011, a holy war against Google.  And but there's you know, there's some interesting tidbits in there.  For me, it's it's fun reading.  I don't understand why they hate Google and Samsung enough to bring this stuff out.  But there's some Phil Schiller watching the 2013 Samsung Super Bowl commercial has like an emergency note to their ad agency saying like these guys are nailing it like Samsung's ad is awesome.  Why don't we have something as good as their ad?  It's like, you know, it's a little bit of a peek behind the curtain.

Start time: 6267.22
End time: 6283.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Fried's article in the recode is is all about this Apple document.  They're really, really good article.  Apple was worried.  You think Apple still is worried?  I guess they are. They should be.  Samsung selling like hotcakes.

Start time: 6285.04
End time: 6326.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the problem is, I think that there's a little bit of resentment on Apple's part there because it's happened before.  They they were there with the Mac before and Microsoft copied them and won and they won the war.  And it's they're still more or less, you know, balanced iOS and Android now.  But there's a real chance that Android is going to eclipse the iPhone even more than it already has.  There was a time where the iPhones was 80 percent of the smartphone business.  So it's it might be a little bit of, you know, phobia once, you know, they can live with it, but it's happening again.  So I can see how jobs would be very upset about it.

Start time: 6327.00
End time: 6363.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, the Verge has a Steve Jobs email.  You know, it's what's great about the lawsuit is the discovery because we're seeing all of this stuff.  This is do not fyi, do not forward from Steve Jobs to the to ET, which is, I guess, a group.  And what the strategy is, whole and there's the line.  Holy war with Google 2011. It's on their road map.

Start time: 6364.28
End time: 6387.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on there. So it goes both ways, though, if you look at the documents that Apple has released about Samsung,  there's one that says, you know, our number one objective is to go up against the iPhone.  Like this is our total focus is like kill the iPhone. Right.  So, I mean, it's not it's not a patent infringement to say that on your internal roadmap, but it is kind of salacious and interesting for the rest of us who are watching.

Start time: 6388.84
End time: 6412.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If I'm not thrilled about the lawsuit, but I'm really enjoying the discovery, I have to say it is.  And really, that's why Apple shouldn't be doing this. I think they pay a higher price doing this.  Maybe they get so they get two billion dollars. Maybe they win and they get two billion dollars.  But really, do you want all this stuff to come out? And do you want people to perceive you as petty?  Win by making a better product.

Start time: 6413.90
End time: 6423.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the problem is Apple hasn't made any new better products lately.  So it starts to become it starts to look like a patent troll unless it has some real creativity coming out.

You know, there's a rumor that there's this X plus one.  The Moto X plus one might be coming out. This is heavily exposed to the very cryptic tweet yesterday.  But the cool thing about that is we are we do expect that they've even said a new Motorola X this summer.  And, you know, just Motorola just be paying attention to the this and they just make a better one.  OK. Apple is 42 percent of U.S. smartphones and growing.  And and growing. That's important. Market share is growing.  Tell me, Patrick, in France. Yeah, I don't have the exact numbers.

Transcript:  I can take a little bit of the fun, but that's that's going too far.  So, yeah, no, I mean, obviously, when when the iPhone first came out, it was the Holy Grail, I guess.  And everyone wanted one. And it was everywhere.  You know, you would go on the metro and everyone would put the get their their iPhone out.  Now, I think it's a little bit more in line with with the U.S.  It's maybe 40, a little bit less, 30 percent, something like that.  It goes back and forth. But the image of Apple has eroded a little bit.  And we don't we don't see it as interesting as it was when I first came out.  And even myself, who is I got the first few iPhones, you know, the day they came out, I still I'm still using a 4S now.  And I'm happy with it. Oh, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.  The 4S, what are you nuts? Yeah.

Transcript:  There are there are a lot of people who think that it's it's become I guess that's how I would frame it.  It used to be that if you were serious about wanting a cool phone, you would get an actually good phone.  You would get an iPhone. And now it's really a matter of choice.  There's a good reason for it. There are lots of good reasons to get an iPhone, lots of good reasons to get an Android phone and, you know, a few reasons to get a Windows phone.

Transcript:  So, Jeff, your perception is very interesting because I think you're right.  I think that is the general perception.  But according to NPD, Apple has 45 percent market share, at least in sales in last year, compared to 24 percent.  I'm sorry, 26 percent for Samsung.  What's Samsung? What's Android all over?  Android overall is 40 is equal. It's 50 50 overall.

Start time: 6616.01
End time: 6630.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  50 50, which is phenomenal.  And considering that Apple created the market and worldwide, Android's going berserk because the price point is that's what I was interested in worldwide.  Yes. I mean, India and places like that.  It's it's Android now. Yeah, sure.

Start time: 6631.76
End time: 6643.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Apple is not even competing on that segment.  So it's a little bit unfair to include all of those cheaper Android phones as well.  All right. I've tried to avoid.

Start time: 6644.02
End time: 6667.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not unfair.  It's just let's say, OK, you're looking at a different, different strategy.  Right. It's a strategy.  And what what Eric Schmidt said years ago is that the strategy for Android was with a free operating system, you'd end up with more users.  You would thus end up with more developers and you would thus take over.  And the price point is exactly part of the strategy.

Transcript:  There's a slide, though, if you look at the one of the documents that we've been talking about from the discovery, this is an Apple internal executive retreat around strategy from last year.  So April, looking forward to 2014 strategy.  And this is the slide I put at the top of my article because I thought it was like crazy to see this and kind of an Apple slide.  The headline is consumers want what we don't have.  And it talks about growth in the smart phone phones.  The growth in the smartphone market is coming from two places.  One of them is phones that are cheap and one of them is phones that are big.  And at the time, they didn't sell either of those.

Start time: 6703.62
End time: 6713.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  And which, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not going to be on Apple fan boards to come after me.  But if that's your innovation, let's take the same thing and make it a little bigger.  That's not terribly inspiring.

Start time: 6729.01
End time: 6751.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's so yes.  No, it's true.  No, I agree.  I completely agree.  The thing I want to challenge is this idea that there needs to be constant, incredible innovation in that space.  You know, we had maybe three incredible years when that the new types of smartphones arrived.  But then nothing has really become incredibly innovative.

Start time: 6752.36
End time: 6761.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the problem exactly, Patrick.  I mean, Apple charges a premium because Apple is supposed to be wow.  And if it doesn't bring new while we out, it ain't worth the premium.

Start time: 6762.58
End time: 6814.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their premium is there for the it's not necessarily for the innovation.  I mean, they've been selling Macs that have not been that innovative for a very premium price for a long time.  The build quality, the image, you know, that's I think what their core wow he Ness.  If we're making up words comes from, it's not necessarily from the we sort of have this weird idea now that Apple is failing.  Is there if they're not revolutionizing the market with every product they come out with?  And historically, I don't think they've done that with every new product they come out with.  It happens every three, four years.  But I think people are expecting a little bit too much are being a little bit unreasonable in their expectations.

I just don't always do his brows.  Well, I do a few other things.  Maybe that's like what?  Like what?  Yeah, right.  Python code.  I don't know.  Edit video, edit photos, that kind of thing.  Let us take a little break.  I've been putting it off, but I guess we have to talk about Brendan Ike.  I'll be eager to hear what you think.  I don't know.  It's hard.  I don't know.  It's hard.  Anyway, take a break.  We'll come back and talk about our show today.  Brought to you by Atlassian, the folks who make Jira.  Don't ask me what Jira does because I don't have to worry about it.  But if you are managing a big code project, you probably know about Jira.  You know all about it.  And I'm sure you're interested in what it can do for you.  It is the world's most powerful customizable issue and project management system.  So the whole idea is it's something that will capture your workflow so you can take action on what's important.  Stay up to date on the activity going on around you.  Plan, track, work smarter and faster.  Great for your team.  Oh, hey.  This is the jazzy video from Atlassian.  A simple interface for collaborating with each other in real time, by the way.  This is not Twitter here.  You have a Twitter-like interface, but there's a whole lot more.  There's a full real-time activity stream going on.  You can do anything you want pretty much.  Any business process you can imagine.  Your team can work the way you want.  You define your own issue types, track the information that matters to you.  They've got email, chat, app mentions, RSS.  You can monitor streams of activity, self-updating reports, dashboards.  Really significantly.  Angry nerds bug workflow.  I like this.  This is a good project they've got here.  Angry nerds they're making.  It works, of course, with Git.  That means you can follow the code from development all the way through delivery in a single system.  The planning docs in there, the files and changes in the code repository all the way.  You can even build onto JIRA yourself.  A lot of people do with Atlassian's REST APIs.  It's easy.  Flexible and simple enough for a five-person startup.  Powerful and reliable enough for 100,000-person enterprise.  That's why 70% of the Fortune 100 uses JIRA.  NASA uses JIRA.  25,000 companies are using JIRA.  JIRA is at the heart of Atlassian's offerings for managing your entire application dev process.  From concept to launch.  And I want you to try it right now at Atlassian.com slash twit.  You'll get more information.  You can try it free for 30 days.  And it's really affordable.  As little as $10 a month for up to 10 users.  Atlassian.  A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.  Atlassian.com slash twit to find out more about JIRA.  I do hope they make that Angry Nerds game.  That one.  We could use that.  So Kara wrote the story, and I think that's great, about Brendan Eich resigning.  He was one of the creators of Mozilla, one of the founders of Mozilla,  and then he was tapped by the board to become CEO not so long ago, like a week ago, right?  About three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago.  Almost instantly three members of the board resigned.  There was a Twitter.

End time: 7049.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7051.00
End time: 7055.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there wasn't any attempt to separate the two events.  There was a little...  No, there was.

Start time: 7056.08
End time: 7076.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there was?  Yeah, there was some kind of fuzziness around it.  I mean, particularly because John Lilly was the former CEO, Gary Kovacs was the former CEO.  Maybe it was time for them to move on.  They were naming a new one.  There's like some plausible reasons, but Lilly actually did say, or he was quoted as saying in the New York Times,  I didn't want to be involved when he was CEO.

Start time: 7077.34
End time: 7112.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The controversy is over the fact that he, Ike, donated $1,000 to Prop 8,  which was the anti-gay marriage initiative that passed in California.  That became public only because the databases are public, as they should be in this country.  And so you can see who gave money to what.  Okay, Cupid kind of took the most extreme point of view by forbidding people using Firefox to use their site.

Start time: 7112.32
End time: 7116.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they didn't forbid you.  They put up a pop-up suggesting you use something else.  Well, they didn't lock you out.

Start time: 7117.02
End time: 7135.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just said, don't use it.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  They're calling this clicktivism, which is a terrible word.  Oh, I misunderstood.  I thought that you couldn't use Firefox.  So they really just took it as an opportunity to raise the issue.  And then you can move on.

Start time: 7136.79
End time: 7145.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, plenty of people have done that.  They've said, oh, you might want to come back with a more modern browser,  not usually over political issues, like in this case.  Similar to that.

Start time: 7145.45
End time: 7165.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  On March 28th, Ike blogged.  He was sorrowed at having caused pain.  He did not, however, say, I now support gay marriage.  I don't know what, Jeff, you put me on the spot because I don't know what to say about this.

Start time: 7165.16
End time: 7219.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then afterwards, Andrew Sullivan, obviously well-known gay political writer,  argued that gays had basically put a head on a stake and this was going to be bad for the cause of gay rights.  Mark Andreessen, who had worked with him at the browser company, obviously.  Thank you very much.  See, age, Liz, don't get old.  I'm telling you.  And Netscape said that this was going too far.  Josh Marshall wrote a very interesting column today saying, listen, nobody has a right to be a CEO.  And a CEO is a different job.  And he said, if somebody just plucked out somebody from a federal agency,  so we don't like what you say, you're fired, that wouldn't work.  But if the head of, if a cabinet member came out with a controversial view like this,  then people would understand saying you got to go.

End time: 7252.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's legitimate concern if you're in the LGBT community that maybe you're not going to get treated well at Mozilla under Ike.  Which I think is a legitimate concern.  Well, he made a point of posting, believe it or not, I mean, I don't know whether this is sufficient,  but he made a post on the blog saying, you know, I'm committed to equality in everything we do.  I want to work with the LGBT community, et cetera, et cetera.  Maybe that wasn't enough.  It does feel a little like a witch hunt.  I got to say.  That's the issue.

Start time: 7253.06
End time: 7294.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that there's a couple of things going on here that are important.  One is that Mozilla is not just any company.  They're a community of activists that work together on a nonprofit, all contributing.  And they have this they have this kind of radical openness of a culture where they actually encourage employees to criticize their CEO on Twitter if they feel like criticizing them.  That even wouldn't be the case other places.  So I think it's less about feeling like you wouldn't be treated well at work and more about feeling like you're on this mission driven line of work.  And if your CEO has a close minded approach to something that's crucial to how you define your values, that's it's hard to reconcile that with the notion of openness.

Start time: 7295.38
End time: 7331.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Liz, you know, number one, I'm resolutely in favor of gay marriage, resolutely against the proposition and agree with you what you just said.  The question then becomes, though, where are the lines?  What are the right?  And I'm sorry, this this fits in with the Kevin Rose story, because at some point, if you become dogmatic and don't allow other voices or other ways to view the world, then you have an issue of openness.  And mind you, I couldn't disagree more with Ike's stand on this issue.  But it's his right to do it at some point.  At some point, isn't it?

Start time: 7333.06
End time: 7355.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK. He should be allowed to have his opinion.  Should it cost him his job is the question.  And then you make a good point, which is his job is in a very, you know, an open source project.  It's an open community and he's going to be managing gay employees.  Should he be, you know, would he be fair and equal to them?  I believe he would have been.

Start time: 7356.48
End time: 7393.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's also this aspect of the witch hunt is moving faster than ever.  Right. Like this online discussion is moving faster, but also the discussion about this particular issue.  You know, eight years. What?  Sorry. 2008. So six years ago, Proposition 8 passed in California.  A majority of people who voted voted yes on Proposition 8.  And that's basically equivalent to it's a little bit more to give money to it.  But he was on the side of the majority six years ago.  So, yes, the online witch hunt is moving faster than ever.  But also the you know, the which is the right and which is the wrong side of history is moving faster than ever as well.  And so you're living in that new dynamic.

Start time: 7394.40
End time: 7430.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's what Josh Marshall's point, which I think was a good one, that says that the victors in a moral war need to give the losers the chance to come in time.  And I think that's true.  I think that the victory of gay and lesbian LGBT communities about these issues was magnificent.  And you're right, Liz. Swift, so swift that some take time to catch up.  And so President Obama himself had to catch up on this issue.  He was it was not that long ago at all that he said, I'm all for gays, but I'm against this marriage thing.  Right. And he had to catch up.  And I guess the issue was actually, by the way, exactly the same year.

Start time: 7432.00

Transcript:  And Meg Whitman, who I think is maybe an even better comparison because she's the Republican CEO of a technology company and a former candidate as a Republican for governor of California.  She said in February that she had changed her mind and now is in support of gay marriage.

Start time: 7450.89
End time: 7516.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's even let's you know, we're talking about people, you know, coming around and sure.  Let's say he doesn't. And like Jeff, I have to say I'm very much in favor of gay marriage.  So that's not even the issue. But the guy was not like an incredibly militant person.  It seems he wasn't. The issue is not that he was at rallies, that he was trying to raise money, that he was.  He just gave a thousand dollars for the cause that he thought he was, you know, falling on one side of the issue.  And if he is being he's being stigmatized for it in this way, six or, you know, six years later, he's being stigmatized for an idea that yes, is not very, you know, is probably going against the openness that the company, Mozilla, wants to promote.  But it's still very concerning that he's being stigmatized like this and not just stigmatized, you know, forced out for the extent of what he did, which doesn't seem to warrant that kind of ire.

Start time: 7517.34
End time: 7558.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, I think as we're going to argue more and more and more about protecting the Internet for the sake of free speech, then we have to decide as an Internet culture what that means.  What is the level of tolerance that we have about different opinions?  And I consider it a wrong opinion flat out.  But at some point, you know, you defend the rights of others to have those opinions.  We defend the notion, you know, we make fun of Erdogan for getting rid of for shutting down Twitter and YouTube because of opinions he doesn't like.  Did the militant side of Mozilla shut down Ike for an opinion they don't like?  And I don't like that opinion either.  But we have to decide what is the culture of free speech on the net?

Transcript:  I've been taking a lot of of we've had this issue very recently about gay marriage in in France and unbelievably it became an issue in France.  I thought it wasn't going to be I thought it was, you know, just you weird Americans that would make this an issue.  But and I've been taking a little bit of crap, but we've had an open dialogue with with my followers and the people who want to discuss this issue.  And that's exactly the problem.  Jeff, what you're saying, we have to be tolerant of other people that ideas and he's not going around.  I think that's what I was trying to emphasize in what I said earlier.  You know, he's not running around drowning puppies or strangling people.  You know, he he just expressed his idea.  Yes.  What if it were racism?  What if he'd what if he'd?

Start time: 7613.00
End time: 7665.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good question.  Well, you know, I mean, I always try to define it in those terms because and the reason I do is because as times change bigotry and changes.  And so it's now pretty well accepted that if you don't like somebody because of the color of their skin, well, that's clearly wrong.  And I think we're rapidly moving in that situation for people if you don't like people because who they love.  There's some that we now know that that's wrong.  But we're catching up on that.  What if it were racism, which was kind of widely agreed?  That's a problem.  I think there'll be no question if he if there were some smoking gun that said in an email in 2008, you know, I don't think we should hire black people at at Mozilla.  He would be out.  He wouldn't have been considered.  That's not even what he said.  You know, he's not he didn't say I don't think you're right.  I don't think black people should be allowed to marry white people.  What if he'd said what if he'd said that?

Start time: 7666.02
End time: 7673.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, after the Civil Rights Act, after finally integration came to this country and we still have a long way to go.  I think we did forgive a lot of people for not George Wallace, maybe, but a lot of people for racism.  I think we recognize the times have changed and people have come along.  Now, Ike has never repudiated his point of view.  He's done for all we know, still has that point of view.

Start time: 7698.06
End time: 7706.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the other issue is I thought about that, too.  We don't what if he'd said, well, I changed my mind.  But then that means the mob made him change his mind to keep him.

Start time: 7707.28
End time: 7736.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was the original act.  But not to be the stickler in here, but one other point that came out in reporting is that at least according to the folks who are talking about it, which is which is not Ike except for a very brief blog post, Mozilla contends that they did not ask him to step down.  He asked him to not serve as CEO and he decided he needed to leave the company.  So I thought it was an interesting distinction of him.  He was ultimately the one who kind of ran from the furor that he'd ignited.

Start time: 7737.10
End time: 7744.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you OK, but if you'd been asked to step down as CEO after three weeks, you probably would leave the company.  Right. I mean, you're not going to stick around.

I hear a lot of good things from people who buy Pebbles.  They've sold hundreds of thousands.  Was it 400,000?  I was going to reach for my.  That's your number of the week.  Yeah.
