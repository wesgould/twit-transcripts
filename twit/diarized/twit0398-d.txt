End time: 185.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the eggs come out of the  chicken and we were in fact the  chicken capital, but mostly were  the egg capital because they  didn't kill the chickens to eat  them.  They kept them laying.

Apparently, we're going to have  a big parade of the eggs.  We're going to have a big  parade of the eggs.  We're going to have a big  parade of the eggs.  So we celebrate our agricultural  roots with a big parade.  And Petaluma is only, it's 55,000  people, but really the west side,  which is where we are, is only  really about 25,000.  So there's really, so what  happens with the parade is  everybody in town is in the  parade.  And what they do is they line up  their chairs.  Who gets to watch it?  They march in the parade.  Well, you do because you march  in the parade and then as soon as  you've gone by, you go and you  sit in your chair and you watch  other people go by.  So it's kind of a circular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  aspiring journalists and the  first thing he wrote up on the  board was editors are evil and  underline evil like five times.  Typical writer.  I did that.  That's right.  That was the Markov.  Yeah.  He had a right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were the best.  They were the best.  They were the best.  They were the best.  And I know there are people  out there who are  sort of the thinkers that were  naively thinking the world was  in the 1950s.  Right?  And so I nobody thinks that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  And Jason helped launch the new  site.  Techhive.com, which has been  really great.  This is kind of your response to  the Verge and other websites that  are really kind of, I think,  starting to take over from the  print.  So yes.  Absolutely.  This is a good looking site.  It's really nicely tried to do

Start time: 337.77
End time: 341.07

Start time: 341.50
End time: 359.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's where Andy Anakos,  a three parter on how he left the  iPhone for an Android phone.  That's right.  And that's a perfect place for it  because it's kind of, you know.  Three parter.  You got a lot of mileage.  You know what's funny?  Because I left the iPhone years  ago, but did I get all the  attention that Andy did?  I guess he's so known as an  iPhone guy.  Yeah.

Start time: 359.88
End time: 364.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got a five parter.  It started as a two parter,  believe me, and then I saw part  two and I said, how about a  three parter?

Start time: 364.82
End time: 370.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's in there is what's  better, what's worse, why I feel  like the Android phones are now  better.

Start time: 370.58
End time: 377.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not trying to tell people  that he's just explaining his  thought process and what that  says about what Android does  well and what the iPhone maybe  needs to do better.

Start time: 377.82
End time: 422.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little later on, Denise Howell  is going to join us.  And so we're going to defer a  conversation about a pretty  sensitive subject in the tech  community right now.  The debate over dongles and  forking and whether there's a  place for that at a developers  conference.  But before we do that, let's  talk about the mess that Apple  made with two factor  authentication.  Boy, was this a...  So Apple did the right thing.  A few days ago, they announced  we're going to add second factor  authentication to your Apple  ID so that when you enter your  password on your iPad for the  first time or iPhone or on your  Mac to log into iCloud, to log  into iTunes, we're going to ask  for a code generated from your  phone.  Right.  And actually by a text message,  I guess, to your phone.

Start time: 422.90
End time: 440.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could be text message or they  also use the find my iPhone  feature.  So if you're logged into an  Apple ID, it can go to an iPad  or iPod touch or any device.  So how does that work?  Is it a pop up?  Yeah, it's the same technology  they use to push those, you know,  I'm lost.  Give me back my phone.  Make it loud noise because you  can't find it in the couch

Start time: 441.04
End time: 448.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cushions.  It's the same sort of thing.  So it will pop up an alert  saying here's your number.  Now, once you enter that, you  validate the machine and you  don't have to do that again,

Start time: 449.14
End time: 454.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right?  Right.  For some period of time, it's  valid.  So you have to have the  password and that.

Start time: 454.90
End time: 458.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For some period of time.  I'm specified.  I don't know the details.  This is what always bugs me.

Start time: 459.18
End time: 462.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't used it for that.  For Google, it's 30 days, I  think.  Yeah, because every 30 days,

Start time: 463.42
End time: 467.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  here comes another one of these  annoyances.  Yeah, and I got it.

Start time: 467.92
End time: 470.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, there's a trade off between  convenience and security.

Start time: 470.49
End time: 472.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What kind of security you need on  one of these phones?

Start time: 472.86
End time: 480.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, ask Matt Honan.  Had there been two factor  authentication on either his Gmail  or his Apple ID, he wouldn't have  been hacked, lost all his data.

Start time: 480.82
End time: 517.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the point is just  that you have to have your  password and then you have to  have one of these objects in  your pocket, really.  And then you have to put them  both in and then you get access  to your account.  And it's not for every login.  It's not like you don't have to  do this either.  You don't have to.  It's opt in.  No, although the day that this  came out, the verge also posted  an article about how they  discovered a horrible hole in  Apple's security system and  said, well, I guess you better  turn two factor on because  otherwise you can get hacked.  I think it's all they need to  know is your email address and  your date of birth and they  could reset your password and  take control of your account.  Yeah.  So two factor is a pain, but  it's probably a good idea.

Start time: 517.90
End time: 526.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People turned off the I forgot  website as soon as the verge  published this article and fixed  it. Although some people  probably we don't know, but I  would imagine some people were  bit by this.

Start time: 526.92
End time: 596.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have to do a little research.  It's not like the Internet  rushed in there because you have  to know somebody's email address  and date of birth.  Yeah.  So if your buddy's on  Wikipedia.  Yeah. Well, see, that's a  problem. Yeah.  And my email is highly, I did.  The big problem with the two  factor tying it to Apple IDs,  if you can put it to your SMS  just to a text message to your  phone and that works.  But I have I have two  different Apple IDs on my  devices. I've got the one I buy  all my apps on and I've got the  one I use like I cloud black  back up and all that.  And to send those messages,  you need to use the  it's the address you're using  for two factor is that ID.  And so I actually realized that  if I turned on two factor, I was  going to be reduced to just  text messages because my  devices are logged into a  different I cloud ID.  So you can only have one ID  on my phone.  Right. So, well, you can you can  have more than one ID, but the  messages for that ID will only  use that method.  So basically now I turned it on,  but it's only going to my wife's  iPhone and my iPhone and not our  other devices, because that's on  another Apple ID and Apple still  doesn't let you merge  different Apple IDs.  So everybody's got like three or  four Apple.

Start time: 596.52
End time: 630.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got a borrowed a guy's  iPad and I wanted to  prank him by downloading some  crazy apps from the app store  because but I didn't have any of  these IDs.  But since I had the iPad,  I went to the  the store, the app store, and it  says, did you forget your password?  And I said, yes.  So it sent me the password to the  mail account on the iPad,  which I just automatically opened  up, pulled the password down,  got to download the stuff,  cost them maybe five or six  bucks. But at the same time, it  was just like, this is kind of  dumb.

Start time: 630.36
End time: 632.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now, you know, I stopped  allowing John to handle any of my

Start time: 633.04
End time: 636.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  devices.  By the way, I was probably that  guy. I'm just thinking.

Start time: 636.52
End time: 640.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I never have touched your  iPad.  Thank you. You've always screwed up

Start time: 640.22
End time: 640.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  my phone.

Start time: 640.84
End time: 649.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. All I do this is joke.  Everyone should think about this  great joke.  You go into the language section  and turn the phone into Russian  or Cyrillic or something.

Start time: 649.32
End time: 651.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Some non-Roman alphabet.  Chinese is great.

Start time: 651.74
End time: 654.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't guess what it is.  You can never get.  Why?

Start time: 654.96
End time: 656.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I can't change it back because I  don't know.

Start time: 657.64
End time: 661.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So you got the guy in  Chinese. Great, great gag.  I recommend it.

Start time: 661.64
End time: 708.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good thing about the second  factor is it turns off the  security questions, which are a  huge loophole.  In fact, I don't even remember  setting security questions.  I cannot remember my favorite  children's book or the name  of this. Well, I know what the  name of the street where I grew  up is, but I don't it doesn't  work.  So I cannot reset my Apple  ID. And then here's the worst  part of this.  Send reset security info to this  email address, except this isn't  the email address they have on  file.  The it says dot com.  And then it says reset it dot  cc.  There's some script that munged  it.  Oh, because I never gave them.  I don't I don't know.  They have the correct address.  In fact, when I changed my  birthday to make this less  hackable, they sent me an email  to the correct cc address.

Start time: 708.42
End time: 739.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's some bug.  Yeah.  You know, you mention Matt  Honan and he wrote a great piece  in Wired about how the password  needs to die.  I mean, passwords, passwords are  good for low security kind of  semi-trustworthy environments.  Anymore and retina scan.  What we get.  Well, I mean, that's the thing  is the biometric stuff can be  can be fake.  It's not great either.  No.  So it's it's I mean, this two  factor stuff as as weird as it is  and kind of as we do it,  it's like getting those  government installations  where they've got the little  like cards that have the random  number on them that change.  They'll do three.

Start time: 739.24
End time: 743.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll they'll often do a  password, a number and then do  a retinal scan.

Start time: 743.14
End time: 748.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the good thing about that is  if your device that's got the two  factor on it disappears,  you can reset it.  Why don't you just keep things

Start time: 748.60
End time: 755.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  encrypted?  Well, we do.  And what's the guy who I use  last pass and then.

Start time: 755.96
End time: 784.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But well, the Honan thing is  interesting, and that's why I  says passwords need to die.  They didn't have his password.  At no point did they get his  password.  They use social engineering to  trick Amazon and then Apple  and to resetting into resetting  the password.  They didn't need the.  So he might have had a last pass  super secure, 28 digit password.  Didn't matter because they  tricked Apple.  That's one of the reasons Apple  needed to do this is the secret  that this eliminates secret  questions.  That's a big hole.  Any time I try to log in  and it says, did you forget your  password?  We can help.

Start time: 785.34
End time: 786.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a flaw.

Start time: 786.26
End time: 790.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Apple says, by the way,  after you turn this on,  we aren't going to help you  anymore.

Start time: 790.38
End time: 815.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they give you a special  secret code that is the third  factor, essentially,  and you need two of the three  factors.  And what they tell you to do  with that Dropbox is the same  way.  Google is the same way.  They tell you to print it out.  Save it.  Don't put it on a computer.  Don't save it.  Yeah, just print it out and put  that piece of paper somewhere  secure in your house or something  so that you can get it if you  need it, if you lose one of the  other two factors.  And then you can unlock it and  reset it with a different code.

Start time: 815.54
End time: 817.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say specifically,  do not put this on a computer.

Start time: 817.90
End time: 823.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Because then if it's offline,  Dropbox or whatever,  they can see that and then they  can reset your password.

Start time: 823.40
End time: 827.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's a pain.  You can say passwords should die,  but I don't know if there's an  obvious.

Start time: 827.62
End time: 832.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, well, that's the trick,  because everybody sort of agrees  passwords are weak.  But what do you do?  There's no great alternative

Start time: 832.80
End time: 837.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I use two factor on Google,  on Facebook also allows us now  Apple Dropbox.

Start time: 837.42

Start time: 838.76
End time: 844.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dropbox just just turned out on.  Yeah, I don't put anything  private on Dropbox because they  can read everything.  So they can.

Start time: 844.98
End time: 848.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you can also put a  encrypted disk image on Dropbox  if you want. Right. Right.

Transcript:  No, I don't care.  What do you do?  Do you have any?  You know, not really.  And somebody gets in.  What are you going to take?  Right.  I mean, I'm not trying to make  the argument that, gee,  I don't commit any crime.  So I don't want to lose my.  I don't care about my privacy  because that's bullcrap.  But I don't have, you know,  whether you steal all my old  columns, I mean, I mean,  what are they going to get?  Or my photos.  Gigabyte terabytes of photos.  I mean, it's like, God,  why does he keep all these photos?  Do you have your tax  returns online?  No.

Transcript:  Hey, we got a winger.  So we were doing a contest for GoToMeeting,  G-O-T-O meeting dot com.  I should probably tell you  what GoToMeeting is  before I tell you who the winner is.  It's a way for you to meet  and collaborate online.  Your entire team can get together  even if they're not physically  next to each other,  because GoToMeeting not only allows  screen sharing, but it actually  gives you HD video.  They call it HD faces.  So you're seeing  the person's screen.  You're seeing the people you're meeting with.  It works on not only a Mac or a PC,  but it works on an iPad, an iPhone,  Android devices.  In fact, you can present from iPads,  which is really awesome.  It means you can have a meeting  and you can be sitting out in the backyard  with your iPad in your lap  and enjoying yourself.  We use GoToMeeting with HD faces  for almost all of our online meetings.  It's just a lot easier to get together.  And as you know,  a lot of our team is distributed  all over the country, all over the world.  With GoToMeeting, you share the same screen  so you stay on the same page.  The built-in HD conferencing  makes it be like you're in the same room.  It's easy to launch or join a meeting from anywhere.  Why are you watching Twitter?  We're here.

We asked you to add the hashtags  twitipad and go to meeting.  I have the iPad here.  Congratulations to, drum roll,  Dave Cacandi, who said,  I would meet with HR professionals  from around the country using my new iPad  and go to meeting to encourage them to hire my students.  I guess he teaches from Ashland, Oregon,  and he teaches HR.  So there it is.  There's your iPad and we're gonna contact you, Dave.  Congratulations if you want us to autograph it.  In fact, we should contact him quick  so we can get Dvorak and Jason to autograph it as well,  if he would like that.  Thank you, Dave, congratulations.  We'll do more of these, more giveaways to come.  And make sure you try GoToMeeting to work face to face.

Transcript:  Apparently, according to-  Why would anyone in their right mind make this decision?

Start time: 1139.34
End time: 1151.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they went so far in the other direction  with this skeuomorphism.  In fact, maybe a harbinger of this,  the new podcast app which was just pushed onto the iPad  a couple of days ago,  they took the reel to reel tape recorder out.

Start time: 1151.62
End time: 1156.94

Transcript:  It was odd that they even included that.  Jessica Lesson, I've gotta get,  do you know Jessica?  She's been writing for the journal for a while,  covers the Apple beat and it does a great job.  She says that Johnny Ive has decided,  they said Scott Forstall was the man behind skeuomorphism,  the torn paper, the stitched leather.  But Jobs liked that too.  He liked it too.  Absolutely.  Because I remember that the leather,  was it on the note?  It was on something, was duplicated the leather  in the Apple van.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know what the point is,  but apparently Johnny Ive who was reputedly  always against all of this  and is now in charge of Apple GUI design globally,  says we're gonna go flatter.

Start time: 1208.94
End time: 1225.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, just look at all the stuff  that Ive has designed.  It's all been pretty simple.  And it's clean.  Lately, especially it's monochromatic and very simple.  And so it's not surprising.  If he has that clout and he's in charge of it now,  that they would move in that direction.  I think the DOS prompt.  That is minimalist.

Start time: 1226.18
End time: 1245.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ive is pushing according to Jessica  writing in the Wall Street Journal,  for a more flat design that is starker and simpler.  She says she gets this from developers  who've spoken to Apple employees.  Overall, they expect any changes to be pretty conservative,  like perhaps dropping the reel to reel  out of the podcast app.  Actually that podcast app,  which was horrible is now usable.

Start time: 1245.32
End time: 1269.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, Ive gets,  people talk about Ive's design sense a lot,  but he's not just looking to design pretty stuff.  I mean, he is a minimalist for functionality sake.  I think he more often than not is airing on the side of,  is it usable?  And that's really the most important thing here  is if he makes it bland,  but it's not any more usable,  then it's not a move,  it's not a step forward.  So, hopefully that's what he's looking for.  And I think he's got a good background.

Transcript:  It's me, I invented it.

Start time: 1289.42
End time: 1306.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the idea that if you've got a clock interface  on a computer, you have to grab a hand and drag it around,  even though that might be like wildly inefficient,  you have to do it because people are used to clocks  that work like that.  And eventually the idea is  that people aren't used to that anymore.  They understand that it's a digital clock  and that there's some better way to interact with it.

You're thinking about the Flintstones.  That's why skeuomorphism is kind of ridiculous.  It's like, why do cars have wood in them?  They never had wood in them.

Start time: 1363.92
End time: 1394.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The big argument here is that Apple  changed its address book design,  which used to be a sort of a three-paned approach,  but they wanted it to look like a physical book.  So they took one of the panes away,  which made it less functional, but more like a book.  And the people who are against skeuomorphic design  say that you shouldn't turn off functionality  just in order to make people say,  oh cool, it looks like a book.  On the other hand, a lot of people think it's really cool  that when you're in iBooks and you flip the page,  you actually see the page curl.  For some reason, I don't mind a page,

Start time: 1394.38

Transcript:  especially if you can turn it off.  It's a bit corny.  But it's a little cornball.  There's skeuomorphism.  See the wood, see the brushed aluminum, the knobs.  This is probably from Dribble, D-R-I-B-B-B-L-E  has a lot of examples of skeuomorphism.  Look at that, a coffee cup sliding  on a checkered tablecloth.

One of them is it's cute and it's fun and it's whimsical.  And then the other thing is it's less functional  or it's confusing and it gets in my way.  And sometimes people wrap all that stuff up  in skeuomorphism.  And I do think it's two separate things.  Making something look like leather  isn't a problem necessarily if it doesn't get in your way.  It's only when you're taking features out  in order to make it look like it's stitched.

And the impact that had on me  was when I first learned of the list,  first of all, I never thought that I would be on it.  I'm 48 years old and look nothing like that woman  that you just showed the Russian gal.  So I'm flipping through and I was just stunned.

And most people are, especially on the internet,  especially on these sites.  And you can threaten them and do all these things.  He's not gonna, you're not gonna, you think-  Judgment proof and have no judgment.  We had people that were stealing my column full cloth  from PC Magazine.  I went right to the lawyers, I said, what is this?  This guy's, you know, he's taking this up.  He says, you know, it's not worth the trouble.  Yep. Yep.  Not worth the trouble.

Transcript:  So let's get to the dongle joke.  Why?  This is another one I didn't really wanna cover,  but I feel like we probably should.  It's certainly spun out of control now.  It happened at PyCon, the Python Developers Convention.  Adrienne Richards, who I, turns out I know,  I did not know I knew her until somebody in the chat room  said, oh yeah, she interviewed you last year.  And very nice person.  Was sitting in the 10th row  of the Python Programming Conference.  She works as a developer evangelist for a company.  And apparently there were a couple of guys  sitting behind her, mouthing off about dongles and forking.  What we don't know is how foul or purr-y  that we knew what the jokes were.  But she took a picture of them and tweeted, not cool,  jokes about forking repos in a sexual way  and big dongles right behind me, PyCon.  And here's the bad news.  The guy on the right got fired by his company  and Adrienne got fired by her company.  So guy was a developer for Playhaven.  Playhaven posted, the CEO posted on the website,  as a company that is dedicated to gender equality  and values, honorable behavior.  We conducted a thorough investigation  and we've let the employee go.  And then Adrienne got fired by her company.  They don't have anything to say about why SendGrid.  SendGrid has meanwhile been DDoSed by Anonymous.  Just a mess.  And it really-

Start time: 1986.00
End time: 2015.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, here it is.  All right, I got it.  A SendGrid developer evangelist responsibility,  Adrienne, is to build and strengthen our developer  community across the globe.  In light of the events of the last 48 hours  it's become obvious that her actions have strongly divided  the same community she was supposed to unite.  As a result, she can no longer be effective  in her role at SendGrid.  Our commitment to our 130 employees, their family,  their community members,  our more than 130,000 valued customers  is our primary concern.  So what a mess.

Start time: 2017.04
End time: 2033.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that about sums it up.  What a mess.  Nobody except maybe PyCon ends up looking good  in this at all.  And they are still gonna be remembered  where this thing happened,  but at least they seem to have acted with some care.  And every other party in here, yeah.

Start time: 2036.02
End time: 2045.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two weeks, probably.  But I feel bad for Adrienne.  She's being doxxed right now and the internet hackers  are publishing her private information.  She's being trolled, getting death threats on 4chan.

Start time: 2046.02
End time: 2064.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My concern is that the thing that won't be forgotten here  is that there's gonna be another conference  where there's a woman and a group of 50 men  and somebody's gonna say something that's really offensive  but the last time that happened, she got fired.  So I'm just gonna shut up.  That's what concerns me.  That's actually a really good point.

Start time: 2065.96
End time: 2100.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope that the takeaway for this,  I hope it's not forgotten in a couple of weeks,  and that the takeaway for this is that people need to realize  that in the world we live in today,  everything you do is a matter of public record.  And so you need to think about it.  Whether you're cracking the joke in an inappropriate place,  whether you're overreacting perhaps  to overhearing a joke that was not directed at you,  all of that conduct is subject to scrutiny  by the world at large based on the networked society  that we're living in.

Start time: 2100.42
End time: 2133.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is also reasonable that you want to make  computer sciences, engineering, and programming  a friendly place for women.  So I understand perhaps Adria's point,  which is we gotta be a little more careful  about how we act at these events.  And I doubt she thought that the repercussions  that happened would happen.  Also, by the way, it was against the rules  of the conference, I guess, although I think those rules  were changed after the fact, so I'm not sure.

Start time: 2134.40
End time: 2165.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so conference rules are there  that you're sitting in the audience.  No harassment.  You're sitting in the audience, you're not harassing her.  You're just talking amongst your friends  thinking you're funny.  And you exchange a couple of jokes she overhears  and doesn't like it, doesn't turn around and punch them.  She gets a little annoyed and then takes a picture  to humiliate them and puts it on the internet.  I don't know, I mean, who's at fault here?  I mean, she could have done other things.  Well, we don't know what she did.  She might have complained.  We do know one thing she did.  She took a picture and posted on the internet  calling these guys out as douchebags.

Start time: 2166.24
End time: 2194.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really liked Jolie Odell's post on this  where she presented the alternate reality  of what could have happened if folks had just made  some different decisions.  And I'm certainly not singling out Adria  as somebody who misbehaved, because I don't think she did,  but you've got to think before you decide to involve  the entire online community in your career path

Start time: 2197.34
End time: 2219.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but Twitter's not a really great way to communicate  and keep it a secret, right?  I mean, I feel like what she was really trying to do there  was communicate to the PyCon people  that she was feeling uncomfortable.  She did hashtag at PyCon.  And they came and they dealt with it.  They took the guys outside to ask them to cut it out.  But the fact was it's not a direct message to PyCon.  It's a public tweet and it got around  and it got those guys fired.

Start time: 2220.06
End time: 2229.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what we don't know is what the jokes were,  how offensive they were.  We don't know if she looked at them and said,  stop it, and they didn't.  I don't know if we know more enough about the story  to know really what happened.

Start time: 2229.82
End time: 2253.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we don't know if she's been in that situation before  and did say something and it was a bad situation.  So she didn't want to do it again.  I mean, there's lots, like I said,  I think there's a lot of questions  about a lot of the behavior in this situation.  Nobody comes out looking good, I think.  But my concern is just in the future,  other women in technology are going to be like  feeling it's even more an oppressive environment,  which is what we're trying to stop from happening.

Start time: 2253.68
End time: 2271.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good point.  I mean, horrendous things do happen at tech conferences.  I've heard horrible.  What?  Oh, terrible stories.  Like what?  Well, I'm not sure I want to get into it,  but of women being physically harassed  in an elevator, for instance.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2288.68
End time: 2323.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been to tons of tech conferences  and I've never had a single kind of negative incident  like that, except that just being cognizant of the numbers,  and the numbers are gradually changing.  But again, that lean in book,  it may not be the first thing that a guy thinks  about reading, but they should.  It is a really, really good read  and it sort of gives the experience  of what people are doing today  that they may not even be thinking about that they should.

Start time: 2323.74
End time: 2334.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should say also that PyCon,  I think had 30% women attendees.  Really?  So it was, I mean, that's a much more  women populated conference than a lot of developer conferences.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Okay, let's move on.  Weave going to jail for 41 months.  And I think what he did here was mouthed off.  That was what he did.  He's the guy who figured out that if you query an AT&T  database with a UUID, I think it was a UUID,  it will give you, no, I'm sorry, the ICC IDD,  it will give you your email address back.

Start time: 2364.86

Start time: 2369.36
End time: 2390.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So 2010, he wrote a script that would query this database  over and over and over again and collected hundreds  of thousands of email addresses of iPad owners.  Remember, he released that information.  That's pretty creative.  It is, I'm not sure he needed to do it 100,000 times.

Start time: 2391.66
End time: 2394.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and release it publicly.  Well, I'm not sure.

Start time: 2394.74
End time: 2397.76

Start time: 2398.36
End time: 2402.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's random, it's a script, so it just went through numbers.  Yeah, it just pranks away.  And if nothing came back, he tried the next one

Start time: 2402.96
End time: 2407.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then the next one.  Well, he doesn't try anything, the computer just.  It's a script.  He wakes up in the morning, he's got 100,000.

Start time: 2407.78
End time: 2413.27

Transcript:  He said he wanted to get the, first he says,  he tells the assembled crowd the day before his sentencing  at a press conference on the courthouse steps,  I'm going to jail for doing arithmetic.  Then he says he wants the maximum sentence  so that people will rise up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And a federal law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,  that allows for some very severe penalties  if you're found guilty of exceeding authorized access  or accessing a computer without authorization.  That's what Aaron Schwartz was charged with.  Right.  And for someone like Weave,  we may all just kind of say, okay, you know.  He deserved it.  I got what he deserved.

Transcript:  There's also, in my estimation,  a fear of computer technology,  which also fuels this,  that prosecutors, police officials,  are so afraid of what hackers can do  that they over prosecute them.  Even when what they're doing is really no different  than vandalizing the front of a building.  Right.  It's treated as much more serious because of,  it's scary.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hackers seem to be winning.  Yeah, they just be quiet.  Steve Gibson talked on the Security Now this week  about a very interesting study.  They called it an Internet Census 2012.  But what it really was, was a smartly anonymous guy  because he would go to jail for this for sure,  who realized that there were a lot of computers out there  with open FTP ports.  Even worse, these open FTP ports  were often not secured by real passwords.  So he wrote a paper that you could find at bitbucket.org.  He posted it anonymously.  The paper is full of some beautiful images.  He was able to create a botnet  of hundreds of thousands of computers,  all of which he got into by blogging in through Telnet  and using default passwords like rootroot or rootblank.  The images, some of these images are amazing.

Start time: 2681.54
End time: 2687.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2687.74
End time: 2732.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is why he of course is gonna stay very anonymous  because this is an absolute violation of federal law  and worldwide law and all things that are right.  They, he took this stuff off by the way,  but after six months of doing this,  he needed these because he had to use these  botted computers to continue the census.  It's a very big universe.  He scanned every IP address looking for open Telnet ports.  Some of them were on things like internet front facing  HP printers with Telnet ports.  Oh, that's interesting.  It's really terrifying and there's nothing anybody  can do about this because these devices  aren't going to be fixed.  They're not gonna be updated.

Start time: 2732.50
End time: 2741.16

Start time: 2771.70
End time: 2781.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what he did is he updated the software.  It's like you could do that with a WiFi router too.  You put some software on it that makes it connect  to other devices and just keep going.

Unfortunately now, because he's written this paper,  bad guys know, if they didn't know already,  how to use Telnet and to create massive botnets.  One of the reasons that malware propagates  is because they want to take over machines,  create botnets to attack servers.

You already told us this trick.  Well, because you'll see, when you see a version of...  First of all, we only have one advertiser per half hour,  so that's four advertisers in the whole show.  But when you begin the show, you get a billboard.  And that's actually free.

End time: 3465.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, so we charge them 40 bucks for the billboard,  but they have to buy it and they have to buy an ad.  So you have to buy two ads, each at 40 bucks.  That's an effective CPM of $80 for Audible, for instance.  So audible.com...

Start time: 3501.20
End time: 3527.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where I came up with 70.  Originally, my target was 70, we've gotten up to 80,  but I did that research.  I said, how much is a full-page ad in PC Magazine,  in PC World?  It was about 110, 120 CPM.  And how much is a radio ad?  I said, it's about 10, 15 at most.  Yeah.  And so I said, well, we're somewhere in between.  So I said 70.  Now that was years ago.  We didn't get 70 right away.  Right.  But we worked our way up to it.

Start time: 3527.82

Transcript:  That's the question is...  Got it in there.  Is YouTube a good environment for advertisers?  Obviously not, or they would be charging more  than three or four dollars.  It's not targeted.  It's not targeted at all.  It's targeted to goofballs.  But it could be more targeted.  Google knows who's watching.  Yeah, you're right.  It's true.  It could be highly targeted.  I don't know.  Do I see ads?  I don't think so.  I keep seeing Zeusc ads on...  That's the dating site.

And if people say no,  they don't show you the ad ever again.  Facebook started to do that.  Facebook does that, yeah.  And Google does it too?  Hulu. Hulu.  And the advantage is you get,  for the advertiser wants this.  You get a metric.  And people who wanna see the ad are seeing the ad.  It's one way of kind of measuring engagement.  I'd say no to all of them.  That makes no sense.  Well, that's why they don't advertise to you.  You don't buy anything.  What do you buy?  I buy...  What are you the decider for?  What product?  Food.  All right.  I buy all the food.  So, this is the problem is,  I don't know how anybody would target you with food ads.  I mean, how would they even know that this...  Right?

You're not gonna switch to Keep,  especially in light of the fact  that Google just dumped Reader and could very...  In fact, there's a graph.  I'll see if I can find it on Google.

They made the Google Reader,  put all these RSS readers out of business,  and then they killed the reader.  Effectively killed RSS.  Well, RSS.  I don't think it on attention.  It's not attention.

Transcript:  We know what's going to happen is that they're gonna,  so many people have already reverse engineered the API  for Google Reader,  that that's what's gonna happen next,  is that everybody's gonna just put up their clones  of the Google Reader API.  There's so many news readers  that rely on Google Reader to do their jobs.  That's the problem,

Start time: 3963.46
End time: 3997.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because Google was providing a backend.  They were,  and we've talked about this with Kevin Marks  on this week in Google,  and Kevin Marks created Tech Narate,  wrote the code for Tech Narate  that went out and spidered sites,  and he said, this is actually a challenge,  because you don't want,  every site doesn't want 100 different readers pinging,  is there something new, is there something new?  Google was giving you the infrastructure  where they could do that once they were spidering it anyway.  It was part of their indexing.  They were really perfectly situated to do this,  and again, giving it up is really deleterious  to the internet economy.  Go ahead, Denise, I'm sorry.

Google won't say how many people use Google Reader,  but Mike McHugh from Flipboard said  that two million people have connected Google Reader accounts  to the Flipboard app.  I did that.  I did too.  So that's a lot of people who had at least had accounts  and were interested in what was on that reader account.

Transcript:  You know who's not really crying about this though  is publishers, because RSS was never a really great...  It's not a bad traffic generator,  but it's not a great ad platform.  People generally prefer RSS feeds  with the content in the feed,  at which point if there are no ads there,  it's not that good.  And then you mentioned about caching.  I mean, one of the problems with Google Reader is,  yeah, you don't have to have that big infrastructure,  but it also means you can't count.  It's harder to tell how many people  are behind that Google feed.  Plus, if you post something new,  it doesn't go live until Google decides it's time to cache it.

Start time: 4109.40
End time: 4115.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 4129.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was not the best.  I mean, we tried some stuff with it.  If you didn't have a RSS feed that was very popular,  it would decrease how often it...  Pinned you.  It pinned you.  And so we had some custom feeds that we were setting up  and they basically were unusable in Google Reader  because they wouldn't update,  except every six hours or every 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was making...  You'd rather have somebody just...  Use a newsreader.  Go direct, right?  Rather than going through the middleman.  Well, that was the argument against it,  which was there's too many pings.  You're gonna get pounded now by all these individuals.  I never made that argument.  Yeah, well, I don't think it's...  I think it's a bull crap argument.  You don't get that.  I saw it, you're bing, bing, bing.  It's not gonna be like you're not already pounded.

Transcript:  were app developers,  because app developers didn't have to check  50 different servers one at a time,  some in Atom, some in RSS, some malformed.  Google Reader made it like one API call to one server.  Everything was in one format.  So it was super easy for them.  And if you used like a podcast client,  like I used downcast on my iPhone.  Me too, yeah.  And you hit reload there and it's like one, two, three,  because it actually is going to every single one of those.  So the app developers having a middleman is great.

Transcript:  Nick Baum, Liz Gaines quotes Nick Baum,  one of the original product managers said that  in the early days,  several million weekly active users used Google Reader.  But he said, my sense is if it's a consumer product  at Google that's not making money,  unless it's gonna get a hundred million users,  it's not worth doing.

I don't like the idea of having an entire mail thread  for five, six, seven, eight, 10 years of mail  being owned by somebody other than myself.  I just find it somewhat annoying.  It's like the post office sending my mail to Google,  letting them look at it and then say,  okay, here it is, Dvorak.  And I just don't like it.  I think if nothing else, it's creepy.

How many user data requests-  Yeah, this is just requests.  And what they do- It's not a subpoena.  Let's look at the United States of America.  That's where we live, here in the US of A.  Oh, these are national security letters.  By the way, they can't tell you exactly  in terms of national security letters.  So they say we receive somewhere between zero  and a thousand national security letters.  Because they're not allowed to.  Could be zero.

End time: 4590.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me mention some, to give a retort  to one of Jason's assertions,  which is that, y'all, what difference does it make?  They can go to your ISP and get the data and all the rest.  You can maintain a pop account someplace,  even your IMAP account on some local guy's little operation.  And if you know the guy specifically,  like my friend who runs the seaktime.mailer,  you can take the stuff off, erase it,  as part of your process, nothing new,  not to destroy evidence,  but just some way of just getting rid of all this.  You don't know that Google hasn't got everything backed up.  They back up all your searches, for God's sake,  and they keep that stuff for 18 months.  It's possible that every email you've ever done on Gmail  is still on the servers, whether you erased it or not.

Start time: 4590.54
End time: 4593.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4594.55
End time: 4602.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't have mail through my ISP.  I have mail through an independent...  He uses his podcast service.  What do you mean?  But does it back up that server?  It's like, get no spam.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 4602.72
End time: 4608.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But do they back up that server?  Because if they keep backups,  then they can subpoena your mail on those backups, too.  So, Denise, this says...  It's a rolling backup.

Start time: 4608.90
End time: 4635.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not an archive backup.  Okay, this says,  Google got formal requests issued  under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  for the production of information  that may not involve a judge.  They received 5,000 in the US,  5,784 requests July through December last year,  10,000 accounts, and they complied with some data anyway,  88% of those.  Is that what you're talking about?  These could have been depositions,  I mean, discovery, motions in a civil suit.

Start time: 4636.48
End time: 4656.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Depositions are where you sit down in a room  with someone and ask them questions.  But you can subpoena information from Google,  but what Google can then do,  if you've decided to be obstreperous  and you're not gonna produce something responsive  in discovery, which is a bad decision,  you should respond to discovery and make the process.

But what I was gonna say is even if they go to Google  and say, okay, we need this person's entire email account,  well, in litigation, people, the judge is going to demand,  and hopefully your lawyer is going to come in and object  and say, we need to have this narrowly tailored  to what you actually need to know for this lawsuit.

But when you're litigating, fortunately, you have counsel  who's looking after you, hopefully,  and they're gonna come in and object  and say, no, this is overbroad.  And if they're gonna respond and actually give over  the things that are gonna help the lawsuit go forward,  and Google's never gonna be involved in that process anyway.  But to the extent that Google has to be involved,  again, you can come in and object and go, no,  this is not responsive to what we actually need in the suit.

Said that it was, well, the interesting thing is,  and Denise, again, you can qualify this  because you actually understand the law,  but she said that it was a violation of free speech  because one of the things a national security letter does  is say, we want this information  and you may not tell anybody that we've requested it.  And she particularly took issue with that feature  of the national security letter  and said that was a violation of First Amendment.  Does that overturn the idea of using an NSL entirely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the government has 90 days to appeal  to the Ninth Circuit,  and then, failing that,  go on up higher to the Supreme Court.  I presume the government...  Very dubious process.

According to the Shatner book,  it was that thing bumped into the Borg.  Ah. Oh.  And then it was actually the Borg  who sent it back, all modified.  That's logical.  Yeah, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the big argument.  Nobody knows.  Because there's no, well, there's no like dividing line  that's like now entering, now leaving the solar system  where there's no sign out there.  So the question is, is it outside the,  what they're thinking is the solar wind  pushes out from the sun, but then outside the solar system  in interstellar space, there are,  it's all energized particles  from the rest of the galaxy.  And they're trying to find that dividing line  where the sun's influence kind of fades away.  But there are lots of other ways you could draw that line.  You could draw it with like the-  Scientists are such bitches  when they get in a fight like this.  Well, this is the worst kind of stuff for science, right?  It's just like Pluto being a planet, right?  Because it's completely arbitrary.  It's about how you define it.  And so if, that's when the scientists get all caddy  and start arguing about what I define the solar system  as being the Oort cloud.

Transcript:  it's very important in certain areas of the world.  It's one of the grand challenges  in their global health program,  up for grabs, so to speak, by anyone,  students, scientists, entrepreneurs,  who can improve the age old technology of the condom.  This is from the Gates Foundation.  Additional concepts that might increase condom usage uptake  include attributes that include ease of use  for males and females.  It's so hard to use.  Better packaging or designs  that are easier to properly apply.  Oh yeah.  Attributes that address and overcome cultural barriers  are also desired.  I think that they're.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chat room guy.  Privacy's dead.  Get over it.  Mark Leno has suggested a new California state law  treating, and by the way,  the EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation,  helped him draft it that would treat electronic mail  the same way as physical mail.  That's part of the problem is email is not treated the same.

Start time: 6805.40
End time: 6824.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leno proposal requires state and local governments  to get a warrant before asking email service providers  like Google and Yahoo to hand over your email.  The companies would then have to tell you that they did it.  Well, that would be a good idea.  So this is a direct response  to what we were talking about earlier,  where all they need is a subpoena.

Start time: 6825.04
End time: 6840.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this the same old story  where laws are written very specifically  to protect certain parts of the world  and then technology advances,  and they're like, yeah, let's not cover those  because that would be inconvenient for us.  I mean, of course email should be covered, like postal mail.

So actually, I'm very interested in what Denise has to say  about the new patent law, which starts today.  We will talk about that in just a moment.  Actually, started a couple of days ago.  But first, a word from Gazelle.  If you've got an old product lying around,  is that clock right?  Is it really 516?  Have we been here for four hours?  We gotta close the show.

Gazelle.com, you know there's new phones coming,  the Galaxy S4, the HTC One, I just ordered an HTC One,  nobody knows when it'll be out,  but the good thing to do is, yeah, pass those around.  Thank you, Jason.  The good thing to do would be to go to gazelle.com  where you have 30 days to pull the trigger, in effect,  on your quote.  So go there, get a quote now for your existing phone,  because I'll tell you what,  it's not gonna get more valuable tomorrow,  or the day after, or the day after.  So let's say I have, as I do, an iPhone 5 on AT&T.  I'm thinking I wanna replace that with the HTC One.  Let me get an offer.  It's 380 bucks, wow!  That pays for the new phone.  Now here's the beauty part.  I can lock that in for 30 days.  I have locked it in at gazelle.com.  That price is good for the next 30 days.  I can wait and see what happens.  I have time to transfer my data over.  They will wipe the data for you, by the way,  and might as well, as long as you're going through your stuff,  get more stuff, throw it in that box.  They send you a postage-paid box for your stuff,  and then they send you cash when they get it.  It is a really great deal.  How much does that Galaxy S2?  That can't be worth very much.  Free of water damage, let's see.  115 bucks, that's awesome!  Too bad I gave it to Baratunde.  Now I regret it.  I should have checked on Gazelle first.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  Sell your iPhone for cash, your BlackBerry, your Galaxy.  Sell your iPad.  You wanna get, the rumors are strong.  New iPad coming soon.  New iPhone 5, too, apparently.  Now's the time to get that quote,  even on Apple computers and other Apple products.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  You'll find out why Gazelle has sent out  over $50 million to over half a million customers  over the last couple of years.  A great way to sell your gadgets.  Gazelle.com.  Thank you for their support of this week in tech.  Real quickly, that first to file patent law starts today.  Really big, or it started on the 18th, I guess.  Really big shift in patent law.  I didn't realize it was already in law.  The idea is you don't have to worry about  who has notes from previous years or whatever.  It's just whoever got to the patent office first.  First to the window.  First to the window.  It took effect March 18th.  Denise, you're an IP lawyer.  Is this a good thing for inventors?  Is it a good thing for our broken patent system?  Or does it have anything to do  with our broken patent system?

Start time: 7111.50
End time: 7144.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does a bit.  It will streamline things for the patent system.  It was part of the America Inven-  America Inven-s Act enacted in 2011.  And it brings us into conformity  with how the rest of the world does things.  So it's a good thing in that sense.  It makes things more streamlined.  It doesn't necessarily help inventors because,  you have to be really on it to make sure you get  down there to the window.  Some people have been calling it the patent cliff.  Much like the fiscal cliff.  I don't know that it's quite that dramatic.

Start time: 7144.32
End time: 7150.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had heard that many, many, many people  were filing patent applications leading up to the 18th.  Trying to get it in before then.

Start time: 7151.08
End time: 7165.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Hence the patent cliff designation.  But I think that once people realize  this is the way it's going to operate,  it's going to be not as big a deal  as a lot of the coverage has made it out to be.

End time: 7193.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it's more of a problem  if you don't make something, right?  I don't know.  Denise, is it a software patent issue  or is it just a general issue?  I guess it is.

Start time: 7195.20
End time: 7204.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a software patent issue in that  things are being patented. It's really easy  to get a software patent. Exactly.  Things are being patented that traditionally  you would not think would be able to be  covered under that system.

Start time: 7205.08
End time: 7218.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Denise, I think worse than that  is these business model patents  where you patent a process.  That's how you run your company  and you do this and that.  You told me to do that.  You said you want to make money someday selling Twit,

Start time: 7219.42
End time: 7222.96

Start time: 7232.94
End time: 7239.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But wouldn't that kind of come under the software patent?  It's another patent.  It isn't a physical thing.  Right. It's a process.

Start time: 7240.73
End time: 7277.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  It's a process.  You okay? It's not an invention.  It's getting further away from  I have invented this thing to  I have invented this process.  This idea.  Yeah.  And there are other areas of IP law  that have traditionally covered that  and the courts are very much up in arms  about software patents  and what is going to be permitted to survive  and what is not.  So there's no real definitive answer there.  Patent trolling, I think, is, as John said,  more a function of the fact that people are able  to buy up portfolios of patents and then enforce them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Will, there has been talk about adding a shield law  to any consumer product,  extending the shield law.  This is the law that says you can,  before a patent or some sort of lawsuit is filed,  you'd have to put in escrow the amount of money  for the legal fees in case it turns out  that it wasn't a good suit, something like that, right?  Is that going to make a difference?

Start time: 7305.12
End time: 7323.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that makes a huge difference  in the way that what cases get filed  and whether or not they proceed through the system,  when you have the anvil hanging over your head  of somebody else's legal fees,  it's a very big motivator.  So I think.  Yeah.

Start time: 7324.06
