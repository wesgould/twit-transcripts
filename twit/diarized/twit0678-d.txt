I remember because I remember the year before, actually it wasn't, it was the preseason before  he got moved up to take over the quarterback role of the Niners. I watched him in the preseason  scramble and score a touchdown. I thought that kid's good. And then of course he took  us to the Super Bowl. I was very impressed. So I bought the jersey. I thought this guy's  a superstar. He's going to be a franchise quarterback.

Transcript:  Apple. Apple. Apple. Apple. Record quarter. Trillion dollar company. The first to be  worth one trillion dollars in the United States of America. Even worth more. My favorite stat,  that's the New York Times. You could click the start button. If you're watching the video,  this is a really great infographic, animated infographic, the New York Times did. My favorite  factoid from all of that is that Apple is now worth more than the entire United States  media industry. All the TV, all the radio, throw in Disney, Comcast, throw them all in.  They don't add up to one trillion dollars. Does it mean anything at all to anybody? It's just a  number. It's four commas. Who are you starting with? Ed Bott. Oh God. That's why I started with you, Ed.

Transcript:  You know, market capitalization is such a distortion of everything these days. There's  a handful of big companies that have basically having money funneled into them in ways that  remind me very much of 1999 and 2008. You think it's bubble time?  Well, who knows? If I knew that, I'd be a billionaire. But it sure reminds me of that  time. And we already saw a little inkling of what can happen when things turn on a company with what  happened to Facebook just two weeks ago, losing $120 billion of their market cap in one day. I  don't think Apple is in any danger of having that happen to them because they have momentum.

Start time: 502.76
End time: 523.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's ask this question. Is Apple being worth a trillion and have this big bump in its stock  price that important to Apple compared to Facebook losing $120 billion in its market cap? Does  market cap have, it doesn't mean the company's got more money. It means there's more value in

Start time: 523.74
End time: 535.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the shares. That's all right. Yeah, it's just value. I don't think it's, I look at it more as  like monopoly money. It doesn't really mean anything until you don't have any. I guess

Start time: 535.48
End time: 541.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  though, for morale purposes, it matters. Your employees who probably have stock options are

Start time: 541.92
End time: 628.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  paying attention to this, unfortunately. So when it comes to tech and the stock market, it's such  a scam because they don't evaluate technology the way they do other markets. It's not like oil and  gas and things like that. It's just on how they feel when they want to make free money. Facebook  does what it's supposed to do and then they tank Facebook. And thanks to Jiminy Christmas that  losing $15 billion doesn't make Zuckerberg jump out of a window, just shows you how much real  money he actually has that he's like, okay, whatever. But he was doing the right thing and  the market doesn't reflect that because they want you to keep being corrupt and making free money  on top of money, on top of money. And so saying, Hey, let's adjust and pivot and keep growing and  have trust in our company and our brand. The stock market is such a scam. It's ridiculous. And then  being worth a trillion dollars, whoop-de-doo. They're selling. Every time I look at one of the  markets, it's in the global scale of things. They're losing shares to other phones, other  devices and other things. They personally can't get their own media content. Correct. Their music  streaming is down. So again, all the things I look at in general, I'm like, sure, keep fluffing up  that number and giving somebody money until you rip everybody off. So bubble or bust or whatever  it is, then making a trillion dollars, cookies to them. Shame on me for not putting my hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dollars in back in 1996. All right, let's play a game. You probably already know the answer to  this, all of you, because you covered this, but number one phone manufacturer this quarter,  who sold the most phones this quarter? Was it Apple? Samsung. Huawei. Samsung. Huawei number two.  There it is. Number two. Number two. Apple number three. So you could talk about Apple's stock  price, which easily beats Samsung's market value and Huawei's market value. But if what you're  talking about is how many phones you sold. Unit pricing. Yeah, that's true. Apple's phones cost  a little more, don't they? Not much more than the Samsung, probably a lot more than the Huawei.

Start time: 674.26
End time: 707.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not that much more than the Samsung. Yeah. And again, Apple does everything and everything  in Apple matters on how you feel. They make you feel like you have a gold laptop in your lap.  You know, it's a piece of crap without a touchscreen or SD card reader. And they tell you it's a  consumer pro. Why you got me ranting about Apple right now? Is this going to be the Andy Apple show?  No, stop it. I'm always Andy Apple. I'm so sweet. I only have, I got my phone left and I got this  Mac mini left and I'm slowly getting the drugs out of my system. Are you fading away? Really? Trying  to get off crack cocaine and heroin when Uncle Leo's hard though. And Ed Botts has always been

Start time: 713.50
End time: 747.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about these things. You know, one thing that I thought of though, first of all, in your ranking  of the companies, that's by unit sales. Right. If you look at profit, the numbers are very different.  Apple's margins are insane and they're capturing, you know, what is it? 80, 90% of all the profit in  the entire smartphone market. But, you know, thinking back on the whole trillion dollar valuation,  it reminds me of Amazon's journey. You know, Amazon is second largest company or third. They're

Start time: 748.18
End time: 761.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right. They're right up there. Yeah. All of these companies are close to a trillion. Google, Amazon,  Microsoft, probably will all hit a trillion at some point. But for years, Amazon would, you know,

Start time: 761.50
End time: 839.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they'd report insane, big increases in revenue and no profit, you know, one half of one half percent  or even a tiny loss. They'd always manage their expenditures. So every bit of profit that they  were making, they were plowing back into the business. And now just in the last two years or  so, you're starting to see all of that stuff pay off for them. And that to me is more of the model  of what to look for in a successful company. You know, Amazon was saying screw the quarterly  results, screw the analysts who say you need to, you know, you need to be paying a dividend or you  need to be showing, you know, 5% or 10% profit each quarter. They were plowing it back into the  business. And the funny thing is that where they are making all of that money now is on  Amazon, Amazon Web Services, AWS. That's where they, you know, while everyone was looking at  Amazon, the big e-commerce site, they were stealthily building this juggernaut of a business  that is in turn running the rest of the internet. If you, if you buy Amazon stock, you're buying,

Transcript:  you're betting on Jeff Bezos, right? You're saying, I don't know what their business is  or what their business will be. But I think that that big wallet that Jeff Bezos is carrying around  will be put to good use. It looks like he's going to get in the pharmacy business. He acquired  PillPack. God knows what drone plans he has. He certainly looks like he's getting in the position.  He wants to do healthcare. He's gotten together with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to do  something that looks like it's Amazon Healthcare for employees. But obviously,  if the next step is, you know, we might have single payer in the United States brought to you

Transcript:  by Amazon.com. I said, I said a healthcare by Amazon, maybe they should get like a 20 minute  bathroom break instead of having to run all the way across the factory and take two minutes in the  bathroom and not make it back in time and get punished for their 15 minute break. It's the  working conditions. I have a lot of friends. There's a local hub around here and so many of  my friends cycle in and out. So I, you know, it drives me crazy. Let me play the, let me play the,

Transcript:  the evil capitalist for a moment and, and, and you can, you can, you could shoot at me,  oh doctor. They take the job. If you don't like the job, quit, get a different job.

Start time: 917.84
End time: 1003.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they do take the job, right? It's more than a minimum wage. It's legal. It's more than minimum  wage and it is legal, but it's also for a company that is automated and so down to the wire. And  here's the bottom line. When that man sits on TV and the way he talks about his employees versus  the way they treat employees, that's what I have a problem with. If you want to be a slumlord,  go ahead and be a slumlord, but don't tell me that I'm living in a luxury apartment in the sky.  And yes, those people can quit. And most of those people do quit because they can't handle it. But  a lot of people need a job. There's only so many jobs per area and that place has a farm system for  work. So yes, you're absolutely right. They have the right to quit. They can get their little 10,  50 an hour. They'll get there four hours a night or 12 hours or 60 hours or whatever it is. But  again, when you're talking about healthcare and when you sit on TV and tell me how you're working  conditions are great. And I'm telling you that a person on the floor putting stuff in your box,  it's a 15 minute break. And if they had to go to the bathroom by the time they get all the way over  to the bathrooms, it's already eight minutes and they've got to be back in those 15 minutes or to  get written up and get written up three times. You're out. And that's just for going to the  bathroom, let alone your half hour lunch break. So the work conditions there aren't spectacular.  If you're on the ground, I got another buddy who does a website work for them. He works from home.  He's getting paid a mint living in Seattle, Washington. He's balling out of control,

Start time: 1004.30
End time: 1021.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  typing away on his computer. But that's the way it should be. He has a high level of skills.  He's doing something that is a difficult and a rare job. Anybody can be a warehouse worker.  They're getting paid commensurate to their value to the company. Again, I understand. I'm being the

Start time: 1021.80
End time: 1037.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  evil capitalist. Oh no, no, no. I'm not yelling at you. I'm saying you're right. They're getting  paid for what they're doing. I'm just saying that there needs to be more humanity in those lower end  jobs where the bulk and the back and the workforce is the lifeblood of your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it though? Is it Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cooks? Is it their responsibility to look at  Google now is getting a lot of heat? Apparently, this is a rumor, they're preparing a censored  version of Google search for China, the authoritarian regime that Sergey Brin pulled out of when China  started to assert its authoritarianism. But apparently they want to go back in. Google  employees are very upset. Is it the responsibility of these CEOs to be human or is it their  responsibility to be profitable? Isn't that their job? It's a balance. It's a balance in how they

Start time: 1078.52
End time: 1090.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  should do things. And again, it's how you talk. When you sit there and tell me, I'm going to say  it again, when you're on national TV talking about those people in the warehouse and you talk about  all the great things they have going on. You think it'd be okay if Jeff Bezos was the evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not saying it'd be okay. It's not okay the way it is now. And bringing up Facebook,  Facebook doesn't sell anything. They don't have minions in warehouses hitting the like button.  We're the minions. No, when it comes to Facebook, we're the minions. At least Bezos built a

Start time: 1115.94
End time: 1127.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  customer-centric company. Bezos could make the argument, no, we focus on making the customer  happy and the employees work for us and that's their job. Well, okay, let's back up just a little

Start time: 1127.28
End time: 1243.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bit though. And let's go back to Apple because Apple has partly the same problem. Exactly the  same problem. The Apple stores, the employees in the Apple stores are very much in the same boat.  And, you know, what you've got is basically a situation in this country where there's two  kinds of workers. Those who have skills are treated like gods and those who are working  with their bodies are treated like replaceable cogs that get discarded as soon as they break  or show any signs of not wanting to be part of the machine. I would love to see the leaders of  one of these companies show some moral leadership and actually say, you know, we're going to go  beyond what we're required to do. You know, I think that we really need that. We really need  someone to set a moral example in terms of the way that they treat workers. Because right now,  if you listen to your average stock market analyst or your average corporate executive,  when they're talking about an earnings call, they treat any increase in wages or any increase in  benefits to employees as something bad and something to be avoided. So laying off workers  is good. Cutting salaries is good. Cutting expenses for workers is good. And I don't know,  that just seems wrong in a country where some, where a huge portion of the workforce is  capable of using their bodies, capable of doing good work, but only able to earn a subsistence

Start time: 1244.02
End time: 1287.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wage out of that. You said something to start there. You talked about having a skill versus  working with your body. And I think that's part of the problem right there is we don't necessarily  look at the people that are running the retail stores as having a skill. They're selling the  product. At the same time, you could go to corporate sales and be a rainmaker and make a  gazillion dollars. Sales is sales and sales is a skill. But for whatever reason, we have our own  little perception of, okay, you're just selling the iPad inside of the store. You're not really  skilled. But the second you move out to sell ads for Apple or what have you, then that's a skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have to fix that. You and I, Anne, have a little dog in this hunt. You will at some point,  oh, doctor, we have kids who are entering a workplace that is different from the workplace  we entered and who may be faced with some very difficult choices. I feel terrible for millennials,  even those coming out of college with skills, because the jobs are disappearing. Now this bring,  I set you guys up. Because this brings up something that is, I think, going to rapidly be a  conversation. Universal basic income. I want to take a little break, but I want to talk about  what Silicon Valley seems to like as a solution and a guy who's running for president who says,  this is the solution. In Canada, there's been some experiments that were recently abandoned  in UBI. I'm curious what you guys think about it, because I myself don't know what to think about it.  The idea, though, fundamental idea is jobs are disappearing, the robots are coming,  they're taking over. We better start thinking about what we're going to do about real people  who can't work, even though unemployment is at a historic high, right? Unemployment is very low

Start time: 1361.24
End time: 1373.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right now. It's going down. It depends on whose numbers you check with. If I wasn't in office,  Trump kept saying, I don't believe the numbers. I don't know if I believe the numbers currently.  Now I don't believe the numbers. That's all I'm saying. Currently, I don't know if I believe the

Start time: 1374.06
End time: 1450.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  numbers. Well, that sounds like a political game. I'm just curious. I mean, some of those  numbers are people who are underemployed. Some of those people have stopped looking for work,  so they're not counted as unemployed. Nevertheless, it doesn't look like there's a crisis at this point,  but maybe one's coming. Some people are worried about that and have a plan which seems maybe to  be voodoo economics. I don't know. I want to get your guys' opinions. I'm going to give you a minute  to think. Put your apron on. Put my apron on? Are you cooking? I want to know what  Odoct is cooking. We're going to take a break and then the battle royale will begin. Cage match  on in just a moment. The capitalist cage match. The capitalist cage match. You bunch of commies.  You bunch of commies. We've got Ed Bott here. I like to bait Ed Bott because Ed Bott and I  basically are exactly the same politically, but I like to bait you. He is great. Ed Bott Report,  ZDNet, old friend too. It's great to have you on the show. Odocta, who I dearly love. He's ready  to go off at any moment. Be careful. Any moment. Anything could set him off. Oh, and JJ Stone,  IQMC.com.

It's done some research on you,  Owen. He knows what's coming. It does happen. It does happen. Our show today brought to you by  sleep. Oh man. You know, the older I get, the more I appreciate sleep and the more I appreciate  my Casper mattress. Isn't that a great moment? Now tell me the truth. It's been a long day.  You're tired. You've been working hard. The kids are driving you crazy. The job is nuts.  Traffic was terrible. That moment when you get in bed, you slide under the sheets.  It's so magical. It's so great. If you have a great mattress, the worst thing in the world,  and I know because we were on vacation and the mat, it was you get in bed. It's awful.  It's a terrible mattress and you go, what? This is my one refuge from life and I'm sleeping on this.  No, you need a Casper. In fact, I think I'm going to send a Casper to that place we read it at Tahoe.  They need a Casper. Casper, is it online? Let me explain who they are. They're online retailer  premium mattresses. That might scare you. I can't buy a mattress online. I got to lie on it. Well,  honestly, this is where Casper came from. These guys realized that in the mattress business,  there was a huge problem, which is the middleman, the mattress store. They double the price of that  mattress. You pay a huge premium for the simple privilege of going in there and lying on a mattress  in broad daylight with the salesperson staring at you for three minutes. You think that helps  you decide maybe, but you're paying a big price for it. Casper said, look, we could take that out  of the equation, revolutionize the mattress industry by cutting the cost of dealing with resellers  and showrooms and then passing that on to you. How do we do that? Well, this is how they do that with  the 100-day guarantee. When you get a Casper mattress, you have 100 nights to sleep on it.  You don't have to lie down in a showroom and if for any reason you don't like it, they'll come,  they'll take it and they'll pay you back every penny, no cost. That's a great deal. By the way,  free shipping returns not only in the US, but Canada and the UK too. The original Casper mattress  is the one we have, combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface. It's uncanny,  just the right sink. When you get in bed after that tough day, you go, ah, and you just, ah,  but you don't want to keep sinking. You want some backbone. So it's got just the right bounce,  just the firm, it's the strangest combination of comfort and firmness. It's breathable. You sleep  cool on these hot summer nights. That's huge. And we do know that by the way, you will sleep better  if you can regulate your temperature through the night. The Casper mattress, it smells good,  it's breathable, it's comfortable and you could try it online, buy it online and try it completely  risk-free in your home. This is the mattress you want. There's actually now more than the original  Casper. They've expanded. I just want you to go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com slash twit. When you use  the offer code twit, you could save $50 on select mattresses and you're going to find the best  night's sleep you've ever had. And that's, we know more and more important. I'm telling you,  as life goes on, you will realize there's probably only a handful of things that really matter. One  of them is a great night's sleep on a Casper mattress. Terms and conditions apply. Casper.com  slash twit. Use the promo code twit for $50 off on select mattresses. My dad, who's 85, happy  birthday, daddy, turned 85 on the 30th, is all over. I keep getting email from my dad for this  guy, Andrew Yang. Yang is, he says running for president. He doesn't have a chance in the world,  but you know, dad liked Bernie Sanders too. He's the author of a book called The War on Normal  People. I think this ties right into what we're talking about. The truth about America's disappearing  jobs and why universal basic income is our future. And I'm trying to come up with arguments  because I'm going to see that in a couple of weeks. Dad, this guy, universal basic income,  it's a non-starter. And by the way, Silicon Valley loves this solution. It lets them off the hook.  Sure, we can make robots. We can take all the jobs because you guys, Yang says we've got to pay  everybody between the ages of 18 and 65, $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year. He also believes in  single payer healthcare. I don't know how he's going to pay for this. I don't know if he knows  how he's going to pay for this. Ed, is this the solution that we're looking for?

Transcript:  Well, I actually have a local angle that I can bring onto this. You may not know this, but my  hometown is Stockton, California. That's where I grew up. And the mayor of Stockton, the fat city,  the mayor and ground zero of the housing bubble 10 years ago also. And the mayor of Stockton is a  wonderful, very smart man named Michael Tubbs. And Michael Tubbs is, I think he's probably 28  or 29 years old now and he's the mayor of the city. My father 40 years ago was the mayor of  Stockton. So there's a big connection here. At any rate, Michael Tubbs is doing a  controlled experiment with universal basic income in Stockton, California. I haven't kept up on it  lately, but as of about six months ago, that was happening. And so there are some experiments going  on in this country and it does seem like a way to eliminate at least part of the basic, the sort of  core baseline problem, which is at least give people a chance to get to a subsistence level.

And nobody's going  to do that. Well, maybe a handful will. Most people, the premise really is if you have this kind of  safety net, then you'll take more chances. You'll work harder. You'll try, you know, you might  take a job that would be a little more risky and do better as a result. That's the argument.  They were doing it in Ontario. They were doing it in Canada in Hamilton, Brantford, Brant County,  Lindsay and Thunder Bay. And the new government in Ontario, Rob Ford's brother just dumped it  completely. Just went, that's it. In fact, you say this page was published under a previous government  and is now available for archival and research purposes. In other words, it's over. So we don't  know what the results are, but I'm noticing a lot of howls of pain from people who said this was a  success. This was going to do well. Owen, you got an opinion on UBI?

Transcript:  It's just, it's not a reliable thing. You know, we have welfare, subsidized housing,  people can barely afford to keep themselves afloat on that. And again, I know how statistics work,  but in the real world, there's so many people that aren't counted that aren't working that are  living with family members and struggling with either of them jobs. So telling me you're going  to give somebody a thousand dollars a month when you don't do anything about inflation. First of  all, we don't have any money. You're telling me when I was social security, all these other issues  that we got, you just want to start giving out free money to everybody. No. And of course San  Francisco says they want to do that at the same time. I really get care less because we're going  to run out of water before robots start taking jobs. Is there going to be, Oh no, when my pipe,  when my pipes break, is there going to be an Android that comes in here and fix my pipes? No,  we need plumbers. Okay. We need welders. We need people that build things like the things when they  say, Oh, the robots taking over, you know what it is? It's a little flat Roomba that moves.  Show. It ain't taken over. It's not taken over. So I mean, but again, by the time you see the movie,

We'll make sure everybody's a contract employee because they're getting the money from the  government and then we don't have to pay benefits. That's brilliant. And again, we're going to run

Transcript:  I'm not well versed in it. I haven't really looked into it, but the first thing that come to my mind  was we, we get this stuff rolling. The prices of just keeping the lights on in the house will  eventually start to go up. And I'm sure that universal benefit is not going to go up because  the price just to keep the lights on in the house is going to go up. Not necessarily saying  that everybody can afford air conditioning or things like that, but just the necessities of  light and water. All of that's going to rise eventually. It goes up every single year.

Start time: 2115.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also the fear that a government that's paying a UBI universal basic income would just  then cut the rest of the entitlements. UBI it's estimated would cost between one and a half and  $2 trillion a year. And the entire entitlement budget in the U S is I think 1 trillion. So this  is a big chunk of change. They're going to have to go somewhere. Yang says, and this scares me too.  Oh, you can pay it with a value added tax, charge tax on a national tax on everything,  on production. And that scares me as well. Although we're, we're, I think one of the last  developed nations not to have a valued added tax, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the thing though. The, you can't talk about something like this in isolation.  It has to be part of a comprehensive economic plan, a vision for what you want to do  with the populace. And, you know, if you look at the developed world right now,  you're finding a lot of resistance to anything that smacks of socialism like this. And, you know,  so what you wind up with is piecemeal solutions like this universal basic income by itself.  First of all, it doesn't have to cost a trillion dollars. You have phase outs for it the same way  that we have phase outs for all sorts of benefits that are there in the income testing. Yeah. I mean,  or, or at least once you re you know, once you reach a certain level, then your basic income  starts dropping at 50% per dollar that you earn until it reaches certain levels so that you don't  have people, you know, so that you don't have Rupert Murdoch collecting a thousand dollars a month  in, in UBI, you know, you know, and, and, and so, you know, basically what you have is people who are  in the, you know, you probably have about 50% of the population that is getting some sort of  assistance. And that's the same way that the affordable care act works. So, you know, you know,  and are used to work. Yeah. Well, in, in some respects, in most respects, it still does because  the law was never repealed and the courts have upheld most, most portions of it. But the, but  that's a good, that's a good example of a program that had to be put together and be cobbled together  in a way with a whole bunch of provisions that didn't make sense. And as a result, you have  something that, that for political reasons doesn't work as well as it should. And I'm afraid that when  you start talking about economic programs that benefit the entire populace and you, and you try  to build them one brick at a time, and you argue over each brick, you're going to wind up with  something that is not very solid, not very stable, not very sensible. And, you know, that's just kind

Transcript:  of the way this country works these days. Yeah. I, I could, I just want to say something so people  don't yell at me for always being a Debbie Downer. I could literally fix America's problems with two  things. The first thing is cut the defense budget 90% for two years. And you can even do a year on,  a year off, just cut it 90%. Just have enough money to pay everyone in our armed forces for that  year. But all the rest of that money, put it into a hydro system with the water. Like if you looked  at Portland, they're going in their tunnels and they're putting in hydroelectricity in the water.  So when you get water coming to your house, which it pumps through the township anyway,  every 10 feet or a hundred yards, whatever it is, they got the little ball just rolling around  and it produces electricity. Soon everybody's gonna have free electricity. If somebody who always says  as a president, we're going to do infrastructure, actually did infrastructure, put all that defense  money into building a hydro system for water. Of course, Atlanta city electric would like it,  but the cost of just electricity will come down, which would help other costs of living.  And if you did that every like 10 years, say, Hey, we're going to actually fix this. We're  actually fix that. We'd be good, but we spend money on jets that are invisible and nobody can see them.  And we don't use them for anything because we don't have jet fighter battles anymore.  And we're building tanks that no one uses tanks anymore. And we spent all this money wasted. But  if we just went and did a hydro system with the water, Oh, the things that we could do if we  actually did something with our infrastructure, but America, I digress. It's the real world though.

Even if they're giving it away because they're owned by and founded by former members of the  Chinese military. And the DNC is worried. You know, the GNC is already worried that the Russians  are going to hack them. Now they sent out a notice after they learned that a democratic organization  was considering buying ZTE phones for staffers. They said, don't, whatever you do, don't.

If I can prove to you that I don't use Tinder,  then you got to pay for dinner. She said, okay, because you can't prove it. So I opened up Tinder  and Facebook thinks I'm 63 years old and the lovely 70 plus year old women that were on my Tinder.  It is after my profile. It uses my Facebook profile. I was born in 1949.

You've just described the same phenomenon that happens to every business when there's even the  slightest bit of news, the slightest bit of rumor that Amazon's going to enter it. The stock price  goes down 10% and then over the course of the next two weeks as everyone realizes, oh wait a minute,  this is just normal capitalism at work, the stock price goes back where it was. The stock  market is driven by all these insane, you want to talk about signals, the insane signals that go to  market traders, exactly this kind of thing. How many times has Facebook launched a new product  that has failed spectacularly? I mean, you could just do a big long list of all the things that  they've done that have failed. Given their reputation, I would be shocked if a Facebook  dating app turned out to be successful in less than, maybe in version 6.0 after five years,  they might be able to get it right, but they don't have a good track record with this kind of stuff.

I think it's a logical step for Facebook to take as far as  trying to get into the dating world and what have you, but I don't like the security aspect of it  because there's already enough issues with Facebook and privacy and security on there right now,  and now you're making people even more vulnerable by giving them an avenue to,  quote unquote, date someone.

And my daughter is  11 years old. She's had a phone since she was four. She can regulate and control herself and has a  extreme amount of resilience when it comes to doing things too often. You know why? Because I  spend time with her. I talk to her. I show her how to use devices and the apps and the games.  She doesn't have an addiction. When she gets in trouble, I take her phone two or three days.  She doesn't even ask for her phone back. She's not addicted to it because we've set these things in  line to keep under control. People know me. I don't be tweeting all the time. I don't need  to do my podcast all the time. I got to coach my kids, spend my time, live the life. The last  thing I need is this phone wasting my battery telling me that I'm wasting my battery looking  at Instagram.

It's now a reality. In France, schools could make exceptions for pedagogical use,  extracurricular activities, or disabled pupils, but for the most part,  kids will not be able to bring smartphones to class. Now that seems like a good idea.  I dig it.

Start time: 4055.86

Transcript:  Yeah. Yes, that. It rings, it's gone. Once you get into sixth grade, they use their phones  or they give the kids tablets as their calculator. They run apps on them for the classes and things  of that nature. So the way our setup is, instead of using Chromebooks, we use tablets. So it's the  same thing. The kids are using iMessage to talk to each other in class or whatever they're doing.  So taking away is great and all, but we live in America. This is not France. My daughter has  an Apple watch on her and her teacher has been instructed that no matter what, she's not allowed  to take this from her because in case of school shooting, my daughter hit the SOS button and call  me and call the police and let me know. So she has to have that device on her 24 seven, three,  65. And I feel like taking phones away from kids in America is not a good thing because we have  other things to worry about besides his playing Fortnite in the middle of class. And if that's up  to the teacher to handle their business and make sure that the kids aren't on their phones, because  the teachers pay attention to the kids, the kids gotta be paying attention to the teacher. It's

Actually, I was, I was,  I was thinking of making it the title of this blog post by Nick here on his Pixel Envy blog,  but then I realized it's not polite. He calls it, you could show it, I guess, the BS Web.  And he actually raises some really good points. We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Before we go on, let me play. Look, it's a good time to play our house.  Dvorak always called our house ad our promo for the week on Twitter. And then we'll come back  with more from our esteemed panel.

We're going to have to do more reviewing. Jason's going to  have a review for us. We showed it off on the new screensavers yesterday.  It doesn't seem to have all the capabilities of a Google Home device.  It won't do some of the things that you could do with a Google Home,  which really disappoints me because it's kind of awesome.  It's an 8 or 10 inch screen that could be used as a TV. You could watch Netflix on Amazon Prime,  except none of that worked. I want it really bad.

Transcript:  Well, it's good for reviewers because it means we need to help people make the right buying  decisions. These things are not obvious. Companies are not telling you what they're doing.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass. Yes, I know you use, you use, right? Come on.  Everybody uses LastPass. Yadu, it is the password vault that means you're more secure because you're  using strong passwords. You don't have to remember them. It generates them for you.  It'll, it securely stores all the information. I use LastPass to keep my driver's license,  my social security, all our corporate information. I mean, it is really secure storage  for everything, especially passwords. But have you thought about LastPass in your business? If this  was, this was something I was just blind to. Remember when you're using passwords in business  and you are, you're giving employees access to, I don't know, your QuickBooks, your bank account,  your website, your storage, all the stuff they have access to. And that really can be a problem.  We've, I've learned my lesson. I just kind of said, that's fine. Whatever. I learned my lesson.  One of our engineers put all our passwords up on a public website because he couldn't remember them.  Oops. Oops. That's when we went to LastPass enterprise. But the nice thing is when you're  using LastPass in business, you can completely control it. You have over a hundred policies.  You can get security reports. Your passwords are protected. You can share your QuickBooks  passwords with the people who need access to it only. And you can even share it in a way that not  only can they not change it, they can't even see it. So they log into the site, but they don't know  what the password is. That's the kind of thing you need. It makes them generate strong passwords.  We enforce one of the policies that we enforce is two-factor authentication.  It protects the most important stuff in our business. Even if credentials end up being  compromised through phishing attacks, because we use two-factor, we acquire two-factor,  outsiders don't have access to our stuff. Employees can log into LastPass now with their Microsoft  Active Directory. So if you've got AD and you've got credentials, then they really literally only  have to remember one password. They're AD password and they're in. We offer it as a benefit to our  employees, a personal version of LastPass. And one of the nice things about LastPass Enterprise,  one login gives you access both to your enterprise account and to a completely separate,  completely encrypted separately personal account. So you don't have to have two versions of LastPass  running all the time. I really like that. LastPass for individuals is LastPass premium. LastPass  families for the entire family. I love the sharing capability both at home and at work.  The engineering department can share all their passwords, but nobody else at work has access to  them. And LastPass teams, if you have a small business for teams of 50 or fewer, we use the  LastPass Enterprise. It's awesome. We're so happy we have it. And when you realize that 81% of all  breaches come from weak passwords or reused passwords, you realize how important this is.  Protect your business with LastPass. It celebrated its 10th anniversary in July. Happy anniversary  LastPass. I've been using it practically that long. I know we've got Steve Gibson using it about six  years ago when he interviewed the founder of LastPass, Joe Segrist, and he was able to look at the  code and he said, yeah, this is the right thing. This is the right way to do it. LastPass.com slash  twit. More than 13 million people trust LastPass. It's the number one most preferred password  manager and now use it in business too. LastPass.com slash twit. I just, I loved this article by Nick  here just because I couldn't agree more. He calls it the BS web, but what he's talking about is as  our internet connections have sped up, access to websites has slowed down because there's so much  junk. He says the average internet connection on the United States is about six times as fast as it  was 10 years ago, but instead of making it faster to browse, we're simply occupying that extra  bandwidth with more junk. In 2006, partly it's watching movies, Apple added movies to iTunes  store, but really the real problem is, well, here's an example, the CNN article  which took 20 seconds to load. 11 web fonts totaling 414 kilobytes, four style sheets,  315 kilobytes. This is one page, 20 frames, 29 XML HTTP requests totaling 500 kilobytes,  a hundred scripts, several megabytes worth and on and on and on. We've all noticed this.  It's all about revenue streams, sir. It's so sad. Ed, Bon, I know you remember this as we got more  bandwidth, faster processors, more RAM. It just meant programs bloated up, right?

It's not like also there's  anything you didn't know here, but I do like the idea and maybe there's something to be said for  bringing this to people's attention and trying to slim it down. There was Google  AMP. He says that didn't do anything. But we're back to an analog of the same

Start time: 4812.60
End time: 4944.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing we were talking about 15 minutes ago. The economic model of the web for better or worse,  mostly worse, is based on the idea that everything has to be free and for everything to be free,  it costs a lot of money to have these people writing these things. Those servers cost money.  All that stuff costs a lot of money and yet everyone wants them for free. So pages are  cluttered up with terrible, ugly, stupid ads and tracking pixels and things that are just  building dossiers on us that have the potential to ruin our lives. There's no end in sight to it.  It's become an arms war between the people building the crappy ads and surveillance systems  and us. I know in the essay he mentions the rise in ad blockers now. Well, now the next level of  the arms race is ad blocker blockers. You go to a site and say, hi, I see you're using an ad blocker.  Would you like to whitelist us? I like the ones that say, no, I'm just going to continue using my  ad blocker. But then there's the others that say, no, we're going to block you right back.  You can't come through. And those are the ones that I'll pay to get this crap off there,  especially the tabula, outbrain, rev content. That stuff is garbage.  And you're just having that stuff thrown in your face. Every page that you visit, it's exhausting.

Transcript:  I call BS on that stat of 20 seconds of little CNN. I just loaded it on Chrome, Outlook,  Firefox, my iPhone, my Lenovo, LG. It took like five seconds on all of them. They have a text  version too for the site. I mean, what kind of network connection were they using? It took 20  seconds to load. I haven't had that problem or that issue. Maybe it's the use of my internet.  I haven't had any functionality problems over on my end. Do you run an ad blocker though? I do not.  Okay. I do not. The only thing that I run, which I cannot run when I do the show,  is my proxy to lock me up and make it look like I'm in Brazil or something.  Do you do that? Yeah. I told you I'm a white guy in New York. You think my internet ain't disguised  in my nationality and ethnicity? So wait, is it a VPN or just a proxy? It's a VPN and a proxy.  I'm running my own kind of- All the time? You run that all the time?  Unless I'm on with you because it won't let me chat with the people and I'm a man of the people,  so I got to turn it off when I'm on Twitter. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it's a techie sounding thing and it's got to be great because I don't understand it.  Actually, here's an article that comes from Bloomberg. I'm reading it from the LA Times  because I can't use Bloomberg because I've used up my free articles, but the LA Times apparently  doesn't have a paywall. According to Forrester Research, the number of sites claiming the use  of blockchain is a lot lower this year. Fewer and fewer people are talking about blockchain.  There was a lot of hype. Only 1% of chief information officers are planning any kind  of blockchain adoption. Nearly 80% of CIOs said they have no interest in blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I said no to that. But seriously, I just added the word blockchain to my Twitter bio,  nothing else. I am on so many PR lists now. I got one the other day that I shared on my Twitter  feed because it was so funny. It says, will the next Super Mario Brothers Rainbow Bright be  enabled by the blockchain? What? What?  Makes no sense whatsoever. Exactly. I put that up on my Twitter feed.

Transcript:  You just couldn't do it.  Yeah.  You know, they were talking about people, this was in the promo earlier, in Egypt,  tourists getting in trouble for tweeting negative comments, ending up with eight years of jail time.  There is a trend, I think, now to delete your Twitter history. James Gunn, of course,  the director of the first two episodes of Guardians of the Galaxy, fired for inappropriate jokes he  made in the early days of Twitter when it wasn't unusual to see inappropriate jokes.  His cast is standing up for him saying, you know, that's not the guy we know.

Transcript:  I have a friend who's very well known in Hollywood and he sent me an email saying,  what's the best way to delete my Twitter history? It's sad because people are very afraid that they  said something six, eight, ten years ago and that it can come back to haunt them.

Start time: 5282.62
End time: 5303.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not that sad. First of all, I can't deal with the gun thing and the protection  name because I don't play around with kid jokes. I don't find it amusing on any level.  You're a 40-year-old man. There were more than one or two or three or five or six tweets  on that subject and that topic, so I have no sympathy.  It was a little creepy. I agree with you.

Start time: 5303.88
End time: 5307.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no sympathy.  But there's no context for Twitter 2008 or whatever it was.

Start time: 5309.86
End time: 5374.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's context for a 40-year-old man speaking in a public forum out to the world. That's my  context in that situation. Other people are making jokes and different things and I get it.  Trust you me, I get on here and I try to bring levity to technology and I make all kinds of  jokes and I goof off all the time. So as a person like that, I get it. I don't want to see comedy go  away. I don't want to see the white comic get roasted for making a black joke. I don't want  to see the black comic get roasted for making an Asian joke. They're comics. I get jokes and I get  making fun of ourselves as a people in a class. If you want to delete your old tweets just to be  safe, I don't feel like it's a sad thing because people say dumb things and really who cares what  you said eight years ago because all you end up doing is sounding like Donald Trump. I like  pancakes, man. I hate pancakes. So if you delete it, it's fine. Go ahead and do what you got to do.  But it's not something I feel sad over. It's something that if you feel that you need to  delete it and you feel some sort of way about the things that you said and you're not that person,  if you're not that person, then go ahead and delete your old tweets because as far as I'm concerned,  it's hard to find a line.

Transcript:  I said I land your stuff. Three weeks ago, there was a guy making an argument with me and then first  thing he went and tweeted was, Uncle Leo, how could you have someone like this on your show?  I'm like, well, he said something about my daughter and I ripped him apart for it. You can't talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  my child. It's risky though. Look at Sarah. Look at Sarah John. Look at Sarah John. She's recently  put on the New York Times editorial board. And of course, the first thing that happened is people  went through a Twitter feed and she had been harassed for a long time for being an outspoken,  progressive feminist on Twitter. And her choice in finding that was trolling the trolls back.  Which, you know, like hashtag cancel white people. And there was a huge amount of backlash around  that. Now the New York Times to their credit has stood up for, but still.

Start time: 5433.98
End time: 5529.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to stop you right there, Leo. There was not a huge amount of pushback on that. There was an  orchestrated campaign from a bunch of professional right-wing trolls, Mike Cernovich and his gang,  who do this stuff for a living.  And well, that's what happened to James Gunn too, right?  Right. It is. And at least in, at least in his case, they were able to find things that were,  I mean, they were truly difficult to defend. I went, I went through and read the Cernovich  gangs things from that they, that they pulled up on Sarah John. In fact, the day she was announced  as being named to the editorial board of the New York Times, I tweeted like five minutes after  that press release came out. I said, ladies and gentlemen, you watch 24 hours from now,  Mike Cernovich is going to have an orchestrated attack on Sarah John using her old tweets.  Cause I followed her Twitter account for six or eight years. And, and, and I then went,  I also went back and looked at a lot of the things that, that they were quoting and they were  literally completely out of context. You know, there's, there's, there's things that I can't  say. There's one NWA song that she loved to quote, just quote the title of that NWA song  as a, as an ironic shutdown for any discussion of people in positions of authority.

Start time: 5529.32
End time: 5538.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you remove that tweet from its context. It looks bad.  No, it doesn't look bad.  Oh, well you understand it's an NWA lyric.

Start time: 5539.40
End time: 5596.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, I want to say that as humans, we also are doing a much better job. That one baseball player  who is 26 years old had tweets when he was like 15, 17 saying the N word and stuff like that.  And he gave a very basic example. Hey, I grew up in a backwater town. That's how people talked  about things. Now that I'm in the league and I've, and I've gotten to meet other people,  other cultures, other faiths. I realized that what I was doing was wrong. And I can believe  his statement of saying, Hey, my upbringing had me talking reckless and saying stuff like that.  But my professional life and where I've lived now has had me learn and grow.  And my teammates support me in that. So that a couple of players had that issue. And again,  teammates come out and support them. So depending on what it is, people, people do understand what's  going on. I just can't get behind the gun thing. Cause I don't mess with kids at all. That it's  like going to jail, the things they don't mess with. You don't mess with nobody's mom. You don't

Start time: 5596.78

End time: 5627.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  none of you would even consider deleting old tweets. No, I'm not deleting anything. I've said  it and own up to it. It probably doesn't work anyway because you know, you could, people can

Start time: 5627.56
End time: 5646.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  save them and screenshot them. Well, they can, but there is no, there is no archive of Twitter. And  that's a, that's a really interesting thing. Library of Congress has the archive. No, they don't. They  announced that they were going to do that in 2010. And then it never happened. Oh, interesting. Oh,

Start time: 5647.16
End time: 5651.20

Start time: 5651.50
End time: 5714.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can start talking real reckless. There are a fair number of people who do exactly that. They  do it every quarter even. And if, and if you want to do that, if you don't want to have people,  you know, just writing, you know, just posting garbage about you, calling you a hypocrite  because you said something two years ago and now your, your, your attitude has changed on it.  You can avoid that being a thing if you're famous enough to be the target of something like that,  you know, but there is no archive right there. So the only, that's interesting. I did not know.  The only way that somebody can, can find those things is there are random numbers of them that  were screen capped by people at the time. So you might be able to find those, but if you,  there is no Twitter archive. You, if you delete your tweets, the likelihood is that most of the  things that you said will never come back to haunt you. Somebody on this show once said, I wish I

Start time: 5714.54
End time: 5736.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  could remember who it was for all I know it's you Owen. The problem with Twitter is that it's the  kind of thing you'd say around the water cooler, but because it's in print, it's preserved as if  it was a essay and treated as if you thoughtfully crafted that tweet when it might well just be  something you said off, you know, you were half in the can. That's the biggest thing I hear about

Start time: 5736.72
End time: 5746.39

Transcript:  man, I can't edit that. Is it getting worse because the president himself is willing to use Twitter  in that kind of half-baked way. I mean, he tweeted it basically a racist tweet yesterday about LeBron  James and Don Leveau. A racist tweet. A many, but this was the most recent. So let me tell you,

And leaves. And then you get mad and start writing her number on the wall and  calling her all kinds of names. It's like he tweeted LeBron James. I love his work ethic.  They're down in Miami about to win the championship. He won the SB awards. He's a great man deserves  it. LeBron never responded to him at all. LeBron says one thing when he asked a question, he said,  look, he's trying to divide us. And he's like, Oh, LeBron James is the worst person in the world.  He never did anything for anybody. Like you sound like such a scorn lover. This dude is so weak and  pathetic. Regardless of your political views. He's just mentally by the way, because for legal

Transcript:  My problem is actually the exact opposite of what, uh, most, most people have. When I started on  Twitter, I was very conscious of being, you know, a well-known tech journalist and I, you know, I  wanted to be careful. I didn't want to be overtly political. I wanted to avoid using profanity.  Those who follow me now are, are, uh, are laughing, but for the first, for the, for the first three or  four years, I was, I was very careful and controlled and almost, I was almost my own  PR shop. And then I think at one point, I, you know, I think I asked my followers,  they probably had, you know, 10,000 followers at that time. And I said something like, you know,  who out there would be, uh, offended if I, you know, if I dropped an F bomb here and one or two  people said, you know, we'd really prefer that you didn't. And most people said, you know,  it sounds like you've got a couple of saved up.  And so, you know, I think I'm much more authentic now and, you know, what you see is what you get.  And, and, uh, and yet also I don't, I really don't say anything that I'm not going to  feel that I can stand behind next week, next month, next year. And if I make a mistake,  if I do something where I've, I have inadvertently wronged somebody by misquoting them or something,  I'll call myself on it. You know, I'll correct myself. I'll apologize. I had an interaction with  John Dickerson of CBS news where it snarked. I said something snarky about him. He responded to me.  We had this delightful interaction and I wound up apologizing to him for the, the snarky thing that  I said. And, uh, you know, and amplifying a couple of the things that he had said that I  thought were worth repeating. And, you know, that's what happens if you're authentic, uh,  and, and you're not trying to play a role and just be outrageous for outrageous sake.

As a  matter of fact, imagine, imagine that, uh, if you understand the purpose of this device, this is a  general purpose productivity and, and casual entertainment device, which is the way that I  used it and the way that I evaluated it. So running office 365 apps, no problem. Uh, fast,

Transcript:  computer. It is a, it is a computer. Uh, and so what's, what's interesting about it, well,  just the other thing about the, about the performance of it, if you try to play Fortnite  on it, you know, or whatever, you know, some, some game that demands a high frame rate,  you're going to be very disappointed.

Start time: 6231.90
End time: 6236.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's running over desktop operating, a real operating system. Right. It is. When I set this up

Start time: 6236.90
End time: 6371.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on my desk and then I put an iPad alongside of it with one of those Logitech keyboards on it,  they're almost exactly the same size. The aspect ratios are a little bit different.  So, so the, so this is a device for the person who has been saying, you know, I, I, my laptop  is too heavy to drag around with me. It's three or four pounds. I just, it hurts when I carry it  through the airport. I just don't want to have that with me. And so they're bringing the little  external keyboard for the iPad and they're doing whatever their work is on that. This is the same,  this is the same thing, except it does full PC workloads. And what is essentially a step up from  Chromebook? Oh yeah. Uh, right. In a way it's, I mean, to me, what's fascinating about this is  I've got, you know, I have a messenger bag that I normally would use if I'm going to a trade show  in Europe next month. And normally I would carry a messenger bag with a, you know, with a three  pound notebook in it. And then a bunch in the charger and a bunch of other stuff that goes with  that. And by the end of the day, my shoulder hurts. I have a small, a small bag, you know,  your basic man bag. This thing actually fits in that. And I can carry this to the show with me.  And in fact, I can snap the keyboard off and use the pen with it and take handwritten notes in one  note when I'm at a press conference or something, which is something that I couldn't do before.  You know, I could do that with an iPad, with the magic pencil. But then if I go back, you know,  our CMS at ZDNet doesn't, it isn't exactly friendly to an iPad. You need to, you know,  you need to have a Mac or a PC to really, you know, to take advantage of all the features.  And so this is actually that one device that I could carry that would, you know, it'll be a tablet.  It'll, I can, I can download Netflix movies onto it. It runs Spotify and it runs iTunes,  but it also runs the full office 365 and it has a full web browser in it. I can run Google Chrome,

If I were giving this to a, a, a extremely non-technical relative,  okay. Who has a history of downloading crap down, of, of, of having me have to come over and clean  up their machine because for whatever reason they got infected with something that yes, I would.

Start time: 6403.18
End time: 6410.52

Start time: 6410.70
End time: 6426.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can run and you can download now iTunes and Spotify and Slack and a few other  things. Those are all available from the store. Chrome is the big one. That's not.  It's not, and it never, it never will be. Right. Right. And that's the.

Start time: 6494.02
End time: 6608.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to charge it. Okay. So the other, well, and also the type C dock and I've used it for a docking  station. So you can do external monitor. Right. I have the surface dock, which does use that surface  connectors. So that, that is one reason why you, yeah, but you can, you can use like a type C  doc. Yeah. $50, $50 type C docs that you get at Amazon for that. Now the one, the one,  there's two variations of the surface go. And I have the, the more expensive, there's the,  I have the more expensive one. Yeah. Cause I wasn't going to get a 64 gigs of storage and the  it's four gigs of Ram is not as a non-starter. And it's not, well, I think for some people it would be  it's 64 gigs of EMMC storage as opposed to an SSD. So that one's, that one's going to be slow.  But again, for somebody, you know, I would see this, I wrote the headline on the articles,  you know, the best cheap PC ever. And that's, you know, we could, we could have a debate  over that, but I would argue that this is an excellent replacement for somebody who is,  has this, you know, seven or eight year old PC that originally came with windows Vista,  you know, and, and it is just dog slow, but they keep it, they keep it in the den because that's  how you have to occasionally do something on a PC. And I would say this is a great replacement for  something like that. Even at the, even the, the low spec version, that's four 99, even though we,  as tech experts would, would be horrified at, you know, having to wait an extra half a second  for, for a program to load somebody whose experiences with a seven or eight year old PC,  it will be a major upgrade for them. Yeah. There's like, there'd be a good device for,

I use, I use all 10 fingers, but it's like, but it's an, it's an unorthodox,  it's an unorthodox style. Uh, I do know, uh, Microsoft claims, uh, that they did a lot of  testing in their labs with people on this. And they say that, that a good touch type is within  about a week can get to about 97% of their normal rate. Uh, and I, and I didn't find it,  you know, I didn't find it difficult. Uh, I didn't find it anymore. It's exactly the same size  as one of those iPad keyboards. So if you can get used to one of those, you could get used to this.

I mean, it's clearly aimed at that group,  although I, yeah, I kind of, I'm, the other thing is it's dang cute. And I got the, it looks like  you got the burgundy cover too. I got the burgundy pen, the burgundy cover and the, I even bought the  burgundy mouse, which is completely superfluous because it actually has a pretty good track pad.

I have the platinum cover and the platinum, the platinum mouse, but yeah, it's,  it's very cute. It, it has the same build quality as the, um, the other surface units. And so it has  this really great solid, uh, well built feel to it. And that's that, you know, and I hope  that one of the things that this does is, uh, that it takes the PC OEMs who have been cranking out  really mediocre $499 and $399 PCs, and it helps them up their game.  I think that the original surface, that that's kind of what it did. You know, you watched Lenovo,  you watched HP, you watched Dell, that you compare, uh, look at their PCs from 2012  when the first surface came out and then 2015 when the first good surface came out, the surface pro  three. And you, and you look at the evolution of the PC market since then, and I think they have  improved dramatically just by, in many cases with some of the, uh, manufacturers, just by copying,  uh, features that Microsoft came out with on the surface.

Transcript:  It's time to talk about Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, the best, the biggest lender in  the country and a very customer-centric business. I mean, that's one of the things I love about  Quicken Loans. And we've talked before about Rocket Mortgage, which is their entirely online  mortgage approval process. Let me go in a little bit more detail about why Rocket Mortgage is more  than just an easy way to apply for a loan. It's the best way to apply for a new home loan.  Interest rates are starting to go up, aren't they? That adds a lot of anxiety. And the last  thing you want when you're buying the most expensive thing you'll ever buy,  even more expensive than an i9 MacBook Pro and an eGPU, you need to get the sense that,  okay, I can take my time. I need the zen of being able to take my time and choosing the right house,  not being rushed into it. That's what Rocket Mortgage is bringing you with something they  call the power buying process. It starts, as always, with Rocket Mortgage with this  really simple to use Rocket Mortgage website. It's rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  Few simple questions. They get everything they need. They have all the relationships with the  financial institutions. So once you give them permission, they can go out and get the information  they need. And then based on income assets and credit, they will quickly give you approval. But  within 24 hours, they'll give you something called verified approval. So you get the pre-qualified  approval right away within about 10 minutes, eight minutes. The verified approval within a day,  that gives you the strength of a cash buyer. It's basically saying,  we are going to give this person that loan. So when you go in and buy a house,  the seller looks at you like a cash buyer. There's no contingency on getting the loan.  You got the loan. That's fabulous. Then the next thing happens. It really eliminates the anxiety  to get the rate shield approval. This is a guaranteed rate for up to 90 days. That means  you have time to look at all the houses. You have time to breathe and find the right place,  not be rushed into it. If your rate is locked in, if rates go up, your rate does not move. If rates  go down though, by the way, your rate will drop. So you win either way. You just have to have peace  of mind there. This is exactly what you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender,  rocketmortgage.com slash twit two from Quicken Loans. Rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. When  it's time to buy that new home, this is the one and only way to do it. Great rates, that sense of  confidence and the zen of knowing you're not in a rush. You got Quicken Loans backing you up.  Rate shield approval only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions. Additional conditions or  exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records. Equal housing  lender licensed in all 50 states and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030. You don't have to  remember all that. Just remember this. Rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. We thank Quicken Loans. They've been a big supporter of  this network. We appreciate it. The best. I knew you were the right man for the job.

Transcript:  I saw Owen's tweet. It was pretty funny. Man, everybody who follows me on the internet  knows that I am the person that destroyed MoviePass. As soon as they said it was $9.99 a month,  I got one for me. Leah got her first credit card with her name on it. I got one for Leah.  I paid $20 a month. Last year alone, I saw 73 movies times two. That happens down to me paying  that average out to them paying for 79% of movies. They made $1.66 per movie off of me  when the movies are $14 a pop. That's how many movies I saw. This year, I'm on record for 54  movies times two. Let me tell you how bad I am with these movies. I went to go see a Jesus movie,  Apostle movie. I fell asleep in it. Didn't care. Didn't lose no money. Didn't cost you anything.  I went and saw the Gotti movie, which is the 57th Gotti movie. It was horrible. I walked out,  didn't give a hoot, and or Annie. I'm seeing three, four movies a week. I personally,  me and my daughter have destroyed and decimated MoviePass. It is people like us that has made  this company go bankrupt. I'm super kind of sad, but I got a backup plan. It's just amazing how  dumb they were to think that this was going to work. I don't know what the plan was. I was  expecting them to raise the rate after three months. They did not. I expect after six months,  they did not. Then they did the year upfront membership because I was doing month to month.  They wanted people to pay 120 a year. That gets more cash influx, which floated me through  Christmas. Now they're just like, what are you doing? AMC charges $20 a month and puts a limit  on three movies per week. These guys say, make a movie anytime. I was watching movies on prime time,  Friday night.

Movie pass,  if you come find me and you want to yell at me or cancel my account, don't matter,  y'all broke now. This is how dumb and inadequate their system was. Okay?  My local movie theater had a cheap day on Tuesdays where the tickets were half price.  Well, I would take Lee and her friends and I'd be going to Will to pay for their tickets.  But for some reason, movie pass did not adjust the amount of money they were paying to the theater.  And I ordered four tickets and they say, oh, that's five cents. And I'm like, no, man.  And they said, no, sir, it's going to be five cents because they're- and guess what? Every

And then there was a time or two where it was a  challenge just to see, well, can I get thrown out today? And then me and my best friend,  we would go, he's a big meathead too. So we would just go and just crush it. Just to see what could  happen. Golden Corral is one of my favorite ones. So Ant broke Golden Corral. You broke movie pass.

Transcript:  Speaking of economic power, Fortnite announced a couple of months ago that they were making  $150 million a day on iOS. This is for a free game, but there's in-app purchases.  And of course that means Apple made $50 million a day because they take a third of it.

That game is horrible. I feel, I won't let my daughter play it.  No, I wouldn't let my daughter play it. But I can't, I can't, again, you got to keep your  kids away from crack cocaine.

Transcript:  It is crack. Fortnite is a drug. So it's coming to Android, but this is interesting.  Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic said, we're not going to put it in the Play Store.  Good for them. Now remember,  Apple doesn't let you choose. So Apple, they had to give them their 30%. But they said, no,  you know what? We want all $150 million. We want it all. Can you blame them?  No. So we're going to sideload it. But maybe you can blame them for this. Some people have,  in order to do that, you have to turn off the feature that protects you on Android that says  only download apps in the Play Store. You have to say, and it'll give you a big warning. This is  not secure. You shouldn't get apps from anywhere but the Play Store. But you can sideload it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and pay to cut. I don't like that. That's an interesting take. All right. It doesn't change  the player's point of view. In fact, in a way, you're taking advantage of people because they're  going to make their phone less secure. And how many people are going to turn that back on?

Start time: 7469.06
End time: 7482.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And how many people even understand that that's what they're doing with their device? And especially  because mostly a lot of kids play it. You're setting your kid up to be vulnerable.

I bet the kids that are playing Fortnite  and are curious about getting this on Android, they already know how to do all this stuff. They  already know how to go in and flip the toggles and whatnot. Heck, they're probably even running  their own VPNs on phones. Those kids are. You're giving kids a lot of credit, bro.

They know they're  ABCs yet, man. I don't know. There's a little bit of that around you too. I want them to pay their  fair share. That's all I'm saying. I don't like that. Ed Bott, do you have any opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no. The 30% racket for all of the online stores is, sometimes it's justified, sometimes,  in the case of Amazon, it's a blunt force instrument of competition.  I understand the argument about building a curated store, but I also saw the service revenues that  Apple reported in its most recent quarter. More than 10 billion. More than the Mac and iPad  together. Yeah, they're not hurting there on that. If they're making 10 billion, how much is

Transcript:  and price. Some developers like it because they don't have to worry about distribution at all.  They don't have to think about it. They don't have to think about bandwidth. There's no costs.  They just put it on the store. Now, some developers don't like the fact that you have to get through  the store. The store is quite a gatekeeper. There's a lot of apps you couldn't get on there  because Apple is kind of prudish and so forth. In general, the only developers who are making big

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bucks on any mobile store are those with sticky, addictive things like games and things with  within-app purchases. The companies that have been devastated, the developers that have been  devastated are the ones that are making productivity apps where they don't have 30%  to give up. They were once able to legitimately charge $50 for an app or $99 for an app.

Transcript:  We can even go down from there. In order to pay for the time that the developer takes  to develop that app, to debug it, to test it, to support it, and to upgrade it.  Then the customers are going to say, we want it $499 or $999 or we're not going to pay.  Anything over $999. $999 is the top of the line. That's considered expensive.  I have talked to developers who had successful apps who have gone back.  They're working in corporate jobs now doing websites and line of business apps because  their really good productivity app is no longer a thing.

Transcript:  It's a very bold move by Epic. It'll be very interesting to see what the impact is. If it  kills Fortnite on Android or if it makes Fortnite sing, if Epic makes more money,  this will be very interesting. If other people follow suit, it could completely  destroy the Play Store. Of course, it's like the PC. You could buy in the Windows Store or  you can turn off S-Mode and buy and get stuff everywhere else.  What's Fortnite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the model for people like Atlassian and Jira that have their big platforms for  corporations and whatnot, but then they also have a mobile app and is it that they're just  sort of writing off that mobile app as just something they have as an option?  Exactly.  But we're just banking solely on the platform.

Start time: 7769.54
End time: 7781.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. The mobile app is free and the subscription is where you make the money.  Those are two very good examples because they're freemiums.  Most people who use Slack, for instance, don't pay for Slack.
