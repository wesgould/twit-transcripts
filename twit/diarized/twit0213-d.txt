And by the way, the real Dvorak, not real Dvorak, the real Dvorak on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're going to, David Pogue is going to join us at the end of the show.  And ChannelDvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And ChannelDvorak.com.  And also the real blog.  I don't do the ChannelDvorak or the real blog, but they are approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we, before the show began, recorded an interview with David Pogue.  He wanted to respond to the criticisms that he got last week from the twit panel and even  kind of the week before.  And he did so, I thought, well, but he included you in the criticizers.  And it turns out, and I'll make sure David learns this, that he was reading a spurious  Dvorak tweet.  A fake.  He was reading, well, we won't even give it out.  I don't want to give him any publicity.  But somebody with a mere 200 followers, you have far more.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although it could be millions now that I think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, we'll talk to David.  He will get his chance to respond to what we talked about last week in terms of conflict  of interest and the issues about how he talked to Steve Jobs and so forth.  Also joining us this week, we have a international cast.  I'm very thrilled about that.  From France, Patrick Béja.  He does a number of podcasts in France, including one that I keep meaning to be on, the Filius  Club, and never managed to get on.  Patrick, what is the...  It would be great to have you on.  I'd love to come on.  It's frenchspin.com.  Is that the place people should go for your podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  frenchspin.com is the site.  And yeah, you can find all of the different podcasts over there, both in French and English.  The Filius Club is in English.  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And combines journalists from all over the world to talk about...  It's very much like an international tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's an international sort of general news tweet, political and general topic.  And we try to get opinions from really different people.  Like we have a regular contributor from Saudi Arabia and we try to get people from the US,  South America, etc.  Excellent.  I look forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  frenchspin.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I bet you they'd like you on that Filius Club too, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like it's not the wrong hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's late at night.  Speaking of late at night, it is almost midnight in the UK.  But that hasn't stopped John Graham coming from joining us, an old friend and a man I  would like to honor on Twitter today.  John, it's good to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's very nice to be here.  He's a little bit late.  But I'm a programmer, so this is actually, you know, normal working time.  That's true.  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just buy more coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More coffee and then get up early or get up late as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Sleep in.  That's the problem.  That's the hard one, isn't it?  Because tomorrow's Monday.  That is the hard bit.  Yep.  So John, I first met John, I think during the screensavers days.  He wrote a really good anti-spam, open source anti-spam Bayesian filter called Popfile, which  is on, I think, not just Windows, but Mac and Linux too, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's written in Perl and it was done completely cross-platform.  I know it's even been run on things like an Amiga.  Wow.  John, you'd like that.  Yeah, that wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I still have a little...  He still has an Amiga, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the reason I wanted John on...  We talked about John's book, by the way, The Geek Atlas, which came out a few weeks ago.  It was a wonderful, wonderful book.  It's a series of articles about places that are famous in geek history.  Did you visit all of those places?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of them, not all of them.  128 of them, fittingly.  Yeah, 128 places.  When I got the idea for the book, I actually just went on Amazon because I wanted to buy  that book.  I thought it must already exist.  And then when I found out it didn't, I wrote down a list of about 70 places where I'd already  been.  And then I started researching the additional number to make it up to 128.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool.  And like any good open source programmer, you scratched your own itch.  You wrote the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, basically.  I was like, well, somebody's got to write it, so I guess I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Among the places you visit, of course, Bletchley Park.  Yes, absolutely.  This is where...  This was the top secret installation that the British government set up to crack Enigma.  I'm sure it had other roles as well.  It's where Ultra was, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the thing about Bletchley Park is it was a location owned by the British  Secret Service just before the Second World War.  And it became the place that was used to break basically as many as possible of the Nazi,  German, and Italian, and Japanese codes during the Second World War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going there, was that where you learned about Alan Turing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, funnily enough, I learned about Alan Turing when I was very young.  My parents sent me to a thing at Cambridge University when I was quite a young kid.  It was for bright kids to go and have fun in the summer.  I went up to a man there who was probably a professor at Cambridge University and said,  so how does a computer work?  This is talking in the 70s.  This man said, well, there's this thing called a Turing machine.  He drew on a piece of paper a Turing machine.  He just basically told me the fundamental underpinnings of computer science as a young  kid.  I was fascinated by this idea of this tape that goes back and forth.  If anyone's read about Turing machines, it's mechanical.  So I'd known about Turing forever.  Then of course, I studied computer science and I studied cryptography.  Alan Turing was a man who I'd known quite a lot about for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1999, Time Magazine named him one of the most important people of the 20th century because  of his role creating the modern computer, although he never was able to build one, I  don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, after the Second World War, he worked at what's called the National Physical  Laboratory in Britain on something called the ACE, which was a computer as we would  now recognize it.  Ironically, one of the problems was during the Second World War, he had worked on some  part of a thing called Colossus.  He wasn't the main person on it, but he was well aware of Colossus.  That was a valve-based special purpose computer built at Bletchley Park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For our ignorant American audience, valves are vacuum tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry, vacuum tubes for the American audience.  It's funny, let's see the translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A valve is a very different thing in America.  A valve is actually a valve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually a valve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also actually a valve in the UK.  So you have both?  Okay, all right.  Yeah, so you had total confusion.  But anyway, Turing said, well, we could actually make a computer using vacuum tubes valves  and designed it.  And he was almost poo-pooed because people said, no, no, that'll never work.  But of course, during the Second World War, he'd seen something related work, but he couldn't  tell anybody because it was a big secret.  So he was sort of stuck with this.  And then I'm pretty sure it would work.  Yeah, you should try it, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So obviously, other computers did get built using vacuum tubes and it did turn out they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  worked.  Now, the great tragedy, I mean, Turing, of course, helped crack the Enigma code.  He was a national hero, really.  But the great tragedy, he was gay, which was of course illegal and considered to be a mental  illness in his lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we also know there's so few British gay men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so rare that the government went after him.  In fact, this is really sad.  They prosecuted him in 1952 and gave him a choice.  What was that choice?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They gave him a choice.  He could either go to prison, which was the normal punishment for essentially being caught  being gay.  And that's what happened to Oscar Wilde, exactly the same law.  He got two years of hard labor.  And Turing was given the choice of either that or he could try a sort of experimental  cure thing for homosexuality, which was to be injected with female hormones, which would  – the idea was it would kill his libido, which of course it did, and would sort of  stop him being gay by curing him.  Unfortunately, he did agree to it.  And then he grew breasts because of it and had a major effect on him mentally and physically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He killed himself just a couple of years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And then two years later, he killed himself by eating an apple that had been dipped in cyanide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really kind of an unfortunate chapter in British history.  But John, I like it because you decided to do something about it.  Tell us that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is one of these stories that's always upset me because it's like – basically,  if you look at the timing, the Second World War ended in 1945.  Ten years later, Turing was arrested.  And nine years after the end of the Second World War, he was dead.  And then only 12 years after he was dead, what he had done was no longer illegal, i.e.  being gay was no longer illegal in 1967.  And so it's just this awful thing where you've got this man who's an absolute genius and  then he basically – we essentially make him kill himself.  And it's always annoyed me.  And then for some reason this year on Turing's birthday, which is June the 23rd, I just got  really, really mad about it.  And I put this blog posting off my blog and said, you know what?  British government ought to apologize to Alan Turing about this.  Something ought to happen officially.  And the next day after some comments came in, I thought, you know, actually what I'm  going to do is I'm going to start a petition to the British government.  It's quite a long tradition in Britain of directly petitioning the Prime Minister.  People go and gather all these signatures and they deposit this big pile of paper on  the doorstep of No. 10 Downing Street where the Prime Minister lives.  And there's actually a Web 2.0 version of that, which is e-petitions run by the government.  And so that night on the 24th of June, I then signed up for a petition to say we ought to  apologize for this treatment of Alan Turing.  And about a month later, a little bit over a month later, on August the 4th, that petition  became public so people could sign it.  And what happened over the next 37 days was through my effort and through a lot of people  tweeting and all sorts of other things happening, 31,000 people signed that petition.  And Thursday night on September the 10th, I got a call on my mobile phone from the Prime Minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Gordon Brown called you? He just called you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he didn't call me directly.  What happened was I had the flu and I had been at home and I hadn't been looking at my email.  And on the Thursday night, I thought, I've got to look at my email because of a work thing tomorrow.  I had to tell someone to do something.  So I log into my email and there's this email that says, please urgently call number 10  Downing Street for your petition.  Oh, wow.  So, you know, I looked at the number and I called and I was put straight through to somebody  in number 10 Downing Street who said, well, we're actually going to make this apology.  It's going to happen.  We think it's a great thing.  And in about an hour, it's going to be made public.  And, you know, they read the apology to me to give me an idea what they were going to say.  And I was completely blown away because if you read the apology, there's no nuance to  it at all, which, of course, is always a worry with anything that's political.  And then this woman says to me, Gordon would like a word with you.  Wow.  So I was at that point, my heart started beating.  And about 10 minutes later, my mobile phone rang and she says to me again, well, I've  got Gordon for you and hands him the phone.  What did he say?  Well, he, sort of things you might expect.  He thanked me for bringing up this petition, you know, making, getting so many people to  sign it.  He said he thought it was very public spirited of me to go off and do this.  He taught for a while about how he hadn't really realized the story of Alan Turing,  you know, hadn't really seen, you know, what happened at the end of his life.  And he thought it was a wonderful opportunity to talk about that.  And he also links it, of course, with all the other people who were prosecuted under  these laws.  So if you look in the in the apology, he talks about the probably about 100,000 other people  who had been prosecuted over the years.  So he just, you know, it just an amazing thing that he suddenly came out with this apology.  I was in it for the long haul.  I thought, you know, I've got 31,000.  I was trying to get to the number one spot on the on the website because I was number  five fifth most popular petition.  So it all happened rather quickly.  It was a rather amazing month, actually, because there was a lot of things going on behind  the scenes to to get that number up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really did you go ahead and start the petition with the hopes that it would actually  get through?  Or was that just, you know, something to do because you thought it was the right thing  to do without any, you know, hopes that it would actually happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really hoped it would happen because I really thought it was just an awful story.  And every time I think about Alan Turing, I'd suddenly get angry about it again.  I think this is terrible.  It shouldn't have happened.  But if you read my blog, I said quite clearly, gosh, I don't think I'll get 500 people to  sign this.  You know, he's known he's known, of course, to computer people Alan Turing, but he's not  well wasn't well known, in my opinion, by the general public.  So I was pretty blown away.  I was pretty blown away once I got to 5000 signatures.  And then on August 31st, the BBC wrote a story about it.  And that really blew it up because that night I had gone to bed feeling pretty happy about  5000 signatures.  And at some time later on in the day, I punched up on my iPhone, the petition website, and  there were 16000 signatures.  And if you look on the story I wrote for O'Reilly about it, there's this incredible graph where  you can see the effect of certain news organizations.  And there's this almost vertical jump in the number of signatures when the BBC spoke about  it.  Yeah.  Yeah, obviously touched a nerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it obviously touched a nerve.  It was a BAM.  It just goes up like that.  That's the power of the B.  I have to say Gordon Brown, who's not notorious for his eloquence, is really quite eloquent  in this apology.  He says, Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was convicted  under homophobic laws were treated terribly.  Over the years, millions more lived in fear of conviction.  I'm proud that these days are gone.  In the last 12 years, this government has done so much to make life fairer and more  equal for our LGBT community.  This recognition of Alan's status as one of Britain's most famous victims of homophobia  is another step towards equality and long overdue.  Have they ever apologized to Oscar Wilde?  No.  Maybe we should start another petition.  You do another one, be number two.  He says I'm being...  I'm not going to do another one.  It was a lot of work.  Yeah, I bet.  On behalf of the British government...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can think of a lot of things we should start petitions for.  I want that system in France.  Yeah, it's a great...  It's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a wonderful thing.  It is a really cool thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The cool thing is that all the code for that petitions website is open source.  You can just go download it.  So we can set up our own petitions website or in the US here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just take the code.  Then look at that.  Yeah.  You can look under the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I need an apology from David Pogue.  Okay, we can start.  Let's start.  Can we have the Prime Minister give you that apology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really an eloquent apology.  It's actually quite moving.  At the end he says on behalf of the British government and those who live freely, thanks  to Alan's work, I'm very proud to say we're sorry.  You deserve so much better.  It's pretty amazing.  Even when he was on the phone with me, he was really quite clearly moved by the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and happy to be talking about it.  So...  Well, John, thank you for doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's wonderful that you did that.  It brought a lot of attention to a guy who was very important to our industry and to  a grave injustice that was done to him.  So I think in a number of ways you've done a really great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's get him some publicity for this book.  Tell us about some of these places that you've visited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so cool.  I have a copy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to look at this book.  Yeah, well, I'm looking at what I have online.  But I have a copy.  Yeah, let me get a copy.  Go ahead, John.  But what's some of the places?  Because I mean, it'd be kind of a challenge for people to come up with places that you've  left out because you actually have a lot of places that I didn't think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me grab the book.  The book is right behind me up here.  Here.  Since you were looking for it.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold up the camera.  This is the Geek Atlas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm guessing a couple that you might have left out.  I can try as a game.  Go on.  Well, how about Area 51?  Do you have that one in there?  No, because it's not in there.  Area 51 is not.  Okay, good.  I got one.  I thought it was.  Oh, all right.  How about Cape Canaveral?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course Cape Canaveral is in there.  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alamogordo, New Mexico.  That's a good one.  The testing ranch.  Is that where the sound of space...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they sent some rockets up in the name.  Alamogordo, yeah.  There's a couple of things...  I'm sorry, the Werner von Braun kind of a piece.  Right, right.  No, you got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  White Sands Missile Range is in there.  White Sands is in there.  White Sands is good.  That's pretty good.  What about Vandenberg?  No, I didn't have Vandenberg.  One of the problems with the US sites is a lot of military and NASA sites.  So you get lots of overlap.  So in the end, I had to cut a few.  So if you look at the NASA ones, there's the Glenn Research Center because they do lots  of interesting basic science stuff there.  And of course, there's Kennedy Space Center.  But lots of people have written to me and said, well, what about Houston?  What about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, that's what you're going to get, obviously.  But those are places that I think would be cool to visit.  Oh, they are.  I mean, the Skunk Works at Lockheed.  You can't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Funny that, actually, I wrote to them and asked them if there were ever any public visits.  And they did have the good humor to actually reply to me and probably put me on the no  fly list as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to visit your super secret facility.  I'm writing a book.  Skunk Works.  No, I think I brought the book home.  But, John, it's a beautiful book.  It's glossy.  It really is like a regular, you know, like a travel guide.  But with lots of pictures, it really is.  You did a nice job.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, people should go buy it then.  What's it sell for?  Where can you get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everywhere.  Where can you get it?  Well, it's just, you know, how much it costs?  I actually don't know.  I'll have to look at the back.  It says it's $29.99.  Is it O'Reilly?  It's O'Reilly, yeah.  So it's everywhere.  Oh, he says oh.  So it's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John says oh, O'Reilly, oh.  You know, I was thinking it'd be a random house or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's beautiful.  You know what?  They did a gorgeous job.  There's no animals on the front or anything.  It's a really nice...  No, no, there's no animals or anything.  I'll show you the cover one more time and then we'll stop.  It's beautiful.  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen lots of pictures.  It's got Darwin and Mary Curie and various other people on the front cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was your...  What's your favorite places and then we'll move on to the news of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The one that's most unusual, I think, in the US is probably Experimental Breeder Reactor  1, which is in Arco, Idaho.  And the best thing about that, I was a breeder reactor, obviously, but in the parking lot  outside there are two nuclear aircraft engines.  The US had this idea they were going to use nuclear reactors.  Yeah, I remember that vaguely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Terrible idea.  Yeah, I remember vaguely that concept.  That's such an awful idea.  Oh, yeah, sure.  But, you know, if the oil crisis continues, it may happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little car with a...  As long as the plane didn't crash or, you know, get the crew back alive or anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like that, then it was pretty much fine, you know?  But the engines are worth going and looking at because they are simply the sort of completely  crazy contraption.  You know, here's a nuclear reactor, here's half a jet engine, and it seems like the size  of a small house.  And you've got to say to yourself, how big was the aircraft that was going to go in?  Well, the answer is pretty simple.  How big was the aircraft that was going to go in?  Well, the answer is pretty freaking big.  The runway was going to have to be miles long.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a dreamliner.  We're going to talk tech news in just a bit.  The book, again, would just give you another plug.  And I know it's really late in the UK, so if you start to pass out, just you can go  to bed and we'll just...  I'll get a pillow.  Get a pillow for yourself.  But we are going to cover the tech news, all of it, in just a little bit.  Before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.  Got to send you to gotomeeting.com slash twit so you can get that great deal on the best  meeting software in the world.  Our friends at Citrix, our big sponsors of the show, we thank them so much for all the  support.  And one way you could support us is by taking a look at GoToMeeting.  Now, we've arranged a 30-day free trial so you can see if it'll help you with what you...  Let me give you an idea of what GoToMeeting is.  It's a very affordable way to meet with clients and colleagues.  I think we all have decided that travel is kind of not in the picture these days.  It's awfully expensive.  American Express says the average cost of a business trip is, what would you guess?  That's low.  I would have thought more.  Yeah.  Because they include business trips across town and stuff.  But pretty serious costs.  $49 a month, as many meetings as you want.  And these are, I have to say, effective.  We use them on the shows.  We use them all the time in meeting with other people because it is a very engaging, effective  way to meet.  You know, conference calls are a snooze, but this way you're seeing something.  It's visual.  You can collaborate.  I can give you control of my computer, so it's great for training.  You can actually, while we're having a GoToMeeting, give me control of your computer as a meaty.  It's completely flexible that way.  Very easy to install.  If you go to gotomeeting.com slash twit right now, you'll have it installed in just a couple  of minutes.  Set up that account, but make sure you use that site so we get credit for that.  And you can try it free for 30 days.  I think you're going to find a lot of uses for it.  Highly recommended.  Tell the boss and your colleagues and your clients, go to meeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Once again with us, John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak, also here for the first time.  I'm very glad to have him.  Patrick Béja from the Phileas Club and other podcasts in France.  Are you in Paris, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  I think France is pretty much Paris.  There's no other city.  That's what a Parisian would say, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Parisian would say that.  I know it's not true because my daughter was in Rennes for a year last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First time I went to France, it was years ago, and I didn't know it.  I was down in Bordeaux and the people kept running me off the road and giving me the finger.  And I kept saying, what, they hate Americans?  And the guy says, no, you're driving around a car with Paris plates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They thought you were Parisian.  Really? Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you, it's a fact.  That's very interesting.  It does happen sometimes.  Hey, by the way, can you move a camera and show that dog?  You actually have a giant bookshelf in here.  And in the bookshelf, within the bookshelf itself, the dog sleeps.  Isn't that nice?  It's a little cozy little den for him.  The dog sleeps within the bookshelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's our spy code.  If you meet John at an airport, you say the dog sleeps and he goes within the bookshelf and then you'll know.  Right, then we know.  Then you know.  Stories, ladies and gentlemen.  There's some really, really big stories this week.  The Department of Justice filed its brief in the ongoing Google Book Search settlement issue.  In about a month, a judge is going to decide whether to let this settlement go through.  The Department of Justice said some interesting things.  One thing it said that I thought was I was glad to hear him say is that allowing Google to scan in the works of the world, even ones currently in copyright, is of benefit.  However, they said, we don't want you to reinvent copyright law with this settlement.  And we think that that's possibly what it's going to do.  We want you to make sure you consider visually impaired people.  The full access is important.  And we also think that the data has to be open in a variety of ways.  I mean, a lot of criticism on this data because Google has asserted the rights to sell it, to own it.  They say, we'll scan it, but we'll get to keep it.  Also, Google has been criticized for potential privacy issues.  Everybody would know what you're reading.  And we trust Google with a lot of information about us, so I'm not sure that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anybody actually run this thing down in any meaningful way that it makes sense?  Because every time I read these stories, it's all a lot of vagaries.  I mean, people are moaning and groaning about what Google's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example.  There's a guy named Jeffrey Nunberg.  I love him.  He's a regular contributor on NPR's Fresh Air.  He's a linguist.  I think he's at Stanford.  Maybe he's at Cal.  He's in the Bay Area.  And he said, you've got to look at the metadata that Google's recording on this stuff.  It's worthless.  He says this stuff is worthless for research.  Google's attributing the year 1899 to half the books just kind of randomly.  He's got a long list of metadata issues.  So that's one.  The privacy complaint, you know, you're always going to hear about that whenever Google's involved.  What are they doing?  What are they keeping our information?  I think that's a red herring.  I do think that the biggest issue is that Google seems to want to control these orphan works.  Once they've scanned them, they have the right, because they've paid to this fund, to resell them, to use them in various ways.  And I think that that's something that's concerning to a lot of people.  So I think there's some legitimate concerns about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there are too, but I've never seen a really good breakdown.  You know what I mean?  I think you should read the DOJ's brief, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was surprisingly good and not particularly legalistic.  Danny Sullivan has a good kind of breakdown and analysis of it.  And a link on his search engine lands to the full PDF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, make sure to read that before the next show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says the United States is committed to working with the parties constructively.  And so I think the DOJ is saying we want to support this going forward, but we just think that they say the inaccessibility of many works due to the lack of clarity about copyright ownership and copyright status is a matter of public, not merely private concern.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a huge deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a big deal.  But the real problem is everyone is having problems with Google doing this.  But really, Google shouldn't be doing this.  I mean, they're only doing it because no one else came in and did it before.  I agree.  They've been waiting and waiting and waiting.  And where is it?  Maybe even the government should have done it or.  But I think it's clear now that nobody's going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has been doing this for five years.  They have a huge head start.  They've done millions of volumes.  Microsoft started it last year and abandoned their book.  They started in 2006.  Google, I believe, started in 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, Microsoft two years later.  And then they said, I don't know why.  Now, the thing I agree with this that why is Google having to do this?  Because I remember in the 1980s when computers were really getting ahead of steam and people were talking about these issues.  And the big concept was everything's going to be digitized.  All the books in the world will be digitized.  The entire Library of Congress is going to be digitized.  And we're going to have information at our fingertips kind of thing.  You know, before the Internet came along, that was the buzzword.  And meanwhile, so Google, nobody does it, like you said.  And then Google starts doing it.  Everybody starts complaining about it.  Eric Schmidt said, I'm open to a better solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll recall we had our solution and we were sued over it.  And then we had a god knows how many years of negotiations with 27 parties.  And we've actually produced a deal.  This is quoted by Danny Sullivan again in Search Engine Land.  We didn't think we should be sued in the first place.  In fact, a lot of people said that Google was what Google was doing is fair use.  They weren't, you know, well, they weren't scanning to publish.  They were scanning the index and then they would put an excerpt on if you search for the.  Yeah.  So that's kind of what they do with the websites.  Right.  Yeah.  Is it so different?  Well, the different.  No, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is what makes it weird.  The web site is so different.  You presuppose that when a website exists, it's there to be scanned.  It's there to be accessed.  It's there to be linked to.  There's a bunch of givens with websites.  But books that are published or newsletters or newspapers or magazines are meant to be  distributed only by the print medium.  There was never any assumption that they were going to be scanned and then show up on the  Internet.  So I'm not absolutely sure that argument's valid.  I mean, I think it's a good point.  I think it's a good point.  I think it's a good point.  I think it's a good point.  So, Patrick, what is the attitude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, a lot of the critique of this has come from the EU because I think there's just  kind of I get the sense that there's this kind of an anti-American corporate sentiment  in the EU in general.  Microsoft's not much beloved, nor is Google.  What is the attitude?  I mean, I think it's a good point.  I think it's a good point.  What is the sense in France?  What do you hear from people about this?  What do you hear from people about this?  Oh, we lost Patrick.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Patrick, you're muted.  Hello, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  That's OK.  Go ahead.  You're good.  Am I back?  OK, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like, you know, there's really we're really behind in that field.  We don't have any we're not worrying about digitizing people.  We don't have any we're not worrying about digitizing books yet.  It's really not something that we care about.  So we really don't have an opinion about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think this is, as John said, a huge I mean, this is what this is what we always  want it is everything that is known available for search and scan and find online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I personally I personally think it's it's very important and definitely it should  be done.  It's too late.  Well, not too late, but it's definitely time.  And the real fault is on the industry, which hasn't modernized enough.  It's the same way Apple came in with iTunes to force people from the music industry to  get with the times.  And that's definitely something that should be done.  And we want to have everything at our fingertips.  But in that in Google's with the orphan orphan works issue, the problem is that they are  appropriating these works for themselves, isn't it?  Can someone else then go and digitize these books and use them also?  Oh, yeah, that's the main concern.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you have to do the whole process.  So I don't get why.  I'm sorry.  If Google grabs one of these books and Microsoft grabbed a lot of books.  In fact, a lot of them are, you know, you can turn into books because they get released  everything to the public domain.  But essentially what Google's doing is that they're they actually own a copyright in some  sense to the scan itself.  They don't own the books.  They don't own the words.  They own the scan.  And what you'd have to do if you wanted to say you want to republish the book for some  reason or make it a part of a collection, you'd have to either scan it yourself or find  some way to extract the scan from the Google scan.  But in fact, you know, there may even be codes in there to catch people doing that.  I don't think they'd go that far, but I can imagine it being possible.  So both Germany and France have both Germany and France have five books.  Briefs to the judge, to this court against it, saying it would essentially create a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for Google.  That's what their concern is.  Now, there is a monopoly only in the sense that they have they'll have more books than  anybody else because they've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  But you can still sit down tomorrow and scan in 500 books and you've got your little collection.  You could distribute there.  There was an interesting problem in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In when I was writing my book, which is that I was going to be able to get a copy of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  book, which is that I wanted to include a diagram drawn by Charles Darwin in one of  his notebooks, the famous diagram of the tree of life.  Yes.  And that is definitely out of copyright.  Darwin's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mother, my mother made a hooked rug of that, as a matter of fact, as a gift from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my paleontologist father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have it.  Yeah, you have it.  I think that explains it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that diagram is actually in Cambridge University.  They have the original.  To get a high quality scan of that, you have to pay a license fee to Cambridge University  because what they're licensing is the scan.  So the claim is that the scanning is a new work.  Right.  They can then apply copyright law to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  And that is actually absolutely true.  That's reasonable.  And that's why a lot of museums around the world won't let you take photos of the artwork  in there because they're selling slides usually of the same artwork in the front lobby store.  But the fact of the matter is a Monet, for example, typically is in public domain.  And if you wanted to copy it, make another painting that, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How would you because they won't let you take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing is the great museums are not, that's not their business to.  Right.  And so you go to the museum, the Met in New York, and you can take all the pictures you  want.  Oh, really?  But you can't.  You can't take the museum's let you take photos.  But you can't.  I took pictures in the Louvre.  That's right.  Yeah.  But you can't take usually pictures of the special collections that are on loan because  the people who loan those paintings, they want the rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a European answer to Google Book Search.  It's called Europeana.  When it went online, it went down 10 million hits in the first week.  You think, Patrick, this is not this is not the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, sure.  I mean, there are efforts, but there are other efforts in the US also.  Google is the only one who is doing this really seriously and really systematically.  And they are the only ones who can bring the costs down enough that it's feasible on a  large scale.  So I think I don't know.  I just don't get what the big deal is.  If they want to go and do it and license it properly and then want to use it.  Why do the people who complain not go and do it instead of complaining?  That's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is.  I think the libraries have and the states also have an initiative which is way, way,  way behind.  Why not let Google do it?  I think this is what's going to happen.  I think this is appropriate.  It's appropriate for the judge to look at this.  It's appropriate for these parties to weigh in.  Google has not said we won't negotiate.  They have not been intransigent.  They've been trying to solve this.  It's appropriate to assert all of these interests and work it out with Google if they can, if  we can, and let them go ahead.  I don't think they should have free reign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the writer's unions, not the writer's guild in LA, but the writer's union or something,  some group out of, I can't remember which group it is, but they were moaning and groaning  about this to an extreme saying that Google is stealing their copyrights.  But again, one of the things that we're missing out on here is that most of the books, despite  the fact they have a lot of new books that have scanned in, are these weird books that  are out of print.  They're out of cover.  They're orphaned.  And they're being thrown away.  I might want to mention this, by the way.  The University of California, which has one of the largest libraries in the world, I think  only second to the third, to the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library,  those are huge, but UC Berkeley has the other one, the big monster.  You can go over there to a couple of the rooms there, and they are selling off lots of the  books because so many books are still being printed that their collection is out of control.  And there's books that are just basically being lost to time.  I mean, there will be no copies of these books available for anyone who wants to do some  back research.  And who knows what valuable products or books are being discarded.  I see nothing wrong with any of this, personally.  Let them scan everything in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't worry about it creating some sort of rights for Google or limitations on what  you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you can always nationalize them.  You know, just go in and bring in the cops and bust up the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without going the French route, at least let them just get it in digitized form and then  we'll worry about what we were going to do with it.  At least get it on the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, don't stop them, in other words.  Let them keep doing this.  I'm actually disappointed that Microsoft crapped out in this deal because they worked,  I think they did about two years worth of scans and they did, I think, 700,000 books  or something along those lines.  And they copied most of the University of California because I keep working on these  perpetual projects that I never finish.  And I was using that Microsoft search because their search was actually superior to the  Google one for going plowing through books.  And I was searching, finding all kinds of interesting things, especially in these economics  that were written around in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  Then I could search them this way.  And I was thinking to myself, at least for this two year period, God, I should go back  to grad school because I could do research on a thesis or any sort of paper so quickly  with really good data and find stuff really fast.  It just was marvelous.  But then, boom, they decided to just drop it.  Google's harder.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want people to think that I'm a Google fanboy or that I want to defend them.  I don't want just Google to do this.  I want Microsoft to do this.  I want Amazon to do this also.  And I want every government in the world to digitize all their books in their national  libraries.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually, all the publishers, in fact, the publishers were working with John Warnock's  son for a while with some company he had.  I can't remember the name of it.  You might.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That sounds familiar.  They were sending him all the digital files that because books today, there's not really  a book being published today that doesn't have a digital format somewhere along the  line in the publishing process.  And so they were giving him stuff, but then he would resell it in a digital form in some  way that would make them money.  And I don't know what happened to that initiative, but the fact is that everything should, yeah,  everything should be digital, should be backed up all kinds of different ways and kept here  and there and then be searchable.  So somebody, for example, in Lawrence, Kansas, can walk into their little library that's  run by one of these modern librarians, and there's many of them, who know more about  how to search and find things than anybody else and go up to a terminal and be able to  get all the world's great works and be able to do some research in Lawrence rather than  having to be in some big university somewhere.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, if these books then become printable with these espresso book machines, then I  think that'd be fantastic because there are so many books that aren't available.  You might want to get one copy of in some random place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ironically, that's one of the plaintiffs in this that put together the Gary Reback Alliance.  He's, of course, the attorney that went after Microsoft in 1998.  He's representing Microsoft and actually he defended Microsoft.  I shouldn't say went after Microsoft.  The DOJ went after Microsoft.  He's representing Microsoft.  I think the EFF is in on this.  Amazon.  Amazon.  But it's also the Internet Archive, which is one of the groups.  Brewster Cale's group.  Brewster Cale is the one who was going around with the bookmobile and the instant print  thing and trying to get books in people's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Brewster's the one who picked up all the Microsoft.  Microsoft people gave their huge collection.  He's got their database.  Yeah.  Right.  So I'm not sure why he's...  But the search engine's missing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand, frankly, why they would fight it, but we'll give them a chance to  respond.  Here's an interesting story that really won't affect you, Patrick, or you, John Graham Cumming,  because it's a US issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the US doesn't affect the rest of the world at all.  Well, it's...  No, we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait until you hear what I'm about to say and you'll understand.  We're debating here in the US about healthcare, nationalized healthcare.  And Roger Ebert, who as you know, he had a cancer surgery, lost his voice, went to Medicare,  and he was asked for a device that would help him talk.  Medicare's response, he said, they offered me an $8,000 custom device with a tiny little  computing power, small, dim screen.  He says, I tried the built-in speech software on my MacBook, found it much more practical.  It'll read anything aloud, including what I define on a webpage or an email message.  Several voices are built in, others are downloadable.  I combine talking and web surfing.  He said, for instance, sharing a news headline with my wife, insurance companies will not,  the Medicare will not allow him to spend the money on a MacBook because, get ready for  this, it can be used for something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wait a minute, let me get this story straight.  It can be used for something besides speech synthesis.  So instead of like the $2,000 for a reasonably decent MacBook, that's no good.  But $8,000 is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, makes sense.  Many users with disabilities, this is from an article on Apple Insider, are barred from  choosing cheap off-the-shelf technologies by Medicare or private insurance companies  who insist on only covering far more expensive devices that don't work as well.  For instance, in the New York Times article about a woman named Kara Lynn who lost her  voice to ALS, Medicare paid for an $8,000 Windows PC running speech synthesis software,  government rules require the PC be disabled from doing anything other than speech in the  fear that Lynn might benefit from features unrelated to her disability.  The vendor will, after the insurer pays, the vendor will, if you give him $50, will reactivate  the computer.  But the government will not.  Ridiculous.  The government.  Now does that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the kind of dumb crap that's got this debate out of control.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a cheap shot.  I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason.  Oh yeah, there's a Frenchman talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a reason why the government would do that.  Instead of buying this $8,000 computer, she bought herself an iPhone for $300, running  a $150 text-to-speech application.  She says it works better, it's portable, and I don't care if it's not insured, I don't  want the $8,000 broken computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  You know, there's always, you can always frame, they have to have rules and special, you know,  sets where they can accept some things and not some others.  And you take one example where it doesn't make sense at all and then you make a generalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to be reasonable in all that, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not a fan of the US healthcare system.  Believe me.  I've spent more money to get crappier healthcare than basically any other country in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never asked John, who's our resident conservative, where do you stand in the healthcare  debate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that we need a single payer system.  I'm with you.  That's very liberal of you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  I'm surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean like in France?  No, the French system right now is one of the best in the world.  I mean, people always moan, oh, the British, the British, the British, the British go to  France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that true, John Graham Cummings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it's interesting you say that because I've lived in the US, Britain and in France  and I've had healthcare in all of them.  There you go.  Here's an expert.  Well, an expert.  At least I've sampled all three.  I actually have my Lasik surgery in France.  And I have to say that the French system for me was the best.  Absolutely no question.  It's a no fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's widely agreed.  France and Germany have the best healthcare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I worked with a group that's involved in the medical system and they told me that,  you know, France may have the best system, but the way the infrastructure is, the French  doctors don't make as much money and they're all, they come out of school, they're actually  trained a different way.  There's a whole, the entire French health industry infrastructure is so alien to what  we do here or England or Canada for that matter that there's no real apples and oranges comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about those death panels, Patrick Béja?  What about those death panels?  Do you have them?  We have those, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's no way it could work for that.  We have twice as many in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't get off on too much of a tangent, but there's a very good article.  Yes, we must go.  Well, it's kind of technology because one of the reasons it's so expensive is because  it's so highly technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true because well, that, because they have to do over testing too.  That's one of the problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Over testing because of, but you know, there was a great article in the Newsweek where  he said nobody can talk about the real truth of it, which is most of this money is spent  in end of life attempts to keep you alive for a few extra weeks.  Nobody wants it, but it's, but it's, but it's the doctors feel they must do it.  And that's really where the expense is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of expense.  Nobody will talk about it.  Nobody wants to talk about anything.  No, I don't know.  It's either, you know, the Democrats have their shot at ramming it through.  And if they can't do it, well, then there you have it.  They've lost their nerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess.  Hey, here's a good thing the Democrats did for us.  Finally, the FCC.  Wait, let me get my pen.  Write this down, John.  Check this day and date.  4.07 p.m. on Sunday.  On Monday, the chairman of the FCC, Julius Janikowski, will urge rules from the FCC requiring  Internet service providers to protect net neutrality, to treat all traffic on the Internet  equally.  And in fact, it's expected these rules will apply to wireless networks too, which is a  really great thing.  It's expected that he does have the votes on the commission.  Three out of five is what he needs, a simple majority to make these be the rules.  It may be that we will have net neutrality in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's unbelievable.  How about in France?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have anything like that.  In fact, in France, now let's contrast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The French.  I knew it wasn't going to pick on the French.  I had to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the French National Assembly has passed a draft law that would allow illegal downloaders  to be thrown off the net.  Probably the hardest line policy in all of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's absolutely ridiculous.  We've been trying to fight it for a few months now and they've had a really hard time to  pass it.  But yes, so to explain to people what it is, it's a three strikes law where if you're caught,  quote unquote, downloading something illegal three times, the first time you get a letter  from your ISP, second time, same thing, third time, you are barred from using the internet  for two months to a year and you are on a list that doesn't let anyone provide you with  internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody, nobody in the country.  It would be illegal for them to give you access.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Whose idea is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the defense of the assembly, it's probably American music companies, movie companies  and television companies that have proposed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, the way they find that you download illegal material is, I mean the commission  that will bring down the hammer once again, receives anonymous or maybe not anonymous,  but tips from maybe the music industry.  So they will say this IP address has downloaded this and this material, they should be banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any due process?  I mean, can you defend yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was the reason for the delay because the constitutional council said that you couldn't,  I'm sorry, do that kind of condemning.  I'm losing my words here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You couldn't, sorry, it happens to me all the time.  You couldn't convict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  You couldn't convict someone like this without due process.  And that was the initial plan, which of course was litigress.  And so now what they're doing is that they are liking this offense to something like  a speeding ticket.  So you will have due process, but in an accelerated fashion.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worth saying, it's not just France who's doing this because Britain, there's this thing  called Digital Britain, where there's a report about how we're going to make everything digital  and wonderful.  And part of that was also cutting people off who were persistent file sharers.  So this has been inspired the British to do something similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they had something like that in New Zealand too.  The real shame in this is that the people who are doing, who are writing these laws,  I had, I remember one reaction from one of the people who was behind the law, which was,  you know, we lived perfectly well before we had the internet.  There's no need for it.  Oh, jeez.  You don't really need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a luxury.  So...  Mini tell.  You have mini tell, so you didn't need internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we had the, you know, electricity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've talked about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  No, I think the argument is the same.  You know, you don't need electricity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  In fact, who needs indoor plumbing?  Really?  You don't need it.  You don't need it.  This is running water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forget it.  Too much.  Yeah.  So now it's basically passed.  It needs to be approved by the council again, but it probably will be this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think it will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be because...  What's wrong with these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think there's some pressure being placed in these countries.  I mean, it's no accident that it's England, France, and New Zealand by WIPO and by eventually  American copyright interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they probably would like to get a couple of precedents out there, especially  the WIPO people.  You bet.  And then bring it over here and see how far it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if the WIPO treaty calls for something like this, but you know, if  you want to be a trade partner, you've got to protect other countries' copyrights.  And this is oftentimes seen as what you have to do to be a trade partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the Net Neutrality Act, the law that's going to be probably...  Rules.  We call them rules.  Rules.  Okay.  Does that mean that the ISPs cannot do deep packet inspection and cannot see what you're  restricting?  I imagine they can still do it, but they can't act on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is what Comcast was accused of, was running software from Canada that found out  that you were doing BitTorrent and terminated that BitTorrent.  Well, they throttled you.  They throttled you or they terminated it.  Yeah.  And I know in Canada, it's certainly a big problem.  Whenever we're on a Skype call with somebody, after about an hour, it starts to deteriorate  because the ISPs up there just say, well, you've had enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's enough of a free phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's enough VoIP for you.  You're done.  Yeah, I guess as important as it is for us in the negative sense of this law that was  just passed, it's extremely important.  And the net neutrality one is extremely important.  And I really want to applaud you guys because I consider you as part of the American people  for voting it because it might show us the way.  It's an extremely important rule and it should be voted.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are people that debate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of these people who don't think that the government should be involved in this,  they should let the market bear on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not even that so much.  There's, I don't know, Andrew Orlowski is the biggest, he is the biggest complainer  about this of anybody.  And everyone, if you actually listen to him, you should get him on the show, even though  to be honest about it, he's hard to understand because he's so British.  But he actually makes a logical argument and it's actually more complicated than that.  There's other people I've heard that don't like the idea of this net neutrality thing  because it's not even just the market.  It's just the, you know, some, I mean, if I'm paying for paying extra money, I mean,  it's going to create a situation.  So I'm paying for the Comcast double speed, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm going to pay a hundred bucks a month for it.  You get half the speed for half the price, let's say.  How's that net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Orlowski writing in The Guardian.  He says, the UK's most prominent internet engineer, Professor John Crowcroft of Cambridge  University thinks that activists had imagined a bogus demon.  Net neutrality is a misdirection, a red herring, he says.  It's true that we haven't, well, now I gave an example in Canada, but we haven't, I don't  think we have an example in the US or do we, of discriminating against Google, let's say,  or Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, this whole thing began largely because, yeah, I think it was the CEO of AT&T  who came out shooting his mouth off about stuff he didn't know anything about and says,  I don't see why Google should be getting a free ride.  Orlowski quotes-  As if Google's not paying for their bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Orlowski quotes Robert Kahn, one of the fathers of the internet, who says, the internet has  never been neutral.  Oh no, this is Crowcroft talking.  Without traffic shaping, we won't get the convergence that allows the innovation of TV and online  games we've seen in data and telephony.  That's the defense that Comcast uses too, is well, we've got to shape bandwidth.  We've got to keep the bandwidth hogs from stopping everybody else from using the internet  in a useful way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can open up a million pipes up and just, you can bring the whole thing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't think that was the issue of net neutrality.  I mean, sure, you can do tiered speed and pay more to get more speed.  That's fine.  But the real issue with net neutrality is selecting who you allow to, your users to  have access to and who you don't allow.  That's a much deeper, more troubling thought.  Yeah.  I'm with you on that.  Speed, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I agree with that too.  We'll get Andrew on.  I'd like to get Andrew to do it.  I'm on both sides of this argument because of the, the Orlowski points are interesting,  but the other points are more, are logical.  And so what, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well he does make a good point when he says, you know, this is a straw man because it hasn't  been a problem.  So now you're making rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I agree with that too.  This hasn't been a problem.  I haven't seen anything.  I don't get my Skype choked off.  It doesn't get cut off.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nissan.  It'd be interesting to see an ISP try and cut access to Google and then see how the  market reacted to that.  Well, this is the problem, at least in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I imagine it's the same in the UK and France is that there isn't really any competition  among internet service providers.  There's a, you know, a paucity of potential companies you can work with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in France there is.  That's not true at all.  I mean in, in the UK and in France, we have much higher bandwidth available and there's  a lot of competition.  When I lived in France, I had a hundred megabit connection at home and it was costing tens  of euros a month.  There's tremendous competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in France, in England, it's not a government run.  It's run by private parties for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I'm in the process of switching broadband providers at home because I've got fed up  with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have, how many different companies could you choose from?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, tens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, in most US.  You're going to get a, you wait a minute.  Let me get this straight.  You can choose from like six providers and you're getting like a hundred megabits per  second and you're paying like 10, 20 bucks a month or 30 bucks.  Wait a minute.  You're saying 10 euros, which is about $50 US.  No, 10 euros.  Well, something like that.  It's some ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I lived in France, I had a choice of one megabit, 20 megabits or a hundred megabits.  And I think the hundred megabits had 20 megabits up, but my memory is fading.  And it was not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I pay $700 a month for nine megabits up and down.  Of course it's a.  Yeah, but you're in a dedicated fiber.  It's a quality line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I pay 30 euros a month for 30 down and eight up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, in the States, we generally have a couple of choices.  You're going to have a cable.  You might, if you're lucky, you have a cable company that's offering internet service.  Your phone company might be, there might be a few independent ISPs on that phone company's  line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe a fiber provider that may be.  Maybe.  It depends.  If you're out in the suburbs where there's fiber.  Give Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get it.  But usually most people have two or three choices and not many more.  And that's what keeps it, that's what makes that neutrality an issue.  Because if you get a couple of people colluding saying, well, yeah, let's cut back on that  YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's killing us.  Well, either that or whether they just collude on the price.  Well, they clearly do that.  Yeah.  The prices are too high.  Way too high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's two different issues really.  I don't think we should lump them together.  Maybe they are effectively lumped together.  But pricing is one issue and selecting which content you throttle is another one.  Throttle or cut.  Because you were talking about Google just now.  Google is not going to be the issue.  BitTorrent is going to be the issue.  Well, it depends what your business is.  If you're a cable company, it's BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're a phone company providing the internet access, it's Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons I find this argument maybe I don't care so much about because we're having  so much non-net neutrality now that's part of the system.  For example, and Leo will agree to that when I bring it up, my site, dvorakuncensored,  dvorak.org slash blog, is blocked all over the country.  For no other reason than the word uncensored is in the URL or not even in the URL.  It's just in the header.  And it's done by these third parties that are filtering systems that are all over the place.  They're in libraries, they're in corporations, they're in universities, they're in research companies.  They're everywhere.  And there's about 25 or 30 of these guys and they block content.  And where's the laws against this nonsense?  I thought if you're on the internet, you should be able to see what's on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, imagine the situation if your last name was Cumming.  Do you get blocked, John?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I get blocked.  And I also famously, Eudora would splash up this warning.  Oh, you get the hot pepper.  The hot red pepper.  Yeah, hot pepper.  Using disgusting language in emailing this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, how do you get any emails delivered at all?  Yeah, really, you have my email.  It's like being named Freddie Viagra.  I mean, it's not a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because my whole family at one point had Hotmail accounts and Hotmail would not allow us to use our actual name.  So we all had to fake last names.  So we all actually had quite offensive fake last names.  We just happened to get through the filter from Hotmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may be related, but I guess this is Cummings, which is a very large motor manufacturer in the United States.  They make some of the top diesel engines in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there's so many things to think of now when you're naming a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really got to pay attention.  When it's your last name, it's a bit more difficult.  It is a problem and I do get blocked in some places and it's actually got to the point now where it just amuses me because it's so stupid.  But early on, Google used to serve up pornographic ads if you searched for me.  Oh, geez.  I actually wrote to Google and asked them to stop it.  And to their credit, they did do something that doesn't happen now.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually haven't seen much porn on a Google search recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they do that, sell those ads anyway.  They've done a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You write a petition to 10 Downing Street and you get it like a written apology.  You write to Google and they stop sending you the spam you don't want.  How exactly do you word these things?  I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's British.  He's Russian properly.  What you do is you ask very, very politely.  In Britain, that works.  I actually published some of the emails I sent to people about the petition on the O'Reilly website.  And you can, particularly for the BBC, because that big hit from the BBC, I actually just wrote to them and said,  you need to cover this story.  It's important.  And they did.  So it's always worth a try.  Says, asking nicely.  I never thought of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Freddy Nigerian Bank scam wrote and tells us.  All right, we're going to, I want to remind people that you can, and we did, you know,  I said it's briefly last week, but I want to emphasize it.  You can now call us.

It's one of those cases where the number is actually easier to remember than the letters.  But do call us.  Leave us a message.  And maybe next week we'll be including your message.  Try to keep it short.  Remember that if you leave us a message, you're giving us permission to use it on the air.  And we do reserve the right to edit it for clarity and length.

Would you like a glass of wine or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have any Bordeaux in the house?  I don't think we have. I think we've gone through all the Bordeaux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want a Chinon or Bordeaux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you have any Chinon.  That would be what the Parisians drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Patrick is drinking.  Are you drinking any wine today, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's half past one, so not right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Half past one, should be drinking the Armagnac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  It's time for Brandy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good suggestion, actually.  Intuit.  I'm going to stick to the water, though.  It's my first Twit.  You know, maybe in a five minute while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably wise.  In fact, I used to drink and now I realized.  It's really one time.  One time we had a whole group half sloshed.  Everybody was sloshed.  You know, it's funny.  We haven't done that.  I think we did it for a few episodes because we had a wine sponsor.  We haven't done it since, but we still have the reputation as being a bunch of drunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, the Woodford is still around, isn't it?  Or did you guys wipe it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it would be there.  Is that a wine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the bourbon.  Oh, I think.  Oh, let's see what we have here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you like some bourbon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, why not?  Oh, yeah, it's right there.  Oh, no, this is that stuff, right?  This is the Evan Williams named after the founder of Twitter.  Right.  This is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to say I did apply to Twitter because you told me wearing somebody put a link up where you fill out the form for the verified thing.  Yeah.  And I guess this shouldn't be much of a surprise.  But look what happened.  It says something is technically wrong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that shouldn't be shouldn't be much of a surprise.  But I guess I won't be getting my verification either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Well, you know, the funny thing is I was thinking about it and say you don't, you know, even Pogue, who is suckered by the phony, you know, that other one, the phony Dvorak, the phony Dvorak.  I mean, it doesn't say verified on there.  But, you know, who's to know that it's still not me?  I mean, because I don't, you know, so what's good to verify do if you don't know about the real guy, about the real site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say on here we can't verify everybody.  So, you know, don't expect a miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but they verified there are certain supporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I verify the celebrities.  The Oprah's of the world are verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  O'Reilly's verified.  What's the secret?  What does he do that's so special?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think you and I both are probably more famous than O'Reilly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not if you go look at his numbers.  He's got over a million.  Well, that's because he's on the suggested user list.  Well, so you think you're kind of telling me here, even though I don't think you're.  You're expressing it properly.  So there's a level of corruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's one way to put it.  Yes.  I don't know if there's bribes thought about being handed out or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to disassociate myself from this discussion.  I love Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is your what is your handle on Twitter, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not Patrick.  Really?  Not Patrick?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, my well Patrick was taken.  So I figured I should find something that's somewhat similar.  And so I started with not Patrick.  And then a few people started a few people, a few listeners started naming themselves,  not their name.  So there's a few not someone on Twitter who named us.  That's confusing because you are Patrick.  That's the whole genius of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some might call it genius.  John Graham Cumming, what is your pornographic Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not pornographic.  It's J Graham C.  Oh, there you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would they have let you have Cumming, I wonder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I mean, I have my real name on there.  So they didn't block me from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the so the chat room?  I'm watching the chat room going on with the jokes about the basting the meat.  But whenever John gets up during the show, we we it's an old gag.  It goes way back.  They're asking what that zipper is doing on your shirt.  And I'd like to know myself.  He has a zipper like in the middle of nowhere on his shirt, like in case he had a shoulder  operation that needs to be there.  I could get arthroscopic surgery in this shirt without taking it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  It is, you know, it's rather prominent.  I didn't really notice that this is a Scottie vest polo shirt, a twit polo shirt.  And this you could put you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get that shirt free, Leo?  Did you get that shirt free?  You gave it.  Yeah, I got it for free.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Look, I put my iPod in there and now it looks like I did have that shoulder surgery.  There's a big clunky thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got like some old grandma breasts has been flattened and pushed over to the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is the Alan Turing.  You know, I was at the at the cottage, I think last year with Nicole and Mark Spagnolo.  And you gave me a cap.  Yes, that has a zipper in it as well.  Yes, it has 30.  You have a zipper inside.  You have a zipper on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They own a stock in a zipper.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I love Scottie vest stuff because that's exactly his idea is pockets and zippers everywhere.  So that's why I have a zipper on my shirt.  That's all.  It's a very comfortable shirt.  Let's see news.  Hey, there's a thought I can get back to the news.  The Nissan company is adding Blade Runner sound effects to their electric cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, an electric car so quiet.  No, no, no.  It's like.  Makes a.  Yeah, I don't I have to listen back.  But I think Blade Runner's cars made a kind of a hum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the issue of the electric car is not making any noise?  They're very quiet.  You can't hear them coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  People getting run over by electric cars because they're expecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was in a parking lot in San Francisco and one of those little things came by scared the crap out of me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where'd you come from?  Exactly.  Hey, here's an idea.  Darwin is in the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eventually, we'll kill all the people who don't realize there are electric cars around and it'll just move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get to Britain and I and I and I look to the right and the cars coming from the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it takes weeks to get over that.  Yeah, you look the wrong way.  And even though there's big, you know, they have it plastered all over the street in England.  Look left, look left.  No, you're looking right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you look right and step into the traffic and there's an electric car and you're squished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in Amsterdam, you always you're always getting hit by bicyclists doing the same thing because they're racing around in this.  I don't know.  It's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say once they get to a 20 kilometers an hour, they're going to turn off the electric sounds because the cars are more noisy anyway.  But at the slower speeds where they can creep up on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, do you think maybe this is an opportunity for iTunes like ringtones?  Cartones.  That's what I was trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  We think alike.  Cartones.  We've got good ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cartones.  That's because they can't get any music on their iTunes.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the theramit noise.  Yeah.  You know, that sort of, you know, they the earth stood still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  22 states have made texting illegal while you drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know it was ever legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's legal.  Well, it's a loophole, I guess.  And California is considering it.  However.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would anyone consider it?  It should just be illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Many of these states have traffic traffic updates via Twitter.  So they're asking that you tweet when you get in a traffic situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this makes no sense.  However, it is illegal.  If you stop dead on the freeway, that would be a time you could tweet that this year.  Stop dead.  That would be okay.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you're running around 60 miles an hour, the road's clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  State transportation officials insist these are not mixed messages.  The tweets are to be read prior to driving.  Know before you go.  Drivers should be read, but how are they presented before they go?  Yeah, we don't want people reading their tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To send an update that this is all done by GPS and things like that, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it should be done as a heads up on the right on the windshield.  Just have a heads up display that has all the stuff right there and you can drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Facebook feed, my YouTube, my Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the Jet Pilot has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what you want?  You want that new Motorola Click phone that has like as a screen saver just floats Twitter tweets and stuff past you.  But it should be on the windshield.  I think there is a device, isn't there, that you could put like on your phone that would project it onto the...  That'd be cool.  If it's not been invented, it should be.  Well, good news.  The Supreme Court upheld an order on Friday to reimburse $300 million in overpayments collected from residential phone customers.  That's the good news.  The bad news is it was in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  That's part of the British Commonwealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're happy.  Okay, good.  I'm glad.  I'm so glad to hear it.  I'll get the Queen on to you.  Would you like to buy Gene Roddenberry's old Mac Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So while you're on the topic of the...  Gene Roddenberry gave his Mac Plus, apparently, which is an 01 serial number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say it's 01, although apparently it's...  Well, it's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the serial...  Yeah, it is confusing.  Because they upgraded it.  Now, I don't know.  There's a...  When was the last time you got to see Waz?  Has he come in much up here?  I haven't seen him lately.  I'd like to get him up here because I want to come up here with my...  I have one of the original Macintoshes, not the Plus, the real one, the first one.  The 128?  Yeah.  Wow.  I have a 128 with no shielding inside, so it still has all those autographs inside.  You know about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they signed the plastic mold.  Yeah, they signed the plastic mold.  All the people on the team, yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want Waz...  Oh, that's cool.  ...to autograph the outside.  Because one of those...  I can't believe this.  One of these things showed up on the Antiques Roadshow.  Yeah?  You know, there's money to be made here.  Did they say there was worth something?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, well, shh.  He's not saying anything.  He wants to keep it a secret.  He's just telling you.  I'm going to talk to Waz.  We'll get him a couple...  Waz will sign anything, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll get him up here.  I got the felt tip pen.  I'll get Waz up.  Sharpie.  We'll supply the Sharpie.  Sharpie.  And we can use a box of Sharpies if anyone's listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Auction House Profiles in History is auctioning off a Macintosh Plus given by Apple to Gene Roddenberry.  They say this is the very first Mac Plus 1 megabyte personal computer to come off the assembly line.  It is serial number F4200NUM0001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like the first one to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, apparently they were only planning to make 10,000 because after that you run out of numbers.  You got lots of letters.  Oh, maybe they were going to use letters too.  Yeah, it's a megabyte of RAM expandable to 4 megabytes.  But then, which is kind of weird, the machine was originally a 128k Mac that was upgraded to a Macintosh Apple Plus by Apple.  But you know what they're saying?  So if you look at the back of it, well, they have a picture of the back of it and it does say M0001 on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it might be legit then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  On the other hand, they say they'll only expect to get $8 to $1200 at it, which would kind of...  Maybe if Waz had signed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like if Roddenberry had signed it with a big felt tip pen, it would be worth something.  I got this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you get that free, Gene?  You got it free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have a keyboard from Northgate and the back of it is signed by Stan Freberg.  Wow.  What's the connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, you just happen to have a keyboard lying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  Freberg was doing some promotion work and advertising for Northgate when they had that special keyboard  that had the asterisk in the right place.  They had a bunch of...  It was like meant for easy...  Why did they got Stan free?  It must have been ancient.  Yeah, well, this was years ago.  And this Freberg was there and I met him, talked to him, asked him different questions  about radio and why he liked it so much.  But anyway, he gave away a few of these keyboards that he signed because they were giving these  keyboards to people to evaluate.  And so...  Did you get that free?  To evaluate.  And so I grabbed the keyboard and Freberg stopped me.  Hey, no, hold on a second.  He signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat.  Now, I'm sure Patrick and John aren't familiar with Stan Freberg.  He was a radio pioneer, did a lot of ads.  You'd recognize his voice.  Yeah.  He had a very famous voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He actually started off as a puppeteer.  Really?  Beanie and Cecil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I remember Beanie and Cecil.  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was his voice.  Absolutely.  He was born on August 7th.  Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wikipedia.  And he grew up in Pasadena, actually.  I believe you're right, Patrick, as long as Wikipedia is accurate.  So, real quickly, I want to get to one of the bigger stories that we have left out,  but we will, which is Skype.  Again, more in court and it's just a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you figured out the story?  I mean, I've been reading this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like the Google Book Search story.  This is one of those crazy stories.  Well, here's the issue.  It happened again.  But I'm going to explain what that means in just a second.  It happened.  I thought it couldn't happen again, but it did.  It happened again.  I thought that only eBay could be that dumb.  But it happened again.  And you'd think they'd have learned, but no.  But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at audible.com.  You could baste your meat, John.  You know, wait a minute.  You're not cooking today.  He's not making dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm having raw oysters.  You know, we're back in the months with ours.  So I'm going to start checking the oysters out again.  Oh, September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Because August didn't have an R.  Right.  It's the hot months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, you can get some confirmation from our French friend.  The French believe that the absolute great month for eating oysters is January.  And I have to say, I started picking up on that concept.  Because it's the coolest.  I'm telling you, oysters in January are astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Patrick, I know the French are very proud of their huitres.  But I think that we have better huitres here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think if you get the ones in Oregon and you go up to British Columbia.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave this panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got the British Columbia oysters.  It'll just blow your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even Hog Island out here, just our local oysters, just a very delicious, fresh, crisp flavor.  But all right, well, we won't get into battle over this.  You're an oyster lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to start speaking with a French accent if we do.  It's going to be messy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing that is available everywhere that this show has heard, including the UK and France,  is the great audible.com.  I want to tell everybody about the audible deal.  Now, this audible deal is available in the US only.  But you can get your audible books all over the world.  And it's just a wonderful place to get online and find something great to listen to.  My friend Roz Savage just got back.  She's been rowing across the Pacific.  She was three months at sea.  And before she left, I gave her my iPod stocked with 323 audible books.  And she says, I could not.  I mean, she's rowing solo for three months all by herself.  She said audible saves my life.  She loves these audible books.  Now, if audible can get her across the ocean, audible can get you across town, home from work.  Great for your commute. Great for the gym.  Here's one for John.  Ron Paul's book, End the Fed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually, I think this is a speech by Ron Paul.  That's one of the neat things about audible.  Well, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think he did come up with a book.  He wrote a book.  Yeah.  I mean, he's been trying.  I don't want to get into politics on this show, but Ron Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's the point.  You can from left, from right, from the center, from way out in the left field or right field, you can find books about all the topics in the world.  Science and technology, sci-fi and fantasy.  Audible is even recording some of the great sci-fi books that were never recorded.  And I just have to thank them for that.  You can get stuff that has never been on audio before.  In fact, go to their audible frontiers section.  These are the books that they've recorded.  When I first joined audible, they had a handful.  Now they have almost 2500.  It's amazing.  Great sci-fi books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should do a book or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I want to do a book.  They've asked me to do a book and we're just trying to find one.  I'm going to recommend, I mean, there's, oh man, our friend Jerry Pornell, the last time he was on, they did not have this on audible.  They do now Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pornell.  What a great book.  I mean, this is a 24 hours worth of listening and you can get it absolutely free.  Actually, you know, I think the Moten God's Eye, that'd be the one I'd start with.  What a classic this is.  Go to audible.com slash twit to you get them both.  Get the Jerry Pornell, Larry Niven collection and absolutely free.  You're going to sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month and the first two books are yours to keep free.  Even if you decide not to stick around.  I know you will, though.  This is a great way to listen on your iPod, on your iPhone, on your Nano, on your Kindle, on your Zune works great on the Zune HD.  Audible.com slash twit to we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  As I mentioned earlier, David Pogelby on in just a few minutes.  He's going to for his he's going to record this earlier.  A rebuttal, a rebuttal for all the nasty mean things we said about him last week.  You said you record this earlier, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. Well, then I don't get to complain.  You don't get to complain to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he will mention that he considers that you were one of the people who was savaging him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because he was on some bogus site.  Wasn't you?  It wasn't me.  I've never maybe mentioned him on Twitter ever.  OK, so I'm going to send a note.  I mean, on here, I've talked about him because you brought up in the conversation.  I did say he's a fanboy.  But so what?  It's obvious.  Yeah. Now, there's a new story here that I don't know if you covered it last week or not.  I want to please go right ahead.  Did you Google acquires recapture?  Yeah.  Isn't that wild?  Why?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what a capture is?  Acaptcha is, of course, folks, is those are those funny letters that they put on.  In fact, which you sign up for Gmail.  You have to decipher the letters.  Apparently, no computer can, but only humans can.  It keeps the spammers from signing up for a million Gmail accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the way they do it, of course.  You know, what you do is they have these systems available where a spammer will run into, you know, they essentially have, they get to a, the machine gets to a capture.  And then it sends the web page in mass, like hundreds of them to people in India or wherever they have them so they can just type into things.  What does this mean?  Or it means, I can type that in.  And they type in the.  But they type it in with an accent.  So does that work?  So they type it in and then they would actually not only in, but they're in like, you know, permanently.  So the captures never come up again.  They're like members now.  And then the spammers just go crazy.  So capture doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've even got a man in the middle, a really clever man in the middle.  When you go to a porn site to sign up, you'll get a capture, which is just forwarded from Gmail.  So they have humans signing up for their sites and they just use them and they say, oh, thanks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the question in my mind is why does anybody.  Well, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, recapture was created at Carnegie Mellon with a kind of altruistic bent.  It gives you two words, right?  One word is the actual capture, but they don't tell you which of them.  The other one is something that was scanned in from a book that they can't figure out what it is.  It's part of a book scanning effort.  And so Google is going to use this for their Google book scan.  When they get to a word that their scanner can't interpret, they add it to the capture.  You don't know which one's a real word, which one's a capture word.  You type in both because it's a two word capture.  And now they've got a human doing their work for them.  Clever, eh?  They've learned something from the pornographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually genius.  It is genius.  But what did they pay for this company?  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ridiculous amount because what's interesting is I thought that recapture was kind of a, I don't know,  I got the impression it was more of an open source thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought they were going to use it for that idea that I can't remember which blogger had,  which was to put ads in the capture.  But that makes sense too.  Wouldn't that be cool?  That would be good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of uses here.  Now I'm starting to see the light.  Now you realize why Google bought recapture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's all kinds of possibilities.  Let me see.  You know, actually it's funny.  I took that out of the stories because I thought there'll be nothing to say.  Drink Pepsi.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Drink Pepsi.  And then you type it in.  Drink Pepsi.  So it gets embedded in your brain.  It's a great pure genius.  Drink Pepsi.  Okay, I'll drink Pepsi.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I'm getting thirsty right now.  I want some Pepsi.  That doesn't say how much they spent for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I can't find it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking for a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was a private company so they're probably never going to get it.  They never published a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're also buying Brightcove.  Well, that was a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that rumor, which came from a fairly reliable source, was never confirmed and nothing ever happened.  So I don't know if they actually are.  I don't know why they'd want it.  Well, they bought on too.  They've been buying video companies.  Brightcove is kind of what?  Like Ustream or Stick Amp for a business.  They stream video or Bit Gravity.  They stream video for business, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they also store and forward stuff.  I mean, MarketWatch used to use Brightcove for its videos that it has on the MarketWatch site.  I don't know if they do anymore.  Why would Google want that?  They've got YouTube.  They've got Google Video, which they were supposed to take down and yet to do so.  Remember, they said they were going to kill it and they haven't done anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're hoping to make some money, unlike YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they're preparing.  They need a steadier infrastructure for the movies that are going to be served through YouTube for rental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting speculation.  Maybe.  That's how you would do the movies.  That's very interesting.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they would have to buy it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's up to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know they're up to something.  Also Intuit does a very smart thing.  Buys Mint.  Do you use Mint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't use Mint.  I don't even know what Mint is.  Oh, I love Mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think John or Patrick, I don't think you can use Mint outside the US.  No, I tried.  There are competitors in the UK that do the same thing.  You've got something we don't have, though.  You have Spotify.  Well, tell us about Mint.  Mint is something that I resisted because I thought, oh, this is a terrible idea.  When they first came out about a year ago, they came out, I think, at TechCrunch 50.  I said, oh, this is cool.  You give them, and a red flag should go up here at a moment.  You give them all your bank account logins, all your loan logins, all your investment account logins,  and they collect all the data from your bank account and kind of balance your checkbook  and tell you how much money you've got.  They even warn you.  I have Mint on my iPhone.  They'll send me a warning when a big transaction happens.  It'll budget for you.  It looks back in history and says, well, you're spending 50 bucks more on fast food.  It keeps saying that to me.  I don't know why.  Than you have before.  This is nice.  This is the iPhone app that gives you kind of like a, oops, and now it wants me to log in.  Oh, well.  It gives you a summary of what you're worth.  You can go online at mint.com.  Really, I didn't sign up at first.  I thought, oh, this is terrible.  I can't use this.  I think I can give them this information.  But then Gina Trapani, who does this week in Google Show and I Trust is a smart programmer,  wrote an article about it saying, well, you know, they use a third party,  the same third party that the banks use.  In fact, the truth is this third party already knows all your logins  because the banks are using them.  So it's safe to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know, that reminds me of the, you know, people,  if you do mail order or direct marketing and you put up a website,  people can type in their stuff to a web browser.  But some people say, well, I don't want to do that because it goes on the internet  and I can't handle that.  But if you're in the mail order business or the direct marketing business  and you actually set up shop with one of these guys who take phone orders,  because I'd rather do the phone order,  they require that you have that same exact internet account.  So they bring up the information on the web browser and type it in  instead of you typing it in.  So the whole thing is...  And they're probably using prisoners anyway.  Which is probably worse.  They're probably using...  Exactly.  The whole thing you can't get around.  Well, that's an interesting point to make.  It's a great service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I love this service because it does do a really good job of analyzing.  And you know, it's a smart service because it's free, totally free.  The way it works is they monetize it by selling ads,  but they're smart ads because they'll be ads saying,  well, I see you're using Fidelity as your broker.  You know, you could save $53 a week based on the number of transactions you've had.  By going to E-Trade.  By going to E-Trade.  It's very smart.  Or we can get you a better credit card deal.  So that's how they monetize.  The interesting thing is they've been eating Intuit's lunch.  I mean, Intuit, because of Mint, had to make quick and online free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And people still are...  So it's a smart move by Intuit.  Smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought the competition out.  $170 million big exit.  And there was a lot of criticism by people who said,  criticism of Mint for selling out for $170 million,  because that's not the new web way to look for an exit to a big company.  You should be more like Facebook.  You should be building value.  You should be turning away the suitors.  Yeah, right.  If anybody comes to me with $170 million, I'll do it for 10.  I'm out of here.  You're out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're in the south of France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Patrick, you got room for me there?  Sure, no problem.  Coming over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have anything like Mint in France?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I looked, and we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The banks all have online services, but nothing like Mint.  And I even tried opening an account with Mint,  and was all happy when it accepted my account, I mean, opening the account.  But then there was only American banks.  Right, it won't import any of your data.  And then it reinforced my anti-American...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is largely due to the fact that the EU has privacy and security laws  that are alien to ours, and they won't let you do that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about a violation of privacy and security.  I've given them everything.  And I go on my iPhone, you press a button,  it tells you what my net worth is, where all my money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody just says, knock you over the head with a sack of pennies,  and then grab your iPhone, and they've got your balance sheet.  They've got my balance sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another thing that people don't quite realize about Mint and Quicken,  which is there's a much bigger story,  which is that Intuit actually runs a lot of the online banking for banks in the US already.  Oh, interesting.  They're actually a service provider.  And so this whole issue of Mint actually used a thing called Yodely as the backend.  Intuit is actually a pretty big deal in actually hooking up to banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is Yodely an Intuit competitor as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of. Yodely has actually been around for a long time.  They were in the late 90s, they were around, and they were trying to do what Mint is doing today.  They actually had a thing that was a bit like NetVibes or PageFlakes,  but also with all your financial information in it.  And they then turned themselves into a B2B company.  They do actually still provide the B2C bit, but Mint really came along and did a great job of it.  But Intuit has been building this business in the backend, which is all of the bank connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I wonder if they'll abandon Yodely and make Mint use Intuit some.  Because I have to say, one of the reasons I loved Mint was I never got quickened to do a very good job of importing all my data.  I had to do a lot of my hand tweaking and stuff, and Mint just does it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm surprised you haven't got banks of bookkeepers.  I do, actually.  I just haven't been there on a Tuesday, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They come in on Tuesday, and they count my money for me, and then we have a little vat that we keep it all in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get that little thing that flips through the dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like that.  Just like that.  Hey, I really want to thank you all for being here.  I especially want to thank you, Patrick and John Graham, coming for staying up so late with us.  Patrick Béja is a podcaster from Paris.  His site is Frenchspin.com.  And will you do, turn the favor and allow me to be on your show at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. That would be a great pleasure.  I'd love to be on the film.  Do you watch movies at all? You could be on the Movielicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. Is that an English language one as well, Movielicious?  Yes, it is.  Do you talk about movies? Do you review movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm reluctant to say review because it really implies a level of professionalism that we don't really have.  But we just discuss the movies that we've just seen.  Modern movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sometimes trash them.  You know what I loved? I just saw Zinglorious Basterds.  You liked it?  Hell yeah.  You know why? Because Hitler gets it in the end.  I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we have come to some understanding that Hitler actually did die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but not the way it shows it in the movie.  Not that way.  It's really kind of, it's quite a Tarantino, so it's very, very violent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you think they're revealing the absolute truth though? I mean, is it possible?  Maybe this is what really happened.  This could be. It could be a cover up for what really happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, as violent as it is, it is a comedy. It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all this violence has been comedic.  Yeah, it's very funny.  I mean, that one with that Kill Bill.  Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, Kill Bill.  Reservoir Dogs, I don't think he really had the soft touch with that one.  But with the Kill Bill, when that girl chops off the woman's head and the blood squirts up like a little geyser that goes on forever.  It's so horrible.  It's so ludicrous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tarantino does have a talent for making gruesome stuff sort of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you need to get John and me on. Have you done Inglorious Basterds yet?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have.  Oh, I'm sure we'll find some other movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you got to go see it. I think you'd enjoy it.  Yeah, I'll watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of the World War II history.  I'll watch it on the 100 inch screen at home.  Oh, shut up. You have a 100 inch screen?  You know what you should see though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you buy that?  It's a projector.  Oh, go ahead, Patrick.  No, I just wanted to mention the movie 500 Days of Summer.  Oh, is that good?  Which is an amazing movie.  Oh, I have to go see that.  Everyone, please go out and see it. And that's all I'll say about it.  500 Days of Summer, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I love, what's her name? Chloe? What's her name?  Zoe Deschanel.  Zoe Deschanel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 500 Days of Summer is about global warming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Very good. Very quick. Thank you for being here, Patrick. We really appreciate it.  Also want to thank my friend, John Graham Cumming.  And I really want to thank you for the great job you did rehabilitating and bringing people's awareness to the great injustice that was done to Alan Turing.  Yeah, that was great.  Yeah. Success.  Thanks very much.  Don't forget his book, A Must Read, Geek Atlas. It's on Amazon. It's available everywhere from O'Reilly & Sons. His website, jgc.org. Thanks for staying up late with us, John.  No problem. Nice talking to you.  And John, see Dvorak. We appreciate your great contributions as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can find me at channeldvorak.com and on Twitter I am the real Dvorak, spelled T-H-E-R-E-A-L, Dvorak, D-V-O-R-A-K, if I can get that right.  And he has never mentioned David Pogue on Twitter.  I've never mentioned David Pogue and really had no desire to until now, which I did mention him on Twitter asking people to give me where I mentioned him.  And somebody on Twitter, my audience, somebody said, here, here it is.  Twitter is a great crowd sourcing tool.  It is. I love it.  In fact, I don't know if I could do it. I'm at the limit where, you know, if you crowd source with 60,000, it's harder than 30 because you start getting too much redundancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thank you for being here, John. We really appreciate it. Thank you all for being here. East Meats West is coming up next.  Remember, you can watch this show live every Sunday afternoon, 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific at live.twit.tv.  But make sure you subscribe on iTunes or the Zune store as well, because those subscriptions make us lots more money, frankly, than you watching on the stream.  Did you know that? I'm glad for you. We make no money on the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the stream is just floating out there. Yeah.  Another twit. This is hit the can.  It's hit the can. You said it's in the can. You said hit the can. Hit the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go. We're not done yet because David Pogue joined us right before the show.  I asked David on actually he asked to be on and I was very glad to have him on to rebut our conversations about him and the conflicts of interest that we considered were happening at the New York Times with his coverage, particularly of Apple.  So David agreed to a call in from the road. He's in Syracuse.  And the conversation went something like this.  David Pogue is here with us. And just just to kind of set this up over the last couple of weeks.  We've been pretty hard on David, which is hard for me because I consider David a friend and I really like you, David.  But we've been very hard. And I know you've received criticism in other areas as well because the New York Times public editor responded to a conflict of interest issues.  In particular, the public editor responded to the issue of you reviewing Snow Leopard while at the same time writing a book on Snow Leopard, which might lead one to think that you have some vested interest in the success of Snow Leopard.  And then I think we were more critical in general of the fact that as times gone by, you've become more and more apparently a Mac fan and that it just seemed like you it was inappropriate for the Times to use you as a reviewer because  because it just didn't seem like you know you were unbiased in the issue. So I wanted to give you that. Is that fair? Is that a fair summary of what you feel like we've been saying about you?  Yeah, I think that's that's about right.  So I want to give you a chance to respond. Absolutely. And I do want to say upfront, I think the world of you, David, you're super talented. I really admire you.  I don't believe that you're that you would in any way act unethically. And I hope that that wasn't the feeling that you got from this.  But I do think that there is an issue and it's a different issue than perhaps somebody like me who's a podcaster, who's an opinion person, that because you write for the Times, you have a higher standard to adhere to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I think you're right. I think there is clearly an evidence and apparent conflict of interest.  But what I thought was interesting about your segment with the panelists to talk about me when I wasn't there is that I think you had Dwight Silverman, right, from the Houston Chronicle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it happened several times. So last week was Jason Calacanis on Twitter and then the week before, I believe it was Dwight Silverman.  And Dwight, I think, was defending you because he, in fact, also writes books about these topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And in point of fact, this is a problem with the industry and not so much with me alone. And this is what I wanted to bring up to you. It's about context.  So Dwight admitted to you that he writes for the Houston Chronicle and he wrote a Windows book at the same time that he was writing about Windows for the paper.  And Ed Baig, who writes for an even bigger newspaper than I do, he writes for USA Today, the equivalent column.  He wrote Max for Dummies, Palm Pre, The Missing Manual. He wrote an iPhone book at the same time he was reviewing those.  Walt Mossberg for The Wall Street Journal makes, I think the New Yorker said, a million dollars a year off of the DeConference,  where Steve Jobs and Bill Gates make exclusive appearances, the very guys whose products he reviews.  So it's a growing problem. You probably have a hard time finding someone who doesn't have a problem like this.  So, you know, I'm not going to say there's no visible conflict of interest. Obviously, there is one.  The question is, the only thing I can say in my defense, our defense is, does that conflict of interest affect the writing?  Does it affect the conclusions? So, in other words, can you look at a column I've done about some Apple product and say,  oh, my gosh, this thing that he has a book about is so much more of a positive review than any of the other national reviewers gave him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I can. So let me bring that up.  So, and this is where, you know, to be honest with you, for a long time, I've been aware of the conflict of interest.  And you're right, it is endemic. And I think it's a big problem.  But we can, and let's talk about that because I think it's a good subject.  But let me talk specifically about you first.  So where it really started to surface for me as an issue was your Snow Leopard review, which was a very positive review and left out what I thought was something fairly critical.  You talked in a blog posting, and I'm trying to remember who you talked to, about some significant problems you'd had with Leopard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, Leo, there are two paragraphs about the glitches in the review. That's what boggles my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you didn't mention the fact that you hadn't, you never got CS3 working, that your printer never did work.  It felt to me like you downplayed the glitches.  And in my opinion, I realize I was swimming upstream on this because you're right, most of the national viewers are very positive about Snow Leopard.  I was much more critical of Snow Leopard and I really felt that the tech reporting had done a disservice to Apple users by recommending the upgrade.  When in fact, I don't think it was ready for most people.  The problems that it caused did not outweigh the benefits that people were going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I must disagree with you about that.  I specifically, in the New York Times, mentioned Microsoft Word, Photoshop CS3, the FTP program that was crashing all the time, and a couple of other.  I named them specifically.  And so when Paul from VentureBeat emailed me and asked me to elaborate, I said I named the exact same problems, except for the printer one, which happened later.  Later, I was not able to, after the review for the Times was done, I was not able to connect to my HP Laser printer, which turns out is because they took out Apple Talk.  And it's pretty easy to fit back in. You just switch it to IP address.  And so really wasn't an incompatibility.  As a matter of fact, the word problem went away as soon as I did a reinstall.  I think my normal template was corrupted.  That turned out, as far as I know, not to be a snow leopard thing at all.  The Photoshop CS3 crashes, a few people, other people have had.  Adobe's talked about it a lot on their website.  And supposedly that was corrected, as I predicted, by the 10.6.1 update from Apple.  So you're wrong.  I did not not mention that in the Times.  In fact, I mentioned the same things that I mentioned to VentureBeat.  And the reason it was only two paragraphs was because these things always happen when something new comes along.  And then there are bugs, fix and patches and they go away.  I said exactly the same thing about the Microsoft Zoom the following week.  There were little glitches.  And I'll say the same thing again this week about the product I'm reviewing now that's brand new with a 1.0 operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I will point taken.  I felt the tone of the I won't defend it, but I felt the tone of the Snow Leopard review was more positive than I would have given it.  But that's a difference of opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you had problems, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And significant ones.  And I feel like in general, the people should have been a little harder on Snow Leopard.  The second issue that came up was your conversation with Steve Jobs right after the Apple event.  Where you and to your credit, you immediately asked the question everybody was asking.  Why no camera?  Steve gave you a pretty spinny answer.  And I would have I was hoping for more follow up there.  And I wonder if the impression I got was that perhaps you were reluctant to challenge Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, see, that's that was a really bizarre situation.  First of all, by the way, what did you think of Walt Mossberg's interview with Jobs and Ed Bage's interview with Jobs the same day?  I didn't actually I didn't actually read them. I read you.  Because they didn't write them. They didn't write them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so did you have it was unclear to me.  Did you did not have an exclusive Ed and and Walt did get interviews with all the big guys have interviews one right after another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're all sitting in the same way.  Why do you think they didn't write them?  So I think Apple clearly wanted to focus on the products.  So they declined every Times and Wall Street Journal and USA Today reporters, business reporters requests for interviews.  So only the product guys got in and not the business, not the business interviewers.  So my editors asked me, by the way, we'd like to do a news story about this while you're there.  Can you ask these newsy related questions and we'll use quotes from it for a business story.  And they gave me some questions that they hope that I could pass along.  So you have 10 minutes with the man.  And already, you know, by the way, after this, John Dvorak went on Twitter and said David Pogue is a disgrace to journalism.  Jason Calacanis said, no one in the tech business takes you seriously.  It's a joke that the New York Times employs you.  They're just unbelievably harsh.  And one guy on the David Pogue blog said, you should have nailed jobs as asked to the wall.  And I'm going to like, dude, that is not how you get.  I mean, yeah, maybe I should have.  But is that my job?  But let me ask you this, Leo.  What would you have said if he spun you?  If he said, well, the reason we didn't put a camera in the iPod touch is because we're repositioning it as an inexpensive game machine and you didn't buy it.  So what would you let's role play?  You said it'd be hard not to laugh when he said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I've talked to Steve and I know that the follow up question, which I would have said is, you know, I'm not sure exactly what I've said, but I would have said, well, Steve, that that doesn't make any sense.  He would have left.  And this is the issue.  I think that a lot of trade press has and press that covers narrower fields have and certainly it's a problem on the Beltway with balancing access with fairness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we're talking.  That's the point.  He would have left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I got to tell you, that's why I was I have never been offered an interview with Steve Jobs, although I've asked many times.  It's why I was never allowed to speak to Bill Gates because every time you have to speak to Bill Gates, you have to submit questions in advance.  And I, for ethical reasons, don't believe I should be doing that.  So I don't get those interviews.  I will never get an interview with Steve Jobs.  I think perhaps because I wasn't even invited to that event, perhaps because I have not been a Apple cheerleader in recent times.  And I think that that is an issue, David.  So I think now it's on the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is it better to have to ask the hard questions and not nail his ass to the wall and the follow up, but bring the readers his answers?  Or is it best not to interview him at all and get no answers?  Listen, and by the way, I want to add this isn't a David Pogue Steve Jobs thing.  Though I have I have interviewed Bill Gates.  I did was not asked to submit my questions in advance.  I have interviewed senators and governors for CBS Sunday morning.  I interview lots of big people and I'm always respectful.  That doesn't mean I'm kissing your ass.  It means you're respectful.  I asked him the tough questions.  It came out later that the blogs found a hole in the iPod touch where someone could have put a camera.  But that happened after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had you seen that before the question before the interview?  No, that came out two or three days later.  No, I'm saying if you had, would you have brought it up?  Oh, sure.  OK.  Absolutely.  So that's really the that's really the issue.  I'm not saying be disrespectful.  But I but I think that it is an issue when in effect you're giving Apple.  Look, you're coming from The New York Times.  You're giving an Apple a platform for what is essentially public relations, you know, a press release.  And so I think that there is an issue there.  I think that because you have the weight of The New York Times behind you, that's I'm certain that's why Bill Gates did not ask you to submit questions when he asked me to submit questions.  You know, you you have some weight and you can go in there and perhaps challenge him a little bit more.  Are you?  And I know that's a difficult thing to do.  But I think it's your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll I'll accept that.  I am.  I love the thing that I objected to most about John Dvorak's tearing me down on Twitter is, you know, your disgrace to journalism.  Since when have I ever build myself as a journalist?  Well, that's the question, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were a blogger, I mean, are you a blogger for The New York Times?  I mean, if you're I mean, you have a blog.  If you were a blogger, nobody would say this.  It would say, you know, because or an opinion.  Let's not say blogger. Let's say a columnist, an opinion person.  You know, nobody says to David Brooks, why is it that you you aren't a fan of President Obama?  Actually, I guess he is.  But I mean, you're not a columnist.  You're a reporter, are you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  You know, by the way, I'm suddenly realizing this is all just making it all worse for myself.  But I just I got it that the haters are going to hate David.  You know, you can't win with the haters.  I am not a reporter.  I have never been to journalism school.  I don't know what it means to bury the lead.  OK, I do know what it means.  But I'm not a reporter.  I've been an opinion columnist my entire career.  I express opinions.  I try to entertain and inform.  And in this instance, and I've never, never interviewed jobs in this sort of news report way before.  And it was a mistake.  I don't think I'm not an investigative reporter by any means.  And again, this is not a jobs thing.  This is a David Pogue thing.  I like my interview subjects to like me.  I like them to feel comfortable because in my experience for CBS Sunday Morning, the interview subjects tend to be more forthcoming.  They tend to let things roll more when they feel comfortable as opposed to feeling that they're being.  David, that's my style, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm completely sympathetic.  I think one of the reasons we get along, I'm not a confrontational journalist.  So maybe that's a misapprehension about your role at the Times.  And certainly you were put in the position of being a news reporter.  Now, what is the Times reaction to this?  I mean, I read the public editor's piece.  It sounded like they were content with your role and from now on they're going to put a disclaimer in your column.  Is that the end of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, as the public editor said, I was already doing the missing manuals when the New York Times came along.  And from the very beginning, that was my offer.  Look, I have to keep doing the books.  That's how I put food on the table.  Right.  So anyway, so they went into it with their eyes open.  For nine years, it's never been an issue.  Apart from the snarky bloggers, most readers seem satisfied that I'm being even handed.  And if you again, if you compare my review, you know, I called mobile me a mobile mess.  I said that I movie 08 was a train wreck.  I mean, I'm not afraid to and I had books on those subjects.  So I'm not afraid to nail Apple where it's due, because why wouldn't I?  It's my credibility is my bread and butter.  People think I'm going to cave just to increase the sales of my books, which by the way, I think is a pretty it's pretty far fetched.  Oh, David Pogue is doing this to get his 80 cent royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody who's read the book knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So as far as I know, that's it for the Times.  I've offered repeatedly.  I mean, we've discussed this a lot over the years and I've offered repeatedly to take those weeks off.  Right.  You know, I only have three missing manuals.  Right. So I photo I'm sorry.  I move iPhone, Mac OS 10 and Windows.  Those are the three that I'm keeping alive.  So it comes up three times a year, this subject.  So I've said I could take those weeks off from the Times.  You could get someone else to write it.  Their feeling is that at this point, readers are sort of expecting my voice and they know me.  And I've frequently said, why don't we disclose the book in the column?  And for nine years, that's been shot down because it's like, dude, you can't advertise yourself.  It's like putting a plug in the column.  So they never did that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, that is the irony is the disclaimer is in a way a plug, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. And you know what?  I'm sorry to tell you guys this, but now that the plug is going to appear in each column, it's going to raise the book sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask you about the video, the I Love My iPhone video.  A lot of people have said, look, this is a proof positive that David is a fanboy.  He shouldn't be reviewing any Apple products after making a video that says I love my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, you're talking about the song that goes, I want to touch its precious screen.  That one.  I want to wipe the smudges clean.  I want my friends to look and drool.  I want to say, look, now I'm cool.  I took a stand, paid half a grand.  That one, the one that goes, talks about the Scott and the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying it's a parody.  It's not a pain to the iPhone.  It is, in fact, mocking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course. It was a parody of the hype, dude.  I mean, it's so obvious.  We went to all these guys who've been standing in line for the Apple store for a week, you know, a thousand people and got them to sing the lines.  One whole verse is about, you know, no keys, no memory card, can't expand it, can't change the battery.  A whole verse about that.  But all anybody remembers is, I love my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all anybody remembers of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, evidently. But watch the whole thing.  It's a parody of the whole thing.  Look, dude, like it's my credibility at stake.  I'm not going to say, if I really did kiss Apple's ass, I wouldn't say it.  I wouldn't advertise it.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably a bad way to go if you had something to gain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just one last thing.  I know we've hammered this horse still as dead.  But one last thing is, I'm not an Apple fanboy, meaning that I give Apple a pass.  However, I think that Apple is relatively more often likely to do polished work.  What's interesting to me is that nobody nails me for being a Google fanboy or a BlackBerry fanboy or a Tivo fanboy or a Sonos fanboy.  All of those companies have gotten a higher percentage of positive reviews from me than Apple.  It's because Apple and Microsoft are part of this religious war that people care, and they get especially fired up about this.  But I think it's important not to mix up the two.  The haters want me to cream Apple every time.  That's not going to happen.  I'm going to give good reviews when I deserve and bad reviews when I deserve.  Just like a theater critic may generally like Sondheim's work, a restaurant critic may generally like Chef Pierre Boulogne's work or whatever.  I think that Apple, and so do you, Leo.  I think I've heard you say many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in that category, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In general, they do polished, elegant work.  And I'm going to call it when I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do we do then about the issue that you raised at the beginning, which is, I think, a big issue, which is that it's very difficult to find people that there isn't a conflict of interest to cover this stuff.  I mean, I've tried personally to distance myself from PR.  I don't take, I very rarely take products for review anymore.  I buy the products that we review.  I've done everything I can to distance myself from that.  And I don't work for the New York Times or the Houston Chronicle.  Is it too late to expect a higher standard?  Is it impossible to find a reviewer that doesn't have conflicts of interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Consumer Reports?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's actually been my model as going forward is to try to move towards that standard.  They don't take advertising either, which makes it very difficult for me because I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to be Michael Arrington and get you really pissed off here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Palm Pre, I took a loner of that, okay?  But that's very rare.  That was a rare exception.  And there were logistical reasons why I did that because they released it on Saturday and have time to review it at the radio show.  I wouldn't have been able to buy it in time.  So I did take a loner.  But generally, if I can buy something before the radio show, including all the iPhones I own, all the Macintoshes I own, I will buy them trying to keep my distance.  I don't get invited to these events anymore.  And I think it's because I don't take calls from PR.  I don't do vendor meetings whenever possible.  Again, I recently did one for the Zune HD foolishly hoping to get it in time for review, but that didn't work out because they didn't activate the dang thing.  So I try as much as I can to do that.  And I think that that's something we should ask of tech reporters, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, except that as a result, you're depriving your readers of your opinions a lot of times or delaying them.  I mean, is that good too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that's a worthwhile trade-off.  Because you're in print, you have a longer lead time.  I don't have the lead time that you do.  Right.  But as a result, I often have to give a quote first look review because I don't have much time to look at it when the product's released.  I think that that's fair.  You know, it's what I'm comfortable with, David.  I don't really want to have a relationship with these companies.  Right.  I feel like my job is to represent the user.  And if I am too close to the companies, it makes it hard for me to do my job.  I like these people.  And see, that's the problem.  I don't want to like Steve Jobs too much or anybody at Apple too much because then it would make me hard for them for me to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's extremely admirable what you're doing.  It's also extremely unusual in this day and age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I apologize for bringing it up because I'm not trying to toot my own horn here.  How do we address this as a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my message is it's not just me.  I felt like I was ganged up upon.  And I just want to point out it's problematic, but it's not just me.  No, absolutely not.  I'd agree with you.  The only solution is I mean, this genie is never going back in the bottle, not with newspapers crashing the way they are.  We all need to earn a living somehow.  So the experts in this field tend to be in demand for speaking, for television, for books, for newspaper, for blogs, for Leo's show.  I mean, they're the same people who are going to to recur.  So it's not going to change.  So it remains, I think, up to the readership to judge if this guy is credible or not, despite what appear to be conflicts.  I guess in the new age, that's the bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, because while today I can say, well, you write for the New York Times, so you have a higher standard, the truth is it's a level playing field.  It's an increasingly level playing field.  And why should anybody have a higher standard?  We should all have a high standard.  So I guess in the you're right.  The bottom line is we're all going to be faced with this.  You know, you can't ask a blogger not to get products for review.  They can't afford to buy these products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, in my case, Leo, I think the simple solution would be those three times a year when I have to review a product where I also have a book coming out that I let a substitute do it.  But you know what?  That would not change the haters.  No, I know.  One iota.  No, that I know also.  That would not satisfy Jason and Dvorak, those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David, I really appreciate your willingness to come on and talk.  I apologize for not having you on in the last two weeks, but the truth was I didn't know that this would come up as a conversation, certainly not to the degree that it did or I would have.  But I'm really glad you could come on today and talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, thanks for letting me speak my piece.  And you're right.  It's an interesting question.  It's a troublesome question.  It's only going to get worse.  It's only going to get worse.  And already it's been in place for, you know, 15 years, even before I came along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I grapple with this because I have to do ads.  You know, we can't support it.  We can't support it.  I wanted to support ourselves like Consumer Reports does with donations and we just couldn't.  There wasn't enough money in it.  So we have to do ads and that raises a huge conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I remember I was listening to your show one day and which is fantastic.  And thank you.  There was a go to my PC ad.  Right.  And you read the copy.  But then you threw in we use it all the time.  Right.  And I was wondering myself.  I know.  I know it's true.  But would you mention it every week if they weren't a sponsor?

Transcript:  No, absolutely not.  Those are ads that here's the and this is not necessarily effective.  But here's the line I've drawn.  We don't do ads for products I don't use.  Now in the tech sphere, I'm hoping I pray that sometime we'll be getting advertisers who aren't in the tech sphere.  Then it won't matter because it won't be cut products I cover.  I also recuse myself from coverage of those categories.  Fortunately, there's not really much of an issue in terms of Citrix or Audible or Drobo.  We don't have you know, one of our hosts was a wonderful guy.  I really adore him.  Frederick on our photography podcast and he was on Mac Break Weekly took a job with Drobo.  I immediately had to let him go or say you can't do the show anymore.  We try to only use journalists, not PR or marketing people on the show.  These are the lines I try to draw.  But it's a very you're right, David.  It's very difficult and increasingly with our hosts, it's impossible.  So I think you're right.  I think it's ultimately as with everything else, it's going to the burden is on the reader.  The truth is, it's always been on the reader.  It's just it's just now surfacing as as something more explicit.  Yeah.  David, thanks.  Thanks for letting me have the chance to express my side.
