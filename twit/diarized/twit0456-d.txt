Now what's interesting about this one and I know you just got it so you haven't played with it yet is this is the so-called Harmon Kardon edition.  It has the capability of playing back this high bit rate files the 192.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think this is interesting because you know Neil Young has made a lot of hay with his Pono player raised quite a bit of money on Kickstarter for basically the same idea.  A player that can play instead of the MP3s we're used to which really I mean I think everybody agrees there's you give up a certain amount when you do an MP3 but even there'll be uncompressed  black files but even recorded at higher bit rates.  The CD is 41 kilohertz.  What is it. 41 kilohertz by 16 bits sample resolution.  And you know I asked I asked Joe Walsh when he was on Ham Nation.  What do you record in.  And he says well 44 124 because I said what don't why don't you do it higher because it takes up too much disk space and nobody can hear the difference.  It's not true.  There is some debate over whether you can hear this.

Start time: 340.80
End time: 351.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can actually if you get into a double testing lab.  Can you tell the difference.  You can tell the difference.  Most people can actually.  And so it's theoretically down at Harmon.

Start time: 351.48
End time: 359.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think people can.  But I don't know.  I don't know if I can because I'm so old.  But theoretically this phone will do if you have good.  You'd have to have good headphones.

Start time: 359.40
End time: 361.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Like that's why we brought the JBL.  OK.

End time: 401.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean I'm convinced that this is the age of music entering basically like like wines.  You got fine wines and yeah there's like three dudes who can maybe taste the difference between this one and that one.  The rest of us you know can buy two buck Chuck and think it's great and not have any idea.  I think that's I'm pretty sure that's where we are with audio at this point.  It's golden years.

Start time: 402.20
End time: 421.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's funny Spotify inside the settings has a way to download higher bit rate and it does sound better to my ears.  But most people don't even three.  But most people don't even know that's there right.  And it'll be interesting to compare the Pono also.  T.H.X. has a new format that surrounds sound and audio that's sort of neat.  It'll be interesting to compare all these different.

Start time: 421.32
End time: 447.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Dolby and T.H.X. keep pushing surround sound headphone stuff and it just never gets picked up.  It'll be picked up by the video game people.  Right.  So Pono raised six million dollars.  They wanted eight hundred thousand.  They raised six six six million dollars.  Eighteen thousand people including me.  I bought one but it won't be out till September.  But Marquez you're literally the only guy with a cute enough you're young enough that you have a cute enough hearing that you could tell a difference.  Have you listened to any of this high quality stuff.

Start time: 448.74
End time: 457.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I rarely do.  I just have a lot of MP3s and a lot of WAV files.  I don't record any higher.  You see kids today.

End time: 477.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what I'm what I'm recording I'm uploading to the Web just to YouTube which compresses everything anyway.  So even if I did record and master at a way higher resolution you wouldn't really hear the difference on YouTube.

Start time: 477.68
End time: 482.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well it's the same thing for us.  We could shoot this at 1080p but why do you shoot at 720 or 1080.

Start time: 483.76
End time: 501.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I shoot a 2160p and you can get a higher YouTube will stream at a higher bit rate when you shoot in 4K so I can upload in 45 megabits per second rather than or export in 45 megabits per second rather than 10 which is the max for 1080p streaming.  So you shoot at 4K.

Start time: 503.10
End time: 510.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  Buster.  In theory YouTube shows 4K but it's the same thing.  You have to compress it so much I can't imagine it.

Start time: 511.00
End time: 515.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't have enough upload speed.  I mean they're all night uploading one video.

Start time: 516.58
End time: 532.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah and YouTube takes forever to process those files too because if I'm uploading a 1080p five minute video it'll be done processing in five minutes.  But if I upload this 4K video that's four gigs.  It takes YouTube like an hour to fully process to actually show that resolution.

Start time: 533.06
End time: 536.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.  Do not whatever you do go to the post.  Well you can't even go to the post office on Star Wars Day.  All the clerks are home watching the movies.  But what if you needed a stamp right.  Well stamps.com.  You could actually anytime 24 seven print out legal US  postage from for any kind of package or letter right from  your computer and your printer.  And then tomorrow the mail carrier comes to pick it up.  Take it away.  Stamps.com.  If you are eBay or Etsy seller.  If you if you're a business and you want to you know you  don't want to lick stamps and put them on the envelope.  The other day I got a an envelope.  85 cent postage to envelope from a company that wanted me  to review a product.  It's like that is a bad first impression that I have to pay  85 cents to review your product.  Don't be that guy.  Go to stamps.com.  You can buy and print official postage.  They'll fill out the forms for international.  For priority mail.  They'll automatically send an email to your recipient with  the tracking code.  The whole thing it makes it it's professional fulfillment.  For anybody's for any small business we use it all the time  here.  We have two accounts we use it so much.  You don't have to buy special ink.  You don't have to buy a postage meter whenever the postage  rate changes postage.  Me your companies will actually charge you money to update  their postage meter.  Not with stamps.com.  The postage rate is automatically updated.  You get a USB scale.  I tell you how you can do that.  So you always have exactly the right postage.  No more.  Not enough stamps or worse too many stamps.  You ever put too many stamps on to make sure it goes through.  You don't get a postage to you don't want to do that.  That's wasting money stamps.  Dot com.  You'll even save money because you'll get discounts you can't  get at the post office.  Visit stamps.com right now.  Before you do anything else click I want you to click that  microphone in the upper right hand corner and enter the  offer code TWIT.  And you'll get a $110 bonus offer.  You get that digital scale.  You get activities kit of stuff.  You get a postage free postage $55 worth of free postage that  you can use over the first few months of your subscription.

Click the microphone at the top of the home page and type in  twitstamps.com.  So F8 this year.  First of all they haven't had a Facebook developers conference  in three years.  Something like that.  It's a long time between conferences.  I think you look at Apple.  You look at Google.  And their developer conferences are big deals.  It really is an important thing to get developers in your  corner.  Facebook's obviously realized this.  Yeah, they bought Parse last year.  Well, that's one of the things they showed.  Yeah.  So first of all Mark Zuckerberg leads it off.  He looks great.  He's very much in command.  He's not the shy guy.  You've interviewed him many times.  He's almost 30.  He's grown up a lot.

Start time: 980.70
End time: 983.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's confident.  And he's worldly now.  He's a billionaire.

Start time: 983.86
End time: 1011.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, he's not only a billionaire.  He's got 1.2 billion customers.  Active customers.  That's an amazing thing.  So he did a couple of interesting things.  For a long time, Facebook's philosophy was kind of fail  fast, break things early, and fix them.  The hacker culture.  He said, while that served us well, we want to be a  platform now.  We want to be stable and consistent.  That's a big change for Facebook.

Start time: 1011.30
End time: 1022.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which means he's going to move slowly.  The days of some 20-year-old checking in some code without  having a committee check it over first is probably over.

Start time: 1023.30
End time: 1091.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It strikes me that what they're saying is that, well, I feel  like this has happened.  You guys tell me that Facebook realized, as Google has  realized and others have realized, that the monolithic  portal page that you go to and everything's there is dead.  That mobile is where it's happening now, right?  Yeah.  Google knew this all along, it seems, that all Google said is  look, we'll just do all these different things, some of which  you'll use, some of which you won't.  And we'll make sure that the information we gather about you  is shared across all those platforms.  We have basically an ad network.  And when you use Google Docs or Google Voice or G+, or Google  Mail or any of our services, you'll see consistent ads  across.  New Drive apps came out this week, right?  Yeah.  And I think Facebook might have realized this with the  acquisition of Instagram and then WhatsApp.  They don't need to fold those into Facebook.  In fact, it's better if they don't.  People want to use apps for specific purposes.  And then Facebook is now going to become the platform  underneath, the ad platform underneath.  And to do that, to get developers to use it, you  can't be changing every three minutes.  You can't have a 12-year-old filing code.

Start time: 1091.62
End time: 1122.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, one problem with apps is if you click a link on the  Facebook app to maybe a SoundCloud, for instance, it  takes you into the web page.  And they just announce it.  They just announced a protocol that'll take you to the  SoundCloud app.  Now, people aren't all that happy about some of these  moves because they really are, if you look at it simply,  they are taking over the app ecosystem.  They're taking over the web.  Well, the app ecosystem, which is the new web.  I read on my mobile phone far more than I read on a desktop  anymore.

Start time: 1123.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Zuckerberg promised two years consistency in the API  minimum.  So if there's an API call and you're, as a developer,  you're using it, you can be guaranteed it'll be good for  two years.  We're going to pay more attention to customers.  We're trying to build, he says, a stable mobile platform.  This seems to be a big change.

Start time: 1146.22
End time: 1163.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ad network is really the big thing.  And most people aren't going to get crazy passionate about  an ad network.  But the numbers will start showing up in the next  quarterly results.  And that's when we're going to see the effect of that new  network.  Most of the developers say it's really well done.

Transcript:  So I'll tell you what, man, that's all great for Facebook.  But as a consumer, there's only one thing I care about, and  that's the anonymous login.  And it's weird because on the one hand, I applaud that he  does it, but there's so much damned hypocrisy.  What was it?  He said, quote, I can sign in on my own terms.  Quote, we don't want anyone to ever be surprised about how  they're sharing on Facebook, which is a very magnanimous  statement from a man who built an empire by surprising  people about what they're sharing on Facebook.

Transcript:  Isn't Facebook's anonymous login completely cynical?  Because you're anonymous to the app developer, but you're  exactly not anonymous to Facebook.  What the value to Facebook is is to get you to use all these  different things and collect information about you across  all of these platforms.  There's a lot of ways to look at it as a cynic.

Start time: 1226.80

Transcript:  I didn't even think about this as being an insidious way to  go a second level deeper, where you not only tell people  that they're, man, that's dark, where it's like you increase  the likelihood of somebody using yours because you have  the word anonymous in there.  And then in fact, it's totally not anonymous, and they're  just collecting even more data.  That's horrific.

End time: 1312.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's absolutely not true in the stats.  The app developers I know say, man, a major proportion of  their people are using Facebook to sign in because it saves  you putting that damn username and password in for all these  stupid apps.  And their pitch to the developers was, if you put this  anonymous button in, more people will try your app  because they know that they won't give you any deep data.  And there is something to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 1343.64
End time: 1367.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  Based on talking to the developers in the audience,  they say, yeah, we like this because it's yet another way to  get people to sign into an app and try it without having to  type in your username and password.  And they know that they lose people on  username and password.  I know I do.  If I have to fill out a bunch of stuff when I first get an  app, sometimes I go and do something else.

Transcript:  But the difference on Rackspace is, first of all, it's  open source software.  It's an open stack.  And Rackspace is not collecting information on my  customers.  They're facilitating it.  Facebook's saying, hey, forget the Rackspace, the  Amazon Web Services, forget the Google Code.  We'll do all of that for you.  You'll be in our ecosystem.  It'll be a good thing.  And I think that's tempting.  I mean, I even think for us as potential app developers, we'd  be tempted by that because it's our customers.

But Microsoft is just not part of this world.  What was really interesting, too, was I didn't see any  Microsoft stuff on the Facebook stage.  But you didn't see any Apple stuff, did you?  Or Google stuff?  There was a lot of Apple talked about.

Transcript:  Robert, walk me through this.  Because if I'm an app developer, I understand the  benefits of buying into the Facebook ecosystem for ease  of acquisition of new members.  But it seems like an individual login and an email address  would be much more valuable if what I want to do is sell  stuff down the road.

Start time: 1488.69
End time: 1501.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be.  But when you log in with Facebook, first of all, your  users don't turn because it's one click.  And then if your users say yes, you get access to their  birthday, to their friend network, to all their likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I think that overall, the most interesting thing here,  and I have to give credit to Mike Elgin, our news director  and the host of TNT for first highlighting this for me, is  this notion that the monolithic web page is dead.  I think, in fact, I saw an article the other day that  agrees with me.  Not only are we in a post PC era, we're in a post tablet  era, we're in everything on the mobile phone era.  And so the web experience of the mobile phone is tough.  It's too small a screen.  Its apps are where it's at there.  We're in an era where, frankly, all of these big  companies are going to say, we don't need to have one  page, we need to have as many apps as possible.  And it could be our own apps, it could be through a  relationship with an app developer, but all of them  using either the Google ad platform or the Facebook ad  platform or the Microsoft ad platform or the  Yahoo ad platform.

Start time: 1580.36
End time: 1610.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's where Android's way ahead.  If you use some of the newer app launchers, the contextual  app launchers, they will actually pull in apps onto  your screen that you don't even have loaded yet.  And Apple just doesn't let developers do that.  And also the app ecosystem on Android is more connected.  I can actually deep link into your app, which I  can't do on iPhone.  And the fact that Facebook is now coming out with linking  for apps tells me that Apple is in a bad position here.  They really should open up.  I'm surprised Apple's going to allow that.

Start time: 1611.72
End time: 1620.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Doesn't Apple have the right to say, no, you cannot click  a link in an app and launch another app?  I'm shocked that Apple hasn't done it themselves, because

Start time: 1620.80
End time: 1634.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if Apple doesn't keep its app ecosystem up to date, people  will start switching.  And already 90% of the market's on Android, so it  doesn't take a whole lot more to get us off of this iPhone.

Transcript:  So Marcus Brownlee, I hate to keep using you as the young  person, but really your usage is what everybody cares about.  They don't care how Scoble or I or even Brian  Brushwood uses stuff.  They care about how people in your age cohort uses stuff.  What do you and your cohort, how do you use this stuff?  How aware are they, for instance, that this is even  going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a college student, just looking around at the way  people use apps and trying to, I guess, sign in to stuff,  it's obviously way easier to just sign in with your Facebook  account and never worry about it again.  There's also apps that use Google+.  And if you have Google+, I use that for SoundCloud.  Every time I set it up, it's just one click.  So that's easy.

I mean, I have certain classes where  it's sort of a vocal minority where everyone in the class  is concerned about it because it's a class about security  or a class about innovation policy or something where  we talk a lot about that stuff.  But outside of that, it seems like not a whole lot  of concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I'm curious about Snapchat in that regard.  Snapchat, which really did well out of the box  because that was the app that you could take a picture  and then say, and they can only look at it for 10 or 20  or 30 seconds.  And it just took over the world.  In fact, they turned down a $3 billion offer.  Was it from Google or Facebook?  I can't remember.  I think Google saying, no, we're going  to be worth more than that.  My daughter yesterday, she's sitting on the sofa.  She said, oh, Dad, Snapchat just updated.  I said, oh, really?  She said, yeah, they added phone calls and texting.  And so Snapchat clearly sees this as an opportunity.  I think that could be a mistake, though.  An application that gets too complicated.  One of the reasons Snapchat was so popular  is it was very straightforward.

Start time: 1741.82

Start time: 1762.72
End time: 1782.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen the reaction to the new.  Actually, I've seen one guy's reaction.  So when I first saw it, it came out.  All the coverage of it seemed to be very positive and glowing.  But my initial impression was, wow,  that's a lot more complicated than Snapchat  was when it started out.  So I wonder, are people even going to try to use this a lot?  Or are they just going to keep using it the same way  they used it before?

And if they happen to stumble upon another thing  they kind of like, then, oh, hey, that's a bonus.  I'll start using that more too.  But I didn't really get any walkthrough or instructions  of, hey, this is the new feature you just got.  The video is really cool.

Transcript:  I mean, first of all, it seems to me like the Facebook angle  is they obviously are sitting on a mountain of cash  and goodwill.  However, they got there on a very fickle market.  All of Facebook was based on the fact  that at the flip of a switch, all the cool kids ran over  to Facebook away from MySpace.  And it seems like now that they've got the cash,  they're diversifying and buying stuff  with massive potential, the Oculus Rift purchase  and Instagram and so on.  And it makes sense for them to do this.  But it makes me think of seeing the brakes on Twitter's growth,  which is really shocking to me.

And it was over in your stories and stuff like that to see it.  But I mean, it's interesting.  I think that I saved something from maybe Scott Johnson.  Did I?  No.  So what you could do is when someone sends you something  that you like or I can hear.  Let me go test something.  So send something to Wes Wilson.  How about that?  And I'm just going to say, hey.  I already lost me.  I don't even.  And you send it.  You can tap on it and see how it's bold now.  Now, if I move away, it's going to save that.

But we will provide the platform across which you can interact.  You can be in an ecosystem where people are going to use you.  Because really, these app guys, they don't mind.

I was already a conscientious objector to Google, but I'm very active online.  Strike two.  Yeah.  Uh, I'm not fearful of that technology.  It was really an experimental thing.  What would it look to try to do it?  What would it look like to do it without walking away from Facebook or Twitter?  So the first thing they said is, okay, we're expecting, but don't tell any,  don't put it on, don't mention it on social media.  She told her friends, don't tweet it.  She said, we don't put it online.  We're doing an experiment.  Then she said, whenever we searched for anything baby related, we did it on tour.  So the privacy network, so nobody would know that it was her searching.  Yeah.  And then when they bought something, they created a fake email account on Amazon.  And when they would buy something, they'd have it delivered to an Amazon  locker in Manhattan, so they didn't have her home address.

They knew exactly.  They kept, they followed him.  We moved three times.  They followed him.  He kept getting all those mails.  That that's what they do.

Yeah.  And as we've said on the show before, it's like, you know, you exist as a  feedback loop, you know, who you are is what you do determines who you are.  And if you think about it, the ability to know your past actions as a predictor  of what you're about to do is really just the concept of reputation.  As much as people get misty eyed and talk about, oh, why can't it be like it used  to be when we'd all we're in small towns and everybody knew who everyone was.  Guess what?  We're coming back to those days and it's because of technology and the internet.  I don't know that it's terrible.  I've been driving my car around.  I bought a car like what?  Like seven years ago and and it's getting old and I've been thinking about buying a  new one.  Sure enough, I don't know where CarMax sends me an email saying like, hey, man,  we bet your car is getting kind of old.  You've maybe thought about buying a new one.  And it's like, I don't know that that's terrible.  That is exactly as evil as thinking to call someone on their birthday and say you  really value their friendship.  You know what I mean?

Transcript:  Here's what I think it is.  And go ahead, you know, pencil me as being off the deep end on this.  But I think there's a deep seated cultural desire for us to not believe that with all  apologies to Padre S.J., that the Catholics were right, that there really are an all  seeing eye that knows all the filthy, dirty things that we do to ourselves when nobody's  looking. That has been throughout all of human history.  It's been a tool used by all religions in order to enforce people to be good.  And now it's a reality.  It's a it's a fact that that if not, you woke up, you do the actual deed.  We saw all the bits that led up to it.  And we're pretty sure.  You know, it's like, well, we're looking at your credit card bill.  You sure did go to the liquor store 12 times last month.  So I think you got a problem, you know, that kind of thing.  It's we don't want to believe that we reject that idea.  We want to believe we're captains of our own lives.  And to to know that, number one, our behaviors are predictable, that they're that they're  so predictable that large corporations will bank money on the fact that it's like,  well, he's done ABC and he's definitely into death.

Well, that's why I will say it's fascinating to me.  Like when I wanted to surprise my wife on her 40th with a ski vacation, I had to do  everything in incognito mode because I knew if I just searched one thing, ski  equipment, Utah or whatever, then every ad was going to be like, hey, man, you're  going on a ski vacation in Utah.

And I just kept coming back to that because I kept sharing that link with  people. And soon enough, Amazon starts asking me like once a week, hey, here's a bunch  of paper shredders. I figured you were interested in buying a paper shredder because I  visited that link one or two times making that video.  So I feel like everyone who visited the link after watching that video probably got an  email about, hey, here's 12 paper shredders you might want to check out.

You can create individual accounts.  You can create pseudonyms. You could you.  You can go through all the steps of of informational hygiene that it takes in order to protect your information.  And all this story shows is, yes, it's a big pain in the butt for very little benefit.  And we all agree. Yes, that's the case.  In which case, but the fact that we still absolutely from beginning to end control, all of this tells me that I'm with you, Leo.  I don't see that as a big deal.  Certainly, if it's any kind of government entity, I get very, very uppity.

We were on the tarmac and Tripit says your plane's being canceled.  Buy another ticket out of town.  I click on the ticket.  I buy one. There was only three seats on the next plane.  And then two minutes later, the pilot comes on and says, we're going back to the gate.  And so I'm in an all in world where I'm going to use all this stuff and I'm going to give it as much data as possible to help my life be better.

Start time: 3021.12

Transcript:  Facebook does that right now, right?  It knows your Facebook who's near nearby.  And that's a new feature.  But they have to tread so carefully because people are so I guess what I'm what I'm saying is, look, you have the right to privacy and I'm not denying your right to privacy.  And if you don't like it, you shouldn't use these services.  That's fine. I'm not going to say anything against that.  That's completely within your power.  But what I don't want people to do, people who have this fear of technology and this kind of moral panic, is to keep the rest of us from using things like Google now or face recognition in glass, because those would be phenomenally useful.  And if we don't feel like there's an issue with it now, I guess you can't use face recognition because you don't have the agreement of the person you're recognizing.  You can use eye beacons because I'd have to obviously turn it on on my phone.  Yep.  So I understand that.

They are trying to addict you.  That's what they're trying to do.  That's the real downside is addiction, which you guys didn't mention in the chat room.  And they're very good at it.  They want to put things in front of you that you are going to click like on or share or comment on or share with your friends.  And they're going to try to get rid of the noise.  And therefore, you're going to get addicted to this stuff.  And addiction does have deep, deep implications for us.

Transcript:  Let me let me pivot this just a little bit and ask a question specifically to Marquez, because what we're talking about in general is the emergence of persistent reputations in our online interactions.  That's what seems to disturb a lot of people.  And we see this trend where in the early days of the Internet in the late 90s, everyone could say anything.  You could post anything.  And you didn't worry about it ever coming back to bite you in the butt.  But we've seen bit by bit that window closing.  And most recently over the last year, we saw a shift in the way YouTube handled their comments because YouTube comments used to be I used to ask people, which would you rather do get paper cuts on your eyeballs or read YouTube comments?  And universally, everyone's blind because they have so many paper cuts on their eyes.  But then the switch to Google Plus as as as clumsily as that was handled and as much of a backlash as there was, how have you seen things change in the comments on your YouTube videos?  Do you find it to be more civil now that more people are using their actual name or if not, they have a persistent reputation to account for?

Start time: 3206.71
End time: 3292.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so depends on where you look on YouTube.  Right. So obviously, there's I do tech videos.  I'm like reviewing products, so 80 percent of the comments are pretty civilized for the most part.  So I didn't I didn't necessarily see a big change in the way people commented on my videos.  The worst thing that would happen on my videos is people like screaming fanboy like the typical reviewer comments that you would see on like a tech website where, hey, I thought this was bias, blah, blah, blah.  But, you know, don't pay attention to my username.  But then there's the the other side of YouTube, not the other side, but there's plenty of other niches in YouTube like comedy videos, for example, like people who leave comments like, oh, this isn't funny at all, or I just hated this so much.  And they would just hide behind a sort of an anonymous username.  And the people who did that got really mad about YouTube or Google Plus comments now requiring you to use your name.  And that's that's something that bothered a lot of people.  But inevitably, it's just it's just what kind of stuff do you want to be tied to your name?  What kind of stuff do you not care about being tied to your name?  So a lot of the stuff, like I said, on my my comments on my videos, not a big problem, not a big change.  Engagement didn't really spike or decrease or anything like that.  But I feel like on other parts of YouTube where people will be more tempted to leave more ridiculous comments or comments they wouldn't want to be associated with themselves.  They saw differences in maybe comedy videos or other genres that I'm not really as well.

Start time: 3292.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's interesting is I I know I read an article recently about the plight of girl gamers who get a lot of sexist,  hateful comments in their in their inbox after gaming sessions for Call of Duty or whatever.  And it makes me wonder, like, what kind of comments are the ones that that number one would be legitimate,  helpful comments that number two, you wouldn't want associated with your name?  How often does that happen? Can you think of an example of that?

Start time: 3318.54
End time: 3348.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just in the tech videos, I see people who are like, you know, trying to half of them are people who are not making videos and they don't want people to know that they're just bashing on everything that they hate.  So they can just feel free to lash out at anyone they want, take out any any any negative thoughts they want to have and just put them wherever they want.  No one will know it's them. So if you don't have that anonymity, then you're not going to do that anymore.  You don't want that tied to your name forever because that's your Google account and can't like hide that.

And in this country, it's a lot safer than it is in a lot of other countries.  So I understand there's a need for anonymity.  But, boy, the Internet, the Internet comments, chat rooms, places like that, we allow people to use handles and chat rooms in our chat room.  I don't know, maybe you think if we made them use their real name, that we'd have fewer troll problems.

We do tweet because we are interested in talking about this stuff because we want to give people this information.  We feel very strongly.  The real truth about it is it's ad supported because that seemed to be the best way to make it available to the widest possible audience.  Doesn't. But if you say and it isn't exactly untrue to say, well, if you didn't pay for it, you're the product.  No, that's true. The reason we can make money.  It's doing ads is because people watch.  So your attention is of value to us.  But it's not the only reason we do this.  It's not of right. And so that implies that if you don't have the good content, nobody watches.  You don't have advertising. Mark Zuckerberg did Facebook because he just wanted to use people and make money off of them.  Or we do tweet just because we want to use people and make money.  And that's not the reason we do.  And I'm going to give Mark some credit and assume that's not the reason he does Facebook.  So it's a very I don't like that.  I mean, I've said it and I've used it, but I don't like that idea because I think it's oversimplifying the truth of it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree with this.  And this is the problem that we have with with Robert Barron's of all varieties is that it's easy to overstate like, well, they're getting rich, therefore they must be screwing us in some way.  But in every single case, the way they're getting rich is by offering something cheaper, faster, better.  That is of value to so many people that they that they make it happen.  And even now, it's a very good point, actually.  I mean, that's that's I mean, to be honest, that's that's part of the reason that we resent them is because they look they make it look so easy or whatever.  But I suspect that that what is happening in general is only empowering more individuals.  And yes, it is weird to watch somebody profit obscenely.  And I think it's fine to say an obscene amount of money, as I understand money for it, for for what what seems like it should be obvious.  But all the greatest, all the most important discoveries always seem obvious in retrospect.  And they always seem like, well, why did that person deserve to make all that money?  Because it turns out that there is a value to limiting interactions to only one hundred and forty characters.  And for that, Twitter deserved to make a bajillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, they're not making as bajillion dollars as they used to.  Oh, my gosh. Yeah, no, we should talk about this.  In fact, we just made more money on Twitter than Twitter did in the same amount of time.  Just want to point that out.  If you actually wouldn't that be a great thing?  Who makes the most money, Twitter or twit?  Twitter makes very little money, right?  Because they lost money last quarter.  Yeah. Oh, although, you know, I'm watching what was I watch?  What were you watching?  Oh, Jimmy Fallon late.  It's not late night anymore.  The Tonight Show. And they use Twitter very effectively.  They use hashtags. They they do it like crazy.  And I imagine that that's good for their ratings, that there is promotion.  You know, he had a lip sync contest with Emma Stone.  And I saw a lot of social media action around it.  Lots of views on YouTube, lots of tweets about it.  That's probably good for their ratings, I would guess, and certainly makes it a more  valuable show. But Twitter is not seeming to see too much about it.  And as a result, the Twitter stock is sinking.  You know, I don't know if stock the stock market is a way to judge a company.

I know businesses because, you know, nowadays businesses are spread all out.  Teams are in different locations.  Clients and even colleagues are, you know, across the globe.  Go to meeting, let's you stay together, stay in touch.  And I, you know, we're still humans face to face is still number one.  You've got to see somebody face to face.  Go to meeting started by allowing you to share your screen  so you could stay on the same page, literally see the documents,  collaborate in the documents, you know, give you a PowerPoint.  But any of this HD faces now, this makes it like really like you're in person.  And I know teams who are distributed all over the world  who keep go to meeting running all day because you pay one low flat  monthly rate for as long as you want, for as many meetings as you want.  So just keep it on all day.  And they're working together. They're collaborating.  It's great. Any time we do a conference call.  Sure, we could just do the conference bridge.  But I use go to meeting in case we want to turn on the video or we want to show a document.  It's just it's really helpful to have go to meeting with HD faces from Citrix.  It is the powerfully simple way to meet in person online, anywhere,  anytime to brainstorm, to develop quality ideas, to solve, to cut the Gordian  not to just solve problems.  When you when you get elected to lieutenant governor,  I want you to bring this to the state house and say, everybody, tell the assembly  we got to meet online, start your free 30 day trial of go to meeting today.  Visit go to meeting dot com, click the try it free button.  Use a promo code tweet, go to meeting dot com promo code tweet.  I hope politicians start making this a place to come for your campaign.  You could come on here, you could talk.  I think that's great.  We have a candidate for California State Lieutenant Governor in studios.  We could tell because he's well dressed and the rest of you look like slobs.  No, you all look good.  But I think that's cool. I think that's cool.  I wonder, do you think I think politicians need to use social media,  Facebook and Twitter effectively?  Don't you think that's important?  Now, Robert, you're looking at your Facebook.

It has a faster processor.  But according to benchmarks, it's got a way slow hard drive.  So I don't know if Apple's trying to save money by putting a much slower  SSD in there, but it's like one.  It was one third as fast as last year's 11 inch MacBook here for unzipping files.  That's painful. That's not good.  So just a word of warning.

That's a one to one program.  So everybody going to the school gets a laptop.  They they use Lenovo.  There's Lenovo for education.  Windows laptops are giving kids.  They're not going to Chromebook.  That just hurt me.  Well, you know, it seems like Chromebook is the right thing to do.  Yeah.

You know, we've talked about the movement to doing everything in the cloud.  Seems dumb because what happens when there's no cloud like those days are gone.  There's never going to be a day where there's no cloud.  It's like like having no cloud in 10 years will be as weird as the power going out.  You remember, do you remember just like 30 years ago?

Transcript:  Delightful, singing fool David Pogue.  This is actually a little bit of an old story.  We talked about it last week on Twitter, but I certainly don't mind bringing it up again  because it ain't over till the fat commissioner sings.  Tom Wheeler, who is, you know.  Tame lobbyist for the National Cable Television Association, former president there,  and the wireless industry is in both halls of fame.  So he really he really gets around.  He's also, oddly enough, the chairman of the government group  that's supposed to regulate these industries.  I don't know how that could possibly that doesn't seems like that would be a problem.  He's the chairman of the FCC and he's proposed new FCC rules,  none of which we have seen.  Denise Howell pointed this out last week, and apparently they still have.  We still have not seen these.  The commissioners will be voting.  I think next week on these and then they'll be up for comment saying,  hey, you know what, this whole open Internet thing is nice.  But the Telecommunications Act doesn't really allow us to do that.  So here's what we're going to do.  We since we can't since the law says we can't regulate this, we're going to stop.  And if you are a Internet service provider and you want to charge  an edge provider like Twitter or YouTube or Netscape to get to your customers,  you go right ahead and do that.  Now, of course, that's really in violation of everything we hold near and dear.  And as Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts tweeted, she said,  I don't think we know what the next big thing is going to be in the United States.  But one thing we can be pretty sure of, it's going to be online.  And that startup isn't going to have the kind of money that a YouTube or it gives  it gives companies like Netflix and YouTube the power to pull up the ladder.

Transcript:  But before you say your thing, and I'm going to let you,  I will give you something you can do about it.  The FCC has opened a mailbox for comment.  Open Internet at FCC dot gov.  So whether you love this or you hate it, you can let them know how you feel about it.  You know how I feel about it. Go ahead, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brushwood. Well, I am very conflicted over this whole thing.  And I honestly don't know.  I'm going to I'm going to play the dumb card on this, because on the one hand,  you know, we're hearing so many of the right words come out of Wheeler.  That's his name, right? Wheeler's mouth talking about the importance of competition  and of doubling down, making sure everyone has access.  These are all things that we want to hear.  But then in the same breath, he's like, also, we should have a fast lane  available for people who feel like paying with it, which which makes me cringe.  But then I think about the whole breakdown of the peering agreements with Netflix.  Netflix in peak hours takes up a third of all Internet traffic.  Netflix wants to work out a deal.

Start time: 4434.88
End time: 4505.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I understand your concern and this you're confusing two issues.  Right. So Netflix pays currently for peering.  And this is not what we're talking about.  That's different.  So Netflix and there is a big argument there.  God knows Netflix is not happy.  In fact, Verizon is now saying, by the way, you can give us some money, too.  But you could make the argument they are using a lot of bandwidth.  So maybe they should be paying for peering because it's not a symmetric relationship.  It's not worth talking about.  What Wheeler's proposed rules would do is let edge providers.  It means everybody who provides content, Twit, you, Brian, everybody.  Can now pay for improved access.  That's a different thing.  That's not a peering relationship.  That's just that means the cable companies and the and the phone companies  now why Titi's already doing it with what do they call it?  There they have they allow a company to pay them  so that it won't count against your bandwidth cap.  So that's the same thing.  So they're already doing it.  Comcast will absolutely do this if these rules go through.  That's different. That's them going to each edge provider, each content creator  and saying, oh, by the way, you have to pay us to now.

End time: 4524.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This surprises me that you're so universally against it as the stated goal.  I wouldn't preserve.  Well, well, because let's say let's say we didn't know that we were talking  about the Internet. If I said there's a thing and the guy  regulating the thing wants to regulate it to preserve competition  and wants to know that he's lying. No, no, no.

Transcript:  You're buying you're buying into Wheeler's.  You're buying into Wheeler's big lie.  The first thing he does is publish a blog post, say, pay no attention.  This is no change in rules.  No, no, no, no. It's all fine.  And enough people bought this.  I was shocked. Companies like CNET published articles saying, oh, it's OK.  But but it's not.  It is a very big change in rules.  So don't don't get fooled by the big lie.  And remember who pays Tom Wheeler? It ain't  it's not some two person startup.  It's a revolving door at the FCC and he will go right back to industry.  The current chairman of the National of the National Cable Television  Association is Michael Powell, the former chairman of the FCC.  It's a revolving door.  These guys are going to go right back in industry and they will be  very much rewarded for changing the rules.

We now are getting sports.  We we are now getting good enough news.  And so what's left?  And we're getting what they do. They raise content.  We're getting custom content, right?  House of Cards and Amazon has a series of shows, right?  That they paid for.  So we're getting custom content on the Internet.  We're getting the sports.  Cable companies are not stupid.

If you read the EFS stuff, they say stuff like, yes, it's important  that we have universal access and that everyone get in.  No, we're not crazy about the idea of government being the one  to make sure that that happens.

You believe that if there is true competition, and you're right, by the way,  if there's true competition among you, in other words,  if I had a choice of 10 internet service providers, this would all work out.  And you're right. But you don't, do you?  And who was it that set that up?  I mean, yes, the FCC created a duopoly.  At best, you have two choices in this country.  So there is no competition.  So the government created the problem to begin with.

Transcript:  I'm not going to say that Austin is representative of everyone,  but I will say that you have Google Fiber.  But that's what's funny is I don't.  I'm six miles outside of the Austin city limits,  which means I don't have Google Fiber.  And plus, also, Google Fiber isn't even installed.  But just the threat of Google Fiber caused AT&T to come in  and offer a gigabit service outside of Austin.  So they preemptively competed, which means I have, you know, AT&T U-verse.  I have, you know, clear. I have Time Warner cable.  I've got direct PC.  I can even use as many people do.  We're seeing a lot of people not cutting the cable cord,  but cutting their Internet cord as they instead use their mobile devices.  So I can use AT&T wireless.  And again, this is not ideal and it's not as fast as we'd like.  But the fact is, I have more choices than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's phone companies. If I want a DSL, there's also satellite.  You have more than one incumbent phone company.  Yes. Well, no, no, no.  I mean, what I'm saying is if what I want is data service, my total list.  And this is just off the top of my head.  Forgive me if it's not all inclusive.  We had clear here in Austin.  We have direct PC, which is the satellite.  We have AT&T wireless and of course, Verizon wireless.  All the wireless providers and their their pro their their plans are much,  much better now. Right now, we're on a shared 10 gigabyte plan for the family.  There's also two cable companies competing, one of the one of them fiber optic  that that this is what I'm on right now is the 300 megabit up and down.  And then on top of that, there's there's also for the fringes,  because there's a lot of rural areas outside.  They have individual radio based services as well.  So, again, none of this is ideal.  And sure, if I wanted if I could have more, I would have more.  What are the caps on the wireless that you have?  My wireless, like for AT&T, I just say out of curiosity,

Transcript:  Well, it's not as good as we'd like.  But if you came to me 20 years ago and told me this is the future,  I'd pee my pants, man.  I'd be you're talking to a guy who paid one hundred fifty dollars a month for for crappy  satellite service that I set up in my apartment on two cinder blocks  to just get this signal so I could get four times DSL.  I mean, the fact is, it's undisputable that it's getting better.  And yes, we all want to get better.

Transcript:  OK, so let's say that this goes through.  Do you think so?  You're not a much more typical situation here.  We have Comcast and we have DSL and the DSL will ride on AT&T's wires,  but it might be a third party.  The DSL is too slow unless you're within two kilometers of the central office.  So I have Comcast.  Do you think if this goes through, the Comcast will then give me tiered service?  Comcast will say you want the bronze plan.  You can have access to MySpace, Yahoo and Dig.  Or you can have the silver plan will give you access to YouTube and Vivo.

The mere fact that you can offer that knowing.  What would I do about it?  To be honest, it's not what you would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The answer is it's not about what you would do.  It's about what the entrepreneurial spirited competitor would do.

Let's say you're right that somebody is going to march in and and trench out  to my house and give me a high speed Internet.  And it ain't going to happen.  But let's say it's right.  This still doesn't solve your problem, Brian Brushwood, because you have to pay  Comcast and AT&T and Verizon for access to their customers.  Or you're going to be buffering.  Yeah. And you're not going to have a stream.  So you can I guess you can I don't believe I don't believe.

I believe it would be suicide because it would be suicide for anyone to do this.  The mere fact that you're afraid of this scenario, that not one person in the entire  world would vote for there, there's no vote.  It's too late. The FCC decides that there's no there's no precedent for it to go down  the way you're describing.  And I don't believe it's going to happen.  There is a precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, it would always be the case if market forces could operate freely in this case.  But we know they can't. They're highly it's this highly regulated.  These are monopolies. Yeah, they are government enfranchised monopolies.  So already you don't have a competitive situation.  You're very lucky. And I don't think you have a very, very competitive situation, even in Austin.

Start time: 5145.50
End time: 5185.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we'll see. Well, again, in general, my default position is always more competition,  100 percent across the board, even in my, you know, even my, you know,  swimming in soup situation here in Austin.  But but I guess I'm not as worried about it.  Warm. The mere fact that every time the subject brings up, everybody goes up in arms.  I love it, dude. Everybody pull out the pitchforks all the time, because that's really what concerns all these guys.  Not they're not where you think these guys are worried about government regulation.  These guys buy government officers all the time.  Isn't it? It's exactly it's like the last thing I want.  Is a entity that has a reputation for being easily to be easy, easy to buy off.

Start time: 5185.42
End time: 5226.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason we get up in arms is because this the system that we have as of today  brought us all sorts of innovation in this country and a whole lot of startups that are employing people.  And those startups happened because it was a fair playing field and everybody could afford the entry fee to it.  We were heading toward a world where if you have the money, you can pay for it.  But that means a small startup like Instagram when I met him was two people at a little picnic table.  And so is that startup going to have the same kind of access to the customer base they have today?  I don't know.

Start time: 5227.86
End time: 5230.70

Start time: 5231.20
End time: 5250.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they did. But but the rules are changing now.  And so that the to get access to the Verizon customers or to the Comcast customers, you have to pay.  That means a whole lot of little 19 year old run companies that are do not have the capital yet are going to be locked out.

Start time: 5252.18
End time: 5256.78

End time: 5375.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe maybe.  Yeah. Yeah, the real the real solution is, I think, for people for community Internet, for municipalities and so far.  But unfortunately, that's then what happens is the government comes in and prevent, you know, prevents that.  This has happened in many states.  They've gone through, I think, 30 of the 50 states because the telcos don't want competition from municipal Internet.  Yeah. And and prohibited.

Tell me you've read The Martian by Andy Weir.  No, I never even heard of it.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, I'm so excited.  I have a gift for you and for everyone else.  The last time I was this excited about a book was when it was Ready Player One by my buddy, Ernie Klein.  Somebody recommended they check out The Martian takes place.  First of all, it's exquisitely well acted by the guy who reads it.  It takes place on minor spoilers that you learn in the first few pages coming up.  The opening line is, you know, log, soul six.  I'm pretty much f'd.  And it's the log of a astronaut who's six days into their five month mission.  They're the second mission ever to Mars.  Six days into the five month mission, there's a storm that comes in.  That's so bad they have to scrub the mission.  In the shuffle of getting from point A to point B, the communications dish breaks off and stabs him and knocks him.  His readings show up as dead and depressurized.  They leave without him.  He wakes up and realizes that he is alone and marooned on Mars.  And all he's got is a few bits and pieces laying around.  He knows the next Mars mission is three years away, but he's only got five, you know, a year and a half worth of food.  And it's how he makes his way.  It's Robinson Caruso on Mars.  The voice is exquisite.  The story is so good.  I got my wife on it.  My wife is not a sci-fi nut, but she loved it.  And it was so exciting that we spent the last...  I walked in and she had it on speaker and she was clearly in the last hour.  I sat there in the dark in my bed, holding Bonnie's hand, excitedly listening to the climactic conclusion for a second time.  It's been forever since I've loved a book as much as I love The Martian.  Definitely, definitely, definitely try it.

I don't feel too bad.  I don't feel bad for Marissa. She's done all right.

Fifteen months.  CEO. Fifteen months.  One hundred nine million dollars.  I think Yahoo is doing better than anybody thinks.  Or that they're just hemorrhaging money to their executives.

End time: 5932.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was wearing the pebble and then the pebble steel.  But I switched back to the original pebble.  Oh, why? What's wrong with the steel?  I just don't like the design as much as I thought I would.  OK, I actually prefer the thinner polyurethane band.  It's just more versatile as a as a wearable, I guess, for what I do  instead of having a metal on my wrist all the time.

Start time: 5932.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I've been wearing the basis watch.  So basis doesn't have any of the pebble notification or calendar stuff.  It's just a health watch.  It has a heart rate monitor steps.  It syncs with the phone using low power Bluetooth, which is nice.  So it's a good health watch.  It seems like there's three categories.  There's the health watches like Fitbit flex, the basis.  There's the the notification, the extension of the phone watches like the pebble.  And then, of course, Galaxy Gear Fit does both.  So it's possible to combine the two.  And then what was the third category?  Seems like maybe we should have a watch that like as an independent

Start time: 5998.80
End time: 6019.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, right. Right here.  Keep in mind, like the thing is, if you receive, let's say,  a hundred notifications of any variety a day and let's say conservatively,  it takes you four or five seconds to pull out your phone and check or whatever.  You realize every single day you wear a pebble, that's what 500 seconds saved  by just glancing instead of pulling the phone out.  That's what five, ten minutes of free time.

Start time: 6019.76
End time: 6022.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's ugly ass now.  But this to me, I've said this before.  This is the Palm Pilot of the watch, the smartwatch. Right.  Right. I was a big pilot.  Yeah, exactly. The Newton came out and it was hilarious.  And then the Palm Pilot said, let's do less and do it better.  And and and it took off.  And I look forward to what's up.  What's funny, though, is I love wearing it.  I love my pebble.  Every time we shoot Scam School, I take it off and put it in my pocket  because I'm so aware of how hilarious it's going to look three or four years from now.

End time: 6103.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't usually wear my watch when I'm like working out or practice or anything.  But I when I have the pebble on, like in class, it's for the same reason as Brian said,  because I can just glance instead of pulling my phone in my pocket,  which teachers apparently hate, by the way.  So if you're if you're just, I guess, glancing at your watch might still.  That's insulting.  If you're a teacher, it looks like you're going, when is this class going to be over?  Yeah, just waiting, begging for the class to end.  But I feel like it's it's a quicker glance and I can not take as many seconds  of attention away from whatever the class is about.  So just as a student, I guess, I'm a fan of the pebble and the notifications.

Start time: 6103.12
End time: 6116.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one reason I never took to the pebble, because when I'm when I'm sitting  at anywhere, my phone's right in front of me and on my car,  I have a dashboard mount for my phone.  So I don't need the glance ability that much.

Start time: 6118.26
End time: 6120.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6120.42

End time: 6156.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, wow. It should be light.  It should not be because I don't know, I'm not a fashion designer.  I just think I just think the design of it is going to be extremely important.  Yes. For it. The way it looks, the way it feels.

Start time: 6156.20
End time: 6170.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it's too early for them to try to get away with any kind of design  that looks svelte or thin or try to sell us on it.  I say own the thickness, own the blockiness for now,  which I feel like like Apple would be able to do.

Start time: 6194.74
End time: 6219.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just have a couple of concerns about the display and the battery life.  Those two things, just because it's obviously not that big.  So it's going to have an LCD display that should be bright enough to the outdoors.  But also, if it's a watch, it's always on.  So you're just glancing at the time.  So is it an always on, very bright LCD,  in which case you're burning your battery constantly and have a really short life?  Or does it have a huge battery?  I don't know how that's going to work. So I'm curious.

Start time: 6219.26
End time: 6225.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is that is the one thing that I really adore about the Pebble  is the fact that I really do only charge it like once a week, basically.

And so he hinted at this. Mm hmm.  But we now know because they've announced it, this is not a guess.  Right. Right.  Rick Osterloh was taken over for him is an interesting fellow.  Actually, I like him a lot.  He was the guy who designed blur.  Motor Motorola blur, which is was among the worst of the carrier  improvements on Android.  And I said, Rick, I'm sorry, that's a terrible thing.  Why did you do that?  He said we had to because Android in the version two  was so godawful that nobody would have bought it.  We had to clean it up a little bit.  But he says now and that's when Motorola X came out, he said, now  we don't need to. It's a beautiful UI and great OS.  And we don't have to modify it.  I think the Moto 360 is my but this is a notification watch.  It's not a health watch.  Yeah. And it sounds like you don't have any interest in health watch.

Start time: 6309.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6392.14
End time: 6400.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You don't think that's so obvious.  See, for a long time, I thought this is a scam.  This is a fake. They're never going to release it on.  Yeah, it's a real phone. It works in the flesh.

Start time: 6400.36
End time: 6424.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a living, breathing, science and I turned it off.  Science and mod phone.  And of course, I'm I like stock Android so much.  So I'm a fan of the OS here, the interface.  The camera is very impressive.  And the price is the most impressive part of it.  So I think was that what they're going to.  This is the 16 gig, so it's 300 300.  And then the 64 gig is in black and that'll be 350.

Start time: 6426.88
End time: 6437.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So so here's so this is the reason I thought it was a scam.  First of all, one plus one, O.P.O.  And these guys came from OPPO.  So I thought it's really an OPPO phone, isn't it?

Start time: 6438.72
End time: 6447.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I see a lot of the resemblance.  I see a lot of the the same language.  I have the fine seven and next to me, too, and it's very similar.

Start time: 6447.36
End time: 6450.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hold it up, though. It looks pretty it looks very thin.  Let me see the one.

Start time: 6451.40
End time: 6465.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It might even be the same panel.  Yeah, five point five inch 1080p display.  It's a nice, it's got the silver trim around it.  I guess I prefer this design a little bit more.  The back of the camera actually looks almost the exact same as the fine seven.  And in fact.

Start time: 6468.48
End time: 6472.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How can they sell this phone for 350 bucks, though?  This is possible.

Start time: 6473.34
End time: 6476.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the question.  Yeah, costs on these things are coming way down.

Start time: 6476.54
End time: 6480.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and they'll give it to you for a buck if you smash your phone.  Did you see that? What do you think of that one?

Start time: 6481.28
End time: 6505.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That I'm glad they turned back on that.  So they did offering.  Yeah, yeah, they they got a clue that that wasn't the best idea.  So they were offering this this contest, I guess, where they would.  You submit your phone and your idea for smashing it,  and they would take 100 people and then you smash your smash your phone.  You're right here. You want to get that?  No, just get every day.  There's a traffic jam at like this exact hour.  And people still beeping their horn.

Start time: 6505.78
End time: 6509.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 6509.58
End time: 6517.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they turned back on it.  And now they're allowing the 100 winners that they did select  to donate their phone instead of smashing.  Is a good idea.

Start time: 6517.88
End time: 6518.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it wasn't 100 phones.

Start time: 6529.38
End time: 6557.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's right. These will be 100 phones.  It'll be a and they really wanted you to take a video, one take  of you smashing it, demonstrating not only that it was smashed,  but that it can no longer turn on.  So you have to turn it on, show it, hit it with a hammer,  show it again that it's not turning on now.  Seems like a lot.  I'm just searching my inbox to see if I got anything from them.  I guess not.  So I guess I guess I'm going to have to wait.  Do you feel like this phone is ready?  Is it buggy or is it reliable? Is it?

Start time: 6559.66
End time: 6578.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this one I have here is like super alpha.  It doesn't actually have volume buttons, but they're sending me another one  that's like finished packaging, finished product.  But right now, from the software, it's fine.  I mean, it's a sign engine mod entirely.  It doesn't have any bugs or quirks once it's working.  So, I mean, I feel like it's awesome.

Start time: 6579.41
End time: 6582.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And you said you really like the camera.  Tell me about the camera. I do. I was impressed.

Start time: 6582.88
End time: 6611.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it has this new camera app from signage and mod.  Of course, you can you know how you can swipe in stock Android from the side.  So you swipe in a little bit and it says, OK, well, open the camera.  That's cool. It's it's the whole entire viewfinder, first of all.  So I like that.  It's really simple. It takes 4K video.  It takes 1080p takes slow mo HD video and 720p takes 13 megapixel photos, I believe.  And they look really good.  Sweet dynamic range better than your M8.

Start time: 6613.12
End time: 6619.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Definitely better than the M8. Yeah.  I mean, I know the M8 is only four megapixels.  I think it looks I like the pictures out of it.

Start time: 6619.36
End time: 6640.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Play Edition M8 doesn't take nearly as good pictures, unfortunately.  And I do like pixels, so I'm not a fan of it only being a four megapixel camera.  I like to zoom in and pixel peep.  I guess I'm not normal on that.  But when I'm looking at Galaxy S5 photos and iPhone 5S photos, I'm way more impressed.  So I think this is a lot closer to those cameras, which is impressive because it's so cheap.

Start time: 6651.64
End time: 6669.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. On my own phone, just because if I'm taking a landscape shot  and I'm literally comparing the quality of, you know, two different cameras.  I took the same picture on both of these cameras and I'm trying to compare which one looks better.  So I'm zooming in on the edge of something and I look at one and it's softer here and it's sharper here.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.

Start time: 6671.30
End time: 6683.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  All right. Well, I thought it was a scam, so it's not.  And it'll be out this summer.  And will it be it really will be three hundred and three hundred fifty bucks.  That's what they're saying.  That's now you're talking you're talking Nexus five's prices.

Start time: 6687.04
End time: 6722.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, the rumor, I don't know if this is true.  The rumor is that they're going to replace Nexus with the silver edition.  This sounds an awfully lot like what Microsoft did with their signature PCs,  which nobody made Vizio and made the idea of being  catch you people are crapping up our windows devices.  So we're going to sell a signature PC that's pure windows.  And none of the manufacturers bought bought it.  They said, no, we need to make money off our crap wear.  And it feels like the silver edition is kind of the same idea.  What do you think, Mark?

Start time: 6723.44
End time: 6750.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it reminds me of the Google Play Edition stuff.  Right. I'm not sure how it's different.  Originally, I saw no reason for it to exist at all.  And I'm still kind of, you know, I don't I'm not sure what benefit  it has to a company to have a Google Play Edition other than to be more  developer friendly and have that relationship with Google.  But when the Google Play Edition Galaxy S5 first came out, that blew my mind.  So it reminds me a lot of the same program.  And I'd be curious if that's an actual thing, not just a rumor.

Start time: 6751.54
End time: 6763.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't know.  And they may still make the Nexus.  Yeah. Phones which are made by Google to Google specs,  as opposed to say, I'm going to take the Galaxy S5 or the HTC one  and just make it a pure Android.

Start time: 6764.24
End time: 6790.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that's what I keep saying is the only reason or the main reason  the Nexus exists is to show that Google spec like they keep they move away  from things like the SD cards and they move away from capacitive buttons.  And if they were to use the Galaxy S5 as a Google Play Edition,  you still have the SD card and the physical home button  and all that stuff that you're trying to move away from.  So Nexus serves to move at least software and hardware  in the same direction Google wants.

Start time: 6790.30
End time: 6824.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and you could thank Nexus for the new M8.  They got rid of the you know, they got the capacitive buttons.  They've got on screen buttons.  And then, you know what? I was not a fan at first, and I actually think it's great.  This is I see where Google was going with this thing.  Hey, we're going to take a break. Come up with more in just a bit.  MKBHD is here.

There was a startup called Outbox seemed like a great idea.  A couple of guys, they said, what we're going to do is you fill out a forwarding  form at the mail at the post office and you forward all your mail to us.  Don't even have it delivered us to yourself.  Just forward to us.  We will scan it.  We will let you check boxes, say, deliver that, deliver that.  Don't deliver that.  Don't deliver that.  Seemed like a great idea.  They launched in Austin.  I don't know if you've seen this Outbox.  Have you seen it?

Everybody wants this.  Nobody wants snail mail unless they want it.  Right.  And so much of it is junk mail.  So they get called to meet with the postmaster general, uh, in the Washington DC.  They say, oh, this is exciting.  Maybe the post office wants to partner with us because it's a better way.  They go into the meeting and instead of just Patrick Donahue, the postmaster  general, there also is the general counsel of the United States postal  service and the chief of digital strategy.

He says the postal postmaster general, the guy in charge of the postal service says,  you mentioned making the service better for our customers, but you need to  understand the American citizens aren't our customers about 400 junk mailers.  That's our customers.  And your service hurts our ability to serve those customers by keeping that  junk mail out of people's mailbox.  You're putting us out of business.

They literally had trucks go to everybody's mailbox in Austin and San  Francisco, get the mail out of the mailbox.  You have to sign a long contract.  It says it's okay to do that and take it.

Transcript:  Hey, can I tell you guys about a brand new thing?  And I want to know if Marquez thinks this is going to work.  Uh, we launched a brand new series on scam school.  It's only the second, the second time we've launched something new on the channel.  But at some point, if you've ever watched scam school, every episode is very much  modeled on a television show.  Episodes are usually 10 to 15 minutes long, which in the YouTube world is  like Lawrence of Arabia.  We have a cold open, we have an intro sequence, we have an intro.  And then finally we get into people tend to just jump forward, like, just get to  the trick, just get to the trick.  And meanwhile, we have this back catalog of like 300 past episodes of scam school  with really good bar tricks and clever scams that you could pull on your friends.  So we decided to try launching something new called scam school remix.  And the entire episode, for example, the first episode we did, we just released  the entire episode is 75 seconds long.  And the idea is waste no time.

Start time: 7476.18
End time: 7478.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So 75 seconds, you will learn how to scam.

Start time: 7479.54
End time: 7489.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Less than that, because the second half of it is all follow up.  I think you learn the track here.  Watch this.  So you can see the trick right here.  Here we go.  Let me get a good grip here.  All right.  Hold on tight.

Start time: 7497.80
End time: 7504.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Stands what?  You're going to break your arm doing that.  Don't do that anymore.  That thing is like, no, it's all right.  As long as they're the one lifting.

Start time: 7505.42
End time: 7521.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you'll notice like in the second half, we're 45 seconds in and we're already in  the follow up and then the wrap up is the last 30 seconds or so.  So the idea is we've been like openly hostile to the things that make YouTube  successful.  So now we're trying to embrace it by shortening everything.  You got confused, Chad, didn't you?

Start time: 7522.28
End time: 7528.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Chad thought you were the video.  And the video was you.  You got confused.  I think you did.

Start time: 7529.40
End time: 7542.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That happens.  Marquez, here's my question to you.  Marquez, how important is brevity in the YouTube world these days?  But don't waste my time.  Get to the point.  Go, go, go.  Is that, is that a leading factor in how you design your videos?

Start time: 7543.26
End time: 7585.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not necessarily for me, but for YouTube in general, when you have a series going on  and when people are like finding a whole bunch of your stuff at the same time, it  does get important that that it's it's quick to get to the next point.  So if someone were to find my channel, for example, and want to just browse  cruise through 15 videos, my intro is seven seconds long at the beginning.  Then I get right into the content.  So I guess I do make a point to get right into things.  But like you were saying, with a 15 minute episode where you're kind of formatting  after TV, where it takes a while to get into what you're actually titling the  video, people might just skip over that.  And I guess it does make a lot of sense to just just head right into what you're  going to do if you have a title, a thumbnail and the first 10 seconds of the  video, you're already into it.  That's very satisfying to someone who clicked on it.

Start time: 7586.02
End time: 7600.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm really excited.  The idea is and this was my pitch to the folks over at Discovery was let's weaponize  previous videos, but let's make them viral gold by taking what was a 10 minute  episode of making it 90 seconds.  We'll see if that works out.

Start time: 7601.63

Transcript:  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah.  You can find Marcus, of course, on YouTube, MKBHD, youtube.com slash MKBHD.  Just the one channel.  You're not going to do an MKB4HD.  4K now.  Just this one.  Just the one channel.  That's it.  Right there.  It is awesome.  And Marques has actually showed that people on YouTube will watch longer  videos with more content.  And that encourages me.  I think that's really great.  You do great stuff.  It's good to have you on.  Appreciate it.  And your review of the one plus one is is right up there too.  Was that a Tesla?  Do you drive a Tesla too?  I did.
