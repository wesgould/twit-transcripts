Thanks so much for having me.  I am a big fan of many of your podcasts, including the Phileas Club, which is, I think, an ingenious  idea of finding people in various areas of the world, bringing them together to discuss  the news of the day for the world as well as news in their area, getting a lot of different  perspectives.  You just recorded one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 289.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wish I did.  I don't.  Everything, you know, my Engadget pretty much locks us in.  I'm not actually allowed to leave the house anymore.  I pretty much sit here typing constantly.

Start time: 289.76
End time: 293.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  Well, so you hear a noise in the background during the show today.  You'll understand why.

Start time: 302.28
End time: 305.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really, I just wanted to clear up what my right hand was doing.  That's a good idea.

Start time: 305.78
End time: 349.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't want this to go off the rails.  So as I am filling in for Leo Laporte, we will be talking about Twitter.  We'll be revealing someone's World of Warcraft name.  We'll be going on about Facebook.  Is there anything else I'm missing?  A three hour show.  It'll be a three hour show.  Yeah.  I'm trying to jump in as best I can.  There is a big story breaking today, though.  TechCrunch saying that the Verizon iPhone rumors are true.  In fact, they have sources and they go into a long description of supply chain evidentiary  trails that they followed that say CDMA chips are being ordered by Apple in numbers that  imply that they'll have a Verizon iPhone by January.

Start time: 349.76
End time: 354.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lather, rinse and repeat.  I've never heard this before.

Start time: 354.96
End time: 362.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one's ever claimed that Qualcomm is producing CDMA chips for Apple in the past three years  or so.  This rumor has never occurred.

Start time: 363.72
End time: 369.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now they're giving a time frame.  It's January.  They never did that before.  I've never heard a time frame before either.

Start time: 372.02
End time: 377.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the time frame always starts with J. It's either June or July of whatever year  you're in.

Start time: 378.57
End time: 379.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So January.

Start time: 381.61
End time: 385.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new part is actually January.  That's the year.

Start time: 388.70
End time: 395.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon CEO has also been signed on to do a keynote at CES.  Not that surprising, but everyone's trying to throw that into this rumor mix as well.

Start time: 395.90
End time: 457.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, actually, that is a little surprising.  So that's a first.  Why is that surprising?  Usually Steve Ballmer does the pre-show keynote and then Ford will do the later keynote as  part of the official show.  Or some other company that we actually don't pay that much attention to.  Verizon is new.  And I think what Verizon's going to do, my hunch is that they're going to do Android  tablets in conjunction with Google.  That's sort of the time frame we've been hearing for a long time.  Google, it's probably the only Android tablet you can really go out and buy in the States  right now is this off-brand, aug-in tablet at Kmart for $150 that's running infringing  Google apps.  And so that's sort of amazing.  That's sort of the Android tablet you can buy, not discounting the Arcos tablets, but  they're sort of harder to find in the States.  So I think the big push is going to be Google and Verizon coming on stage together at CS  and check out our new tablet strategy.  And that makes a lot of sense to me.  For Verizon to show up without Apple and be like, check out the new iPhone makes no sense.

Start time: 457.86
End time: 492.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to give credence to this rumor again, but I mean...  You have been predicting this for a while.  Yeah, we all know it's coming.  I mean, I think there's no question that Apple is eventually going to open up to other carriers.  What I find weird and surprising about this is my assumption has always been they won't  make a Verizon iPhone until it's LTE and that they weren't going to make a CDMA iPhone.  And that's the part of this that I still find a little bit implausible that they would be  at this point when Verizon has already started testing, very limited testing, but some testing  of LTE networks, right, in some areas, that they would be ordering large quantities of  this basically outdated technology.

Start time: 492.34
End time: 500.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The press release that says that Ivan Seidenberg will be delivering the keynote says he will  highlight the company's vision for its LTE 4G wireless technology.

Start time: 501.78
End time: 510.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it wouldn't surprise me if they said that's going to include iPhone.  But then that doesn't really work with this rumor.  Yeah, it just doesn't work with the Qualcomm CDMA chip.

Start time: 510.60
End time: 552.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they do have dual mode chips, right?  But that's like, those are bigger, they're more complicated, they're undoubtedly going  to involve more battery drain.  All of that seems like compromises to me.  And I don't think Apple is the sort of company that wants to get away from AT&T so badly  that they're going to make huge compromises on battery life and maybe even size to get  dual mode CDMA LTE.  I think they're more than happy to wait.  I mean, what do they have to lose?  They're selling their iPhone as fast as they can make them, right?  They keep saying it, we can't make them quickly enough.  And as soon as the white one comes on, whenever that is, I think they're going to sell even  more.  Is that thing seriously not out yet?  You still can't get the white one?  Still can't make it.  Walt Mossberg is the only person in America that has a white iPhone.

Start time: 553.12
End time: 561.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course he is.  Well, the best rumor I've seen as to why is they can't figure out how to stop light from  coming out of the back.  I'm just like, why don't you turn that into a feature?  It's the new glowing back.

Start time: 561.56
End time: 565.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got like a flashlight.  It's revolutionary.  It's like a warm, cozy nightlight.

Start time: 566.04
End time: 569.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just give it a name, like iLight.  The nightlight phone.

Start time: 569.99
End time: 571.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The iLight.  It's amazing.

Start time: 571.94
End time: 575.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No other phone can both make phone calls and keep you safe at night.

Start time: 575.90
End time: 579.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We think you're going to love it.  Or make you a target for snipers.

Start time: 579.66
End time: 582.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just gorgeous.

Start time: 584.28
End time: 596.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you pointed this out, Eli, because I didn't realize he was doing the  key keynotes.  So he's replacing Bomber.  I just thought he was doing one of the... because they have those later keynotes.  I don't think he's replacing... no, he's just one of the keynotes.

Start time: 597.54
End time: 607.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so Bomber does the pre-show keynote the day before CS officially starts.  He's still doing that.  Which is always a little stupid because we all go to that.  It's like CS already started for the press because Microsoft's doing it.

Start time: 608.87
End time: 621.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea what others are going to say this year.  They always have a passel of keynoters, right?  They do four.  They've usually got like Michael Dell or somebody like that.  So it's not totally surprising.  They used to have Palm.  These are the good old days.  No, Palm is a show.

Start time: 621.54
End time: 632.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Palm does an event.  Dell doesn't do anything anymore.  They do it offsite where they pull out a product that they're going to announce the next six  months.  And then Intel usually closes out the show with their huge keynote.

Start time: 633.14
End time: 638.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not that unusual that they would have somebody to basically replace the Dell package.  The Verizon's been a big deal.

Start time: 640.12
End time: 651.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is interesting to see Verizon come into that mix.  And I think the tablet theory that you put out there is right.  But this 4G LTE line in the press release adds a little fuel to the intrigue fire.  However...

Start time: 652.06
End time: 661.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've gotten rumors that they're launching test markets in 2011.  So that makes a lot of sense there.  Say, look, we're turning it on in Boise, Idaho, wherever tiny test markets they have.

Start time: 662.34
End time: 676.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even if they don't have the iPhone by then, they're going to hint at it because they want it.  The thing we do know is that Verizon wants the iPhone.  And they have said very publicly, we would love to have a Verizon iPhone.  It's just that Apple's been holding out.  And I think they're holding out for is LTE.

Start time: 678.06
End time: 693.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would seem very strange that Apple would go for the limited LTE network already.  It would seem a little bit too soon.  I don't know.  I would from the outside.  But about that CDMA chip, don't they already produce CDMA iPhones for other markets?

Start time: 694.96
End time: 710.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  GSM is the global standard.  There were those weird little tests where they were showing app data requests on a CDMA iPhone.  And that was part of it.  I think there's a possibility they've been testing it.

Start time: 711.40
End time: 716.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've most likely made a CDMA iPhone.  I'm sure they have.  But not a factory production model.

Start time: 717.69
End time: 727.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they really going to re-engineer it?  I don't know.  The dual chip is a possibility, I guess.  We'll see.  We'll have this rumor to kick around at least 20 times between now and CES.

Start time: 727.78
End time: 734.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no way Apple is going to allow Verizon to announce an iPhone at CES.  Yeah, because it's not happening.  I think that is 100% sure.

Start time: 735.44
End time: 736.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless Steve Jobs is also there.

Start time: 737.84
End time: 740.75

Start time: 742.05

Start time: 744.14
End time: 747.44

Start time: 747.44
End time: 753.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's just make that into your rumor right now.  The rumor that he is going to be there and then it will happen.

Start time: 754.14
End time: 766.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For months is that the white iPhone is the CDMA iPhone.  He's been working on it for months, just feeding it out to the white iPhone.  And we've seen it pop up here and there.

Start time: 766.98
End time: 770.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wait, Neelay, what you're saying is the white iPhone is the CDMA iPhone?

Start time: 771.00
End time: 771.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.

Start time: 772.24
End time: 776.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying, take that to the bank?  Totally Twitter that right now?

Start time: 777.42
End time: 780.27

Transcript:  Iceing on the cake.  While we're at it, Flash is coming to iPhone 4.

Start time: 789.93
End time: 793.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually, we're not making that up.  That's actually happening.  Yeah, I mean, sort of.

Start time: 793.60
End time: 800.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to jailbreak it and then you can install something called Frash, which is an  homage to Strongbad.

Start time: 801.46
End time: 801.60
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Totally!

Start time: 801.82
End time: 813.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  But yeah, so it's the best workaround to adding Flash to your iPad and iPhone.  As long as you're willing to jailbreak.  As long as you're willing to jailbreak.

Start time: 813.34
End time: 853.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, all right, well, let's get started.  So, Comax, the guy who developed it, says it's alpha quality, so you should buy or be  aware to run it.  It'll probably kill your battery really fast.  And again, to install it involves some steps.  But it's there.  We always knew the jailbreak guys would be the ones to do it.  There was never any doubt that they would be the ones to figure it out.  It's just funny because once that's out there, sort of the last big nerd objection to the  iPhone and not having Flash is sort of gone.  It's like, well, Adobe should have just put out a jailbreak version of Flash years ago.  This conversation would have been over if they had jailbreak on their phone.

Start time: 853.46
End time: 874.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the nerds, though, who have decided I'm just not doing that philosophically, they're  not going to be convinced by the fact.  I mean, I guess, sir, that you could say like, there's a moral high ground to be taken.  I hacked it and I'm running Flash on it or whatever.  But it's like, I think most of those nerds, including myself, have now just defected to  Android and are happily living over there with the Froyo and the Flash.  You know, you think you have it.

Start time: 875.18
End time: 880.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is it I was just using Flash on an Evo today.  I was actually really like impressive.  Yeah, it works.

Start time: 880.68
End time: 887.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to suggest, I mean, if you get an Evo, you already have Flash and the battery  problems pre-installed.  Exactly. You don't need to jailbreak it.

Start time: 888.72
End time: 900.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my question, actually.  Is now that we have all these fantastic Android phones with Flash, is it actually worth it?  Do you guys use it or is it like, OK, I can do it if I want, but I actually never do?

Start time: 901.64
End time: 932.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it sort of depends on what your use case is.  Like, it's nice to be able to stream one of these live shows, right?  Like there was one day when I was driving and I was like, oh, I can totally like start  streaming TNT and just have it listen, you know, have it playing on the phone on the  seat. Like I'm not watching it, but I can hear it or, you know, those  frequent cases where the phone honestly is the device that I'm using when I'm sitting  on the couch sort of just checking my email and surfing.  And it's nice if somebody has sent me a link to a video that I can watch without having  to kind of get up and go to a real computer.

Start time: 933.36
End time: 963.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Restaurant websites on the go.  There you go.  Being able to have Flash is like killer app for me.  Yep.  But, you know, it's like that I have a workaround because on the iPhone I have menu pages and  that works fine.  You know, it's like it's just one of those things where it's now that it's there, I  don't worry about it anymore.  And when I go back to the iPhone and I don't have it, you know, it's as irritating as it  ever was, which was actually not so irritating at all.  But it's it's nice to have.  It's one of those things where it's like, well, now I have it like, why is this why  have we made such a fuss about it?  Like, here it is.

Start time: 963.44
End time: 978.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, like on the iPad, I find the lack of Flash supremely noticeable and annoying.  I mean, really, to the point that I just like usually use my netbook instead.  I mean, I have to kind of come up with reasons now to use the iPad if it's if it's not  entertaining my child, which is honestly is its primary purpose.

Start time: 978.80
End time: 982.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the sites in particular that you're trying to get to that just fail?

Start time: 983.36
End time: 1018.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mainly, I am trying to watch video and then often those restaurant websites and then  often and then there are just sites with like Flash plus JavaScript, right.  That doesn't work really well.  Like I wanted to look up I was going to see Salt and I wanted to look on runp.com  and see like when would be the good opportunities.  You know, nothing doing.  And then add to that the fact that the Google Docs, you can't edit like a Word doc.  It's just kind of like, all right, this thing.  Run P is great.  That's not Flash though, is it?  Run P is awesome.  That's not a Flash thing.  That's a that's like an additional barrier, but it's kind of a Google problem.  I'm not blaming the iPad for it.

It's just that 90% of that same 90% is then being presented in a Flash player.  And so it is still wrapped in Flash, even though it might be encoded as an MOV or something  else.

Transcript:  Sorry for that digression.  But Mark Papermaster, who is the Apple executive in charge of hardware for the  iPhone, among other things, has left the company and all the good rumors say he  has been asked to leave the company.  And then of course the wilder rumors say he's gotten fired over the antenna gate  problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, of course that was the-  Is there any doubt that that's what it is somewhat?  He joined the company a year ago from IBM, right?  And the year afterwards, he's like, oh, I'm going away.  I want to take vacations.  It's obviously what it is.

They sued him and they sued Apple for violating his non-compete with IBM.  And eventually they settled and he got to come over.  So, I mean, his entire tenure at Apple has been controversial.  Right.  You know, he's leaving now.  It's like, well, who knows?  I mean, Bob Mansfield has been the iPhone engineering guy in their videos and their  promo materials the entire time.  You know, Papermaster was never around.  We never saw what he did.  The way that Apple publicly shows off its other executives, like Scott Forstall or  Johnny I, or Phil Schiller, Bob Mansfield has always been that guy.  So did he leave over the antenna?  Or is he just not very good on camera?  Right.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Or yeah.  Or was that like, he failed at that part of the job.  So that's why he's leaving.  They're like, Mark, you know, we've put you in front of the camera a few times now.  And it turns out you're just really unattractive and we're going to have to let you go.

Transcript:  According to John Gruber, though, the thing that makes you wonder if it's antenna  related is that according to John Gruber of Daring Fireball, who is basically, let's  be honest, the unofficial mouthpiece of Apple these days, he was known around Apple  as the antenna guy.  Like he was.  Was given at least internal credit for the being, quote, the guy responsible for the  antenna.  He was also then conspicuously absent from all the iPhone 4 promotional material.  He wasn't at the press conference, even though supposedly he was really, you know,  the hardware guy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which the press conference, you could say, oh, well, he's taking the fall.  They're not going to let him go to the press conference.  They're in the process of getting rid of him.  Right.  The videos, though, that was before any antenna gate had ever broken.  They filmed those long before.  Yeah.  So because they knew Gruber's trying to imply in that in that in that posting is  there may have been problems with him already.  He may not have been fitting in before.

Transcript:  And they said that from from the get go, actually, during the lawsuit when they were  you know, they're doing discovery and Apple's emails are being released about how  they hired him and all this stuff.  One of the emails was from Bob Mansfield.  And he said, paper master is incredibly smart.  He knows the field very well, but he is a long shot in every other way for this job.  And maybe that's just turned out to be true.  Maybe he was really smart about microprocessors and antenna design, but he didn't fit  the culture of Apple or he wasn't good at leading team.  We don't know why he left.  Or he was both right.

End time: 1412.73

Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I'll put it to you this way.  Johnny Ive now has led the design of many Apple products that have significant flaws  that the company has had to take PR hits for.  Right.  iPods that scratch really easily.  The G4 cube that cracked all over the place.  The magic mouse, which is the stoop or the mighty mouse, which is the dumbest  mouse ever designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the Apple lost class action lawsuit over the iPod Nano scratching too easily  and too much.  Right.  I mean, that's a flaw.  That's a major design decision that turned out to be a problem.  And then they can ask Johnny Ive to leave.  Right.  You know, I think that's why I think it was probably a combination of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely agree.  Yeah.  I think he could have gotten, they could have gotten rid of him over the antenna,  the antenna gate thing.  I think it was a lot more important and impactful for the company than the  scratching iPods and also Johnny Ive, the example which you're taking.  He is so, I would argue that he's a lot more important than Mr.  Papermaster's company at this point.  They couldn't, you know, we couldn't imagine them getting rid of Johnny Ive.  It would be almost like getting, he's the second most important person after  the dogs.  Well now.

Transcript:  Yeah, but he made them look really pretty.  He didn't like, he didn't manufacture the materials.  He made them look really pretty.  And I think that's mainly his charter to be honest.  Sometimes industrial design encompasses more than that, but you know,

He says, well, it's because I don't know if he says, but that side says she was  signed up for a contract that was canceled less than 30 days before it was supposed  to start, and that's normal terms for a contract is that you go ahead and get  paid if you cancel less than 30 days.  It's just a coincidence that it's this person.  So, you know, who do you believe?

So she says, well, I'll sue you for sexual harassment.  He calls the bluff.  She hires Gloria Allred, celebrity lawyer.  Gloria writes HP.  HP freaks out, right?  Because it's their CEO who's doubled their stock price since he's been the CEO.  They freak out.  They do their investigation.  They find that there's no sexual harassment because there's  consensual activity going on where she is.  Right.  This is consensual.  So, you know, the harassment lawsuit holds in the water, but heard it has been  essentially flying this contractor.  He hired around on HP's dime, you know, to just be friends.  And that's not okay.  Right.  Because he's the chief executive of the company, defrauding his company,  embezzling money from the company.

What I'm saying is I can't believe that they let him go over this considering  that he's doubled the stock price, considering that he actually brought  them out from under the shadow of the fury in a scandal, considering that,  you know, all that he really did to turn around this company, the fact that he  was then ousted over this, which I don't mean to suggest that it's minor, but  it's really, it seems fishy to me.

And they said there will be a lawsuit unless we settle this woman and you  leave, and I think that that's what drove it, that whoever this woman is said,  unless he leaves, there will be a lawsuit.  And the last thing HP needs right now is a sexual harassment, like high profile  scandal, sexual harassment lawsuit.  So he leaves, she gets paid.  And HP gets to say things like we're upping our guidance for the third quarter.  And I think that's that was just the very cold calculating move that they made.  They said, well, if you don't leave, she files and we don't want her to file.  So you have to go.  And that's what it sounds like to me.  And that's probably why he's so unhappy right now, because I don't think he  wanted to leave.  I think he's he probably said what all he said, which is I'll pay you back.  There's I mean, who cares what I do with a few thousand dollars?  Like I'm the CEO.  Like I can fly whoever I want.  Right.  And I, and check out my performance.

And she complains that people at HP were resistant to change.  And now he thinks Malone, the author thinks that herd kind of ran afoul of that  same culture.  And they're trying to reassert what's called the HP way.  And that is the sort of culture that was created by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard  back in the day.  And there's a lot of old timers still at HP who have momentum behind them.  And you see this happen at companies where the person in charge can fall to the  interests that are entrenched and almost like a meme, these sort of systems of  thinking that perpetuate themselves over the decades.

Transcript:  that if if herd defrauded HP by submitting bogus expense reports to cover up a  relationship or worse embezzled money by having the company fly his love interest  around on the company dime, he should be fired for cause and not get a dime of  severance.  Instead, he was let go with a package that is now costing HP shareholders $10  billion.  And so Ali is saying, you know, the board owes shareholders an explanation.

Start time: 2082.14
End time: 2100.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's 12 million in cash and then another like 30 to 40 million thereabouts  spending the stock price when things best in stock.  Right.  And then, oh, and then 18 months of health and dental just because we have to be  nice.  And then it's the stock price that fell.  Right.  Yeah.

Start time: 2100.50
End time: 2111.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what that's what it's saying is it's costing shareholders $10 billion total  once you add in all the severance and the stock price drop.  So you do have to wonder if it is that HP way thing, like what the hell are the  board?  What is the board doing?

Start time: 2111.52
End time: 2126.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why?  But so if you we put up the the 8K, the SEC 8K that explains the severance  agreement and the reason he's getting the cash payment is that he's agreed to not  sue HP in the future for wrongful termination.

Start time: 2126.30
End time: 2130.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he didn't agree not to grumble about them on the Internet.  Exactly.

Start time: 2130.92
End time: 2146.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's allowed to mutter as much as he likes, but that's why his name isn't  connected closely to any of these reports.  That's why it's sources familiar.  People briefed in the matter.  It's not Mark Hurd says I was fired for no reason.  H.  We made a wrong move.  I'm suing.  You know who a source familiar with the matter is Mark Hurd.

Start time: 2148.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, but again, you know, sure.  You know, it's it looks bad.  You know, I think my aggrieved headline on Engadget was HP CEO Mark Hurd rewarded  with $40 million severance package for harassing contractors or something.  You know, it's like it definitely feels wrong that he's being paid to leave after  defrauding his company.  But from HP's perspective, a lawsuit here would have been even worse.  Right.  Having the former CEO sue HP for termination.  That's bad.  And that's going to depress the stock price even further.  So, I mean, this really feels like HP is cutting its losses and just trying to move on.  There's like here's money.  So everybody happy.  Here's some money.  Please shut up.  Okay.  And like, that's what it sounds like to me.  Also, thank you.  I really want this.

Start time: 2195.56
End time: 2212.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would only work if he actually did it.  If he was actually very like he was clearly guilty of what he's being accused of.  So then him then coming in saying I did nothing wrong is sort of strange.  I'll say Molly, you won me over.  I think there's something fishy.  Something.  It's something else.

Transcript:  I think he did something wrong, but not as wrong as HP is making it out to be.  And so that's why you're getting the grumbling, not the outright protest, but the grumbling  of like, this is making me look worse than it should have, because I really didn't do  that.

Start time: 2229.00
End time: 2246.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my, my, my shady interpretation here is that she threatened a lawsuit and to erase  the possibility of the lawsuit and to get her to settle and be quiet.  They had to fire him and to get him to not sue them for wrongful termination after he  was fired.  He, they had to pay him a severance.

Start time: 2246.98
End time: 2274.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but do you really think that a multi-national company the size of HP can make her go away,  can settle out of court?  You know, I mean, I just don't.  I cannot imagine a world in which the lawsuit is that damaging, especially since now,  apparently now there's this breaking news.  Like she has come forward and said, you know, I'm really sorry that he got fired and we  didn't have sex or any other form of intimate relationship.  And I did not have sex with that CEO.

Transcript:  Yeah, I have a feeling that Tom may be right, that there was something.  And if that's true, if the board kind of used this as a reason, like the big stick to lever  him out of HP, then I sort of think that they have not done right by their shareholders  because it's cost them a lot of money.

Transcript:  So Saudi Arabia has come to an agreement with Blackberry over allowing the service to continue.  They were they were threatening to get rid of it to block the messenger service,  particularly of Blackberry in Saudi Arabia.  It was down for about four hours on Friday, then it came back up.  And now they say they've come to an agreement where Blackberry will run a server in Saudi Arabia,  or possibly provide some other kind of access.  The details are still sort of dribbling out.  But rim was really resistant to this, like right up to the day that Saudi Arabia said,  no, it started with the United Arab Emirates saying they were going to do the same thing  in October, then Saudi.  It's up to the deadline.

Start time: 2603.24
End time: 2610.94

End time: 2626.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but India put a deadline on it.  But then, you know, I will just say that the Indian infrastructure and the bureaucracy there  deadlines don't mean a lot.  So there was a deadline in a long time.

Start time: 2628.12
End time: 2658.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rim was like, oh, it's an Indian deadline.  Forget about it.  But the Saudi deadline became the worst because it came within a few days of Saudi Arabia  saying we need messenger service blocked unless we can get a tap.  Rim said, you know, it's encrypted end to end.  We don't have the keys.  We couldn't give you the data if you wanted.  Now it turns out, oh, I guess we can operate a server and I guess we can give you access.  What's really going on in this story?  What has rim said that is not exactly true and what isn't here?  Right.

End time: 2701.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's rim's IMDB profile?  How many episodes of Silk Stockings has rim been on?  It does sound like rim has caved a little bit.  One suspects and has suspected all along that the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been really saying  what we want is the ability to monitor traffic on these networks and that rim has said,  sorry, you know, our security is too good.  We're encrypted end to end and we're we store the data offshore and that's the deal.  But that they have maybe now said, you know, yeah, we want to remain the global  language of business, if you will.  And so, okay, we'll put some service in your country.

Start time: 2702.26
End time: 2735.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think rim was also gambling on the business community in these countries putting pressure  back and that's why they played it right up to the deadline because the folks who do business  in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, now Kuwait, Indonesia has made some,  or I think of a Singapore maybe has made some remarks that they are interested in having some  sort of situation like this.  The business users don't want these services blocked.  They don't want their email blocked.  They don't want their web blocked.  They don't want messenger blocked.  And it didn't work out that way.  So they kind of had their bluff called, it sounds like.  I think they did.

Start time: 2736.28
End time: 2796.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is a structural issue for rim, right?  This is the way BlackBerry's work is that you have a server that, you know, the authorities  can look at and say, well, all the traffic is going through that server.  We want access to that server.  And they can't say that to Google.  They can't say to Microsoft.  They can't say to Apple, right?  They can't say to Nokia because none of these countries run or companies rather run a single  server where every phone connects to it and all the traffic is routed through this network  of servers.  That's, I mean, that is both the strength and the weakness of the BlackBerry design,  where you have the BBM server, where you have the BIS server for the consumers.  And, you know, then you have the enterprise servers that are businesses.  Well, when you have a micro all Microsoft system, every business has its own exchange  server.  And so it's harder for the UAE or Indonesia to say we need access to all of these servers.  But with rim, they can say we want access to your central BIS server for all your consumers.  And we want access to the BBM server.  Well, and it's good that rim.

Start time: 2797.14
End time: 2834.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good thing about this is that even if rim did cave a little bit, they didn't cave  all the way.  And they did not give them access to those centralized servers, which would have comprised  a lot more data than just the people who are using those phones inside those countries.  I mean, it may be that this is just going to mark a sea change for rim, that they can't  necessarily operate in such a, I guess, kind of a cloud way that they are going to have  to be willing to operate more local servers.  But it makes me wonder what, because this ban applied to foreign travelers as well.  And it makes me wonder what the global business marketplace is going to have to say.  Are they going to say, I actually don't want to use my Blackberry in Saudi Arabia now because  they can monitor my data.

Start time: 2835.64
End time: 2863.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is the thing, which is why didn't rim say from the beginning, oh, well, we could  set up a server in Saudi Arabia.  Why did they dig their heels in?  I mean, you're right, Neelai.  This is what got them in trouble.  The fact that they run a centralized server.  I mean, we've seen the same thing with P2P services.  You run a centralized server, you become responsible for all that data and you have  to answer for it.  It looks like the answer here was to take one of those servers and put it in the country.  Why didn't they come out with that at first?

Start time: 2864.36
End time: 2893.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it was a cost thing.  They didn't want to incur the cost of having a server and maintain it in, apparently, this  country.  And sorry, maybe they have to put a server in each of them to have them independent and  not have the Saudi government spying on the UAE server.  They're going to have to have one server in each country.  And then they were thinking, man, if every country is going to start demanding that they  have specific infrastructure for that, it's going to snowball.  So I don't know.  Seeing that.

Start time: 2893.96
End time: 2954.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also, I mean, you know, security is a, you know, rim is very proud of how secure  blackberries are and for good reason.  Right.  And so as soon as they start chipping away at that armor and saying, well, your blackberries  end insecure in the United States, but as you travel throughout the world, you know,  different people can look at your traffic.  You know, that really takes away from sort of the bulletproof blackberry image.  And I can see what, you know, and rim is a very conservative and very slow moving company  when it comes to things like that.  You know, it's funny to me that, for example, the blackberries, you know, renowned as the  best phone to do email on still to this day.  Right.  And it doesn't do IMAP, like the bonkers.  Right.  I mean, the best email phone in the world doesn't support the world's most widely used  email standard.  Why?  Because they want you to go through blackberry internet server and get that experience because  they're very proud of it.  And they think it is a better experience.  I don't think they want to start chipping away at what they consider their foundational  strengths.  And one of those foundational strengths is security.  Well, they didn't want to, but now they have.

Start time: 2954.34
End time: 2959.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that it's true that they were holding out as much as they could, but now  they have and it's a slippery slope and it's going to be interesting to see what the results

End time: 2978.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kuwait has said they want rim to block pornographic websites.  And we know the United Arab Emirates still wants blocking and Lebanon has spoken up and  said that they are going to consider this.  So there's a snowball effect that's happening, which is going to make blackberry seem like  the least secure.  And that's what you're pointing out here.  Is there a more secure alternative to blackberry given all of this?

Start time: 2979.48
End time: 3017.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, right.  So you can't go to Apple and say, we want the iPhone to block  pornographic websites in Kuwait.  You have to go to the carrier.  Right.  And that makes sense.  So, you know, there's no uproar when we hear about Kuwait's national carrier blocking  websites or sleeping in traffic.  It's a smaller uproar anyway.  Yeah, exactly.  Because people say, oh, well, that's Kuwait.  Metal sat in Saudi Arabia, sleeping on traffic on the iPhone because we know what's happening  because it's not on the device with rim and with blackberry.  There's that server and it's the focal point for everyone because now rim is operating  the service and they can do things to their users.  It's very clever because that server exists and it's a structural issue for them.

Maybe it was some grand strategy to realize, hey, you know, if we could get local servers,  I mean, it might have been just a problem that they just now got around to or they just  thought of the solution.  I mean, it seems very clever in some ways.  It's sort of a coordinated attack on, as Neelay put it, the blackberry infrastructure,  the basic fundamental operation of blackberry.

The Indian government saying we want blackberry servers or the ability to look at blackberry,  BBM traffic in particular.  We think criminals are using it.  We want to be able to get in there and look at what they're doing.  Blackberry saying no.  India saying we have a deadline.  Blackberry saying, well, you're also the world's largest democracy and nothing happens on time.  And India being like, turns out you're right over and over and over again.

And that's what started this turning against rim saying, well, fine.  We can't allow this to happen again.  We need to be able to get this kind of information in the future.

That's right.  Actually, it's kind of like that.  Squarespace is a dedicated server for running your blog.  So it's got an easy to use UI, optimized for beginners and CSS experts.  You don't have to know a thing, but if you do, you can still take control of your blog.  Hundreds of design templates, lots of modules.  You can add forums and photo galleries and form builders,  collect email addresses from people.  If you don't want to put your email address out there,  you want to actually have people email you without knowing your address.  You can build a forum, all plug and play stuff.  Website tracking too to let people find out who's visiting your site and how well it's going.  All of that done on their servers.  So you don't have to mess with it.  You get too many people, they upgrade the service.  They adapt.  They're flexible.  So why not try it out for free?  You don't need a credit card.  You just go to squarespace.com slash twit, import your website.  They have importer tools for blogger, for WordPress, for type ad,  and just give it a whirl.  See if you like it.  If you do and you decide to purchase it, you get 10% off when you enter the offer code twit.  That's squarespace.com slash twit.  Now let's talk a little net neutrality.  Perhaps a Squarespace blog for protesting net neutrality or supporting net neutrality.  It's the transition on the other end.

Start time: 3344.35
End time: 3435.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So this one has been, we've had a lot of thorny, like unusual stories.  Usually August is dead for tech news, but this week, thankfully,  since I had to do twit this week was full of really deep, rich stories.  Earlier this week it broke that Google and Verizon had created a secret way to  settle net neutrality.  So depending on who you read, it worked in different ways.  Bloomberg was saying that wireline service from Verizon would continue to be net neutral,  but wireless service would be able to be managed in whatever way Verizon saw fit.  This was an agreement between Google and Verizon.  New York Times reported that Google had agreed that Verizon could charge  for certain priority access, which would be considered a violation of net neutrality  on wireline or wireless.  And then Eric Schmidt came out and said, you know, what would be okay,  and he wasn't commenting specifically on this story, but he said what would be okay is if you said  video, all video could be prioritized over email.  It's just quality of service management.  So we're not saying that a particular video service like YouTube would be prioritized,  but video prioritized over email, he would be fine with that.  Then as Google and Verizon were denying this saying New York Times got it wrong,  everything is wrong about this story, the FCC popped in and said, hey, by the way,  the talks we've been having with not only Google and Verizon, but a ton of other stakeholders in  the area, including nonprofit groups, they're off.  We're done.  We're done.  We're pulling out of this.

Start time: 3439.06
End time: 3510.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A little bit because, you know, this is FCC regulation is thorny and complicated.  And a lot of these stories conflated issues and got things wrong in ways that just suggest to me  that they weren't all the facts right there.  So I think that wireline services remain net neutral is very strange, right?  Because traditionally, when we talk about Verizon's wireline services,  we are talking about their phone services.  And those services are already neutral.  They've been neutral for decades, right?  You can plug in whatever phone you want.  What they're talking about is like Verizon DSL, right?  And Verizon FIOS.  And I mean, that's actually really important.  That's part of the heart of the net neutrality debate.  And Verizon and Google, they don't have the ability to agree that they'll remain neutral.  That doesn't make any sense.  Unless, you know, the trade is, you know, Verizon, you know, we're Google.  We really want your network to be neutral.  We know that you don't.  What we'll do is we'll trade you.  So if you agree to leave FIOS open to everybody, we will pay you to have YouTube be faster on Verizon Wireless.  And I think that's exactly what's happening here.

Start time: 3510.92
End time: 3536.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that that I suspect my theory is that's exactly the deal they're making.  But I think it's not going to be fine in the future because I think it is very clear that  whatever deal is made between Google and Verizon will be the deal that affects future legislation  and future regulation because the FCC has basically said on the one hand, we don't have the  don't, you know, we now, according to the courts, don't have the authority to regulate this.  We're backing away from re-regulation.  And we were throwing up our hands.  We're saying you guys work it out and we'll follow your lead.

Start time: 3537.80
End time: 3551.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is what's really strange to me about this is because the FCC isn't backing away.  They're actually their new plan is much more aggressive than their old plan.  And the old plan is what the court said was they didn't have the authority to do.  Yeah.

Start time: 3551.76
End time: 3558.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the new plan, I think they're almost certainly going to abandon because they've  encountered so much more resistance than they expected to that sort of third way reclassification.

Start time: 3558.88
End time: 3573.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the new plan would be the reclassification as a, was it Title I service or Title II?  Title II.  Title II service, which means you're back to being governed as a more like a phone company  than this new service, which is more like a cable company.  Yeah.

Start time: 3573.98
End time: 3597.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the administration, our current, you know, the Obama administration is very supportive of net  neutrality.  The reclassification is the only way that the FCC can act under the scope of their current powers.  And they do in fact have the ability to re-regulate like that.  I mean, that is what they're empowered to do.  They can say, we're changing this service from this to this.  Oh, they definitely do.  But Congress was up in arms.

Start time: 3598.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Republicans, Democrats, they encountered a ton of resistance to re-regulation that I think  they really weren't expecting.  I mean, there were, you know, senators, House representatives, all kinds of groups that you  would either even Google, which you would think might be in favor was pretty tepid on the idea  of re-regulation.  And I don't think that they have, I don't think the FCC has the support for that, that they were  hoping they would have.  And I feel like they'll probably back away.  And they're hoping that the marketplace in the form of these kind of backroom deals between  maybe Google and Verizon will figure it out.  But what I think is that wireless is going to be abandoned in terms of the next battleground.  Wireless is going to be left to be tiered, you know, to hell and back.

Transcript:  Can I say this story scares the bejesus out of me.  Seriously, I've been hearing...  Is that French?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that was French.  Exactly.  But I've been hearing more and more people going from, you know, net neutrality is important and  it's, you know, it's one of the founding principles of the internet and it's really important not to  abandon it.  To with this story, all of a sudden, first of all, Google being sort of, we don't really know what  they've been talking about.  And then, well, maybe if it's, you know, only for certain general types of files and you don't  discriminate the specific company or if it's only for wireless, then it's OK.  I think Cooley was saying, well, maybe the business could figure it out.  And, you know, freehand of the market will do something perfect with all of this.  How can people...  I'm sorry, I'm going into a little bit of a rant here, but how can people all of a sudden be  abandoning net neutrality like this?  It's horrendous.  The idea that we can start with maybe wireless and maybe video and maybe...  No, we cannot go down that road.  And this is one of the places where we absolutely, absolutely need regulation.  We don't need the FCC to get hands off and to start saying, well, we're not going to be talking  about it.  And we don't need tech journalists to start thinking maybe businesses are going to be taking  care of this because whatever we decide on now is going to be the foundation for what  happens later.  And we don't know what we're going to need later.  The internet evolves so fast because we have no restrictions and we get innovation.  And you all know that.  But I was terrified at the reaction to the story.  And I'm certainly very happy that you guys here seem to be saying that, you know, maybe we  should actually protect it and fight for it.

Transcript:  I was quite confused by this entire story until I read Schmidt's quote.  And then I realized that fits in where I have been uncomfortable with net neutrality is the  idea that we take away management tools from network administrators.  You can write net neutrality laws in a way that would really be bad for the internet  and would be bad for bandwidth.  And so what Schmidt seemed to be saying was quality of service where we don't discriminate  on content, but content type.  Because if your email gets delivered delayed by a few milliseconds, you'll never notice.  But if your video gets delayed, you start to notice.  And if your VoIP gets delayed, you really know.

But what happens when some other sort of data transmission starts to, you know, some guy in  his garage imagines that we're going to make, I don't know, BitTorrent, for example.

Transcript:  Every net neutrality proposal that the FCC has put forward is the ability for network  operators and ISPs to manage their networks.  I don't think the FCC has ever said we want to legislate or regulate how you manage your  network or how you deliver quality of service to your users.  What they're saying is we don't want you to prioritize certain content from certain  providers over others.  But we want you to manage your network in a way that's fair.  And if it's not fair, we want there to be some sort of process or litigation that will  resolve the issue.  Right.  So we want to say these are the rules.  You have to be fair and then you can do whatever you want under the rules.  And if you don't do them, you know, the aggrieved party can sue you.  The thing I think we need to.  That's how everything works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing I think we need to watch out for, though, like you said, Patrick, in terms of  the future precedent is that wireless broadband is considered even by the FCC to be, you know,  the savior of broadband access in America, that it's going to solve the last mile problem  that that that in the future, most of us will consume our data over wireless networks and  not as much over wired networks.  That's the new infrastructure and it is the new battleground.  And I think that Google is absolutely about to sell us down the river when it comes to  tearing wireless networks because the telcos are holding all the cards.  Verizon, Sprint, AT&T can say we're just not going to build out our wireless broadband  networks.  We're not going to build out that infrastructure to save you all from the coming bandwidth  crunch unless we have a guarantee that we can prioritize traffic as we see fit and that  we can charge for that traffic as we see fit.  And so let me let me.  And it was very fuzzy on that.

Start time: 3912.36
End time: 3947.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with you.  So, Molly, I mean, I think that's incredibly like poignant and I think you've you've got  it nailed and we build on that because I think Verizon and Google right now have a very close  relationship with Android and what they're doing with Android.  And I think Google bring this back to the top of the show.  You know, one day the iPhone is going to be on Verizon and if Google already has a relationship  to prioritize traffic to Android devices from Google services on Verizon's network in place,  the Android phones will always be more attractive than the iPhone.

Start time: 3948.86
End time: 3990.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can't trust these.  I mean, the reason that this became an issue with Comcast and Time Warner is that they  started getting into content delivery.  They had a conflict of interest when it came to their competing services because on the  one hand they were providing the pipe, but on the other hand, they were providing content  that they wanted to get through the pipe more quickly.  And that's why their tiering became so unnerving.  The same proposition exists with the telcos and the same proposition like you point out,  Neelay, exists with Google.  They are in a position to want to prioritize not only traffic in the form of YouTube video,  but traffic to specific devices in the form of Android devices.  And don't think for a minute that Google is going to hold on to the vaunted net neutrality  principles when it comes to increasing market share in both of those arenas.

Start time: 3990.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's a story kicking around that those data center containers that Google has had for  years and years and years might be placed near Verizon data centers and Google would  pipe directly into the Verizon network.  So it would never go out on the open internet if you're in Verizon and they would be able  to subvert any net neutrality regulation anyway.  That just made me cry a little.

What you have to do to preserve the internet, people, this is important.  We're not talking about YouTube and videos of cats only.  The internet, in order to preserve it, you need to say you cannot prioritize anything.  Managing your network is another way of saying you can do whatever the hell you want.

End time: 4081.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there was that internet too.  Remember when we first started talking about net neutrality years ago and internet too was  conducting all those tests and they actually found that network management didn't have to  include prioritizing certain amounts of traffic.  They released that study that said we think that if you provide sufficient bandwidth,  you don't have to do QoS monitoring and you don't have to do that kind of packet level  management to ensure that video travels better or voice travels better.

Transcript:  I had this argument, that exact argument with the network administrator at the University of  Chicago, my freshman year of college in 1999, saying there is sufficient bandwidth on our  network. I don't know why you're shutting down Napster.  And then the...  Turned out I was... That conversation I've been having in one form or another  since I was a freshman in college. And I think it's exactly right. If there's enough bandwidth,  you can just do whatever you want. The issue is that wireless networks don't have enough bandwidth  and the reality is we need to allow those operators to manage their networks.  It's the balance that I think right now we're seeing the pendulum swing wildly between two  extremes. The ACC says you're a Title II service. We're going to regularly...  Traditional landline telephones, everybody has to be neutral. And then there's some pushback  and then pendulum swings wildly to Google and Verizon making a deal in secret in the back room.  And we just need... The oscillation has to stop at some point.

Start time: 4135.88
End time: 4160.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem is we actually don't know what that agreement was. We only know what it wasn't.  Google and Verizon very specifically said, no, we did not come to any kind of agreement  about allowing prioritization of Verizon or Google content on the internet. They specifically  came out on that, which is unusual in these situations. Usually you get some kind of vague,  plausible non-denial denial. So we know that wasn't part of it, but we don't know what they

Start time: 4160.86
End time: 4184.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  did agree on if they agreed on anything. And we also know that the stories, the Bloomberg,  the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times stories are still out there and have not been  corrected or amended by those outlets. That doesn't necessarily say it all,  but the fact that the New York Times did not issue a correction after being flatly contradicted  by Verizon and Google, I thought was also interesting. They did not say,  we're backing away from the story or even issue a clarification.

Start time: 4185.00

Transcript:  So we have wired communications, not wire line, as Neelay pointed out, but wired like DSL and Fios  on the one hand, and the idea of whether we need quality of service management on that or not.  And then we have wireless communication, which even though we've been talking about it in  relations to quality of service, everything we've talked about has said, well, wireless,  no net neutrality. Up for grabs. And Molly pointed out, that's where it gets really scary.  And what I would like to add to that is what's really interesting is wireless, the FCC can  regulate a lot more easily than wired because it's a scarce resource that is managed by the FCC.  It's one of the reasons the FCC exists is to manage that spectrum that wireless exists in.  So is it because the FCC just thinks we'll get to that later?

Start time: 4231.18
End time: 4262.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the FCC is, this is what I said on Buzz That Loud, I think they're pretty neutered. I  mean, I think that they have, I think they are backing away a little bit from reclassification.  I think that they've been gutted by that Comcast ruling. And I think they don't have the  administrative and congressional support that they thought they would have for exerting those  regulations because there's such an intense, you know, when net neutrality became a partisan issue,  it became a lot harder for the FCC to say, this is about managing a crucial resource for America,  which is what they were trying to say with the broadband plan, but they were undercut at almost

Start time: 4262.80
End time: 4368.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  every turn. And I really agreed with their title two reclassification. I thought that their proposal  that the FCC put out and the way they wanted to do it made a lot of sense, right? Because  the best way to do something administratively and politically is to utilize the power that you  already have and to go out and try to seek new power is always a bad idea because somebody will  challenge your ability to have that authority for the FCC to say, well, here's the authority  that we have. We're going to organize a way to use it as responsibly as possible. And we're going to  do what we're tasked to do. Made a lot of sense to me. And, you know, it didn't matter what they said,  right? They could have said anything. They could have said, you know, we're going to go back to  Congress and ask for a bill giving a specific authority to regulate the internet in a neutral  way. And they still would have gotten pushback from the industry. And I think it's the vociferous  lobbying from the ISPs and from the carriers who that's really that's pushing them back. It doesn't  matter how they try to do it. I think that's really the problem that the FCC is going to have to  solve. They really need to get some political capital and they really need to, you know,  find a way to sell their side of the story in a way that, you know, once you get Google and Verizon  signing a deal in the back room, even talking about it, once you've lost Google is proponent  of neutrality, you've really lost a lot. I mean, I think they need to start running up university  support. I think research support, all this other stuff that they need to do because they don't have  the political capital to push neutrality through right now. And that's scary. You know, I really  thought that their Title II reclassification was a good plan. And, you know, Molly, I'm maybe  more of an optimist than you. I hope so. Stupid. I mean, I hope you're right. You know, I wrote the

Well, it's just one wireless network. Well, that's the thing though, Molly.  That's how it starts. Well, no, it's a good point though because we actually have competition.

Transcript:  4G network. Oh, right. But it's something like that. It barely counts. I talk about competition  and wireless networks all the time because, you know, this is an age old battle between people  who have an access layer and a content layer, right? And it's like everybody who's sort of like  us, the nerds of the world, they know that what you really want is a dumb pipe. And that's all  that anybody should really want, right? And that's there should be competition between different  dumb pipes over who's the fastest and most reliable. The problem is that all of it's like  they're arrogant or they're pretentious or something. And they believe that they should  be more than dumb pipes. So Verizon wants to run an app store and have a media service and all this  other stuff to differentiate their dumb pipe. And it's like they don't realize the best  differentiation for their service would be being faster and more reliable, potentially at a cheaper  price. And if they competed on those metrics, I think we'd all be better off. If we had more

Transcript:  Now you are talking crazy, my friend. Well, that was part of the hope of the National  broadband plan that they would actually be able to mandate to enact actual competition via a variety  of methods. And one of them just being simple metrics, you know, finding out what was available,  where and at what cost and really bringing transparency into the debate. And then hopefully,  freeing up spectrum and they had all of these steps that were hopefully going to increase  competition. But now they have just backed off. It's like they have thrown up their hands and  they've said, you know what, you guys work it out. We're just going to be over here. We're tired.

And then you can have a free market work where people say, you know what,  actually, I'm going to choose Sprint. I'm going to choose Metro PCS. I'm going to choose somebody  else because I don't like the restrictions I'm getting. And you don't have to have anybody come  in and put a regulatory hand on it.

Transcript:  All right. Since we're talking about something ecological, let's talk about Ford, makers of the  Ford EcoBoost engine. Also a sponsor on Twitter, it's a 3.5 liter twin turbocharged 365 horsepower  V6 direct injection to increase fuel efficiency. Ford has brought both the twin turbos and direct  injection together in the EcoBoost to deliver the performance of a much larger engine with the fuel  economy of a smaller engine. It's the first engine of its kind in North America, the first twin  turbocharged direct injection V6 in North America. An EcoBoost is standard on the new 2011 Taurus  Show, the Taurus SHO. It has an EPA estimated fuel economy of 17 in the city, 25 on the highway,  and the Taurus Show and most of the Ford cars also feature voice activated sync.  The in-car connectivity system that gives you true hands-free calling, turn-by-turn voice  directions without having to purchase additional hardware, 911 assist, voice activated music and  podcasting, your text messages read aloud so you can keep connected while keeping your eyes on the  road and your hands on the wheel, and so much more in voice activated sync. You can check out both  the Ford EcoBoost engine and sync by driving the Taurus Show, the Taurus SHO at a Ford dealer near  you. Stop by a Ford dealer this week and drive one. All right. This just broke actually. A Best Buy  has had privileged status as the only iPod seller according to the New York Times, but Robert Stevens,  CTO and founder of its Geek Squad service, posted a couple prototype tablet photos on Twitter this  week out of nowhere. It's just an empty shell, but he says it carries Best Buy's Rocketfish brand and  it looks like Best Buy is going to have their own tablet. Wow. Oh, like an insignia version.  Interesting.

Transcript:  the department's press secretary, demands that WikiLeaks return immediately to the US government  all versions of documents obtained directly or indirectly from the Department of Defense.  To give them their credit, they may be meaning the original media upon which you got this,  whether it's an email or a USB drive or something so that they could do forensic analysis on it.  And try to trace where it came from, because that's what they're up to is they're trying to  find out how WikiLeaks got this stuff, as well as asking them to take it down. They've also banned  the military from viewing WikiLeaks, which a lot of people have pointed out means that the terrorists  can see WikiLeaks, but the military can't. I think that's kind of silly. And they've also,

Start time: 5029.94
End time: 5046.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a leveling system about classification and need to know and knowledge sharing. And I think that it  is perfectly reasonable for them to want to protect the classified structure by saying, look, you  don't need to be reading WikiLeaks and finding out information that's above your pay grade.  I mean, that's just how the military works. Although the opposite side of that is that I

Start time: 5046.32
End time: 5054.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  can read it, but someone in the military can't. So it's almost a false ban. I mean, there's an  easy way to get around it. The cat's out of the bag there. Yeah, true. Of course it is.

Start time: 5095.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a 1.4 gigabyte file with AES 256 encryption and lots of people have downloaded it.  Nobody can crack into it with that kind of encryption. Not easily, not really at all.  It'll be a while. But everyone suspects that, you know, if something should go down wrong or Julian  Assange should come up, you know, face up in the Hudson, that keys would be released for people to  unlock this file. And my guess is it's everything else that they've gotten regarding Afghanistan,  because they've said there's lots of documents that they have received that they have not posted

Start time: 5128.64

Transcript:  because they felt they were dangerous. This is super scary. I mean, this whole  WikiLeaks, I've always been extremely supportive of WikiLeaks in general. But I have to say this  story made me think, oh, right, wait a second, because these files, I mean, the insurance thing  aside, the whole military correspondence for the war in Afghanistan, I'm like, maybe there should  be somewhat a way to control that. Or maybe, I don't know, it just makes me question a little  bit WikiLeaks. And I know it's a very important survey to have. It's a very important site. But  it's like putting a light on how disruptive it can become. It's almost an anarchy device,

Start time: 5175.68
End time: 5199.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of anarchy, sorry. I mean, I think the question is really, well, it sort of feels like  dogma is bad on either side, right? On the military side, they're too secretive. There's no question  that the dogma of secrecy at all costs is dangerous. But openness at all costs may be equally  dangerous. And I think that's what we're finding out. It's not, is it worth it? Should there be  some secrets that save people's lives, for God's sake? And is it worth it to protect those?

Transcript:  You know, I don't want to get too crazy and philosophical here. But I've noticed recently  that the sort of the culture of the internet, if you will, or the narrative that sort of the right  wing media in particular spins is that authority is not to be trusted, and that systems and  government have failed, right? And that, you know, sort of general anarchy, like Patrick is saying,  is sort of the way to go, right? That, you know, government can't be trusted because it doesn't  function, and authority can't be trusted because it lies to you. And it's kind of like WikiLeaks is  that it is absolutely, I think, a paragon of this attitude, where they say, well, you can trust us,  but we don't know, you know, we don't have authority. We're anti-authority. And by being  anti-authority, that's how we gain your trust. But the fact of the matter is that WikiLeaks,  just like our government and our military and every other institution, is run by people. And  people have biases and opinions, and they will selectively try to make you agree with them and  persuade you. And that's really the problem with WikiLeaks, is that they release information  in a way that suits them, and they don't release all the information and let everybody decide.  So, I mean, that's my issue with WikiLeaks in general, is that they've put themselves in this  position of saying, you know, the government isn't to be trusted. They're not telling you everything.  But at the same time, they very actively don't tell you everything.

They think that what they are doing is the only right way to go,  and they will not be persuaded by logic or safety concerns or anything. And anytime I think that  your position is that extreme, you're just going to cause trouble.

Start time: 5340.68
End time: 5389.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. So particularly in the case of government, and I think this is going to sound odd for me  because I'm not some crazy supporter of institutionalized government. But government  in America, you can get rid of. Right. If the government does something wrong,  the system is designed so that you can vote the bastards out. Right. You don't get to vote out  WikiLeaks. They continue to be there, and if they do something wrong, they're still there,  and they don't go away. And so it's odd to me whenever we see private institutions come down  and really demand that we take down the government in some way, the way that WikiLeaks does, because  there's a check for the people in the government. There's not a check on WikiLeaks. And I think  sort of an interesting dynamic that they've really used to their advantage. They're saying,  we're the ones who are right, and your government is not to be trusted.

Start time: 5389.30
End time: 5431.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you point out an interesting fact here that WikiLeaks is taking advantage of,  which is the infinite copyability of the internet. Right. If it was just a marketplace of ideas and  people got to shout them forth, some voices would be heard more than others, and you'd be able to  discern which one you want. But on the internet, when you're talking about leaks, it takes one  posting. And so they have so much more power than the government in that way, which has to fight to  stay elected. And it's why you see so much crap in the rhetoric, and so much ridiculous slippery  slopes and all this thing to try to trick people into voting for them. Whereas all WikiLeaks has  to do to affect their agenda is post once, and then it is infinitely copyable from then on.

Start time: 5432.06
End time: 5536.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And because they're really good at what they do, the narrative that they provide about the  information that they leak is generally the dominant narrative until it's corrected. But  nobody cares about corrections. Right. So to bring this back to two subjects that I'm more familiar  with and feel more comfortable talking about is an example of this phenomenon. One is, for example,  the iPhone 4 antenna, where everybody who sees my iPhone 4 to this day says, oh, do you drop calls  and you hold it wrong? And the answer is no, right? Because you don't drop calls and you hold it wrong,  you lose some signal. And that might, you know, it's like there's this whole other explanation now.  But the media narrative has been you drop calls and you hold it wrong. And so that's out there.  It's forever. And Apple can't do anything to fix it. Another one from just this week was Apple used  some images in a patent application with third party application. Like an iPhone app, they used  a screenshot in their patent apps. And the narrative immediately was Apple's trying to patent  iPhone apps that other developers have submitted to the App Store. And it's like, well, no,  that's absolutely not true. And I can I'll explain it to you. But, you know, it took me a day to put  up that explanation. And then it was over. It was like, you know, it's one of those things where I  was writing it. I was like, I know this doesn't matter, but I want the right information to be  out there. And it's like those narratives take hold so quickly, and especially because information,  like you're saying, can be repeated so often and so quickly as soon as it's out there. It's almost  as though they have, you know, an exponential amount more power over the media narrative than  the government, because the government's come in, and quite frankly, be boring, right? They're gonna  be like, well, that isn't actually the case. We're not murdering civilians, you know, here is this  exercise and blah, blah, blah. And nobody cares. Well, the government's gonna say it's not as black

Start time: 5536.46
End time: 5540.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and white as you have portrayed it, WikiLeaks. It's more nuanced, and it's more complicated,

Start time: 5540.26
End time: 5580.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and no one likes to listen to that. And the WikiLeaks side of the argument is, if you want  to be able to make a good judgment on government and find out who the bastards are, who you want  to throw out, you need all the information. They're not going to give it to you. We will.  We will pass it along unfiltered. You know, they don't necessarily help. They do filter it. But,  you know, I think there is a good purpose behind something like WikiLeaks to say, hey, we want to  get information out there that you need to know to understand how things work in your country.  But it has to be done responsibly. And I think that's the conversation we're having here is,  is WikiLeaks responsible? And should we trust them?  Oh, sorry, go ahead.

Start time: 5585.40
End time: 5605.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, just a quick thing is what you're saying is,  WikiLeaks needs to be more responsible. So they need to take in all of this information  that they're getting, filter it out, and explain what the government is doing.  That role is the role of the press.  Well, and they did that. That's what's interesting is they passed that along to three news outlets,

Start time: 5605.38
End time: 5621.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Der Spiegel, The Guardian, and the New York Times, to do that for them. Then they said,  but we also want you to have the source information. We want you to have the source  material so you can double check the press. Yeah, this is not, WikiLeaks is not supposed

Start time: 5621.66
End time: 5687.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to be the press. WikiLeaks serves a different purpose. It's a place to post information  anonymously, whatever that information may be. And what we're seeing now, I believe,  what we're realizing, it's sort of a wake up call, we're realizing maybe this sort of no  accountability possibility that we have now with the internet, with, I would say, WikiLeaks, but  other venues, like maybe 4chan even, which no one can touch. And it's sort of scary almost.  Is that too much non-accountability? We obviously can't do anything about it at this point,  I don't think, because if you strike down WikiLeaks, for example, something else will come up  somewhere else. But it is sort of inspiring and a little bit too much maybe. And that's what we're  realizing now. It's not the fact that WikiLeaks should edit or shouldn't edit the information  they're putting out. It's the fact that you can put out this information with and once it's out  of the bag, it's finished. That's the problem. And is it really a problem is the question we

Start time: 5687.84
End time: 5775.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  should answer. I think that's the issue. So every single day, editing gadget, we get tips on new  products or services or people send us in fake spy shots, all this stuff. And our readers rely on us  to filter out the wheat from the chaff. And sometimes we're right and sometimes we're wrong,  sometimes we miss things. But we have a good record and our credibility is based on that record  and we work very hard to maintain it. And I think what WikiLeaks does is they don't filter. And the  way that they do filter is with these selective edits and selective releases and the sort of  aura of sort of anti-authority rebellion. And as soon as something is on WikiLeaks with all of that  branding, I don't want to call it branding, but that reputation behind it, it gains some status.  And so this goal of you can just submit information for the commons to decide if it's true or valid  or important goes away as soon as WikiLeaks starts performing editorial functions like  editing video and releasing it to news outlets. Like saying, here's what we think is important.  Like saying the government isn't telling you the whole truth. Because as soon as they start  performing that editorial function, everything else on their site becomes part of it. And I think  that's the danger. If WikiLeaks was just a repository and you could go to it and there  was some information on there, you could take away and other people could form narratives from it,  well, that would be different. But they're very much performing editorial role as well.

Transcript:  Q Well, let's finish up with a story that is sort of the opposite. It's someone who wanted to keep  something secret in order to save society. That is 45-year-old Terry Childs, former CIS admin for  the city of San Francisco, who received his sentencing this weekend, actually on Friday,  four years in prison for refusing to hand over administrative passwords to the city's fiber WAN  network back in July 2008. Judge convicted Childs in April of violating state hacking laws. Childs  says that his bosses were incompetent and he would only give the passwords to the mayor after he had  explained why his bosses were incompetent and couldn't be trusted with the system. But he has  finally received his sentence and he'll spend four years in jail for defending his principles  very assiduously. This is a story that Molly and I were following back in Buzz Out Loud when we  were on there together. And it just, there's something entertaining about a guy who, whatever  you think the facts of the case are, said, yeah, I'll go to jail. I don't think my bosses know what  they're doing. I think they're endangering the city and I will only give this password to the mayor.

And you wanted to, you know, not get to him or  not make him able to manage whatever he should be managing. And he's actually going and doing it and  going to jail for this. I think he should, we should open a fund for this guy and just, you know,

Transcript:  We should point out that during the 12 days that he would not return over the administrative  passwords, the network ran fine. It never went down.
