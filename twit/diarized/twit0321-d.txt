Also, I guess I should  give you credit for the new thing, techzilla.com. And don't forget Twitch. And this week in  Kapoor Hardware. You know, it's funny because we actually had last week, even though you  do that show remotely via Skype with Ryan Shroud, who's in, you know, Kentucky, we had  people show up in the audience to watch. It was awesome. I actually tweeted out a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Ryan did the show here live, it was so good. It was so good. It was like the screensavers.  And we had a top down shot as you took apart a computer. I mean, it really felt great.  It was fun. It makes me want to do more of that kind of stuff. Just need to get Ryan

End time: 231.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you say? Live studio audience? There's a bunch of people here.  Gorgeous little place.  It's really nice. This is a great group of people here from App Advice. We've got somebody  visiting. We've got Mike Chandler, my old webmaster is here. That's really, that goes  back a ways. Steve Buchanan is visiting from Oracle. You know what it is? It's Java 1's  in town.  It's in Petaluma.  It's in Petaluma.  I'm going to figure the butter and egg festival.  And also let's introduce Mr. Dan Patterson who hasn't been on ages. And I apologize Dan  for ABC radio.  Quite all right. Thank you very much, Leo.  You've been tearing it up on the Google Plus.

Start time: 232.40
End time: 256.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the Google Plus and on the streets of New York City. Although I did spend, I lived in  Sebastopol, California on Main Street.  No.  Yeah, I used to, you know, I worked for Capital Records and the majority of my income came  from Copperfield's Books down there on Main Street, Sebastopol.  And they're still here. And they're still in Petaluma. They're blocked from here.  Yeah, O'Reilly was one of our biggest customers. That was pre-Web 2.0.

Start time: 257.88
End time: 317.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. And look at this picture of you on your Google Plus.  Should have changed that.  Hey, Laureen, also from the North Coast Macintosh Users Group. Laureen's visiting us. She's  the president of the club. There's a good bunch of people in here.  There's users groups left.  Yeah. Oh, you know what? This is, I met people from two users groups. It was Jay, right?  It was from Colorado, Laureen, right? And that, he says that's the biggest user group  in the world. I don't know. You have about three or 400, 500 members of the North Coast  MassCo. So I think user groups live, oddly enough.  In infamy.  Yeah, maybe. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an interesting week. Of course, last week  we had a big announcement from Amazon. Next week we have a big announcement from Apple.  Which should we start with, John?  Amazon.  Amazon announced three new Kindles. The little basic Kindle, $79, which I bought and got  immediately in love.  They say available now.  Well, where is it? Do we have it?  I didn't bring it. Do we have one? Did Tom leave his line around?

Start time: 317.52
End time: 318.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, he's got his at home thing.

Start time: 320.00
End time: 354.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All they did is they chopped off the keyboard, which was always kind of vestigial anyway.  How often do you type on a Kindle? And they took the audio out. So it's about $79, ad  supported, and it's just a great size. It's the same E Ink screen. It's very light. They  announced a touch version of that so that you don't have to press buttons. I don't know  really what the point of the touch is. And then they announced the Kindle Fire.  Do we?  Yeah. I think that's it.  Bring it forward. Did you say they took the audio out?  Yeah, this was something that they didn't make a big deal about, but I was a little  disappointed because I'm an Audible fan, right?  Yeah.  And I used to listen to Audible on my Kindle all the time and it's not here anymore.

Start time: 354.80
End time: 385.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can listen to Audible on one of your 18 phones. You can listen to it on your  car stereo. You can listen to it on your watch.  It's not the end of the world. I agree.  No, I just actually was laughing because we're supposed to be talking about e-readers tomorrow  on Tekzilla because I was sitting there. I did something I promised myself I would never  do, which is read another novel on the iPhone.  And that's tough.  I read it even faster than I would have otherwise because it was such a horrible experience,  you know, glowing in the dark, my eyes falling off my face. And I actually think I'm going  to turn around and buy another one of the Kindles.

Start time: 385.12
End time: 387.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the backlight you didn't like, not the size of the screen.

Start time: 387.68
End time: 421.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the size of the screen is a trope. Well, it's Ready Player One, which is not a particularly  long book. It's like the ultimate collection of 80s pop culture references wrapped in sci-fi.  It's a really fun read, but it ends up breaking down to 685 pages, which is more like 1685  paragraphs on the iPhone as you're blowing through and clicking like every two seconds  to try to get through to the next page.  They call it a genre buster. Ernest Cline.  It's more like a completely out of control set of game references and music references  from the 80s. It's just it's a lot of geek culture.

Start time: 421.92
End time: 425.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I believe there are giant Japanese robots. Yes.  That's important.

Start time: 425.80
End time: 429.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Immersive gaming. Tom and Veronica are going to be talking about this.

Start time: 431.94
End time: 447.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would not hesitate to recommend this one. This is a $79 one, which I mean, that price  is very compelling. You can get a ton of books on it. I think it's eight gigabytes and it's  easy to read because that E Ink screen, I think it's so creative. Have you ever had  a Kindle?

Start time: 449.20
End time: 461.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife has one. I've used several.  Sarah's a librarian, of course. She's a book fan.  I've used E Ink on three different platforms. Basically, if you want a reader, you get E  Ink. I agree. If you want battery life, you get E Ink.

Start time: 461.52
End time: 503.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You agree, Dan? Are you?  Without a doubt. I love my old Kindle. In fact, that audio is one of the selling points  for me. I'm a huge Audible fan, but I also put a lot of podcasts on there and that battery  life is wonderful. But I think that the number one feature of this new Kindle is that $79  price point. What this does is drive competitive price pressures downwards and makes, you know,  if you think about the power of putting the world's best literature into the hands of  every person, you know, it's a tough sell at $200. Your mom might get it, but you know,  your buddy from college might not. At $79, that's an almost undeniable device. And then  you can put the world's best literature in anyone's hands.

Start time: 504.22
End time: 518.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost an impulse purchase at that price. I'm going on vacation a couple of weeks. I  have on this Kindle Infinite Jest, the new Neal Stephenson Ream-D.  Also a good reader. I read that last night.  Yeah, I can't wait to read that. And what else is on there?

Start time: 519.52
End time: 523.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Complete works of William Shakespeare. I see you're aiming high. You're not a gadget.  Did you just buy a book on there?

Start time: 524.46
End time: 529.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just bought a library for you.  John bought a book on there.  It was a win for $500. I mean, what are you going to do?

Start time: 530.36
End time: 534.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He bought Jaren Lanier's new book, which I have in hardcover, but thank you anyway. I'm  glad to have it now.

Start time: 536.13
End time: 537.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually that's Tom's, isn't it?

Start time: 537.77
End time: 542.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's not mine.  Yeah.  Oh, good. So that's not mine. So I have Infinite Jest Ream-D.

Start time: 542.64
End time: 543.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yours is at home if you recall.

Start time: 544.08
End time: 573.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Now I feel better. Now I feel better. But I mean, that's thousands and thousands  of pages. Oh, I know what else I have on there. Steve Gibson's been begging me to read these  Honor Harrington books. You ever read on Basilisk Station?  No.  It sounds trashy, but anyway, that's on there.  Sounds trashy.  It sounds pretty trashy sci-fi. But that's going to get me a month's worth of reading.  And it weighs nothing.  No.  Four gigs, by the way, not eight gigs. Thank you.

Start time: 573.66
End time: 575.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fast. I'm actually really impressed at how fast the screen is.

Start time: 575.52
End time: 604.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The page turns much better than the original Kindle. So that's the low end and then there's  the touch version. But of course, all the press attention goes to the Fire, which is  a $200 color tablet running Android, highly customized Android with a cover flow style  interface. You get a month of Amazon Prime with that, which is brilliant. The analysts  are saying that Amazon is at best breaking even, probably losing a little bit of money.  Supposedly makes $209 in parts.  According to iSupply. Yeah. And iSupply is usually pretty good. I mean, it's hard for

Start time: 605.04
End time: 607.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  them to know exactly what it's cost.  But it drops in time anyway.

Start time: 608.12
End time: 625.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why does anybody care if they're losing money? Because we don't even think twice. Consoles,  you're paying like half the price of a console. Phones are subsidized. Amazon obviously, I  think Amazon sees an opportunity because the entire non-iOS tablet market is functionally  non-existent.

Start time: 626.22
End time: 667.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and what underscores, I think, is the fact that Amazon, this is a portal to Amazon's  money making machine. It's a store portal. So that's really what's going on here. Of  course, they lose money. Who cares? They could give it away because they're going to make  so much money on the thing.  Magazines, they've got almost every magazine publisher involved in this. And interestingly  enough, many of the magazines will be customized for the Fire with audio video. They'll be  interactive. So they'll be, it won't be totally different. Well, I don't know. You know, it's  now, by the way, if you're looking at the video right now, you look, it does look a  little bit like the BlackBerry Playbook. Apparently.  It is the BlackBerry.  It is the BlackBerry Playbook. Same manufacturer, right?

Start time: 667.52
End time: 679.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the BlackBerry Playbook for a lot less money with a much better backend in terms  of services. What I'm curious about is whether or not you'll be able to load any software  you want to on it, which is something nobody's really been able to answer.

Start time: 679.76
End time: 709.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll hack soon. But I mean, right now you have to put the Android apps that  are available in Amazon's Android store. You're right. They may have a special store that  is Fire only. Tablets traditionally haven't done very well on Android. In fact, I have  a couple of Android tablets and it's really a disappointing experience because there's  so few tablet apps for it. This one is seven inches, which is I think a good size. It's  a little bigger than this, but smaller than the iPad. Pocketable. Perceable.

Start time: 710.42
End time: 715.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's pocketable.  This is pocketable. Where is it?

Start time: 718.04
End time: 726.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is it?  It's right there.  It's in my pocket. Talk about it. Not only is it in my pocket, I can put it in the pocket  with my phone. Now it's doubly pocketable.

Start time: 726.52
End time: 729.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see it.  That's kind of a big pocket, Leo.  Can't get it out.

Start time: 729.52
End time: 736.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you've got an oversized pocket.  It's a captive kangaroo pocket. No, let's put it in that pocket.  No, it won't fit.  You didn't try very hard.

Start time: 736.44
End time: 738.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. I tried real hard. You must have quit.

Start time: 743.16
End time: 753.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, it is relatively pocketable. I was actually talking about the Fire, which is  bigger than that. I don't think it's pocketable, but seven inches is a nice size. Dan, which  would you buy if it were your money?

Start time: 754.92
End time: 815.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it were my money? Well, look, I'm a reader and I enjoy the E Ink screen. I mean, that's  far more important to me, like Patrick said, reading on the iPhone. Not only choose your  battery up, but choose your eyes up. At the same time, this is important because it's  the actualization of the ecosystem. So what every other company has failed to do, Google,  Blackberry, Blah Blah Rim, Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah, Amazon has really wrapped the ecosystem  into the device itself from the opposite direction as Apple. And what that does for me is not  so much about the device or the ecosystem itself, but it communicates trust. I can trust  that Amazon has thought this through. And as a consumer, if I'm going to plunk down  cash, I don't want to plunk down cash on a platform that's going to go away in two months  or two years. I know that Bezos has thought this through. He's playing the long game.  He must be a go player. He plays the long game. And I know that if I spend money, I  can trust that it'll stay in that cloud.

Start time: 815.80
End time: 818.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying, Dan, you did not buy an HP touchpad.

Start time: 819.16
End time: 828.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought 18 of them. I mean, that's important too, because it helps me. I actually bought  three of them and I gave them to friends and it really helps with buy-in.

Start time: 828.98
End time: 831.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A hundred bucks, you mean? At $99, it helps with buy-in.

Start time: 832.62
End time: 843.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, at $99. But I have a lot of friends who are PhD students and cynics and they're  not entirely bought in on the need for more gadgets in their lives. This changed their  minds.

Start time: 844.96
End time: 859.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So get this. According to VentureBeat, Devendra Hardwar writing in MobileBeat says that Amazon  is in serious negotiations to buy Palm, not even just WebOS, but Palm from HP.

Start time: 861.16
End time: 869.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many sources are on that?  Yeah.  A well-placed source.  Which means what?  A well-placed source.  Yeah. It seems a little far-fetched. I can't-

Start time: 869.38
End time: 882.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an awesome rumor. It'd be cool.  Why would they bother? It sounds like they've done a good job making Android accessible.  Yeah, I mean, yeah. Why?  Plus Amazon has an Android app store.

Start time: 883.58
End time: 897.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, I don't understand what- I can't find one single-  But what you can.  Yeah. Tell me one advantage Amazon gets out of purchasing Palm's- I mean, basically IP  at this point, which has not been a spectacular success for HP.

Start time: 898.36
End time: 939.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, according to Dealbook, it's all about the patents, baby. Amazon might be more interested  in the Palm patents to protect Fire. Remember, Microsoft and others have been on an Android  lawsuit tear. Of course, they stay away from Google because they got the deep pockets.  But I could see people suing Apple or Microsoft suing Amazon over the Kindle. Can't you see  Apple going after- Apple for sure.  Yes. They sue everybody.  And so if you had these patents in hand, maybe it'd be worth it. HP bought Palm for $1.2  billion. I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

Start time: 941.46
End time: 945.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, maybe we know another price. Maybe it's like 18 bucks and a pack of smokes.

Start time: 946.66
End time: 950.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, like-  HP went for- bought Palm for $1.2 billion last year.

Start time: 953.60
End time: 964.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would tend to think that if Palm is sitting on a lot of really lucrative, defensive patents,  then Google or somebody else would be bidding large amounts of cash for them.

Start time: 965.24
End time: 990.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may be. We don't know. What we don't know is what we don't know. To coin a phrase  that Donald Rumsfeld came up with first. Well, there's what we know, there's what we know,  don't know, we don't know, and the know that we don't know that we could know, but we don't  know. If you know what I mean.  It's gotten to this.  I knew I shouldn't have had a cup of coffee before the show. How is your coffee, by the  way, John?  Bitter.  Yeah, just like you.  Exactly.

Start time: 991.22
End time: 994.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We try to give everybody the coffee they deserve.  I like the reflection.

Start time: 995.08
End time: 1000.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mine's weak. And of course, Patrick's is strong and black.

Start time: 1000.78
End time: 1009.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrick's is gone.  Wow, you went right through that.  I'm not an amateur. Do we care about Amazon and California sales tax or should we push  straight onto the iPhone?

Start time: 1010.46
End time: 1062.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened there because they were able to broker a compromise with Governor Brown.  So just to give you the backstory, and maybe you can give us an update once we get the  backstory, but Amazon, as you know, does not collect sales tax if it can help it. State  of California passed a law, I think earlier this year, saying, no, you got to because  you do business in this state, at which Amazon responded, okay, fine, we don't do business  in this state and cut off all of the Amazon associates fees for people like me. I mean,  that's 30,000 a year out the door. By the way, $30,000, which I paid a California state  income tax on.  They like to double tax in this state.  You know, well, they lost that tax. And, you know, basically it was a showdown between  the state of California and Amazon. Now, I think California didn't blink exactly, but  they gave them some time.

Start time: 1062.56
End time: 1072.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, basically the LA Times summary of it is pretty good. The company, Amazon, would  drop its battle to overturn the state's new law that required it and many other out of  state online retailers to collect taxes.

Start time: 1072.30
End time: 1075.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Overstock.com, another company that said, we're not doing business in California then.

Start time: 1075.96
End time: 1088.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of funny because they didn't say they weren't doing business in California  because California is, you know, more than 10% of the population of the United States.  Nobody wants to stop selling to California. Nobody wants to cut sales tax.

Start time: 1089.14
End time: 1097.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they can sell to them. By the way, California does attempt to collect. The issue is not  whether you're supposed to pay sales tax. You are.

Start time: 1097.86
End time: 1102.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  California is on the, like many other states, is on the honor system for paying sales tax  for online or out of state places.

Start time: 1102.94
End time: 1140.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the honor system? Because they said on My California 540R Return, did you buy  anything and not pay sales tax for it? They call it use tax. And they said how much? We  paid $6,000 in use tax last year.  For what?  Stuff I bought on Amazon. Because everybody else collects sales tax, but Amazon does not.  So we actually did that. We paid that tax. So California lost not only the income tax  I paid on my associates fee, but the, well, they didn't lose the use tax, but you got  to think that I'm going to be less likely to pay it. Particularly if Amazon starts collecting.  But anyway, Amazon is not collecting it. It doesn't have to for a couple of years now.

I mean, it's, it's, what's kind of interesting about looking at this  is, is, you know, you can kind of have the Cory Doctorow moment and be like, this is  exactly like what happened when Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs began destroying  the markets in downtown America. And it's like that battle, it's, it's kind of ironic  because literally the, the local retailers are crying foul. We can't compete. This is  terrible.  I understand.  On the flip side, the only reason this, this, this came, the only reason this passed even  the California state assembly is because they want more revenue. And this seemed like an  easy way to pay it.

Transcript:  By the way, devil to you saying, and I think this is true that after this brokered deal,  Amazon has said we're going to build two distribution centers in California. So they're going to  hire people. They're going to put money into the California economy. So a good deal for  California because the sales tax will be collected in a couple of years. I'm not sure why Amazon  made this deal, to be honest.

Transcript:  Okay.  Where would you?  I know I got friends who run kitchens in Nevada. They, they, they would love to find more people  that were worth employing. And no, sorry. I mean, the other thing is like everything  I've read about Amazon's fulfillment centers, there's a couple of really good articles about  this.

Start time: 1230.74

Transcript:  It's all done with robots.  It's not all done with robots actually.  Giant Japanese robots.  And they, they're, they're almost almost entirely done with temps.  So they...  Oh, you're kidding. So they don't have to pay any benefits.  So they, they bring in people, they, they have incredibly high standards for the performance  in the fulfillment centers. And if people can't live up to that or they get injured  or whatever, they are temps, they fall off and they have more people willing to step  in. So there's, there's some pretty, you know, some pretty kind of classic taking advantage  of the labor pool in that situation too.

Start time: 1258.30
End time: 1267.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing...  Go ahead.  The thing is not to be undersold here. I mean, this is the worst economy since Jesus was  a sophomore and this is the right time for Amazon to have this fight because they have

Start time: 1336.86
End time: 1340.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1343.78
End time: 1354.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people bought that 99. A million people bought a touchpad.  I think, frankly, that it won't take a big chunk, but I think you could, 20, 30% of the  iPad market could conceivably buy a Kindle and be happy.

Start time: 1355.06
End time: 1362.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what the funny thing is?  Angry Birds, books, movies, TV.  I bet you half of those people already have an iPad and they just buy one out of curiosity.  They'd be like you. They're kind of like pack rats.

Start time: 1363.00
End time: 1393.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it's maybe...  I totally disagree, John. I think that this is an entirely different market that's going  to be buying this. These people may be aspirational towards the iPad, like they may want to buy  an iPad, but $500 is a big expense right now. $200 is a much easier expense. It lets you  get into that marketplace. It lets you be that type of consumer at a significantly reduced  rate. And it lets you have a multiple...  It is a Kindle. At the same time, it's a tablet. It's not a high-end tablet, but what this  does is redefine the marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, I was going to say, I'm with you because you're looking at like Amazon Prime last week.  They set up a deal. Everybody with an Amazon Prime account has access to 11,000 Fox titles,  all the movies, all the television shows. Basically, as part of the Amazon Prime subscription,  I think there's a huge number of Amazon customers that will opt into this because it is an extension  of the existing products they already have.

Start time: 1416.78
End time: 1429.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Prime is so brilliant because you pay for Prime. They give you free movies, but  really what they do is they give you the right to buy more stuff from Amazon. I mean, I go  to Amazon first just because I'm a Prime member.

Start time: 1430.46
End time: 1444.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this may even help them make the bigger deals down the line. I mean, Fox is wonderful  now and think of the deals that if they're able to go to when they're in their biz dev  meetings, you know, the guys with blazers and jeans and they're going to their biz dev  meetings, this helps them say...

Start time: 1450.08
End time: 1469.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it helps them make bigger deals down the line. It helps them say, our audience isn't  just this potential audience of people who maybe have an Xbox or a Roku and hook it up  to their TV.  This lets them say, these people are streaming right now on this device. This audience is  much larger than it previously was. It's not a speculative audience. It's a real audience.

It was a tool that was basically was the predecessor to GoToAssist.  Expert exchanges and like that.  It's called the remotums and pain.  Well, that's the problem.  I mean, times have changed.  Everybody's on the Internet now.  And GoToAssist Express is so amazing.  This is the way you can support your customers faster, easier.  Puts you in a position to do what you do best, which is access the system,  diagnose the problem and resolve the problem.  And most of the time, it's so much, it's instant almost.

You'll be getting more done faster, easier.  You can fix the problem without being there in person, of course.

I think the stealth announcement in here is that Amazon's got its own browser, which  initially will be on the Kindle, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it on other platforms.  Amazon will be caching, pre-caching pages on its own servers, on its EC2 servers.  So it's using its very, very powerful cloud system.  By the way, many of the sites you visit and many of the assets for sites you visit come  from Amazon's S3 and EC2.  So they're going to have a very fast browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  Yes, we are.  This is the problem.  I think that a lot of people complain about this.  Instead of releasing technical information about the Kindle, they released basically  marketing information that makes it very unclear what they're doing.  For instance, SSL.  They're doing something similar to the Opera Mini browser, which is they're compressing  and shrinking pages on their way to you.  The only way you could do that is by breaking SSL, by doing, in effect, a man in the middle  so that you'll have a certificate to fire or to a Silk.  Then Silk will have its own certificate to your bank.  It's not clear if they're doing that or not.  The FAQ is very fuzzy about that.

Transcript:  Bad.  Update.  September 29th, 920 a.m.  A spokesperson for Amazon just pinged O'Mack.  Is Amazon able to peer into its customer usage behavior and use that to offer services based  on that data?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The answer is no.  As you can see in our terms and condition, URLs are used to troubleshoot and diagnose  Amazon silk technical issues.  Moreover you can choose to operate Amazon silk in basic or off-cloud mode.  That's the key.  That's the key.  Generally to go directly to your computer rather than pass through our servers.  As a reminder, usage data is collected anonymously and stored in aggregate and no personal identifiable  information is stored.  It's also possible to completely turn off the split browsing mode and use Amazon silk  like a conventional web browser.

No, it's a middleman between you and Google and it takes the cookies and says, yeah, yeah,  I'll take the cookies and then it throws them all over.  So it's kind of a proxy Google.

Transcript:  Well, I'm going to put a link to Scroogle in my Google Docs and make sure that I email  to everybody on Gmail so that all my friends can protect themselves from the Google search  engine.  Just saying.  The last thing, Google gets so much information from me in so many other ways like my Android  phone.  I can't use Scroogle on my Android phone.  Speaking of which, I like this phone.  This is the Galaxy S2, the Sprint version.  Did you hear what happened though with the AT&T version?  So I use a lock on my screen so that when John gets my phone he can't look into it.  One of these pattern locks.  But John, if you have the AT&T version and you've got this lock turned on, all you have  to do is let it do what it just did, go back to sleep and then when you press the button  again it's wide open.  Not a problem on other Galaxy.  You don't have that on your international Galaxy S2.  I'm surprised they still use that pattern thing.

If you're using a phone like that, make sure you wipe it.  Now let's talk about iOS.  Apparently iOS will have some new locking features including, I'm told, a pattern unlock.  In fact, they basically stole every Android feature they could find.

The trouble is they're not Steve Jobs.  It would be a huge mistake for Tim Cook, who is emphatically not Steve Jobs, for him to  do anything but be Tim Cook, because he's not exactly Mr. Charisma.

We now have a model number that will be basically an 8GB iPhone 4.  There will be the 4S, which is barely new.  Where's the pen?  That's the N94 model.  It will have a 3.5 inch screen, not bigger.  It will have CDMA and GSM in one phone so they can sell it to all three carriers.  We're pretty sure Sprint will have it.  We know T-Mobile won't.  They said they won't.  HSPA Plus.  Now this is the thing that I was told by an inside source at AT&T.  They recently received a shipment of MicroSIMs for 4G on AT&T and there is only one phone  currently on AT&T that has MicroSIMs.  Oh my goodness.  So I think maybe, we were thinking there would be no 4G.  That's what I was thinking.  But I think maybe there will be.

And I can do it on the Android phone too.  But finally, you'll be able to do that on an iPhone.  The idea is that they've bought, remember they bought Siri, this really kind of cool  application where you could say book a table for two at Cyrus, and it would go out and  do what you need.  Yeah.  It's voice control on steroids.  It's the new assistant.  So it has a deep voice is what you're saying.  It will not work on earlier versions of the iPhone.  Probably won't even work on the low end because the new iPhone has not only a dual core processor  but a gig of RAM and you do need that kind of horsepower.

Steve Jobs' last decade there has kind of been personified by those first silhouette  advertisements of the people with the iPods and the things sticking out of it.  And to kill that off at the same time that Steve is leaving the company.  I think I mean, I think you guys are absolutely right.  It's probably destined to happen.  I would love a half terabyte or a terabyte iPod just to, you know, for the iconic value  of it.  It doesn't serve much of a purpose anymore, but it's really the timing is very interesting.  And I think it's you know, we move past the icon of the of the iPod and past the icon  of the man at the same time.  Go on.

This really changed everything.  But I wouldn't be surprised.  You're right.  Everybody's buying iPhones or other phones that have plenty of capacity on there.  I put in this phone, I put a 32 gig SD card and you know, it's got now 40 gigs in here.  You already saw this phone.  I know what you're up to.  Yes.

Well, I got to say, brilliant, because it's not just great software, which is of course  what happened with Anthony, but they've also got the best hosting.  And I think that that really solves a problem for a lot of people.  When you want to create your new website, you've got to find a web host and then you  have to figure out how to put stuff on it.  This solves that completely.  It's all in Java.  You Java One fans will love that, including an amazing, very sophisticated Java virtual  server technology.  That means you always have plenty of bandwidth.  It's impossible to bring down a Squarespace site.  It's incredible.  Why don't you make one for yourself right now?  Just go to squarespace.com.  You click that green button.  All you need is a name for your site.  What should we call it?  Twitch.  What was it?  What?  Twitch.  This week in computer hardware dot Squarespace dot com.  Password Patrick loves coffee.  And then the email address, leo at leoville dot com.  That's how easy it is.  Now, if somebody has Twitch, it won't work, but let's see.  Oh, good.  Nobody had Twitch.  So now that's it.  You notice I didn't put in a credit card number.  I didn't give them any personal information.  the email so they can notify me after two weeks when there's, you know, the site's  expiring.  For now, for two weeks, I have the complete full Squarespace features.  I have all of the incredible tools, the design tools I have.  And by the way, 60 plus designer templates mean you start with the basics and then you  can do amazing stuff.  You don't have to know JavaScript or CSS, but if you do, of course, you can modify it  to your heart's content.  It supports everything.  You've got great plugins too for social media.  So it's very simple.  Did you see that?  I'm now in.  I got a site.  Now, I gave you the password, so I'm just going to let you all mess with this site and  we'll come back later and check it out.  What was the password again?  You remember that Patrick loves coffee.  That's what it was.  Twitch dot Squarespace dot com.  Now, if you like that site after creating it, you can sign up after two weeks and say,  I'm going to that's going to make it mine.  The longer you sign up for the less it costs, you can view to your commitment.  You get 10 bucks a month monthly, $13.33 a month.  But here's the special deal I want to tell you about.  If you use the offer code twit 10, because we're in October now, twit one zero, you'll  get 20% off for the first six months of your site.  So you get an additional incentive to give it a try.  Free to try, very affordable to run.  It's hosting plus the best software out there.  This is the great way to create websites.  We'll go back and check twitch dot Squarespace dot com a little later on.

Transcript:  I think partially at this point because I think there's a really interesting line that  Google's kind of standing up on one side and Microsoft is on the other.  Is Google going to basically start hurling money at giant fleets of lawyers to try to  work their way through the courts to change patent law in the United States?  Or are they going to try to basically drop a giant series of checks in Washington to  try to change patent law by legislature?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The answer's no.  No, no.  I mean, what they do not want to have happen is two things.  One, you don't want the legislation to... you don't want to go the legislative route  unless you are positive you have bought those legislators because it will establish law  that could not be in your favor.  And you definitely don't want to go to court because you could set a precedent that could  absolutely not be in your favor.  So I mean, I would say settlement privately is probably...  Most likely, and again, I'm only speculating.  I don't have any knowledge of this, but I would say the last thing you want to do is  have a precedent that is not in your favor because it's very hard to overturn that.

Magic the gathering.  With patents.  That patents the gathering.  I like that.  Interesting that you should say that because...  Does he got a game show coming up?  Yes, as a matter of fact, we do.  But that's another story entirely.  I'm looking for the quote here.  Brad Smith says at the end of this article, regarding patent issues, ultimately we will  see licensing regimes emerge.  Like the MPEG-IV consortium.  This doesn't mean there won't be some dramatic events between now and that time happens.  It really does sound like Waterloo.

Where are you going?  Sit down!  I could see Ballmer doing that.  And yes, I was one of those folks who wandered to the upper portion of the seats while Mr.  Ballmer passed on his coachy wisdom from Friday Night Lights.

The real story here, and we threw this into the rundown, is not the particular politics  of those involved, but it is how the group has organized and really used the social web  to, I don't want to say force, I think that is a little strong, but coax traditional  media into covering the event.

And storify is really a very good way to show, like, here is what I've seen.  Here is what I've observed.  Initially the protests were very, very small.  You know, it was a couple dozen to a couple hundred people last week.  When I was there on Friday, there were, you know, one police officer told me that there  were 3,000 people there.  Some of that was due to the rumors that Radiohead was going to be in attendance.  And social media certainly helped spread that, but that rumor died away through the afternoon.  People stayed, the energy stayed high, and the transit workers joined the protest a little  later in the afternoon.

I think that would get me into trouble, and I don't think that that is true, but I do  think that the social web has covered this much better than traditional media has.  And I think that the unions were there, and there were, you know, 3,000 people there cheering  them on because of the social web, not because of traditional media.

Start time: 4097.48
End time: 4138.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's also, a lot of traditional media outlets do not cover protests because they  don't want to encourage people to shut down the Golden Gate Bridge, to, you know, to shut  down the Brooklyn Bridge.  I also got to say, having, I went to Pace.  I lived across the street from City Hall.  Oh, sure, yeah, yeah.  I've had to get through some interesting things to get to, to get back to, you know, where  I was living at that time, where I get to the school.  And props to you for going down there on the street because when things get squirrely in  a protest, and they rarely do, but when they do get squirrely, it is a very frightening  place to be because there's generally nowhere to run to down there.  Right.  Except for the subways, and that's generally not a place where you feel really safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm kind of interested to see this, though, because I think, you know, laying this economy  in the laps, squirreling in the laps of Wall Street is highly appropriate, and I think  this is a real grassroots movement.  This is very interesting.  It's not what Congress is talking about.  It's not what mainstream media is talking about.  I'd be very curious to see if this snowballs.  There's one going on in San Francisco right now.  I do know.  Yeah.

Transcript:  On and off.  That's my understanding.  My son told me that.  He said there's no coverage at all.  And I think you're probably right.  They don't want to cover it because they don't want people shutting down the Golden Gate  Bridge, but it's not the job of the Fourth Estate to do the job, you know, police work  for the U.S. government or the local governments or any other governments.  I think there is a note of responsibility where you don't want to obviously do something  that can make people crazy.  And if you notice this on football, baseball games where the streaker runs out, they never  show it.  I think they should.  That's because they don't want to show peni.  No, they don't want other people running around.

Transcript:  In defense of traditional media, before, and I do have to tell you, until this past Friday,  it was reasonably small, a couple dozen to a couple hundred people, and the mainstream  media doesn't want to.  There are a lot of reasons to say I am nonpartisan.  There is no such thing as an objective journalist, but the audience needs to trust that I'm not  bringing an agenda to a particular story.  And you can traditional media could validate something that is a very small.  And let this protest aside, let's say a nut job protest could gather the same amount of  people.  And if traditional media covers that, it kind of validates that and lends credibility  in a particularly partisan direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I think the source of this is the most important part of this story, right?  There's a ton of companies that do analysis of various parts of social media.  Most of those companies are worth about as much as this 20-sided die,  but this comes from Science and was reprinted in the New York Times.  Even if this is just confirmation bias or kind of telling us what we already know,  this is interesting that it's coming from Science and in the Times. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gets more interesting towards the end of the article.  Social scientists analyzing digital content agree that for all its statistical appeal,  the approach still needs some fine-tuning. They'd agree with you.  On Twitter, people routinely savage others with pure relish and gush sarcastically.  Oh my gosh!  Yeah, the software doesn't pick up sarcasm.  And it doesn't pick up gushing, apparently.  Well, Dr. Gilbert, one of the researchers says,

I think, you know, Der Duve. Did you ever see Der Duve?  No.  It was a parody of a Bergman movie.  When Der Duve comes to the town and anyway, that's what I think of.  When 800,000 Swedes are willing to pay for streaming music,  there's clearly a market for more legal players in the digital music market.

Transcript:  Well, here's actually the article I was thinking of, March 24, 2011, up on Mashable.com.  Basically, we're looking at the stats.  Percentage of U.S. Internet population using peer-to-peer file sharing service to download music decreased from like 16 to 9%.  Wow.  28 million to 16 million users in the fourth quarter of 2010 when LimeWire was shut down.

Start time: 5546.16

End time: 5577.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Between Q4 2007 and Q4 2010, the average number of music files downloaded drops by like 50%.  It's interesting to look at that.  It's also the other really good series of articles was pointing out that the recording industry,  our association spent $64 million on lawyers to recover $1.4 million in settlements.  So it could very well be the lawsuits.

Start time: 5579.30
End time: 5587.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  According to RIM spokeswoman Marissa Conway,  rumors suggesting that the BlackBerry Playbook is being discontinued are pure fiction.  RIM remains highly committed to the tablet market and the future of QNX.  That's the operating system on the Playbook and its platform.  Meanwhile, cutting prices on the BlackBerry Playbook, $200 to $299.99 at Best Buy.  Does that sound committed or just...  Committed, I think is the right word.  It ought to be.  I think they're probably looking at the success of the $99 touchpad and saying,  hmm, is the $199 price that Amazon is going to charge for the Kindle file going to become a benchmark though?  I mean, isn't it going to influence everybody?  Yes.  That's a big deal.

Start time: 5653.74
End time: 5670.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the most important part of that announcement.  I know I said it earlier, but I'll say it again.  That will drive everyone else except Apple to compete in the price point.  And I wouldn't be shocked if Apple puts out a larger iPod touch that could be perceived as competition.  That's got to be the benchmark.

There is no use for the thing. It's terrible.  Why did you buy two?  I bought one and Tom bought one.  Oh.  We thought, oh, it's BlackBerry. How could it be bad?  That is Dan Patterson, ladies and gentlemen.  You can find him at ABCnewsradio.com, at Dan Patterson on Twitter, and of course on the Google+,  where he is very active and Storify too.  I'll have to check out that Storify feed.  You're going to keep posting stuff to that?

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I will, absolutely. I've known Bert for a while.  But this particular story is well-made for something like that.  It's little pieces here and there, and particularly because you may not have access to every single event,  but it's something that summarizes, so no one can say this was under-reported.

Start time: 5742.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I mean, I see those as distribution points.  And from what I see, tell me if I'm wrong, the people who follow on Twitter are very different than the people who follow on Google+.  So I use them as distribution points, and Storify kind of summarizes it.

Start time: 5762.57
End time: 5769.29

Transcript:  Google+, is listening. What they need is updates via SMS.  I returned to Twitter, I would have used Plus to report from the protests,  but because you must use the application and because when there is heavy data use, your phone dies quickly,  the best and fastest way to update anything is still Twitter by text message.  It seems slow and antiquated, but that's the best way to update something when you have very low connectivity.  The Google Plus doesn't have it, means I didn't use Google Plus to report from this event live.

Start time: 5815.76
End time: 5829.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but Mike Elgin wrote an article on how to email posts to Google+, and that's his work around,  is you email to SMS and then it will go to Google+.  For reasons I'm not sure I understand, I remember that the number is 33669.
