Today the child-centric version.  Because in studio with us, Mr. Seamus Norton.  Hello Seamus, how you doing?  And his father, Mr. Patrick Norton.  Hey, good to see you.  Good to be here.  His t-shirt today says, science.  It works, bitches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an XKCD.  If you've never been to the cartoon side XKCD, you should go.  They're into science and math.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody said there's going to be an animated XKCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really frightening thing to contemplate.  Because it's stick figures.  Well, I can deal with stick figure theater actually is one of the best things I've ever  seen.  Where they summarize, you know, it's like bunny theater.  It's basically 60 second summaries of classic cinema like Jaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now also with us, Mr. John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Seamus is looking at the monitor saying dada at the picture.  He's pointing at you and saying dada.  No, you had when you had Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's put Patrick back.  Let's put Patrick.  It's dada on the on the on the monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, channel dvorak.com, dvorak.org slash blog and whatever else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also with us, Mr. Dwight Silverman, all the way from Houston of the Houston Chronicle  and the tech blog at blogs.cron.com slash tech blog.  Hey, Dwight, good to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great to be here, Leo.  Thank you for inviting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had a Windows House party here on Thursday for the launch of Windows 7.  Look, we have a jigsaw puzzle, a Windows 7 jigsaw puzzle, and Seamus is going to put  it together.  That's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are chewing on the pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He can chew it.  I don't do anything he wants with that.  That's a puzzle.  It's a Microsoft.  Well, you know, actually, we had a race.  We wanted to see if it would be faster to install Windows 7 or put the puzzle together  and puzzle one.  But it was a pretty easy puzzle.  Dwight, are you hearing like is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that the picture of the guy floating in midair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what it's the turtle with the city on its back?  One of the few things that they surprised us with, with those of us who'd used the  release candidate 7100.  In fact, as far as I could tell, the only thing that was different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was that they're telling you that the thing runs like a turtle?  Is that what the product is like?  It's like a turtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's turtles all the way down.  I do know that story.  You want to tell it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll do it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great story.  Who was it they were talking to?  It was a lecture and a great physicist was lecturing about the creation in the Big Bang.  Was it, who was it?  Was it Heisenberg or is it Einstein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Feinstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or let me look at a Feynman.  Feinstein.  Feinstein.  Senator Feinstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to look this up.  Great physicist, Dianne Feinstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably if I Google turtles all the way down, I'm sure.  The infinite turtle theory.  So what's in the news this week?  It's an anecdote published by Stephen Hawking.  I'll get to it in a moment.  The widely known version is a well-known scientist.  Some say it was Bertrand Russell once gave a public lecture on astronomy.  He described how the earth orbits around the sun, how the sun orbits around the center  of the vast collection of stars called the galaxy.  At the end of the lecture a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said, what  you've told us is rubbish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, Will Madam, what is the tortoise  standing on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're very clever young man, very clever, but it's turtles all the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great story, classic story.  You know it's funny because that's what that desktop is of a turtle carrying the world.  So I think I would be willing to bet that's a little in-joke from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's about that or it's not about the speed of the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more that than the speed of the product.  You know the product is very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seven is snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show of hands, how many people are using seven?  Yeah, wait until you have, wait, I have a copy.  John is and of course Dwight you're probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait until you have Tuesday, patch Tuesday, patch Tuesday, patch Tuesday, one year from  another thing will be as slow as a pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a website called turtlesallthewaydown.com by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh and what does it have there?  It's a blog, of course.  It's a great name for a blog actually.  So I think Microsoft can rightly proudly pat itself on the back.  This has been a great launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a wonderful apology for Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, well and clearly they were responding to Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clearly they were desperate to regain the lost corporate enthusiasm for upgrading Microsoft  products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well I think part of it was, in fact CNN surprisingly got this I think right.  They wrote an article saying that one of the things Microsoft learned from Vista was you  can't just develop an operating system in secret and throw it over the wall.  You have to include your users and you have to include your hardware manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think OS X has done a pretty good job of developing behind the wall although they are  building on an open source kernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that I made that point actually in a tweet earlier this week because people  were saying, well how come you don't recommend people go to Snow Leopard right away but you  say there's no need to wait on Windows 7.  And the point is that Microsoft beta tested Windows 7 with, now it turns out the telemetry  was 15 million people used the beta of Windows 7.  15 million people over the last year whereas Snow Leopard was tested only by a few thousand  developers and there was no public test.  Now Snow Leopard hasn't had major problems but they've had a few data issues.  Sue could have had a few problems.  If one of the few people had the data issues you might consider it a major problem.  That would be a major problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference is that Apple controls the hardware and Microsoft has no control over  the hardware of what it runs.  It has to hope and work to make sure that it runs on all that various, the whole Windows  ecosystem but Apple can kind of control the environment that it runs in and I think that's  one reason why they can do it in secret.  But Vista had a lot of beta testers too.  I remember seeing on Twitter some complaints when Bomber said that, oh we had all these  beta testers on Windows 7 and that's what made it different, that a lot of people said  hey there were a lot, there were billions of people testing Vista too and complaining  about it at the time and Microsoft didn't seem to do what they needed to do.  They didn't listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that that was part of the problem.  There's also the CNN story talks about Windows Starter Edition where Microsoft proposed that  they were going to do a Starter Edition for Netbooks that only allowed you to run three  applications at the same time.  That worked out.  While Netbook manufacturers howled, rightly so, and Microsoft backed down and that's  something that they might not have done in the Vista days.  So I think it's a chase into Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're still between Microsoft and Intel.  They've managed to cripple an entire generation of Netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but now with the Atom deal where you can't put more than a gig in and all of that.  But now I think with running Windows 7 a Netbook is not so bad.  I think it's, running XP on a Netbook was kind of painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it hasn't bothered me that much.  I'm not trying to do any photo editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  XP reminds me of Fisher Price Operating Systems.  Big buttons and that might have been your term actually.  I think it was.  You coined that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody says that the chat room has been down for some time, but not the chat room  I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, just to please stop paying attention to those people.  What, on Twitter?  The Twitter people?  Pay no attention to those Twitter people.  The kids are coming to Twitter apparently.  Did you see that article?  It's becoming a youth culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two articles like this that have bothered me.  That one and the one that say 20% of the entire US internet population is using Twitter.  Oh yeah, sure.  That's what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They may be signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's like 120 million homes with broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let me see if I can find this article that talks about the kids coming to Twitter.  I've noticed it.  You know where you notice it is on the trending topics?  Because I look on…

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see things that they're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That young people are interested in.  That's trending is not anything I would follow.  I mean, it's weird stuff.  What on Twitter?  Yeah.  Do you ever click those trending…

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've noticed it with my daughter and her friend.  She's a journalism major, so their journalists are more interested in Twitter I think than  the average person, but more and more of her friends are using it.  I try to keep track of what is happening in Houston and I see younger people all the time  getting on it here.  I think that really has been happening for a while.  Probably when it became mainstream, it wound up on places like Oprah and you see constant  references to it in the media.  Too many references.  That's the problem.  Yes, I think so.  I think Twitter is not at the point yet where you can mention it and just automatically  presume that people know what it is.  I think you still have to have a little bit of explanation and you see references to it  all the time without explanation and I don't think it's ready for that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a big shift.  The Pew Internet and American Life Project, which I really love, they kind of dole out  these factoids.  It's kind of an ongoing study.  The research in December found that users in the 25 to 34 year old group were slightly  more likely to use Twitter.  Now it's 18 to 24 is the biggest cohort.  They've got a nice little graph which is reproduced on the HuffPo.  As you can see, the shifting demographics.  It's only a matter of time before us old farts start saying, oh, there's too many kids on  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at trending topics.  Right now it's number one is it should be illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, now click it.  And what you get, you see a lot of these, they're continuations.  It should be illegal dot dot dot and then you, I'm guessing but I think that's what  it is.  Somebody started this up, yeah.  If you use Brizly, which is a Twitter web clone, I mean it's Twitter but it's a different  interface to it and they have this really nice feature on the right where you can look  at the trending topics and click why and somebody will have written an explanation.  In this case it says people are tweeting things they think should be illegal to do.  Then there's another one, you know you are a thug.  You know you're a thug when.  Right.  It's kids.  It's like that.  That is kids.  It's kids and it kind of and then there's you know it's Sunday so there's the Bears,  the Saints, the Cowboys.  This is not, this trending topics is not a useful use of Twitter but I think very interesting  this week that Twitter sold its fire hose to Facebook, I'm sorry to Bing and Google  as did Facebook.  Although Facebook didn't sell it.  Facebook apparently gave the information for indexing and Google has announced they're  going to do something called social search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not going to mix it up with the regular search I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to do both I think.  Bing is already, if you search for a hot current topic on Bing you'll get tweets as well as  regular pages.  Like Miss Frank.  Yeah, I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  Maybe someone in the chat room knows.  What's Miss Frank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to go back to Brizzy.  I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Miss Frank.  Okay it's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chat room versus.  The little group from the X Factor this week's losing act in some sort of British idol thing.  You beat them.  You beat the chat room.  Yes I did.  Of course I did.  I've got Brizzy on my side.  So what do you think Dwight?  I like Brizzy.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that cool?  Oh you haven't seen it before?  Oh I had signed up for it but I hadn't explored it.  But for the trending topics and trying to figure out what the hell people are talking  about this is excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's a wiki thing because you can explain it if it's not explained or you can add your  explanation to it.  Alright, well anyway.  I know you hate the Twitter stuff but I want to know about what you think about the notion  of real time search being incorporated into Bing.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think searching tweets is like going to be valuable to anybody.  I think there's some value to it.  I think if there's a special tab and you could just do that only.  Well that's what Google wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want to do a social search which takes the information from your Google profile.  I don't know if you've created a Google profile yet but you can.  I refuse.  You want to see mine?  As you know I do everything.  Google.com slash profile slash Laporte.  And so if you actually populate it you'll have all of the websites you use, all your  Facebook log and all that stuff.  Google uses that information and then puts together a customized search based on the  people you follow on all of those sites.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Laporte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google.com slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that's too complicated though?  That's fairly, that's a fairly complex thing.  It says it doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google.com slash profiles.  Oh profiles.  I, complicated because you have to set up a profile.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  But I think if, I think that, well Google's trying to make these profiles more useful.  If you use Wave for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just a million pictures of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the features of a Google profile.  No, no.  One of the features is it'll get your Flickr feed so you can put your pictures in there  so that that way people know what I look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a way for some stalker to make it easy.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, this is your, in my opinion, this is a way that you can control what Google  puts out about you.  Now the problem is that this shows up at the bottom of a Google search for you.  If it showed up at the top I think it'd be a little bit better.  But the idea is that if somebody searches for my name and the search results are my  Google profile, this is the official stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you can just.  You control it.  Bogus it up to the max.  You can do whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're, if you're Vivek Chandra you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When did you live in Santa Cruz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went to Santa Cruz High School.  You didn't know that about me, see?  If you visited my profile once in a while you'd know a little more about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That explains it.  I'm a hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I went, we moved from Rhode Island and when I was in 10th grade I went to Santa Cruz  High and graduated from Santa Cruz High.  Then left.  As quickly as I, my little feet could scamper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how is this different from Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the other thing is that Facebook has also said we will give Bing and Google status  updates, news information and so forth.  But because Facebook has this privacy issue, they'll only do it if users say it's okay  and they say they're going to modify how Facebook works so that users can specify and are encouraged  I guess to specify that their updates are public.  They really, you know, Facebook's got Twitter envy.  That's pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh definitely.  And that's odd because they're so much bigger than Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, isn't that silly?  They're growing faster.  They've got more going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Facebook isn't as cool as, there's a cool factor with Twitter that Facebook doesn't  have.  Facebook, you know, I think I've said it before here and others have said it, it's AOL for  the 21st century and I think they know that and you know they would like to be something  cooler than AOL but that's basically what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could be worse.  They're actually almost classmates.com for the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually a little bit worse.  Wacka, let's go over some of this stuff.  People need to know this.  What is Wacka Poopa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John has discovered the, what do you mean Wacka Poopa?  Now it is Wacka, oh Wacka, what are you looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh this is my profile.  There's a list on your profile.  Okay.  Here's the stuff that Leo belongs to.  Let's go over some of these things.  Wacka Poopa, I'll tell you what Wacka Poopa.  Claim ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, okay.  Claim ID is an open ID site that tells you which, if you click on it, you'll see my claim  ID page and it shows you all the sites that I say I am responsible for and all the sites  and sites that I'm not.  So for instance, there's a not me section that has my fake Facebook page, my fake blog,  my fake life.  So it's kind of a, you claim this.  Okay.  All right.  Wacka Poopa tracks the applications you use and posts them on a social site.  Why?  Who cares?  It's a great site.  You don't know about Wacka Poopa?  No.  So the deal with Wacka Poopa is you can see what other people are using.  You can get some information about what's good.  Okay.  I'll check it out.  You can see how you use your computer.  For instance, I know that last week I used Mail, Apple Mail, then Firefox and VMware  Fusion the most.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although how do you feel Leo about kind of broadcasting the apps that you're using out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there?  Well, you know, I'll tell you where it gets a little squirrely.  It also does, they added recently web apps.  So you got to be careful.  Yeah.  You got to stay off the porn sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Discuss comments.  Discuss comments, Discuss is a commenting system that I use on one of my blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's pronounced Dis-scus with a Q?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I pronounced it wrong.  You know, I found out that Posterous is actually Posterous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's preposterous.  Exactly.  That was the earlier version.  So okay.  Discuss comments is what again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a commenting system for blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, fine.  So basically the open thing it just puts crap in.  Delicious, book markets we know.  YouTube we know.  Flickr, Smug Mug, that's my photo site.  Smug Mug!  Google reader, links to your Facebook, Twitter, army, that's your thing.  Does anybody still do that?  Twitter army thing?  Friend feed, what's TUM blog?  Tumblr?  You know Tumblr?  Yeah, I know Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's this?  Well that's my Tumblr blog.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's all my stuff.  That's why it's at the bottom.  Those are like the, that's like the dregs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I will check out Wacupa.  Wacupa's cool.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That actually I like even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you on it already?  Oh yeah.  You're all logged in?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  It's called Alternative 2.  Alternative, wait a minute, is that right?  Alternative.  I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to have to, I have to find the website now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alternative2.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's not right, unfortunately.  Oh, what is it?  It's Alternative2.net.  Sorry.  Alternative2.net.  Proofer1.com.  What did I get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, you went to the wrong one.  Alternative2.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It shows you how to get to the site.  It shows you how to get to the site.  It shows you alternatives to mainstream applications.  So you say, well, I can't afford to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why am I getting a Twit search box here all of a sudden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to the Twit Cottage.  I own everything in here, even your searches.  Huh.  Now that's, you know what that is?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open, it's OpenDNS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know about OpenDNS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard of it, but I don't know anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the DNS we use here in the Twit Cottage is monitoring what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I make some error on the line, it takes over?  It takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It takes over.  So you must mean something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It automatically adds it to John's Google profile.  All of his errors are moved by Wacupa to his profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what it is, John, is there's a vast world of Web 2.0 sites out there that you've just apparently ignored.  No, I actively ignore.  You don't want to know anything about.  And this is why John and I, it's like Lennon McCartney.  It's like yin and yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, this is coming from a guy who, Leo, a guy who never answers his email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm too busy playing with Wacupa, who has time for email.  Lennon and McCartney.  No, because you, you, you, you hate everything on site and I love everything on site.  You're Lennon on McCartney.  That was basically their, their, their, their MO.  That's possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul always seems to.  So this means Dvorak is dating Yoko Ono?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've met Mimi.  Let's see.  I want to talk about Windows 7 a little bit more.  Can we take a break?  Because I could see John's had a little too much caffeine.  I have to titrate his dose here for a little bit.  He's feisty today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you do that, before you go into the commercial, what was the name of the site I'm looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alternative2.net.  T.O.  T.O.  Alternative2.net.  The idea being you're looking for Photoshop.  You don't want to spend that much money.  What's a good alternative?  And it's uses kind of a dig style voting as people voted up and down.  You're not, you're still not finding it.  I got it.  Yeah.  I'm on it now.  It's cool site.  Go take a look at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want to go baste meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no meat.  You can baste here.  Unless you brought like a grill with you.  Did you bring your hibachi?  Did you ever have a hibachi?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you might.  Seems like a hibachi type.  Let me talk about Audible actually this week because there's a special offer from Audible.com.  So we have a new Audible URL.  Audible has a really cool sequel to the audio book of the year.  Last year, remember the Chopin manuscript we talked about?  They brought together 16 authors, great thriller authors, to create a book called the Copper Bracelet.  People like Jeffrey Deaver and Lisa Scattellini, Lee Child, Joseph Finder.

What are you looking at me like that for?  Two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One, my wife is listening to an Audible book.  Yeah, what is she listening to?  That Michelle Malkin book.  And she like it?  She thinks it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Malkin is the right-wing nutball.  And is your wife a right-wing nutball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she's actually more of the reporter type that just doesn't do well on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Malkin is? I thought she was another one of those.  She's actually a legitimate journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But she is a right-wing nutball, but she's a reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not a talk show host type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, she can't. I don't think she could do it.  I think she wouldn't be able to pull it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the book?  I don't know.  Well, just search for Michelle Malkin.  It's the hot book.  It is. It's hot right now. I remember seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very hot. It's very good.  Now, why I was looking funny is because you got 3205 over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's not the right time. That time's crazy.  I don't know what's wrong with that thing.  It's had the wrong time ever since we put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it recording? You sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know why it says 3202.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's interesting that the VU meter, I can see it from here so I can kind of modulate my voice without a headset.  You want me to turn that a little more towards you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, now you can watch it. You can turn this too.  You can see what camera's next.  You can see when you're about to be on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a rocket. It's like the Houston Center in this place.  I know. I love it.  That's the reason that Lauterbach came in.  He just wanted to see it.  He didn't really want to be on the show. He just wanted to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was having lunch with him and he says, what about Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said, oh, you got to see this place.  Oh, good.  I said, this is against the one-man shop. It's the combo dream come true.  I hope he enjoyed it.  He says, you're kidding.  I said, it's Leo's place.  And by the way, anyone who's out there that can make a possibly visit this, you should.  Oh, yeah. We invite people come by all the time.  We have like 20 people here for our Windows party.  Leo's studio. You're supposed to have nine.  I know. I only had nine napkins.  Leo's studio is probably the most advanced podcasting system in the world.  I almost feel bad because people come by who want to start podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you probably put them off. Oh, my God.  How much did you spend on this?  It's about $100,000 worth of gear.  Probably by now it is. Yeah, actually, you're right. It is. Come to think of it.  Yeah, I need to come by sometime next time.  I would love you to come visit. I would love you to come visit.  Do go to audible.com slash twit copper. I guess I jumped the gun and I apologize.  You must have been jumping the shark.  Or get the Michelle Malkin book.  It's apparently very entertaining.  It's apparently very entertaining.  I'm sorry I said she was a right wing nutball. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she is a right wing nutball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But she's also a journalist and she does a lot of research.  I mean, she's not writing. You know all these other right wingers that write the books are just.  It's all rhetoric. It's all.  Yeah, she actually has stuff she's dug up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, good. Then I should read it.  Culture of corruption, Obama and his team of tax cheats, crooks and cronies. That's it.  That's the book.  That's a balanced look. Fair and balanced look at the Obama administration right there.  I'm downloading it right now because I want to show you that I am an open minded fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. That's how much of it you listen to before you go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I drive my car off the side of the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does she read it herself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Johnny Heller does. You want to listen? Let's listen a little bit. This is Johnny Heller reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brain power and political muscle this early in a cabinet in our lifetimes.  I could tell where she's going on this. But I like the I like the Stefanopoulos dribbling.  The problem that she has my wife caught this is that she  has a little bit of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem that she has my wife caught this is that she she writes for reading, silent reading.  She doesn't write for a book reader and for somebody to read. Sometimes that can be hard. Yeah.  And that's actually something that writers. This is like I tell writers about your writing for a magazine or a newspaper is different than writing for the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you write online. You taught me. You taught me very early on because I did some writing for you.  And this was very valuable to me to always read out loud.  Oh, yeah. That's like part of your final edit is to read it out loud.  And you're you're always your writing always had I could hear your voice maybe because I know you but I could hear your voice when I read your writing.  Yeah. And it is it's almost spoken word. Do you do that, Dwight? Do you do you read out your stuff out loud before you file?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, unless I'm doing it for audio like if I'm doing something for radio. But for the most part, I don't.  And and I write horribly for radio if I don't do that.  It's I have complex sentences and lots of commas and and semi colons.  And and I just I'm terrible at that. I have to stop myself and change it deliberately when I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. Well, that was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to talk more about when I do want to talk a little bit more about Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you heard Dwight? Because I know you're you've got your finger on the pulse of users.  Have you heard of any problems? They're complaining vociferously. Are they?  No, no, no. The complaint with they say getting your hand off my fingers, but get your fingers off my pulse.  But nobody have you heard of any problems? I mean, this is the thing that kind of the the other shoe to drop.  You kind of wait for when a new operating system comes out.  It seems to me that Windows 7 was very robust, very reliable, very solid.  But you never know until it goes wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing that I've heard, two things I've heard from a couple of people who have had very long installations.  If you remember, back in September, there was a Microsoft engineer who did a blog post where he said that if you have a lot of data on your drive, when you do it, upgrade.  It takes a long time. And I've heard from a couple of readers who said that that's happened to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a rationale? I'm sorry, Dwight. Is there a rationale for this? Is there an explanation for this anomaly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way both Vista and Windows 7 work is they kind of scoop out when you're doing an upgrade, they kind of scoop out your existing installation and set it aside.  And then they put down the Windows 7 bits and then they go back and kind of plug in your your setup before.  And apparently when it goes back and plugs in the setup before, if you have a lot of programs and a lot of data, it's a very complex process.  And and that makes it happen very slowly.  If you're doing something like a clean install or a custom install, it's like 20 to 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really fast. But that's by the way what everybody should be doing is a right as a custom install.  You know, it's crazy to try to upgrade an operating system in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Particularly if you have if you keep all your data on the same drive as your operating system and in the in the scenario that the Microsoft engineer was talking about,  it was a huge amount of data and and 40 programs and it was all on the same drive.  And and what you should do is move that kind of data off onto a separate driver, an external drive at the very least when you're doing the upgrade.  Or that's how you should run period. You know, you shouldn't keep your data on the same drive with your operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I have a Dell laptop that I had separate partitions for my data and the operating system.  Of course, all the applications just because of the way windows work still have to be on really should be on the C drive.  You can move that program file folder, but it's always a mistake.  So so I had to reinstall apps. But boy, it was a smooth. I did a clean install to I wiped the drive installed seven.  You can this is weird. Paul Thurotte came up with the work around. It's a very weird work around.  You can use the upgrade media to do a completely clean install and install as if there's never been any windows there at all.  But you have to do what you do is you install it without the activation key.  You know, you format the drive, install it without the activation key.  And then there's a little bit of a registry modification and there's a command line you run.  And then you enter the activation key and you're fine, which means no one should buy the full version of Windows seven.  You don't need it. And I said to Paul, well, what about the ethics?  Because, you know, he says, Leo, do you know anybody who does not own a copy of Windows already?  I mean, it's all an upgrade. Nobody's nobody's starting from scratch.  That's a good point. I mean, unless you have only used Mac since 1984 and very few people use a Mac and then go back.  Right. So I think that, you know, the ethics of it, but you're conscious, be the guide.  But you certainly don't need to buy the full version of Windows. What's the difference in the price?  Well, if you're a student, if you have an edu email address, thirty bucks at win seven four one dot com.  If you want to buy three licenses, you can get the home version of Windows home premium.  You know, the the the multi-seat package, three three licenses for one hundred fifty bucks.  It's fifty bucks per machine. That makes sense if you or somebody you know has, you know, you can find three people with Windows.  Fifty bucks. Worst case scenario, you don't know anybody. You don't want to buy the three licenses.  You go to egghead. It's about one hundred and twenty bucks for the OEM version of Windows seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much? Let's compare it with what's the price of, let's say Ubuntu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zero. In fact, they'll even send you the disk.  That's interesting, isn't it? You know, the price of Mac OS X is thirty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thirty dollars if you're upgrading from Leopard to Snow Leopard. But it doesn't check in.  It does. Right. It does not check either. So there's your there's your other ethics.  You had asked also about problems and you mentioned the thirty dollars student edition.  There were some issues downloading the sixty four bit version from Digital River,  which was supplying the e-commerce component of it.  It sent it to you as an EXE file. And when you went to unpack the EXE file, it crashed.  It cratered. And Microsoft is giving is giving thirty dollar refunds for that.  Are they really? They're refunding. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought they might find a fix. Apparently, if you burn it to an ISO, in most cases it works.  But it's a kind of a mess. That thirty dollar version because you get an EXE file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a mess. And you mentioned that you file.  I mean, an EDU email address. If you a lot of people who have been to winter university  and maintain a an alumni account with the Alumni Association have an EDU email address.  Yeah, I actually have a university of California. Yeah, I tried it. I went from UT Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried it as well with my alumni address. It worked fine.  I didn't actually buy it because I thought, well, I'm not it's it's very clearly you have to be a student.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this your Yale alumni or the one from the Santa Cruz High School?  It's from the Phoenix University. Right. Everyone can get one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. University of Phoenix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's probably some open EDU emails you can pull down some place or other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Microsoft sells so many copies of Windows that they don't really care.  It's like it's it's de minimis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They figure they can get any way to pay a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thirty bucks will take what is the cost of Windows really?  I mean, what does it cost them? They've done the R&D, which is probably half a billion.  But but you know, they're going to they're going to get their money out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room has a Phoenix.edu address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, the people who are having trouble with the chat room are trying to go through the web interface.  Mibbit, which is our web interface.  There was there is a trouble with web with the Mibbit for some reason.  I don't know whether it's because we've got so many people in there or Mibbit's having trouble.  Eight hundred sixty eight. Well, that's why I said, look, I'm seeing eight hundred people in there.  Can't be too bad if you go in through an IRC client.  No problem at all. So it's a Mibbit issue.  Apple released. It's interesting.  Apple responded to Windows seven by releasing three new ads directly aimed at Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there was four. There's a fourth one that I've only seen on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's here's here's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, I'm a Mac and I'm a PC. Hey, Mac, did you hear the good news?  Windows seven is out and it's not going to have any of the problems my last operating system had.  Trust me. I feel like I've heard this before. PC. What?  He goes back and ties here and it's not going to have any of the problems of Windows.  It's not going to have any of the problems of Windows.  And he had it's not going to have any of the problems of Windows.  It's not going to have any of the problems. Windows 95.  It's not going to have any of the problems Windows two had. Trust me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got a mullet rolled up sleeves. I love John Hodgman. Oh, he's so funny.  That's a pretty effective ad, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that particular one, I think is the best of the group. Yeah.  Because essentially, which is, you know, this the fractal of the of the Microsoft rollouts is when they're always the same.  And you always come out and every show you did the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the best version of Windows ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what you say every time you did it with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a recording. I have a recording, John, of the show you and I did.  And I'll have to find this when I'm saying, hey, I just tried Windows 3.1 and this thing's pretty good.  And you're going and you're going, you drank the Kool-Aid and I said, yes, John, Windows 3.1.  It is the best version of Windows ever. 3.1. That's how long we've been working together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you've been saying the same thing every time a new Windows comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This this. Well, hey, it's not just me this time.  Walt Mossberg agrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walt has gone both ways. He's like he's like going by.  He can't decide. He goes one way. Then he's the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then he's he's he's trying to prove, as I am, his independence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, fine. This is the best version of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's no question in my mind. And the version is the version.  Well, but I mean, this really is a we recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we recording? Are we saying so? Yes.  So 20 years from now, you can say, Dwight, you said you said it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're but John has a point that every version should be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It still wasn't. And we knew it at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is pretty good. Windows ME wasn't.  Vista wasn't. Windows ME wasn't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my opinion, this is the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The last great version of Windows was Windows 2000.  I agree with that. This is I would say as good as Windows 2000.  At least on the surface.  That's why I'm asking you, Dwight, have you heard of any problems?  Because I'm kind of waiting to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the only two of those two things I've heard is the long installation.  I had one issue myself with Windows 7 where it wanted to install older drivers than what I had put on.  That's not good. The hardware I had I had gone out and I had installed newer newer network drivers.  And one of the things that they're trying to do with Windows 7 is have Windows update provide the latest drivers so you don't have to worry about it.  And so the whole time during the beta process, as well as in the release candidate, they kept giving you new drivers.  And so when I put the RTM on it and I went out and install the latest drivers for the network card and then some more showed up and I thought, oh, great.  Now I have better drivers and I installed it and it broke my network connection.  I began having timeouts when I was transferring large amounts of data across my home network.  I went back to the old drivers and that fixed it.  And I talked to Microsoft about it and and they asked for some data from it and some logs and I sent it to him.  I haven't heard back from him since, but they were concerned about the fact that it was indeed delivering the older drivers.  The drivers were dated early 2007.  They were early Vista drivers and and what I had downloaded were drivers that were specifically for Windows 7.  So that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's one of those anomalies that probably doesn't happen that often, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, except that it's happened with the video drivers.  I have the newest ATI video drivers and it keeps trying to give me the ones from about a month ago, even though I've got the ones in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe there are some issues.  I've had I've installed it a number of times and had very good results.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.  I like it a lot.  And I think that that it is it's very stable.  It doesn't get in your way.  It does use fewer system resources.  I love the Arrow interface.  I know a lot of people who are kind of clodging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you ever use shake and peak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't.  I use peak all the time.  I don't use shake, but I do use the thing where you can move two windows to the edge and put them side by side.  I do a lot of drag and dropping and and that works really well.  And they snap to the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  See, that's nice.  When I do the when I do the link post on my blog, I can actually drag from Chrome into Windows Live Rider and it brings over the headline and as well as the link.  And I have it.  I use Windows 7 for that.  It works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Peak is where you you have minimized programs.  They minimize now all into the same icon, the original application icon, and then you hover it over and it shows little thumbnails of all the windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And if you have it doesn't work, I think yet with with Chrome or Firefox.  But if you're using Internet Explorer and you have multiple tabs open, it shows you what's in each tab.  And so if you use and if you're working on the web and you have a lot of tabs open, it can be really handy.  It saves me time.  I think it's more productive.  Oh, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shake is kind of where we shake.  I can never really.  Yeah, I don't shake the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That might be useful if you are you have a touch interface.  Well, I if you work on a tablet and you do this, that might actually be useful in a touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that a lot of this is touch focused.  In fact, Acer and a number of companies are doing touch laptops with Windows 7.  And I think there's a lot of touch buried inside of Windows 7.  I think that's what they already said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the case.  One of the things, of course, touch with a laptop.  I can just see it.  You know, you go to touch something, you got some mustard on your finger and you make a mess on the screen.  So you start to wipe it off and then you start opening programs by accident.  The whole thing goes completely out of control.  I just don't see it as practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know I love touch.  I mean, look at the iPhone success and that's a touch interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that needs to be because it's small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's interesting because Apple responded to Windows 7 not only with these ads, but also two days before the Windows 7 launch on Tuesday  with a launch of some pretty nice hardware, a 27 inch iMac that has video in and out.  It could really be used as a television, as a home theater PC.  And also a new revised 999 MacBook.  That's the white plastic one, but it's got more battery life because it's got that sealed in battery that Apple seems to like so much.  It's much thinner. It looks pretty attractive.  I mean, they clearly, I think if you read, I know new Mac minis, if you read the tea leaves, it's not something to celebrate.  It's Apple saying, huh, we're a little worried about Windows 7.  We better have a response.  Really? You think that?  I think so. Yeah.  I don't know why.  It shows weakness on their parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a blogger, Marco Armand.  Say again, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a blogger named Marco Armand.  He's a really interesting piece on the 27 inch iMac, which is an unusual size for a PC monitor.  2560 by 1440. It's massive.  And he talks about, he says that the fact that you can get something like this for $1,700, you know, the 30 inch display only, cinema display is $1,800.  It's more.  Right. But it's $100 more.  And he can see people buying this for the monitor alone and then connect, because you can connect a notebook computer to it and run it as your main notebook display.  So and the pricing, he thinks the pricing is pretty unusual.  He can't find anything like this looking around at other products.  It's very aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you might say, oh, well, you know, in fact, HP did.  And as you go to Microsoft's Windows 7 launch page, you'll see HP saying, well, $1,199.  That's the bottom of the line iMac.  You can buy three HP computers and we'll throw in a wireless router.  I mean, they're really hitting the Apple tax thing.  But I think that people aren't maybe that price sensitive.  When they see a 27 inch display and a very nice computer, I five or I seven based computer for for under $2,000, I think that's pretty I think there are people who buy that.  Obviously, did you see Apple's results?  Their quarterly results?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And I did a I did a blog post where I actually said, OK, I've been wrong in the past.  I've been calling on Apple to lower its prices.  Yeah, didn't hurt, did it?  But I think I think that actually that they are doing exactly what they want to do, that they don't want to be.  Apple does not want to be Microsoft.  They do not want to have BMW.  They want to be they want to be BMW.  And actually, I think if they were to kind of become a huge numbers, huge market share, let's say 25 to 50 percent market share, it would stress their systems.  Their their support wouldn't be as good as it is.  I think they're much better off as a niche player.  And certainly, I think their shareholders agree that what they're doing is working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They posted forty seven percent increase in profit in quarter four.  A lot of companies are reporting better profits because of reducing costs.  Cheating.  I don't think there's evidence of that.  No, Apple's not.  They sold three million max at 17 percent more than their revenues are up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The revenues are up.  Yes.  Look at revenues.  The revenues going up.  On Microsoft's revenues are going down, even though they have right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That Microsoft save money by cutting costs.  That's where Microsoft's people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they also deferred Microsoft deferred revenue from Windows seven till after the Windows seven launch.  So they all you know, they deny themselves some cash.  They'll have a better quarter next quarter, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Apple sold seven and a half million iPhones.  That's up from six point nine year ago.  You're today.  They had a hell of a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their iPods is the only thing that's falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ten point million, ten point two million iPods.  That's two hundred thousand fewer than the Wall Street.  They need to refresh.  They did a refresh.  It wasn't enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They need another design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They need a major.  Well, they need something compelling.  I think they've saturated the market.  Everybody wants an iPod has three.  How many you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even count them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is the problem.  Everybody in my family has some net income rose to one point six, seven billion dollars.  That's the net kids for three months up from one one four year to date.  Revenue up from seven point nine billion and nine point eight seven billion.  Yeah, this is not a cut cost cutting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, Horowitz and I discussed this on our on the Dvorak Horowitz unplugged show, another podcast.  And Horowitz spotted something that was interesting, which is Apple's cautioning that there's going to be a problem in the next quarter because of increased shipping costs, which was baffling, which led me to believe that the only thing that could cause the increased shipping costs is the fact that I and I.  Other people have said this before, but I said it again and I wrote it up.  Oh, I actually didn't write it up.  I just chatted it up that Apple and there's no reason for me not to think that they wouldn't do this because they got the stores and everything and the infrastructure is to bring out an actual TV set, an LCD TV that has Apple TV built into it.  So you have essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Callahanus predicted that a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I predicted it two years ago then.  But the idea to do that now is the time because an Apple may have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in a way they have with this twenty seven.  I mean, it's got a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of a you can hang it on a wall.  Well, if you make I can see Apple bringing out like a thirty two or forty inch forty two forty seven fifty five inch.  Who knows?  But that's the only thing that counts.  What else are they going to do that's going to that's going to affect shipping?  Those things are expensive to ship if the ship of boatload of them over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, also, though, Apple's really good at over under under the under producing under selling and over producing it at warning the market of problems that don't ever exist.  And that way they get these great expectations.  Well, that's an old trick in Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody they're good at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  During their during their conference call, they made reference to say that they were going to have enhanced or higher shipping costs because of a specific product.  They were going to be selling this before they announced the twenty seven inch iMac.  And, you know, there may be some that's going to cost some money.  That is going to cost some money.  But maybe there is something else.  And I like the idea of an of Apple TV built into a TV.  I think that's just really natural.  And they may not do it now, but I think they'll do it eventually, probably after their tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, with those stores, they've got that New York store, for example.  I mean, they have room in there to set up a TV showroom and and just push those things and they could be nicely they could be nicely profitable.  They could charge a little more than any.  You know, they can charge Sony prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It practically is that kind of a high end audio showroom already.  Yeah, it looks like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has that look and feel.  So you might as well put some fancy and you might as well have some Apple speakers while we're at it.  Well, they tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember when Steve Jobs comes on stage said, these sound so good, I threw out my stereo system and there were these crappy powered speakers, which Apple's since discontinued.  I hope Steve didn't throw out his stereo system, but just put it out in the maid's quarters so he could get it back when the way once this once the once the speakers were off the market.  Let's take a break.  I want to come back.  Apple has a patent that is causing some people to think it may change its entire business model.  But I will find out.  But first I want to talk about GoToMyPC.  This is the company that allows you to get remote access to your computer anywhere you go anytime securely.  It's easier to use, but more secure than a VPN.  This is a great solution.  GoToMyPC.com.  I want you to try it right now.  Absolutely free.  That's right.  All you do is go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  Sign up.  Get that account going.  Press the download button within two minutes with no configuration of your router.  You'll have an absolutely secure remote access set up on your system.  Now wherever you go, anywhere you go, you just log on to GoToMyPC.com.  Press the connect button.  And there it is.  There's your computer.

It's just like being there.  And you could try it free for 30 days.  All you have to do is go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit for your 30 day trial of GoToMyPC.  If you haven't tried it yet, I really want you to give it a try.  We're actually putting it on all of the computers, including our switcher, because sometimes in the middle of the night, the switcher will stop playing.  Colleen says, Leo, why don't you get me a good one?  Why don't you get me GoToMyPC?  All right, all right, Colleen.  I'm going to put GoToMyPC on there.  I think we have it installed everywhere.  GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  You'll want to install it everywhere once you give it a try.  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  John has left the studio.  But I do.  Now, I don't know.  You know, I normally don't report on Apple patent filings because, like most big companies, they've got a skunkworks going all the time and they file patents like crazy.  It doesn't mean anything.  There is a blog called Patently Apple that talks about this Apple patent for ad-supported operating systems.  Now, it could just be, I think a lot of times when you file a patent, you're just protecting something.  You don't have any intention of doing it.  But lately, there's been just kind of this feeling that both Apple and Microsoft are looking at this model.  What is your sense of it, Dwight?  Does this sound like something reasonable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in that story, they note that one of the names on the patent application is Steve Jobs.  Does that make it more credible?  May make it more credible.  You know, there's this constant speculation that at some point Apple will start letting other manufacturers put OS X on their machines despite the CyStar lawsuit.  And I wonder if this wouldn't help pave the way or if that's how they do it.  Is that you could use OS X on a non-Apple product, but you have to show ads at the time.  That would be, I can't see them wanting to put this on their hardware.  I just think it seems very non-Apple to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems very anti-user to me.  I don't want ads on my operating system.  In fact, this patent has buttons like click here within five seconds.  I mean, it almost requires you to act, to watch the ad, which is really kind of appalling.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This may be for some sort of a product we're unaware of or some.  Maybe an Apple TV?  I don't know.  Well, that would be interesting.  An iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or the tablet.  What if you did that on the tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the tablet's going to be so expensive and no carrier's going to subsidize that.  The tablet's going to be a book reader.  I don't believe it's going to be a computer.  Boy, that's the hot quantity right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they could blow everybody out of the water with a nice book reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think of the Nookie?  I'm sorry, the Nookie reader.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Nookie!  Mine's a noble in a perhaps mistaken attempt to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was waiting for the second version, the cranny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's called the Nook e-book reader.  Yeah.  Say that fast and you get something else.  And it's from Barnes and Noble.  It has some color at the bottom, which is kind of interesting.  Black and white e-ink at the top.  But it's not just Barnes and Noble now.  Everybody says we're making an e-book reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd like to see some numbers here.  By the way, as we're talking about patents, we might as well mention what's going on with the Nokia suing Apple patents.  Yeah, Nokia says, hey, we were there before with a smartphone.  And where that's going to end up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they've been talking to each other.  They've been negotiating.  This is kind of indicates that the negotiations have not gone anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just, you know, I think anytime you negotiate with Steve Jobs, I just have a feeling there's a high, I'm out of here factor, you know, like, screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple's so quick to draw, you know, so quick draw artists when it comes to like suing people left and right.  Now they're getting sued.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I don't you know, one of the reasons I don't really pay much attention to stories like that is because there just seems like there's always lawsuits flying back and forth.  And it's just way it's just the way of doing business.  And I don't know if it's if I can't tell if there's merit or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's part of the negotiating process for the exactly they've been talking for a while.  And so now they're going to take it public and kind of try to shame them into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  We'll see.  I mean, Nokia certainly had the first smartphones.  You still use your E-71, John?  Yeah, I have it on me.  You know what I just ordered and I'm really excited about the M900?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a prop, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's running Mimo or Mamo, the Linux version, you know, the Linux, it's Debian under the hood.  But but Nokia has been developing this open source operating system for phones.  It has, you know, it has a lot of the features of the iPhone.  You could slide pages.  It looks a little bit like a pre.  You have multiple applications running in the switcher as you slide it.  It's a big screen touch screen with haptic feedback, five megapixel camera, high quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it's going to be better than the best of the best droids?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's I mean, I think what we're seeing is some real competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I use this the N71 because it's really light, very thin and it has a little keyboard.  This is not bad.  I can do messaging, but going on the web to do anything is just completely useless.  So what I've discovered, though, I don't think you need a phone that has web access at all  because so many people around you have the phone with web access and they be there.  Slavishly will go on their iPhone in front of you and say, I say, well, I don't know where you think that restaurant is.  Well, let me look it up.  I'd love to show you, John.  And they go, I have GPS.  So it's like having assistance.  You don't need to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, John, I'll be the guy with the computer in his pocket.  It really is large.  It has a slide out keyboard, 32 gigs of internal storage.  It does run Firefox basically.  It runs a portable version of Firefox on an ARM Cortex, which I think is the same is the Cortex the same as in the iPhone.  It's very powerful processor.  It has full flash, flash nine on it, not not a stripped down flash.  It's GPS quad band.  It'll run on the T-Mobile network at 1700 megahertz.  Flash nine point four.  I mean, I think it's very interesting.  Plus you can run other it's a real Linux.  You can run other Linux software on there and get this on the screen.  Go ahead.  Sounds like a hacker's dream.  And that's why I was intrigued.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In a good sense.  Not the unplug and plug in again.  You're verbal and honest.  Yeah.  It's a it.  But get this.  And this is what excited me.  Eight forty by four eighty screen.  That's almost a full screen.  Whoa. Hello, John.  Hello, Dwight.  I'm back.  OK.  Eight eight hundred by four eighty resolution.  That's a that's a that's a usable screen size if you ask me.  Full keyboard.  Removable battery.  I asked some people who got one at the MIMO developers conference what kind of battery life they're getting this morning on Twitter.  And they said four to six hours if you really rock it hard.  But but most people are saying it's like any smartphone.  I love that E71 though, John.  It's just a beautiful phone.  It's really, really pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How heavy is the is the nine hundred six six or eight pounds six to eight ounces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it says it's a GPS assisted GPS.  Does that mean it's using GPS or it's using the cell sites only?  What is eight?  I keep seeing some in the chat room will know their geniuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's both.  I think it means it uses the regular GPS and then also does the cell triangulation as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've done what you do, John.  I outsourced my brain to the chat room.  To the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of similar.  There's nine hundred and eighteen people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, it's a good brain.  That's a good.  I've been actually figuring out what is the optimal size for a chat room if it's going to be your brain and any.  It has to be over five hundred people, but under a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One guy says it is the cell cell towers.  Well, some say it's both.  Oh, here it is.  Wikipedia's got the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Assisted GPS.  Well, there you go.  Just click that link to see how quickly they get to it before it rolls off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, generally abbreviated GPS is a carrier network dependent system, which can under certain conditions to prove the start up performance of GPS satellite based positioning system.  So it is used with GPS capable cell phones to give you kind of a quick start.  So it uses the cell towers to narrow it down.  But then you do have true GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's just it's just for a fake performance.  Well, I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know this when you first start up a GPS in a new area, it has to download the Almanac forever.  So this is this says, OK, cell towers, where am I?  Give me the Almanac.  The Almanac is then downloaded over the three G network.  And not and then that much more quickly.  Network also can give you atomic time with accurate time assistance.  Sounds good.  This is a pretty hot little device.  Now I had a Nokia 800, their tablet, and it was really slow and not very attractive.  But I'm excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how much is it?  Five thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little under six hundred.  But now here.  Well, OK, it's unlocked.  It's unlocked.  Now listen to this.  Listen closely.  It's going to cost me less than the iPhone.  And I'll tell you why.  I'm all ears.  And this is what actually this is why I ordered it this morning.  T-Mobile just announced this new plan, a new data plan that is if they say if we don't subsidize the phone, seventy nine bucks for everything.  Unlimited phone calls, unlimited data, unlimited Internet, unlimited texting for seventy nine bucks as long as we don't subsidize the phone.  So in effect, I'm paying about twenty bucks a month less.  I don't have a two year contract anymore.  So even though the phone costs about four hundred bucks more, I'm saving that much on the contract, actually saving.  What is it?  Four hundred eighty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you bring an unlocked iPhone to yes.  But yeah, what's the cap?  What's the unlocked iPhone to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could bring an unlocked G phone or any phone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you wouldn't get the benefits of, you know, whatever it is, the iPhone.  What the what?  I'm sure it's a five giga data cap.  They don't, you know, I'm sure it is.  But they say unlimited.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, I'll let you know.  Yeah, OK.  You'll be five gigabytes and these are five megapixel images.  T-Mobile is struggling right as a sprint.  Verizon and AT&T are sucking all the oxygen out of the room.  AT&T with the iPhone, Verizon with their better network because, you know, they've got a great network.  Sprints dying on the vine and T-Mobile is a week fourth.  They've got to do something.  So they announced this morning this is Project Dark or something they call it.  And Project Dark Side.  I think it's their last ditch attempt.  But you know, the Deutsche Telekom, this is a little something a little more common in Europe.  In Europe, people don't you don't expect a subsidized phone quite as much, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can get most of the phones are unlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is called the Even More Plan.  They started forty nine ninety nine for unlimited calls and no annual contract.  And then if you want the unlimited data and text, it's seventy nine and no contract.  I think that that's kind of that's really basically saying, OK, we want to be the company that people like you, John,  with your seventy one or me with nine hundred go to.  I think it's a very clever differentiator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although they have the worst three G network coverage.  Do you have three G in Petaluma with T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's edge of three G here with the AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, AT&T has as three G here as of course, does Verizon and Sprint.  You know, let me look at my I have to look at my G one.  I've been using a G one on T-Mobile.  I should look and see if it's still edge.  I think sometimes you get a turn.  I hear your Seamus is back.  Oh, Seamus, you let him drink the coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I told you not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he drink that coffee?  Yeah, Seamus, you like your you like your dad.  You like your coffee black and your woman strong.  He's he's a sweet.  I have to say he's the sweetest kid.  I'm sorry that he's a little rambunctious.  He napped on the way here.  That was the problem.  He was like out of the truck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm so glad to see you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come next week.  My apologies.  Anytime.  Great to see you.  Patrick says he's sorry.  He's taken off with the kid and the dog.  The dog.  Leave the dog.  Yeah, I like that dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great dog.  I like that dog.  Did I get that backwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did I get backwards?  Oh, he's women strong.  No, his coffee strong.  No, I don't know.  Anyway, I like my coffee.  I like my coffee.  I like why my women weak and bitter.  That's the one.  Oh dear.  Oh dear.  Oh dear.  All right.  What else is in the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's so much to talk about.  I don't even know where to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T weighs higher fees for data hogs.  We were talking about limits.  There's a cap.  What difference does it make?  AT&T is finalizing a plan that could impose higher fees on big data users subject to the  rules that may come from big data users.  I think that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's the one.  I think that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's the one.  I think that's the one.  I think that's the one.  I think that's the one.  I think that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that the Verizon CEO made last week was that because they have licensed  spectrum and they have to manage that spectrum, this is not strictly internet.  Before it gets to the internet, it goes over their network, that they need the right to  be able to manage their networks pre-internet.  And that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly since they have paid for these  licenses.  That's open territory.  And they're arguing that they should be allowed to manage that when AT&T is part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would buy that if, and see, this is Marguerite Reardon writing, if Marguerite's contention  that 3G was always better and less congested than Wi-Fi were true.  But it isn't true.  It's just as congested.  In fact, I think half the problems AT&T suffers, especially in areas where there are lots of  San Francisco, is it's just they have too many users and they don't manage it properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that obviously they're working on it.  They're spending umpteen amount of money trying to fix that problem.  And I think, I have a prediction, I don't think that AT&T is going to lose the exclusivity  next year.  I think they're going to keep it on the iPhone.  And I think it's because of this.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you'd see this droid does commercials if Verizon had thought they had any chance  I mean, they're doing a hit piece on the iPhone.  There's no way they're going to get it, obviously.  If they thought they were going to get it, they wouldn't be doing the hit piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And I also think that AT&T has shown to Apple, and probably even more than we've seen at  the moment, that they're going to attack and solve the problem.  You know, I was in New York a couple of weeks ago and I had heard about how bad it is there  with the iPhone, but it was astonishingly bad.  And if, you know, putting higher fees on data hogs helps that situation, should they do  it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's, you know, there are people, we all know them.  We might even be them who use a lot of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're in the top of the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, when I'm blogging, I'm sending photos up, I'm using a lot of streaming video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm 10 different networks simultaneously.  So it's reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I pay more than a thousand bucks a month for upstream bandwidth because of it.  So I don't mind doing that.  And I think it's appropriate for me to do that.  And it'd be kind of unconscionable for me to use my local Comcast and suck up all the  bandwidth in the neighborhood.  Well, I got an internet network to run here.  So we buy special bandwidth for that purpose.  But I think that you're right.  I think there are a lot of people out there who are just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if there's caps, it doesn't make any sense to me.  A cap's a cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had this conversation so many times now.  Tear it.  That's all anybody says.  I hate caps.  Tear the damn thing.  That'd work for me.  Yeah, tear it.  So Verizon...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have an iPhone, there's a real...  AT&T has an app that lets you monitor your data usage.  Is there an app for that?  There is an app for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you damn well better use it.  Because if you use the built-in app, as I did in Egypt, get ready to be screwed.  I used the usage stat from the iPhone, as AT&T told me to, and it was off by 200%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that this app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it wasn't the My Wireless app.  It was the built-in iPhone usage.  And you're right.  Now you have to use the My Wireless.  But the problem is that uses data.  Right, to get it.  The phone knows how much data it's used.  I don't understand why I can't trust the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is...  I think that...  I've been using this, and I find I use actually less data than I thought I did.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, 5 gigs is more than...  I mean, it's not a bad amount of data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Particularly the way you use this phone.  I don't know how the apps work, but my suspicion is that there's some kind of compression with  a lot of the apps that allows it to use less data than, say, if you were just using a straight  HTTP connection.  Did I say Egypt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't Egypt.  It was China that I got screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, you're all over the world now.  You can't even keep track.  I have no idea where I am right now.  You did get screwed in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I'm never doing it again.  Great foot rubs, though.  Did I tell you that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never had a foot rub there, really?  You sure it was a foot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great tea and foot rubs.  Great tea and foot rubs.  So here...  I don't know whether you would classify him as a sleazebag or not, John.  The Verizon CEO...  Bingo.  Ivan Seidenberg, speakering at Supercom, says, I'm worried about the FCC's proposal for stricter  regulation on net neutrality.  He says, quote, proponents of net neutrality have a worldview...  Now, see if this is you...  Have a worldview that network providers and application providers like Google occupy different  parts of the Internet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  What does that mean?  Oh, what does it mean?  I'm glad you asked.  Dumb pipes versus smart apps.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm reading it.  It's not trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a mistake.  This is a mistake, pure and simple.  It's an analog idea for a digital world.  It completely understates the need for sound practices and ignores the benefits of smart  networks.  You were saying, John, which is a managed network costs more but gives you more value  for your dollar.  Net neutrality prohibits...  These guys, say, keeps us from doing a managed network.  I would submit that that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  It's bull crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you can manage...  Yeah.  You just have to manage fairly.  You can't prioritize one...  You can't say, I prioritize...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on the way they write this up.  I think that's the concern a lot of these people have because the government gets involved.  Somebody mentioned in one of the articles I was looking at, John McCain is all upset  about this and he doesn't even know to use the internet or know how it works.  McCain's really a rocker on this one.  The government's going to get involved.  They're going to write something.  You don't know what they're going to do.  The only concern that I've ever had so far as the net neutrality debate is concerned  is the idea that I'm Verizon or I'm AT&T and I decide all of a sudden to do a newspaper  at home as a matter of fact did this.  They had a content service.  Remember that.  All of a sudden you're running a content service and then you find that somebody else does  a content service that's directly competitive and you just screw them.  You shut them off.  That's what this is all about.  That's what I thought it was about but apparently there's more to it.  No, no, no.  If that's what it's all about, how come right now, for example, the Dvorak Uncensored blog,  dvorak.org slash blog, is like I can't get in.  Half of Russia won't take this thing because the ISPs have blocked it because of some software  and I still have corporations all over the country.  Guys say, I can't get to your blog.  I say, well, why?  Then they say, well, everybody's outsourcing some little filtering system to keep porn  from going on the net or whatever and I put on the list.  In fact, there's one company which I'm going to write up and market watch.  They never even got back to me.  It's one little ISP in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  McCain's bill, the Internet Freedom Act.  I mean, you might have a beef obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  McCain's bill, the Internet Freedom Act, basically says the FCC, quote, shall not propose, promulgate  or issue any regulations regarding the Internet.  What does that mean?  That's what they do.  Basically, you're saying the FCC cannot in any way talk about the Internet.  Stick with what you know, the TV.  Here's my, I think it comes down to the same arguments you hear all the time from business  interests, which is the government's got its hands in our pockets.  We don't want to be regulated.  And then there's liberals like me who say, well, wait a minute, government regulation  protects everybody.  And your example is very good.  I'll use the example of Skype versus Comcast's voice service.  Comcast is going to take those Skype packets, slow them down just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why they have deep packet sniffing on all these new routers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they do it in Canada right now.  Shaw admits it.  Shaw says, yeah, we deprecate Skype packets.  We don't want people using bandwidth for free phone calls.  Comcast could also say, we don't like BitTorrent because you're getting movies for free.  That's our business.  But Comcast isn't doing that now, is it?  Well, you're right.  That's the argument people say is, well, show us where it's been a problem in the US.  Comcast is doing deep packet inspection.  They have cut off BitTorrent.  The question is, are they doing it because of data hogs or are they doing it because  it hurts their business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which reminds me, when we're done with this debate, I have Google Voice now.  Isn't that cool?  You got it?  Love it.  Well, there's something.  No wonder AT&T's all bent on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cheap phone calls around the world.  Cheap free.  Using data.  It's the one they're getting all over the world.  Yeah, using data.  Yeah.  Instead of cell phones.  Well, I know, but it goes right into the real system and it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can make a phone call on your own real phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's issues with it.  There's a lot of latency.  But nevertheless.  I've gotten some pretty good connections.  You're right.  That's why they're scared.  And I think that, well, Dwight, give us the other side.  Give us the argument.  Are you saying that it's anticipating a problem that doesn't exist yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think that what people are looking at is the fact that data is exploding and  all these people are saying that as phone conversations and more video goes out over  the internet, they've got to have a way to be able to control it.  You know, the fear is, yeah, that you'll end up choking out your competitors.  And I think if you have regulation that says, you know, you don't do that, I don't think  you necessarily need to overregulate.  I think you can stick to the basics and then you're in good shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we agree that it's possible to write a rule that simply says do not discriminate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  There are now what's it what's happening is this is as it often occurs in these overheated  debates.  We have a lot of people who are starting to kind of see, you know, monsters under the  bed.  There's a significant part of the of the conservative blogosphere that's that is now thinking that  net neutrality is the new fairness doctrine, you know, which they're they're worried about  being reinstituted and that this is the way they'll get the fairness doctrine in.  I don't think that that's what's going to happen at all.  I think I don't think you need anything draconian.  You just need something simple, but not as simple on the other side as saying McCain's  don't touch anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's going a little far.  Hey, I understand.  I'm with you, John.  I understand the arguments on both sides.  Clearly there's an explosion in the use of the Internet and companies want to make the  most with Verizon says Steinberg pointed to telemedicine.  He says, look, we need to be able to priorities prioritize packets that are transmitting medical  monitoring data over email to make sure they get through the network quickly.  But he's afraid that rules will keep him from doing that.  That's not what anybody is saying.  You cannot have quality of service.  They're saying it's the opposite.  You can't slow somebody down because you don't like them.  Are those different things or is is speeding up medicine traffic the same thing as slowing  down everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same argument with a positive spin and one with a negative spin.  It's a half a full half empty thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a tough one.  And that's why, Dwight, maybe you need smarter legislation that that takes into account whose  ox is being gored.  If it's telemedicine, then then the FCC would say, well, of course you can prioritize telemedicine.  If it's Skype, the FCC might say, well, of course you can't slow down Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a problem right now with telemedicine going telemedicine packets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't heard anything about the only problem we've had in the U.S. now.  And as I said, I use Canada as an example because there's been absolute blatant and complete  the telcos there have even admitted that they do this, that they slow down voice over IP.  They've had no problem admitting it in the U.S.  The only example we have was of Comcast doing deep packet inspection, interestingly enough,  using Canadian software and turning off BitTorrents.  They said to protect the network from bandwidth hogs.  Some might say to protect their business interests.  That's the only example I can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they and they have stopped doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the FCC said to stop doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  What's interesting about Comcast, they also now have a 256 gigabyte cap, which nobody  ever approaches that I know of.  And they also and they promised Comcast promised last year in 2008 at this time that they were  going to have a bandwidth meter that would let its customers measure the amount of bandwidth.  And it hasn't appeared there have not been able to produce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a bandwidth meter on my machine and I'm on Comcast and I don't know how you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get possibly get to those people don't use them the amount that but I in my opinion the  20 gigabytes and a lot maybe a gig a day is a lot.  But in my opinion, even if you watch our network all the time, you know, but in my opinion  is really not about 250.  It's just about setting up having some limit which they can then write and they can lower

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  change well or raise.  I'm not going to raise it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to talk a little bit about Droid.  We haven't talked about Droid.  We've kind of alluded to it.  And I'm curious if you know anything about it, Dwight or John and or have anything to  say about it because I'm intrigued by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's interesting about Droid when you look at the ads, if you get to see a newspaper  ad if you ever see a newspaper, I got the Sunday Chronicle.  What's that a newspaper?  What is that?  It's like the Sunday paper is so small now.  If you're going to see the ad, Droid is a registered trademark of Lucas Films.  Used with permission.  Used with permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They paid a little money to.  I hate those ads.  The droid droid ads.  The I doesn't.  iPhone doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, for there for several reasons.  Number one, it's extremely geeky.  It's not the kind of ad that's going to appeal.  It says I don't do open development.  You know, does your mom know what open development means?  And then it's all white and happy.  And when they talk, when they come to the product that they want to sell you, it gets  dark and ominous.  Droid.  And, you know, if I'm not sure that the mainstream is going to be that's going to appeal to  them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's it's very interesting campaign.  Obviously aimed at us, right?  It's aimed at geeks.  I don't run widgets.  I don't have interchangeable batteries.  I mean, and then the droid thing is very saw, you know, very scary.  Saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, saw.  That's what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't you wish you had a robot sidekick that moved at light speed?  Could get you out of any problem and lived in your pocket?  I don't know.  A little scary right there.  It's kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a droid in your pocket or?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have to say every even the Boy Genius report had a hands on review that made it  look very sexy.  I mean, it's a good looking phone.  I think it's interesting.  It's taken three years.  But finally, I don't know why it took so long, but finally Motorola and Nokia coming up with  handsets that at least can give the iPhone a run for its money.  I don't know if they will, but you know, you can't one thing you can't underestimate is  eighty five thousand applications.  That's something nobody else can do.  Although it's on the other on the flip side, it is eighty five thousand applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ninety nine percent of them are crap.  OK, true.  And finding the good ones is not necessarily easy.  Yeah.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if the but but but the Android development and Droid runs Android and Nokia runs Android  and Nokia runs Mamo, which runs any Linux app, you're going to have even more crap, right?  Because you don't have anybody overseeing that.  Apple at least is trying to maintain some standards successfully or not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time somebody says, oh, I like the I like the fact that, you know, there are eighty  five thousand apps.  The problem is that's both a right.  It's a good thing and a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Very excellent point.  I'll take a little break.  Come back with a little bit more in a bit.  You're listening to Twitter with Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle, John C.  Devorak of Channel Devorak.  I'm Leo Laporte.  And I want to talk a little bit about my friends at Squarespace.  You do a great Squarespace ad, John.

Did I lose you?  We don't hear you, Dwight.  Are you sitting on the mute button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am sitting on the mute button.  I was communicating with my lovely wife about lasagna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So were you?  Is that what's for dinner?  I'm jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on over.  I love lasagna.  Tell me to do the the wine grouch.  Oh, that'd be good.  Well, I know it's going to be one bit.  I only have one joke.  I'd be taking that.  It stinks.  It stinks.  So the wine drink Bordeaux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It stinks.  Drink more Bordeaux.  You were talking John and I were talking about Bordeaux.  This is like the most addictive wine, right?  I mean, this is like how no burgundy.  I'm sorry, burgundy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought you liked Bordeaux.  I like Bordeaux.  I prefer Bordeaux.  I drink Bordeaux because I can afford Bordeaux.  Burgundies are only for rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I misunderstood.  So burgundy is what you want to get into.  Yeah, no, no, you don't want to get because they're extremely addictive.  I'm ready to be like the Hunter S.  Thompson of podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you get start drinking these burgundies if you get the good ones.  The trouble with burgundy is that there's a very, you know, you have to know what to  get.  You have to know what to get because it's really most of us crummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you could do the wine grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do the wine grouch.  I think I'm doing the wine grouch now.  So it's you don't get much bang for your buck, but they're very.  It's a segment.  There's certain burgundies that are just incredibly compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to try some.  Actually, maybe there's a listener.  Hurst.  He could come.  You know, we should get him on the show.  The problem is he clams up.  Yeah, he does.  He clams up.  But now he's no longer like, you know, he's just he's like a normal clam up this time.  But he can give you the wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He'll give you the burgundy tips because he's got a he's a collector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's get Will up here.  We'll do a burgundy show.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you get Gary Vee on or would that be too?  I like Gary, but he's a little too high energy for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes me I watch him.  I get tired.  Amazon says Windows 7 was the biggest preorder of all time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's interesting.  Did you see Amazon's results?  Unbelievable.  Holy cow.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an example of a company that went public because they could go public in an  era that it was easy to go public before Sarbanes-Oxley.  And now we have one of the great retailers of the world, Amazon dot com.  Very successful company.  Very successful company.  Then very well well for itself.  And we have not seen anything like this since Sarbanes-Oxley came out in 2002 and pretty  much put the kibosh on anybody.  Do you think that's keeping somebody from competing with Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they're just not you can't raise the money with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a small company is trying to compete with somebody like let's say Google, another  search engine.  You can't raise enough money to stay in business.  Not with an IPO, but just with VCs because the VCs have no exit.  Right.  They won't give you any money because without the exit what good is it except to sell to  Google.  The whole thing is in the toilet and it's all because of the Sarbanes-Oxley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Sarbanes-Oxley was created after the Enron scandal to acquire better reporting.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you really look at Sarbanes-Oxley and the Enron scandal and reverse engineering,  it wouldn't have done anything.  Wouldn't have helped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's an example if you want to do an argument against net neutrality, the law  of unintended consequences of sometimes you pass a law with the best intentions.  But the regulation can kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is one of the arguments against the net neutrality folks.  And that's actually big.  I understand that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm kind of similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were arguments at the time that Sarbanes-Oxley was proposed and debated that the exact things  that we're seeing now did happen.  Nobody listened.  Right, nobody listened.  But the thing is with the current VC climate, there are companies that still emerge.  That are small and that find favor because what they do is good.  And the best example of that is Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  But they're small.  And that's the key.  You can't do an Amazon because it's so capital intensive.  What did Amazon do with all the IPO money?  They built distribution centers everywhere.  Physical plants.  Physical plants.  Twitter doesn't need to do that.  So yeah, you can have a small web company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Twitter is something that can be cloned easily.  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the point.  That's the point is that you're not going to get somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they tried it.  Nobody has.  Nobody has because they look at Twitter and say, well, this is just a money drain.  There's no money to be made.  So why would anyone want to clone it?  I guarantee if somebody comes up with some way of really making a ton of money like Google  did out of Twitter, then you'll start to see Microsoft will do it.  Well, that's what I've been waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much money was exchanged in the deals with Google and Bing and Facebook?  I think there was some cash there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was interesting because Twitter said, use the word sold, the information.  Facebook was very clear to point out that there was no money exchanged.  So I don't think Facebook made any money.  But of course, Facebook makes plenty of money on advertising.  They've had a net positive this year, mostly because of Zynga.  You play Farmville.  Do you know about Farmville?  I don't.  I had to stop.  Farmville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you on Facebook, Dwight?  I am on Facebook, but I must get off my lawn kind of guy on Facebook.  I don't do any of the apps and I don't friend anybody who isn't like really my friend.  So I stay away from that stuff.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to play whatever.  The way I see it, it's your kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a Dvorak in training on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I started playing this game Farmville.  Zynga is the company.  Zynga recently was estimated they're making $150 million a year on Facebook apps.  They have YoVille, Farmville.  As far as I know, they have the Mafia Wars.  They have a few others.  There's an interesting life cycle on here.  Somebody is just using Facebook and they see their friends using Farmville because all of these  post updates into the news feed.  So you see, Oh, Leo just found a black pig in Farmville.  And it goes up and there's a cute little picture.  So they go, oh, what's that?  They click it.  They kind of start playing with it.  Just kind of futzing around pretty soon.  They're addicted.  And I was that way.  You can't stop.  I'm starting to check into Facebook 10 times a day to make sure that I have harvested my  artichokes and that the lambs don't need milk.  Is this a fact?  It's a fact.  This is pathetic.  It's a fact.  It was horrible.  It was horrible, John.  So finally, and it has all the social engineering because you trade with your friends.  You give them gifts.  And here's their smart move.  Zynga made a very smart move.  Pretty soon you start buying social objects.  This is the new economy.  You give them actual money so that you can have fake Farmville money so that you can  buy a fake fence or a fake pig.  And it's somehow compelling people.  And they're spending a lot of money on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a bunch of the multi massive multiplayer online games that did this kind of thing.  And people would start to accumulate things and they'd sell their city to somebody else.  Second Life is an example.  World of Warcraft.  Right, World of Warcraft.  And they'd do it through Craigslist.  Gold farming.  One of my kids wanted to buy something like that.  So I think I'd like to catch up and get a whole city of little peasants.  What did you say?  I said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John, I thought you were like the permissive guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not when they're spending money on real money.  On virtual nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well this is a big part of the economy now.  And if you create an addictive game, it really is.  It's a little cynical if you ask me.  The CEO was at the Web 2.0 conference this week in San Francisco talking about this.  And they create these addictive games that have these cycles.  And then there's always another one because it's only about a month.  I finally deleted it.  At one point I got enough self-worth into me.  I said I'm okay.  I'm good enough.  I don't need Farmville.  And I deleted it.  Oh man.  I feel like I have a new life.  I have time for my friends, my family.  I talk again.  How much did you spend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you spend?  No, I didn't fall for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but then they have, oh well I almost fell for something because they have partners who  if you click enough links will give you some gold.  So you start down this path.  They say 20 free gold dollars.  And you can't, by the way, you need a lot of money to build a bigger farm.  And I really wanted a bigger farm.  20 free gold dollars.  But you just have to click these few offers.  Pretty soon they're asking you for your cell number.  You go, okay, whatever.  They're just attending you.  Text, okay, whatever.  It was just a matter of time before I had a $20 a month bill from somebody I didn't even  know I was doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, stay away from the burgundy for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right.  I have an addictive personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So GeoCities closes tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, should we have a moment of silence for the old GeoCities?  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like I remember everybody talking about it back in 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was free web hosting, right?  Yeah, kind of.  Yahoo decided to pull the plug.  Tomorrow, if you have a site on GeoCities, you might want to download that great looking site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Take one screenshot of it and forget about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of links that point back to there.  Oh, hell yeah.  There's a lot of historical data on there.  And if you...  Archive.org  They're going to delete it.  They're not just going to decommission it.  They're deleting it.  And that'll be a lot of information lost.  Archive.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it'll always be...  Yeah, you can always go back and look, I guess.  It says, what if I don't save my files and images?  If you do not download your files and images before October 26th, you will no longer be  able to access that data.  After October 26th, your GeoCities files will be deleted from our servers and will not be  recoverable in italics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it too late to put up a GeoCities site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't sign up unless you have an account still.  If you have an account, wouldn't it be good to put up a goodbye GeoCities site?  There's something.  I mean, I don't remember any great GeoCities sites.  They were all kind of crappy.  I don't think I ever signed up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never did, I don't think.  It's like Tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever happened to Tripod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Tripod is still there, actually.  You're kidding.  I think so.  Oh, yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it is.  Tripod.lycos.com.  Whatever happened to Lycos?  Who owns Lycos these days?  So good.  Everybody on GeoCities moved to Tripod.  You won't have to do this again for those six months.  Six months.  Who?  Lycos?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lycos?  They're still in business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently their public relations department is not doing a very good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they had the ads with the dog, right?  Yeah.  Where the dog would match the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says, go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was dogpile.  The dog's still there.  The dog is still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lycos is one of the original and most widely known internet brands in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AltaVista is still there, too.  In fact, I still use the translation thing sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, Lycos is owned by a Korean search and internet portal called Daum.  D-A-U-M.  Okay, well, this trip back in time brought to you by the letters A and Z.  Well, goodbye, GeoCities.  We hardly knew ye.  It's been real.  It's been real.  1995 to 2009.  1995 in internet years is like infinity.  That's forever.  Yeah.  It's not that long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of the sites look like they were designed in 1995.  They do, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Upgrade your geek, says Dwight Silverman.  From 1995.  Yeah.  Netbooks are a scourge on the PC business.  Do you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was riffing off a Joe Wilcox post where he was kind of talking about how Apple, with  Apple's release of its hardware, that they were thumbing their nose at the PC business  and showing why the margins are so great for Apple and so bad for the rest of the industry.  I was basically saying that things like netbooks and kind of this price war spiral essentially  are cutting margins in the business enough that it makes it more difficult for them to  innovate and to do things that make their products better.  I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yet people want netbooks.  They really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they want them until they have them.  I think people buy them and go, oh great, a $250 computer.  And then when they get them and try to do anything more than just check their email,  they get really frustrated with them.  I think if you buy them and you know what you're getting and that's what you're going  to do is just check your email and check your GeoCities site, I think you'll be happy with  it.  But the problem is people want to do more with their computers than that.  And if that's all you buy that machine for, you'll be fine.  But chances are you're going to want to do more with it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dwight's a great read.  You got to go to his website, his blog.  It's blogs.cron.com slash tech blog.  And he does the tech links as well every day.  And I have to confess, I steal those every week for Twitter.  That's why I put them up there, Leon, for theft.  They're a great resource.  I steal them, so you may as well.  You're just helping the link economy.  It's always great to have you on Dwight.  Thanks for joining us.  I really appreciate it.  Thanks for having me.  Go enjoy your lasagna in peace.  You can forget all this.  John C. Dvorak is at channeldvorak.com and of course dvorak.org slash blog if it's not  censored at your company.  Well, it is censored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because it has the word uncensored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's idiotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As soon as they see uncensored, they go over there.  Yeah, this is how deep they go into these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People do a lot of research.  They don't have time.  Oh, it's got a funny name.  It's a big internet.  Forget it.  It's a blog.  I don't care.  It's a big internet.  Anyway, dvorak.org slash blog.  Yeah, dvorak uncensored.  I'm sorry, channeldvorak.com has links to everything else I do and that's kind of what  it is.  It's a nexus.  Although the Tech Grouch isn't on there.  What?  He shouldn't be on there.  The Tech Grouch is not really me.  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yes, you need like a friends and family link role.  Yeah, maybe.  Something where you could say, I am not the Tech Grouch, but if I were, I would say watch  it or something like that.  Recommended.  Recommended.  There you go.  I'm Leo Laporte.  I recommend.  Now, people are asking me because we mentioned that we were going to have a video and we  are working on it.  As usual, rollouts take a little longer than I thought, but the new Roku's are on the way.  The MediaFly's platform is up and running.  We are recording video of every show and editing it.  You will find video in the next week or so of all our shows, or at least the top five  to start.  Twig, Twif, Twit, Windows Weekly, MacBreak Weekly.  I don't know what happened with those last two.  I guess we got tired of Twiz.  We'll be up on the video and then most of the rest of the shows, soon thereafter, on  iTunes, but also on your Roku, your Popcorn Hour, your Yahoo TV, your iPhone, your Pre-Order  your Android, everything.  Everywhere you want to be, that's where we'll be and you'll go, God, I can't get rid of  these guys.  Meanwhile, though, keep listening to the audio version at iTunes or the Zune store and join  us live as we broadcast.  You're looking at me funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say there's a new show you're going to do, I understand, this week in role  playing.  Twerp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  Damn, let me write that down.  I want to be a guest.  Yeah, but you can't be yourself.  You'll have to be the tech grouch or somebody.  I don't know.  All right.  I'll be the vorac.  It would be funny if we do the whole show as somebody else.  It would be funny.  I'm sure I can book the tech grouch.  Maybe on April Fool's we'll do Twerp instead of Twit.  That would be a lot of fun.  We do this show live every Sunday afternoon or evening, 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific,  and now they've changed summertime in Europe.  I guess UTC never changes, so it's still 2200 UTC.  I don't have to worry about it.  But in a couple of weeks when we change to wintertime we're going to have to...  I hate that change.  I hate that change.  I hate it.  That's something we could invade.  Have you and Adam talked about that on Noagent?  It seems like some conspiracy there.  It seems like there's...  It might be.  Ben Franklin's...  Aliens.  Yeah, aliens.  Ben Franklin was definitely an alien.  Thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another Twit...  This is amazing.
