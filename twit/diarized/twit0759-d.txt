Transcript:  Great to have you. So we were talking before the show. In fact, I'm going to take the interview that we did with Dr. Mom.  I was curious. We know that there are a lot of conferences coming up and I've been reading articles saying the world should prepare  because it's probable that the coronavirus, now named COVID-19, will be a pandemic that they have not been able to contain it.  Not a reason to panic by any means, but a lot of companies are reconsidering the tech conference thing.  And so there's a number of stories about, well, Sony is backing out of PAX East. We already know Mobile World Congress was canceled.  Sony and Facebook say they won't go to the Game Developers Conference. IBM, a platinum sponsor of the RSA conference this week in San Francisco, has pulled out.  It seems as if a lot of companies are taking this coronavirus very seriously.  And there will be, we already know, probably a financial hit to Apple and others because of manufacturing issues in China with COVID-19.  Apple shares dropped 2.6 percent. Although, honestly, if you're an Apple stockholder, you're probably taking any opportunity you can to do a little profit taking just because the price is up 80 percent over this year so far.  I mean, it's year over year. It's amazing what's been going on. It's just a temp. Look at that blip. Little drop here, but man.  You know, Dr. Mom gave us a little, and we'll give you the rundown on what to do to protect yourself.  The short answer is wash your hands a lot. Try not to touch your face.  If you can get an N95 mask and they are widely sold out, it might be worth getting one.  But, Dugo, you recommended the CDC site, Lori Gill, where they tell you which N95 masks really will protect you. It's not all will.

Start time: 375.52
End time: 392.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently there's little additions, not just N95, but there's a couple of tag numbers at the end that you want to look out for too, which is why, Leo, you noticed it was so hard to find those specific ones.  Those are really, really expensive if you even have the opportunity to buy one that's come up.

Transcript:  And, Dan, you just said something that kind of depresses me, that the carnival is being canceled in Venice.

Start time: 401.14
End time: 437.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they canceled that. And, I mean, there's obviously a bunch of other events. I heard this morning, I think there were some Italy has sort of the biggest number of cases in Europe right now, which is one of the reasons Venice is one and Milan was another one.  And it's a little surprising because they're both unconnected too. So, like, that's it's this is the thing we're going to see more and more. Right. And I think that's what's interesting about seeing how companies react to it is because this is the first example of it. But it's certainly not going to be the last.  So watching all these companies pull out of conferences and watching cities cancel major events, I think, you know, you're going to see a lot of effects from these types of things going forward.

Start time: 438.08
End time: 455.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also is an opportunity for entrepreneurs here on Indiegogo. This is just in time for Venice's carnival is a plague doctor and 95 mask. If you honestly if you wore that on the streets, I think you'd be assaulted. I just think it looks scary as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People leave you alone maybe and that's not going to say you're not you're you're going to be the one assaulting people if you're wearing that you're never going to have anyone approach you to bother you at all wearing that mask.

We hit the road to our secret bunker to go hang out.  Wait a minute. You not only have a go bag, you have a secret bunker.  I personally do not. I have a very wealthy friend that has a kidding has one. You have an invite. I have two invites depending on if I'm on the West Coast or on the East Coast. I have two places I can go to.  Can you hook a friend up here? You know, you probably know 12 people that have them. You just haven't talked about it because you think it's a joke.

Transcript:  It's the same thing I say about how come we're not going to Mars. Okay. First of all, you need people that are useful. All these rich people think they're going to Mars. We're going to go to do tweet and build a new Twitter. No, you need engineers, laborers, plumbers. You need people that actually do work. So if you find yourself useful, then you could get into a secret bunker. Now, whether that usefulness is money or other skills. I have no skills. Anybody would want to the secret bunker. I could talk to you.  I can podcast. You need a podcaster you could put in a bunker. No, actually. See that I just sit here in the separate bunker right now. Yeah, you go with the telephone sanitizers and the insurance salesman over there. Wait a minute. I feel like we're going somewhere really dark with this. It is dark. I'm scared of the dark. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should Apple investors be worried? I mean, they've had a huge run up over the last 12 months. Warren Buffett sold off eight hundred million dollars worth of his Apple stock last quarter. I mean, certainly that he didn't know coronavirus was coming.

Start time: 661.50
End time: 725.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think there's a reason for them to worry about it. I mean, and Buffett, you know, it's more interesting to look at how much Apple stock he still has a ton, I think, is in billions. Yeah. And so that's a pretty small amount for him.  Holy yeah. So that's a small percentage. You know, even with Apple revising its its quarterly earnings, like, you know, they estimated 63 million dollars in revenue next quarter. If they miss that and they only get 60 billion dollars in revenue, is that really the end of the world for them? I don't think so. I don't think I think what's interesting about it for them is between this and the relations they've had with China and the problems they've had with that over the last year in terms of like the social aspects. I think it's pointing out to them how much of a weak link it is. The fact that they've seen the  centralised so much in China, like they need to consider diversifying their operations for assembly and all of that to more places around the world because they can have a situation where a pandemic breaks out and a whole bunch of their facilities have to get shut down, which could impact their bottom line. So I think that's interesting going forward is just trying to figure out how are you going to deal with these kinds of situations when you put so many eggs in that basket?

Start time: 727.92
End time: 800.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got a lot like that. That's so true. There's the problem. I think that we're seeing right now is that two years in a row Apple has had an issue where being so centrally located in China has negatively affected their finances.  A year ago, they had something happen. They talked about how they were diversifying. We didn't see that happen fast enough. And now a second year, something else has happened where there's too much centralised stuff happening specifically in China and they didn't diversify where they go for supplies and even just building up their people who are buying things.  So I think at this point, it is starting to frighten investors a little because they're not acting on that. They didn't act on it a year ago. And like if Apple wants to make them feel better and make the investors feel a little safer, they will actively go out and diversify more with more efforts so that they won't have to adjust their guideline.  If something big happens, they'll just say, oh, everything's fine with us. We've got things all over the country or all over the world. If something negative happens in China, that's not going to affect us. Terrors won't affect us. Drops in the economy aren't going to affect us. That's what they need to do.

Start time: 800.80
End time: 802.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have they diversified sufficiently? I guess not.

Start time: 803.52
End time: 842.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So two things about the diversification. One, it's hard to diversify when you have a labour force that works for negative money and putting them in other places around the globe. So that's the first thing. Finding another place that can make these products at the price that China makes these prices at, which keeps your investors happy.  Second thing I'd like to point out is if you're a regular person, now's the time to buy a couple of Apple stocks and buy the subchains of their subsidiaries. Because not only is Apple going down, but the place where Apple gets their chips, their memory cards, their glass, everywhere, all those places are taking a hit because they're losing out right now. So if you've got a little bit of money to spread around, now's the time to buy, buy, buy.

Start time: 842.86
End time: 853.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This would be a good moment for me to say none of us know what the hell we're talking about. And if you make investments based on any recommendations you hear on our shows, good luck.

Start time: 854.52
End time: 858.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that being said, I think Apple in general is a safe bet on.

Start time: 859.26
End time: 883.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again. Again. I'm the guy who told my dad five or six, after Steve Jobs died, so it was nine years ago, oh, sell your Apple stock. Apple's not going anywhere.  And every Thanksgiving, since the tank. Yeah, it's got Apple's got a tank. You should sell that stock cash in on the all the money you've made. Every Thanksgiving, he tells me. And I didn't do it.  Ha ha.

Start time: 885.64
End time: 927.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry, I think Owen makes a great point, too. The other issue there is like volume, right? Apple makes so many devices, just millions upon millions of devices moving their supply chain from one place to another is a huge challenge, right?  Finding not only the labor force, but also the facilities that are available to produce these kinds of things in the huge scale that they needed to be produced.  That's almost impossible. So like even to Laurie's point, like this being a problem a year ago, a year is not enough time for them to ramp up these kinds of production lines because of the fact that they're so deeply invested in China.  So it's going to be a gradual process. And in some ways, they're unlucky that they got hit two years in a row by these very specific locate events. But yeah.

Start time: 928.58
End time: 935.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about, you know, a 60 billion dollar company, though. I think you can throw money at it to make it go faster.

Start time: 935.24
End time: 958.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do agree with you to a certain extent.  But like, yeah, there's still there's still limitations in terms of like the factories, just because China has made such a huge part of their economy, creating these places where they can build all of these things and having these gigantic labor forces.  And other countries have not invested as much in that yet.  And so Apple can throw money around. But even so, there's just physical limitations.  Let's not forget. I mean, Apple has done this already once.

Start time: 958.72
End time: 991.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did it in 2007 when they introduced the iPhone.  They actually built an amazing I mean, it's not like all this stuff existed before Apple came along and said, let's build the iPhone.  They had to invent machines. They had to create a supply chain.  This is why Tim Cook is now the CEO of Apple.  He created an amazing supply chain.  OK, maybe it took them what, 10 years, probably even take 10 years, five years.  Is there evidence to say that they're doing that now?  Are they starting to look at, you know, Samsung did not get bit because they moved their production to Vietnam some time ago in South Korea.

Start time: 992.16
End time: 1010.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also have to figure that people, again, smarter than us, are looking at it.  I would hope. Yeah.  Can we can we weather this storm?  What is the cost of building a whole new infrastructure as opposed to riding this wave out?  OK, so that might be another reason why they're that seems to me a dumb thing to do just because.

Start time: 1010.46
End time: 1017.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so this wave you ride out, but then there's going to be another.  Well, not necessarily Owen.  We're smart. It was pretty smart.

And it was and I canceled it Friday because it's like they still haven't shipped it.  You breathe on it and it breaks. Yeah.  And that's the other thing.  By the time I get it and review it, no one will care.  Yeah. No one. I love.

Transcript:  So there a trend for us is to report on what the COVID-19  outbreak could do to tech manufacturing.  Smartphone production, they project 12 percent decline this quarter.  The supply chain is labor intensive.  So having people out sick, obviously, is going to cause  not only a shortage in the phones, but all of the upstream  components like camera modules.  So it's going to take a while to recover there.  Several fiber optic suppliers are based in Wuhan, the the locus,  the epicenter of the coronavirus.  That's 25 percent of global production.  That could impact 5G  because 5G is going to require, in many cases, fiber optics.  The flash and DRAM market? No.  Because there are  companies making them in Vietnam and Singapore and South Korea,  and they're also highly automated.  You know, the robots don't get in COVID-19.  No, they don't.  Video game console manufacturing has been heavily hit,  but next generation production should not be impacted  since the PlayStation five and the Xbox series X  aren't launching till the holiday quarter.  And so there'll be time to make the.  You know, they don't sell that many of those  smartwatches, laptop PCs and smart speakers will see the biggest decline  in previous forecasts, smartwatches 16 percent.  So there are some sectors that are going to be hit worse than others.  But but we'll recover, right?  It's so so what you can't get the phone for another month or two, right?

Start time: 1290.88
End time: 1323.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think there's a there's a coming and going aspect to it, too.  I mean, when when Apple talked about revising their forecast,  part of it was not only the production aspect,  but the fact that they had to close all their stores in China.  Yeah. And China is a huge market.  So any company that's doing business in China right now,  they're going to take some hits from that.  And then the question is, if this continues to expand more globally,  are other cities and other countries going to follow the,  you know, the playbook that China set out and closed down  a bunch of these stores in other countries, thus killing,  you know, some brick and mortar retail?  So there's there's definitely a consumer impact as well as just the production side.

Transcript:  Well, since I've got Dan and Laurie here and they both cover  the Apple space, let's  talk about whatever this next phone that Apple, the rumor is now March 31st.  Is that credible that Apple will have an event to announce this  four hundred dollar successor to the iPhone SE?

Start time: 1341.66
End time: 1356.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that if if it's an Apple, if there will be an Apple event,  March 31st makes the most sense.  I think they they traditionally will have it the last Tuesday of the month.  So that that fits right into the narrative of when they would have it, for sure. Yeah.

Start time: 1357.46
End time: 1364.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I agree. Dan, how much has the coronavirus impacted that?  I mean, that's probably what those factories were making.

Start time: 1365.96
End time: 1407.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, there's the possibility of that.  I think what's likely is that since Apple already said in their in their guidance  that they'll be constrained on the iPhone, it's likely that if they are sort of  ramping this, that there will be short supply of it in the first place.  There's there's an open question of what the demand is going to look like, though.  There are certainly a lot of pent up demand from people looking for a cheaper iPhone  and small. I think that is interesting.  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.  So I think that that is a risk because I think you'll be looking at maybe  just it's going to take more.  You know, there'll be a few weeks.  Ship times will slip pretty quickly and it will take a little while for them.  But I don't think it necessarily will push back them announcing it.  I think they want to hit that March date just for not only that,  but whatever else they have in the pipeline. Yeah.

Start time: 1407.96
End time: 1430.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can hit the launch and the preorder and then get that first wave out  like they always do and then tell you that the next wave is going to take a month  to get to you or whatever they want to do.  But then they can actually judge what the marks on the back.  And you got to figure they were already pumping out these phones before this  happened. They're not just making these phones a month before they announced them.  Right. I mean, right.  So these phones have already probably been in production  if they planned on having a March launch on them.

Start time: 1431.98
End time: 1435.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 1435.98
End time: 1464.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how they do it. Like the Z Flip.  Well, I know I know this phone's going to sell like hotcakes,  not just because it's cheaper,  but just because I personally in the world see so many people with small phones  and it annoys me. And I asked them why.  And it's just because they can't deal with a bigger phone.  And I'm like, you are living in 1980 right now and I cannot hold this thing in my hand.  But they love a small phone.  So I think this thing is going to sell like hotcakes for a lot of people.

Start time: 1464.68
End time: 1480.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's it's not even that much smaller, though.  I mean, it's basically going to look a lot like the probably the eight,  the iPhone eight in terms of size, which is smaller than the 10 and the 11.  But not as small as the S.E.  Right. The S.E. was way smaller.  Yeah. I don't think they're going to.  Was S.E. four inch? Yeah.

Start time: 1480.44

That's a candy bar phone.  You don't like the new.  Oh, sorry. I apologize. My mistake.  Anyway, I wish I had an iPhone in front of me to show the difference

Start time: 1512.84
End time: 1541.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  between the two, because it's like again, when we talk about small,  I'm thinking of that four inch form factor.  So I'm thinking that size.  So when people say the iPhone nine, if you want to call it,  that is the smaller phone.  I'm completely in a disagreement.  Dan, you've you're right down my pathway where this is not the small phone.  This is the same size as the iPhone eight.  That's not a small phone. That's it.  That's a huge.  It's like a four point seven. Yeah.  Yeah. It's way too big.

Start time: 1546.68
End time: 1592.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. And that's true.  That actually my my standard phone is an iPhone 11 Pro.  And I've talked about this before.  And Rene Richie is actually the one that pointed out to me that that size phone,  the four inch phone,  that it can't handle the processors that are now being made for these faster phones.  So if you wanted a four inch phone, you would have to have a  a series chip that's three or four years old,  because that size can't handle that capacity.  So Apple's not going to make a phone that small anymore.  They're just not going to do it.  It's to the technology that goes inside.  It would be too old. Nobody wants that.  I don't want an iPhone SE that has technology from five years ago.  I want an iPhone SE.  You want it to look like today's technology.

Start time: 1598.04
End time: 1616.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So until the technology of iPhones, basically.  Yeah. So they say the rumor is that it'll be an A13,  the current A model processor in this new iPhone.  So they just couldn't make it small because is it heat?  Or is this the physical size of the chip?

Start time: 1617.30
End time: 1629.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The processor would just burn out the phone.  The processor is too strong to handle.  It's too much, man. You can't handle the processor.  The phone can't handle it.  And the phone would just kind of blank out.  It would just crash on you all the time because it couldn't handle it.

Start time: 1629.60
End time: 1642.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I assume battery capacity would probably be an issue, too, right?  You need that extra space to fit in those higher power batteries  and power not only the processor, but the screen and everything else that goes in there.  So there is a physical space limitation for that as well.

Start time: 1643.18
End time: 1658.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. My hope, though, is that someday the guts of phone technology  will be advanced enough that we can go back to smaller phones and just have faster processors  and stronger batteries that are smaller so that we can have that small phone again.  That's my hope. Someday.

Transcript:  It's interesting. It's interesting, too, because like there was, you know,  I think back to like the 80s and 90s and miniaturization was the trend for so long, right?  Especially with the advent of microprocessors.  And it seems like now we've moved away from that on that arc.  And so eventually we have to wait to get back to the point where we can miniaturize everything once again.  We're trying to do so much. We've got multiple GPU cores in this thing.

End time: 1711.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, to be honest, they're overdoing it at some point.  Like there's no R&D in reverse engineering to make things smaller now  because you're making a phone that's got 16 gigs of RAM in it.  For what? Like, what are you really doing on your phone and on a Samsung S20 that you need?  Everything. 16 and 30. No, you're not doing everything.  I'm doing everything.

Because you got to sell it.  And it's just so annoying because why? And greed.  And we got to do it anyway. I'm sorry for complaining.  But I mean, we don't need this. We don't need it.  All right.

I have it written down Milwaukee  from Mark and Ray's visiting from Minneapolis.  So we've got people from all over the country visiting us.  Thank you for being here in the studio with us.  Our show today brought to you by Zapier.  I am so in love with Zapier.  Now it's gotten to the point where  when I use a new app or tool, first before I even get into it,  I say, do you have Zapier integration?  Zapier lets me automate the things I do over and over again  so that I can still do them over and over again, but with no effort.  And man, it works so well.  There are over 2000 apps you can connect with.  If you're in business, everything from emails to spreadsheets to CRM.  Got a home automation system?  Yes.  I use it for our shows all the time to build our rundowns.  I use Zapier to bookmark, to tweet and to put it into a Google Docs spreadsheet  so Carson could put it in the show rundown.  And it happens automatically.  Four and a half million people who use Zapier.  And on average, they save 40 hours a month.  40 hours a month, they don't have to do anything  because they're using Zapier.  And you don't have to be a developer to use Zapier.  It's easy.  Just connect the apps you use, connect your business software.  If you're in sales, you engage leads instantly, automatically import new customers.  You can notify your team about opportunities.  Zapier is unique in another way.  It supports multi-step Zaps.  So multiple things can happen with a single trigger.  That's very, very cool.  Very, very cool.  You want to try it?  We've got a two week trial for you.  But you got to hurry right now through the end of the month.

End time: 2076.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's apples and viruses together.  But I do.  I, as long as we're talking, I, I saw that weird target post.  Some target employee posted pages from a target inventory system that showed a  bunch of new X products, including AirPods X generation.  What do you guys think?  When I looked at that, I thought that's just, that's fake news.

Start time: 2077.42
End time: 2081.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm skeptical for sure.  Okay.  We got to, we got a fake news.

Start time: 2082.04
End time: 2083.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dan, you're skeptical.

Start time: 2084.26
End time: 2130.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, I mean, it's no secret that Apple's been working on other  versions of the air pod and they would be crazy not to like, like Laurie just  said, they've been back ordered basically since they came out.  Like there is a clearly huge demand for their wireless headphones.  They sales are great.  Right.  So why not expand that?  Because the biggest issue with AirPods for a lot of people is that they're not  the right fit or they're not the right, they're not comfortable.  So if they're talking, you know, there's been a lot of rumors that they would be  using things like, yeah, or possibly an over the, over the year set, like more  like a studio set of headphones and obviously beats make some of those now,  but certainly something with Apple branding.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's certainly something with the Apple branding.  I think they die them white, bingo, AirPods.  There you go.  So I'm not surprised that there might be something coming.  I don't buy the name.  That's the other thing.

Start time: 2130.32
End time: 2142.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and then there was these, there were these images following shortly  thereafter, Apple TV, Gen X, Apple watch series X band, uh, Apple iPod touch X.  So Laurie, you believe it.

Start time: 2144.00
End time: 2241.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it doesn't seem out of the question.  So I don't look at that and go, Oh, this is definitely fake.  I look at this and go well on March of N is coming.  Apple always releases new watch bands in March.  Um, TV plus is something that they're really trying to promote.  So putting out a new Apple TV, just in a bumped generation version, nothing special.  Makes sense to me that, that that would be called out at a March event or  maybe at WWDC, just an update, you know, nothing crazy and new AirPods.  So the price on that one is what kind of throws me off because I do believe  that we're going to see a third generation AirPods coming out.  Maybe, maybe by this fall, just that makes sense.  They're just kind of, you know, making it a little better, doing a  little changes here and there.  That's why we're hearing about AirPods light, whatever that is.  AirPods pro light, which I don't think is true.  I think it's just a third generation AirPods.  Um, but the price of that looks more like an over the ears thing, but  Beats also hasn't put out a new version of studio pro with the H1 chip.  So this could be called Apple AirPods generation X, but what it really might  be is the new generation of the Beats studio pro.  I hope I have that right.  Um, they, their naming scheme is so hard for me to remember.  It's their over the ears, um, pros, uh, noise canceling headphones that for Beats.  So that could be the new generation that's going to have the H1 chip.  We know that's coming.  It just hasn't come out yet.  So these to me, I'll line up with like potentially, yes, that's, this could be  what's coming in March or maybe by WWDC.

Start time: 2241.54
End time: 2244.04

End time: 2258.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it feels to me, I don't think these are like Photoshopped.  I feels to me like they're real, but it's, I mean, it's the target inventory system.  So we just put in a bunch of dummy entries.

Start time: 2259.80

He's just saying, this was the image that I, that I created as a mockup  just to give you an idea, but I might agree with, I agree with Lori that like

Start time: 2285.08
End time: 2317.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  there are, there's enough here that works in terms of things like, I think the  watch bands, like, you know, they, they roll out new colors every spring.  That's they've been doing that for years.  I think that makes, yeah, exactly.  So this stuff does line up well with that March event.  The TV one is the one that I had the biggest question mark about.  Cause I think, although I think Lori's like logic for that is spot on.  I think that product is such a weird place for them to be right now, just  because it is so much more expensive than any competing product.  It's 200 bucks roughly.  Right.  And they've been, because they've been putting their Apple TV plus app  on all the other platforms, including other people's TV.

Start time: 2328.08
End time: 2344.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm curious about that system too, that with that new gaming 599 a month arcade  games, cause their last one had a gaming component to where you could play games on  it. They might have something that's a little bit beefier for that.  If they find that people are actually paying for their arcade, something with  that maybe.

Start time: 2344.48
End time: 2413.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And just like a little spec bump, which is why, you know, it's not a revolutionary  brand new product that's cheaper or something like that.  They're successful with Apple TV that with the box itself, not as successful as  you broke who are something that's much less expensive, but they're successful  enough. So until they come up with the completely new set top box or maybe  dongle or, or, you know, streaming stick or something, they're just going to give  us spec book here and there and just kind of say, if you were waiting to buy  an Apple TV because you were waiting for a spec bump, well, we just gave you one.  So just go buy that now and start watching TV plus and playing Apple arcade  on it. It makes a lot of sense to me that they would just kind of, you know, it  peas the masses in that way.  I actually waited way longer than I needed to because I was hoping that they  would put out a new Apple TV with even just a minor spec bump and they never did.  So finally in like last December, I just upgraded to the 4k.  I had the 1080p one and I just upgraded to the 4k just because I was tired of  waiting around. So this probably appeals to people like me who was like just,  yeah, let's give it to them and then we'll have something bigger later.  But for now, here's this.

But look at their mouths. Look at their eyes.  Look, it looks it's indistinguishable.  You think Jeff Bezos is the alien with a giant brain  and that Elon Musk is Commander Pike. Creepy.  It's a little crazy thing about this is what they rendered this on a Samsung S  20. I wouldn't be surprised.  You're joking, obviously, but I am. Yeah.  I don't know.

What I really is amazing is the lips because they're using the dialogue  in the both of this and the Star Trek from the original.  So the lips have to move exactly like the original.  And the lip sync looks great.  But they have to be Elon Musk's lips.  That's pretty it's pretty interesting.  I don't you know, it's disturbing for sure.  Is it worrying? I don't know.

Transcript:  But at the rate you're going,  I'm a famous podcast.  I'm not even a famous podcaster. I'm nothing, man.  That was the worst cut.  A friend of mine once when I was working at tech TV said,  You're an unknown host on a on a barely watched cable channel.  I was like, Ouch, ouch.  Wouldn't hurt if it weren't true.  EU has passed the bill that says interoperable chargers.  And there was some conversation that maybe it wouldn't affect Apple  because it wasn't about the actual cables.  Well, now it looks like maybe it is going to.  Apple was fighting against it.  The EU voted 582 to 40 in favor of a common charging standard type C.  So and the reason is, hey, we're all buying way too many chargers.  It'd be nice if we could reuse them and they wouldn't end up in the landfill.  Apple says you're going to kill innovation  because the lightning port is, of course, so much better than type C.  Is it? No, no, no.  That's the same thing, right?

Start time: 2811.88
End time: 2814.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  now that they don't have that argument anymore.

Start time: 2821.66
End time: 2829.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think the tricky thing with that, too, is like, you know,  so 10 years ago, the EU tried to do this with the micro chargers.  And, you know, it didn't really catch on.

Start time: 2829.86
End time: 2836.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2836.76
End time: 2867.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But there's also a moving target, right?  Because type C will last for 10 years and they're going to have to mandate  another connector. So like, you know, putting that in the hands  of government regulation rather than the individual phone makers.  I applaud the idea behind it.  I just wonder how how much it's going to be workable.  Like, is Apple going to create a second phone for the EU market?  Are they really going to abandon the lightning port  after all the time and money they spent at it?  Are they just going to figure out another loophole for skirting this?  I'm a little skeptical it's actually going to happen.

Start time: 2867.20

Transcript:  That's what that's what Tim Hardwick's contention is in Mac rumors.  He says this is just going to make Apple make this connectionless iPhone  that there's been rumors about that just does wireless, doesn't have a port at all.

Start time: 2881.16
End time: 2907.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems horrible.  I don't think I don't think it's going to happen.  And they're and they they've already gotten rid of their own lightning cable.  When I buy my MacBook Pro, I'm not even going to pick it up.  So I'm going to touch it.  Does has two USB ports on it.  No other ports on it.  Pro USB. So I have everything else should just be that.  And they need to get rid of it on their own.  They know better. They're just squeezed out because they can charge you  forty five thousand dollars for this stupid lightning cable.

Transcript:  There is a good point to be made there.  Ubiqui sells their dongles.  I use a Ubiqui to, you know, to log into LastPass and other high,  you know, Gmail, highly secure things.  And this one has a type A connector on it.  But there's a Ubiqui with a type C and one end and a lightning on the other end.  The one with lightning on it is forty dollars more than the one with just type C.  And in a way, that's how you can tell.  That's the Apple tax is forty dollars.

Start time: 2934.38
End time: 2971.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there's an NFC one, too, though, so that in theory that should work.  Yeah, that's actually when we're going to wireless one.  Yeah, I have the NFC one. Right.  I think they'll move eventually because the lightning port will eventually  just pass its usefulness. Right.  Like in the same way.  I think the issue is like they're also worried like when they abandoned  the 30 pin connector, it was the right move at the time.  But people were not happy about that, but having to replace all their stuff.  I mean, it's softened a little bit by the fact that the USB-C is at least standard.  But yeah, I'm kind of picturing there being a lot of revolt  when they decide to eventually abandon lightning stuff, because so many people  have not only cables, but accessories and peripherals.

Start time: 2971.60
End time: 2984.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's in the next year or two.  I think they're going to have to.  And I think now more people are because they want USB-C.  Yeah. Blame the blame the EU.  And I'll be happy because I have USB-C chargers all over the place.  I'd love it if everything was USB-C.

Start time: 2985.06
End time: 3049.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But to further Dan's point, and while on the one hand,  I do think that Apple was still trying to protect their proprietary cables.  The fact is that it it potentially could stifle innovation  because if there's a regulation that mandates that phones in the EU  have to have a USB-C port, why is anyone going to try to make something better  than that? If you have to do it, nobody's going to invest in the research  to make a better one.  They're just going to stick with the USB-C.  So 10 years from now, I don't even see why anybody would invest in 10 years  from now trying to make a better port because there's this regulation  that forces them to make it USB-C.  So I do think that these kind of regulations have a negative impact  on our ability to like see advancements in technology,  because money has to get put into researching and investing in this kind of stuff.  And if somebody says you can't no matter how cool it is, you can't use it.  You have to use this other technology.  No one's going to put the money in in the first place.  It's just going to stop right there.

Transcript:  I believe in the power of man and the power of USB 2.0 to now USB 3.0.  And I look forward to the USB-C 2.0 or 5.9.  USB 4.0 has already been announced and it uses the Type-C connector.  Yeah. Yeah. So they just got to keep the same thing and just upgrade it  and innovate. I believe in that.  But I'm just trying to get off this lightning cable so bad.  I think I would guess Type-C.

Start time: 3072.78

Transcript:  I mean, I'm not claiming to know, but I have I'm putting my USB-C Pixel 4  right next to my iPhone 11 Pro Max with its lightning.  And that's about it's a little bigger.  It's pretty close. Yeah.

Transcript:  And we all want it like Apple fans want USB-C at this point.  But, you know, those of us that are kind of entrenched in technology,  of course, my mom doesn't want it.  But yeah, people like me, we're on board with this.  We're ready for USB-C.  We want it. It's coming.  We're hoping we were hoping Apple would do it on iPhone 10s, actually.  And we're really hoping it for iPhone 11.  So with this sort of like regulation in place,  with the potential of seeing it, maybe not maybe not in this fall,  but in 2021, almost definitely seems very exciting  because we've been wanting this all along anyway.  It's you know, it's just all the rest of the people you have to get on board  with it, like why they take away my lightning or now I have to get a new cable.

Start time: 3159.60
End time: 3170.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I want them to replace the lightning port on all the other stuff, too.  I mean, like my trackpad and my keyboard charge, you know, like that.  Yes. Why? Like that could be your Apple TV remote.  Yep. Yeah.

Start time: 3170.88
End time: 3180.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Look at how long we've had the first USB, the USB-A ports have been around.  Right. Those are still good.  And they've gotten faster.  So I agree. I think, you know, it's not like the end of the line.  But Laurie does have a point that like if people are mandated to put that on there,  how much time and energy are they going to invest  into trying to find the next best thing?  And can Apple make an end run around it by doing that, you know,  totally portless phone?

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by, speaking of cookies, Wasabi.  How about Wasabi?  I'm not talking about that green blob on your sushi.  I'm talking it's hot, but it's hot cloud storage.  Yeah. I like Wasabi in both cases.  Wasabi was created by my friend  David Friend and his co-collaborator, Jeff Flowers.  They are brilliant.  They they found a way to write data onto hard drive sequentially  instead of by sector, which saves a lot of time.  It's much more efficient.  And it gives you hot cloud storage.  That is I mean, it sounds like I'm making this up.  It's 80, but I'm not.  It's 80 percent cheaper all because of this new technology.  You get 11 nines of durability as good as you can get.  Wasabi does regular integrity checking.  All the objects store to check for integrity every 90 days.  They have multiple redundant operations centers, tier four data centers.  They're highly secure. They're fully redundant.  So if something if you do the integrity check and the data file is changed,  you can get it from the other center.  So you're never going to lose a bit, not one bit of data.  You've got I think this is a great feature in today's era of ransomware.  You can designate your data to be immutable.  It cannot be erased.  It cannot be altered.  Human error, ransomware, nothing can change that data.  That is you try that on your on prem storage.  You can't do that.  You've got access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs,  so that you can control who has access to what.  Wasabi follows all the best security models and design practices.  State of the art. It's HIPAA compliant.  It's FINRA compliant, CJS compliant.  And it is 80 percent cheaper than S3.  And oh, by the way, if you use S3, you already know how to use Wasabi  because it uses the S3 API.  But unlike unlike S3, there is no charge for API requests.  There's no charge for egress.  There's no complex storage tiers.  It's just a better technology. Why?  Because they're the little guys.  Everybody, when they say, let's go to the cloud, they're saying S3.  Let's go AWS or Azure or or Google Cloud.  And so that nobody even knows about Wasabi.  That's why I'm really I'm on a mission to tell people, look,  if you're looking at those three, add one more name at Wasabi.  I think you're going to be very, very impressed.  And I love it because I think we're making headway.  I talk to more and more people.  They'll come up to me, say, yeah, we went we chose Wasabi.  You were right.  You can find out if you want to try it.  You can get an unlimited trial for for a month.  When you go to Wasabi.com, click the free trial link  and then use the offer code Tweet.  So really bang on it.  Put a bunch of data on it.  Move it around. Try and see what see how it works.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Joe, don't forget to use the offer code Tweet for two reasons.  One, so they know you heard it here.  It helps us.  But also so you get that unlimited free storage for a month.  It is great if you're a managed service provider.  You're reselling this stuff.  You can actually give it to your customers for less than they're already paying.  And you'll still make more money.  You got to love that.  Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I dot com.  Bum bum bum bum bum bum.  Do do do do do do.  Let's see.  Is there any I know more Apple stories?  I'm sorry, I apologize.  We'll get well.  All right. I'll don't I won't do an Apple story.  Well, I was going to ask about the story that Mark Gurman had that Apple's  thinking about thinking about letting you make a different default browser  or a different default music app on the iPhone.  Is that even possible?

Transcript:  I think it's actually good.  I would. Are users.  I think it's good for everybody.  I think it's good for users who get a lot more choice and are a lot happier  with their options.  I think it's good for developers who make those third party apps  because it means they can actually compete on a more level playing field  with things like mail and Safari.  Previously, if you had a third party app and use like Chrome on the iPhone,  you'd still get kicked in the Safari.  I know that's annoying.  And I think it's actually good for Apple because not only  does it get sort of the competitors and antitrust regulators.  That's why they do it. Right.  But also it makes their users happier.  And I think it encourages them to improve their own built in apps  because they actually have to compete, not just because it's built in  and it's the thing everyone's going to use. Right.  And I don't think everyone, most users are not going to ever touch that.  But the users who do want to change it are going to be really happy  that they finally have it as an option.  So I think it's a win, win, win.

That's not going to happen.  Apple did try to suppress Tom Sadowski's book, App Store Confidential,  saying the book has stuff that Tom has agreed never to reveal.

And he had said that he he showed them the book he presented before he was fired,  while he was still working with him.  He showed them the book and he felt very strongly that this was going to help  developers. And I think that's why this book got so popular is the developers  would love to know.  Because it feels like a dark box. Yeah.  Yes. And this can help them.  I haven't read it, but it sounds like what he was trying to do was making it  easier for developers to get their apps through through the App Store and get  them approved.  But he has been fired by Apple.  Their statement was that he had been let go, that he shouldn't have written this  book, that he had signed an NDA agreement so that they want him to, you know,  to remove, destroy all copies of it, not sell it anymore.

Transcript:  And that shouldn't be that way.  They should be able to know what's going on.  I think, you know, I guess we come across, you know, apps that somehow  Apple suddenly takes down from the app store and the developer doesn't understand why.  And they get this very vague response.  This allows Apple to continue to do stuff like that.  That that seems really it doesn't make sense.  Why? Why would you suddenly tell me that my app is not approved, even though it was  approved before? And Apple might say something like, well, now you're copying our  operating system, even though Apple might have been actually copying their app  or something like that. This the secret, secretiveness must allow them to get away  with stuff like that and just say, well, you know, we've got our regulations inside  here that you have to follow and you just have to figure it out.

Transcript:  Larry Ellison is, as you know, Oracle is in  in the Supreme Court in their fight with Google.  This is one that's been going on forever and ever and ever.  Oracle is trying to collect eight billion dollars in royalties because Google  use Java in the Android operating system, except they didn't use Java.  They duplicated the Java API.  And Larry says, well, we had that's a copyright API.  So Ellison hosts a nice dinner for the president of the United States, a golf  outing, one hundred thousand dollars per couple for the golf.  And if you want to go to the policy quote policy roundtable, a quarter of a million  dollars raised a lot of money for the president's reelection campaign.  And lo and behold, the Trump administration is now telling the Supreme  Court, you should you should probably reject an appeal by Google on this one.  You should. You know what? Oracle's right.

Justice Sotomayor just published a piece saying actually, no, it was her dissent  in a recent Supreme Court case where they upheld a Trump administration policy  on immigration, saying apparently the Supreme Court now is just going to listen  to whatever the administration says and support there.  So that normally you'd say a meekest brief from the president doesn't carry  any more weight than from anybody else.  I would say in this case, it might carry a lot of weight.

Because, well, for whatever reason, you want to think that's cynical.  The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants in that 10 billion dollars.  I think I'll take it from anybody.

Start time: 3957.58
End time: 4035.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could care less about your 10 billion dollars  when you're avoid paying taxes and you pay zero taxes.  How about you give out 10 billion dollars every year  for climate change or to help homeless or to do something?  Then also, when you're giving out this money, why don't you appoint a person  that we can go to to know exactly what you're doing with this money?  Now, Amazon is destroying the planet in general with its shipping.  Yes, people go to the stores.  But what are you saving when you go order one toothbrush  and have it shipped to your house?  And then five minutes later, you oh, I need toothpaste.  And it comes in a separate package delivered by UPS, Amazon  and the mailman are coming to your house.  So how are you really saving the planet with your crappy system  of delivering everything in every which way possible  because you want to be convenient.  Then on top of that, inside baseball, people return so much crap  that they would never do it in another store.  And it's wasteful. OK.  UPS has a system now.  Amazon came up with this great idea where they do bulk shipping.  So instead of you returning that toothbrush and them shipping out  one whole toothbrush, they collect things into an 18 cube box  and they can fit 20 to 30 items in that box.  That's great. Amazon totally appreciate you.  But also they have the system where it's computer and it's digitized.  At Halloween at one of our stores, we return  2000 costumes in the first week after Halloween.

Start time: 4036.18

Start time: 4040.02
End time: 4094.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the day after Halloween for two weeks straight,  people were bringing in four and five costumes,  things that they would never return at another store.  But since it's on Amazon, they only had to talk to a computer.  They return it. So they've got the scam going in.  They could dress their whole family up like the Disney Channel for 200 bucks.  Wear it, go out, get their candy, come back in, return it  and then send it back to wherever landfill or trash company  or magic shipping container box that people come spend 250 on  and are just returning stuff that they would never ever return and not use again.  So it's it's a system that creates so much waste.  So he goes out and he says he's put out ten billion dollars.  Like you owe me ten billion dollars in taxes to which you pay zero.  So this one time cookie promo thing that you put out so we can talk about it  and be happy. I don't care.  I want ten billion dollars a year or I want you to pay your fair share taxes  or I want some direct accountability to this money  that you're just handing out willy nilly.

Transcript:  Twitter has been busy banning and all sorts of stuff.  I think they banned 70 of Mike Bloomberg's.  Is he this is a little maybe there's another rant here, Owen,  because Twitter's all excited that they found 70 accounts from real,  by the way, real people who were kind of all at once  cutting and pasting tweets on behalf of Mike Bloomberg.  So they banned those.  But meanwhile, we're learning that the Russian troll factory is on overtime

Start time: 4219.96
End time: 4222.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4223.22
End time: 4233.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that Twitter is suspending 70 pro Bloomberg accounts  citing platform manipulation.  I you know, I feel like this is kind of selective enforcement here.

Start time: 4233.92
End time: 4265.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so think about this, though.  I've read I've read this whole thing from top to bottom.  And what it sounds like is that Bloomberg is trying to do something  that a lot of people have done, which is hire a company  that has people under it sending out tweets to make that Twitter account  look more popular. Right.  And and a good company would have people sending individual tweets  that sounded more original, that sounded more natural,  that actually spoke to these people.

Start time: 4266.18
End time: 4269.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that their mistake is that their mistake is cutting and pasting

Start time: 4270.84

Start time: 4274.10
End time: 4325.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, who have no like no real real influencer experience.  There was, you know, some some Twitter follower Twitter  handle that had zero followers, another who was previously  a supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth, like an outspoken  supporter of them.  And then suddenly switching to Bloomberg.  The problem is that this isn't grassroots.  This isn't organic.  This is the Bloomberg organization paying people to act  like they want him as a president.  And so their tweets sound fake.  They sound cut and paste.  And, you know, they don't sound like they're coming from the heart.  And what the Bloomberg campaign needs to do instead  is to find real, passionate supporters and ask them to voluntarily  do this kind of stuff instead of get paid to do it.  They're just doing it wrong.

Start time: 4326.16
End time: 4360.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is, this is an easy situation because like all those things,  like you said, if they're copy and pasted, that's easy for the,  you know, an algorithm to track down.  It's a lot harder to track down people who are being paid maybe,  but are also, you know, making it sound more original or more unique.  So I think that's Twitter, at least, is trying to crack down on some of this stuff,  which has some things to say for it.  But I think that they're going to find there's a lot more challenge below this.  So tooting your own horn about like, well, we took out all these Bloomberg bots  when, you know, Russia and all these other things are doing a much better job.  As you said, I think that's the harder part.

Start time: 4361.16
End time: 4378.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to be fair, they've updated their systems because they just caught like  the peanut guy with the baby nut thing,  the social media company that was promoting that.  They caught all those fake accounts, too.  So the new algorithm is catching them in there.  And they are announcing when they're catching people.

Transcript:  Peanut, VaynerMedia from the Super Bowl ad.  They they got caught by Twitter also by using fake accounts, trying to promote the hashtag.  Oh, that's right. That's right.  So Twitter is has updated their system now.  So they're announcing when they're catching everybody.  And so hopefully they're just getting better at it and catching more people.  I mean, it's just amusing how when it's something that you don't understand,  it's like, oh, the Russians are doing it like we just blankly blame Russia for everything now.  And it's just weird.  So and Bloomberg finding someone that really cares is hard to do  because he throws out money and I wouldn't do anything for Bloomberg unless he paid me

She doesn't look at anything when we do a show together.  She doesn't really listen to it.  She doesn't look at it.  She doesn't check it.  She doesn't care. But she's all in in a moment.  So just for me training her about how it's supposed to be.  She teaches her friends that she's got her friends not being into likes or caring about  who's looking at what and trying to make the perfect picture.  Like she just she's really good with the Internet.  And I'm super proud because two weeks ago she got slammed illegally in a wrestling match  and her wrist was basically broken and dangling.  She looked at the coach and she said, I'm going to keep going.  And she got up and she finished the round because she was winning and she didn't want  to quit because she didn't want to lose.  So she finished the round, goes into the second round, and then the coach called it because  he didn't know if her wrist was broken.  And the first thing she came up to me, she's like, look, I didn't quit.  He called it.  I'm like, I know, I know.  But I can die knowing that my daughter is tough enough to handle her own self mentally  and physically, that she's a tough cookie and she's a fighter.  So I can I can pass out on this mic right now and be a happy dad.

If you're a podcaster, if you deliver content, if you've got a website, if you've got an  app, you need a CDN, a content delivery network.  And there is no one better than our CDN, Cashfly.  That's what we've been on for 10 years now.  We're not alone.  Microsoft, NFL, Rakuten.  We all use it.  LG, ours, Technica, because it's well, it's faster.  It's faster than you know, it's like up like five times faster than you're just your HTML  delivery mechanism.  It's faster than most other CDNs, about 30% faster than their competition.  And now with Cashfly's new cash shield, you're not only going to be faster, you're going  to save money.  You benefit from a huge reduction in data transfer fees with AWS's S3 and other cloud  storage origins by increasing your cash rate ratio to 100%.

With their 100% cash shield, Cashfly's guaranteed availability, you're just golden.  I mean, literally, a 100% SLA.  That's amazing.  It reduces origin spend by thousands a month, guarantees zero cash misses, your download  speeds go up, no buffering, guaranteed availability, highest quality of service, scale your video  streaming to reach global audiences of any size.  This network is amazing and I say that as a happy Cashfly user for many, many years.  Look, we love Cashfly.  We know you will too.  And so that's why we set this up.  If you go to twit.cashfly.com, bring your current CDN bill, bring your usage trends  and see what Cashfly can do for you.  No hard sell.  They're great people, but they can really make a difference.

It's different, but it's the same.  I assume that YouTube is going to have the lowest views that day in American history  and not so much that voters care about Trump.  But anyone sub 14 is going to be very upset when they log into YouTube that day and they  don't see their favorite YouTuber or song or whatever and they're going to log out.

Pay up or we'll make Google ban your ads.  So the threat is we are going to send so much bot and junk  traffic clicking your ads on your website that Google's  automated anti-fraud systems will suspend your account for  suspicious traffic.  Wow.  What a clever idea.  Next generation.  Yeah.  Here's an example from one of Krebs on Security's readers who  maintain several sites that receive a fair amount of traffic.  Here's an email.  Very soon, the warning notice from above, which is a Google  warning, will appear at the dashboard of your AdSense  account undoubtedly.  This will happen due to the fact that we are about to flood  your site with huge amount of direct bot-generated web  traffic with 100% bounce ratio and thousands of IPs in the  rotation, a nightmare for every AdSense publisher.  More also, we'll adjust our sophisticated bots to open in  endless cycle with different time duration every AdSense  banner which runs on your site.

But it's interesting to target the AdSense program because  it's where people, it's where the money is.  It's about money.  It's hitting people in the wallet.  That certainly feels painful.  I mean, I'm curious too about just like ad networks in  general, like this has been a bigger and bigger problem for a  lot of these ad networks is dealing with these kind of with  not only like the DOS style attacks, but also like the  injection of malicious ads.  Like I can't count the number of times I've gone to sites where  you get these junk ads that start taking over a legitimate  sites, right?  Like you'll go to a site that's fairly popular and somehow the  ad networks, you know, get hijacked and they don't police  essentially the kind of content in there and you get the  pop ups or the things like win a free iPhone or get an Amazon  gift certificate and you can't especially on a phone, you  can't go back.  You can't get out all of a sudden.  Like I got kicked off this site entirely.  It's really terrible.  And it makes me wonder about the longevity left for for digital ad  networks between the fact that, you know, payments are getting  lower and they're getting attacked by more as vectors for  these type of things.  It seems like it's getting riskier and riskier.

What a world we live in.  First of all, that there is a Rick Astley never going to give  you up emote in Fortnite.  Second, that never going to give you up is something you would  want to have on your Fortnite stream.  Third, that if you do it, the company that owns the record is  going to have you demonetized on a platform.  At the end of the day, Fortnite should have went to them and

You are profiting off of that because it is something that  everybody knows and it makes people happy.

Transcript:  I'm just doing this to make Carson crazy.  All right, let's take a little break.  And then there were a number of passings.  This week.  And we're going to talk about those.  Our show today, as always brought to you from the twit last pass studios.  We're mighty proud of our relationship with last pass.  In fact, we're going to be at RSA.  I may be wearing a full body, a bunny suit and a gas mask, but we're going to be at  RSA and we're going to be hosting the last pass party at Bourbon and branch.  This is such a fun party.  We've done this last three years in a row and it's so much fun.  We invite anybody who's going to RSA to come to our party.  I do want to mention a last pass because not only do they host the studio and are  they throwing a great party at RSA, but they are the password manager I use and  have used for 10 years running and everybody should use.  We use it here at twit.  Every business should use this.  They actually did a survey of businesses.  Uh, that, uh, it was called the global password security report.  And they found out that employees on average at a business will  reuse a password 13 times.  That means 13 separate accounts.  If any one of those accounts gets breached, they're all breached, right?  That's what we've seen happen now is you should never reuse passwords because  once an account gets breached, if you use that password anywhere else, you're  at risk everywhere else.  The average score last pass is a great security, uh, survey that they do in  last pass.  And when you first put in last pass in your business, they run that they say on  those new users, 49% is the average score.  That's not even an F that's like completely failing means half in general.  It means about half the passwords are reused or very, very weak.  The good news is last pass makes it easy to fix it.  And from then on to use strong, unique passwords everywhere you go.  Last pass keeps track, but they solve the authentication challenge in other  ways too.  They have single sign on when you use last pass at work, you have over a  hundred customizable policies.  We use those like crazy.  For instance, we require two factor authentication.  We have minimum password requirements, things like that.  They have lots of other features, MFA, multifactor authentication that can  guarantee that an employee is actually who they say they are.  MFA is brilliant uses geolocation, IP address, and other things to really  verify in addition to the password and this second factor and everything else  to really verify that person is the person.  And remember you're giving your employees, you know, access to your bank  accounts, your databases, your website.  I mean, they have the keys to the kingdom.  You want to make sure they're logging in securely, but it doesn't have to be painful.  Just give them the last pass browser extension and start solving your access  and authentication challenges.  There's last pass families.  That's what I use at home with Lisa.  So I can easily share passwords with her.  There's lots of nice features, including the emergency access feature.  Let's me designate a family members or whoever you want as the people who will  get access to your password vault.  If something should happen to you.  I know we don't like to think about that, but that to me, that's a  huge weight off my mind.  Uh, last pass uses all sorts of really sophisticated encryption technologies  to make sure that your last pass data is not accessible anywhere except on your  device, the, the, the keys used to decrypt and encrypt data are never sent to last  pass servers.  They're never accessible by last pass.  And just to make sure that you feel comfortable that you understand they're  the gold standard, they engage trusted world-class third-party security firms  to conduct regular routine audits and testing of their service and infrastructure.  It works.  We love it.  You will love it.  We use last pass enterprise at twit.  I use last pass at home and I have for a decade now, you need last pass for you  and your business with amazing features that both improve security across your  company and make life easier for your users.

Transcript:  I have an excellent immune system and I'm going to wear, I'm telling you, full body  armor.  So sad story, but I wanted to make sure you all knew that Larry Tesler, who you may not  recognize his name, but was a very important person in the computers that we use today.  He was at Xerox PARC, the Palo Alto Research Center, when Steve Jobs and Apple  employees very famously came to visit and find out about PARC's windowed, menued,  gooey computing.  Tesler was actually offered later a job at Apple where his Dodge Valiant bore a  customized license plate saying no modes.  He was very famous and really very influential at Apple for eliminating modes.  Modes, the idea of a mode, if you've ever used VI, for instance, is that, you know,  you're in VI, you're either in the edit mode or the or the command mode.  You can't do both.  The idea of modes is built into DOS computing, command line based computing.  You can do one thing at a time.  But with this new gooey computing, he was really interested in eliminating modes.  And Apple was early on very much about mode-less computing.  It's kind of funny because we're going back to modes a little bit the way the iPad  works, for instance, your full screen, you're doing what you're doing and you have to  switch to another screen if you want to do anything else.  He was VP of AppleNet and Apple's Advanced Technology Group, ATG.  He played a role in the development of products ranging from the Leesa to the Newton.  And maybe his most important invention was cut, copy and paste.  Without Larry Tesler, we'd have to call him something else.  I think we would have come up with that sometime eventually.  But he is the guy who's credited with cut, copy and paste.  Larry Tesler passed away this week at the age of 74.  Another big name in computing, but the name you may not recognize,  Burt Sutherland also passed away this week.  He was a computer scientist, longtime manager of the Sun Microsystem Labs,  the System Science Laboratory at Xerox PARC and the Computer Science Division of Bult,  Berenic and Newman, where he helped develop what was eventually to become the Internet.  He participated in the creation of the personal computer, microprocessors,  small talk, Java and the Internet.  It's kind of amazing.  These guys who are in the early days of this stuff, how much they could influence.  His brother, Ivan Sutherland and Carver Mead and Lynn Conway developed VLSI,  very large scale integrated circuits at the California Institute of Technology.  Pretty cool.  So another farewell to Burt Sutherland, legend in computing.  He was 83 when he passed away in his Mountain View home.  I don't like to end on a sad note.  Let me think of something fun.  How about 40 years of Photoshop, 30 years of Photoshop?  And in order to sell it.
