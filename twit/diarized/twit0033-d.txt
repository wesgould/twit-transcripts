Transcript:  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, episode 33 for December 4th, 2005.  Welcome back to Pixelcore. We're doing TWiT in studio mainly because Bob  Heil sent us a care package of microphones and I just had to show this off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo's got this new mic. He's in pig heaven. It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why I got into radio 30 years ago. Just for this. This one moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you Bob. Actually if anybody has one of those old RCA mics that they use in the studio,  we probably should collect it for you and give it to you as a gift one of these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send me a note, dvorak.org. I'll give you some information that might help you with that.  My 30th year in broadcasting and my 50th birthday are both next year.  That's perfect timing. Good time to do that.  It's a big old condenser. Dip it in gold. Big tube thing.  Let me introduce the TWiTS ladies and gentlemen. Obviously John C. Dvorak is here.  Also sitting to his right, Robert Heron from PC Magazine.  Hello. Also from Digital Life Television, which is going great guns now that  Patrick's back from Baja. Patrick Norton is also here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick Norton's always on vacation.  I learned that from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We saw how important he was to the production.  You could only do a three minute show while he was gone?  What's that all about? I'm going to be gone next week. Maybe we should do a one minute TWiTS.  I did that before I left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? What was the three minute show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was when I was like, hey, I'm going to be gone. We're going to do more shows next week.  We're not gone.  I got some questions for us. Kick us an email. We got huge.  Basically you asked a bunch of questions to the viewers about what they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you got more response with doing the three minute show? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we asked them. We specifically targeted. We did three minutes of like.  Please send us an email answering these specific questions about how you want to receive DL.TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why you couldn't do a show.  Also here from Pixelcore, Mr. Alex Lindsay, who has a gift for all of the TWiT Army members.  We'll talk about that a little later on.  We also got a little gift for all of the panelists today.  This is a. Presumably gave us to us for a plug. So let's give them the plug.  It's called Droid Maker. Tell us what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually asked for it. Michael Rubin used to work at Lucasfilm back in the.  Like he was the original video droid demo guy.  And so he's been at. He was at Lucasfilm, you know, a long time ago.  And he persuaded Lucasfilm to let him write this book about not so much the movies,  but how all the technology came together.  And so and the only reason I asked for it for everyone because he was talking at an event I was at.  It was just fantastic. I can't wait to read it.  All these stories about the Pixar machine and the, you know, all the techie stuff that George brought to life.  Can we get an autograph?  I have one. I have one.  You know where my son is right now? I didn't know he was going to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At 11 year old birthday party where they've rented all nine Star Wars movies and they're going to show them sequentially.  That's going to be a long. Can you imagine anything worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only six. Lord of the Rings.  It was only six?  No, actually Lord of the Rings.  I think you do all three. You didn't do a trilogy of trilogies?  No, he did three and three more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That last one. It's a mere 15 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and this sounds miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You still have to get through episode one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is he going to do an order from episode one through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to do it in chronological order.  When they were released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or when they were in the chronological order of the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, they were doing exactly what we're not supposed to do.  We're all talking at the same time.  It's not a cocktail party, guys.  Okay, we're going to do this one in surround sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it that when we do a surround sound radio broadcast, we were like around and the person sits in the middle and it's like they're in the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can do that. We were going to do stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should do it. We'll do a version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the pixel works guys. Over here, the sound guy's going, oh my God, this guy's nuts.  No, we can do five. Stop him from talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a 5.1 podcast. Somebody's doing one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a panning of the stuff. It sounds awesome.  We did some internal tests. We just haven't put it out.  So we can definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with it is that the file literally is five times bigger, right?  No, it's just twice.  Oh, stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just stereo. Stereo will sound great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little nerdy. Forget I even mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did launch a couple of, we launched one new podcast and we're going to launch another new podcast.  We've been very busy.  Amber's Inside the Net. Amber MacArthur, my co-host on Call for Help, she's doing Inside the Net,  which is a look at Web 2.0, web services, that kind of stuff.  And that was number one, debuted at number one on iTunes in the first day.  Does that mean you're going to ditch us now?  Yeah, that's it. I'm through with you. She's a lot cuter.  And then, no, actually John and I did a trial of a new show.  We're still working out the kinks on this one. It's your idea though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, you guys actually did this podcast you've been talking about for what, 22 weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, not the podcast we were talking about for 22 weeks. We're still talking about that one.  This is a new show that, which means, you know, that's typical.  No, this is another show. This is where we got together with Larry Lessig and we discussed the Google case  and the show's called Triangulation, which is three guys. Here's the idea.  Three guys, one topic.  Three guys, one topic. But three guys that are in kind of agreement because, you know,  these shows that are these debate shows where you have artificial dichotomies, which,  oh, you know, you're sweet because you're a George Bush guy and no, because you're a Democrat.  You know, these kinds of phony baloney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you liberals. The way you act, you liberals, you don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. It's all heat, no light.  And so what we want to do is try to do a show where you, which is kind of what we do here,  which is you build on the total combined knowledge of everybody involved.  You know, like when we do, we have five, six guys here and we kind of, we know, nobody knows everything  or even the whole pieces of all the puzzles. And then, but combined, it's kind of interesting.  So it's the true educational soft or educational broadcasting model that was when broadcasting was invented.  And when they, when the FCC formed, it was to promote this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing it because nobody wants to do all light. No heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is so cute because you look like you look at you. You're gleaming.  It's like you, you two sound like Pacific Radio.  This is the perkiest I've ever seen in a decade. This is beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell them about the other podcast you want to do or you want to keep that a secret.  I don't know. What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to go. Yeah, we have a potential wine and food podcast or probably just a restaurant review podcast.  I've got a bunch of people lined up. We want to do a website. We'll spin a podcast out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Throbbing Gristle, it's going to be called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that's a band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. We can't use that. I knew there was a better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a terrible name. What's that? You have a better name for that?  I thought you were going to use Coney Island.  Oh, yeah. We use Coney Island Frog's Legs. Yeah.  I hope you registered that. You have two days to register.  We got other names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Top story today. I mean, it's hard to pick. We had a lot of stories,  but I thought the most interesting one is actually two stories about Wikipedia,  starting with John Seigenthaler, the father of the NBC News correspondent.  He was an aide to Robert F. Kennedy.  And there's an article, a biographical article about him on Wikipedia,  which makes the very false assertion that he was somehow suspected in the JFK assassination.  And Seigenthaler, really, I understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hilarious, this entry, which is you read it, you crack up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's the, you know, so he's desperately kind of old school trying to,  well, who wrote it? He wants to know who wrote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to know who wrote it too, because they found out that Adam Curry,  which is this follow-up story you're going to bring up, was putting in, you know,  beefing up his role in the podcast.  But they found out he did it.  Well, yeah, because you can get the IP addresses, you know, and they figured it out.  Why couldn't they find out who did this? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They wouldn't reveal it, I guess, to Seigenthaler.  He could do a John Doe lawsuit with the IP address, but you have to then go to the ISP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or maybe the person who did that was more clever about covering the tracks.  Maybe Adam signed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or John should talk to Adam about how he can correct the Wiki.  I mean, you know, that's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting coll... I think that's exactly what it is,  a collision between kind of old school and new school.  Old school, you think there's a responsible party.  There's the New York Times. There's somebody who can go for a retraction.  There's editorial, and that's not what Wikipedia is.  Now, it makes the very good point that not only did it show up in Wikipedia,  but then a couple of reference sites picked it up.  About.com was one of them.  Yeah, and I think... I can't remember the two.  I don't want to be sued for libel.  But two people picked it up just kind of without even looking at it and just included it.  So it did get legs.  Scraped it. It probably didn't even read it.  Yeah, it did get legs. So I think he has a point there.  What do you think? Does this mean the Wikipedia doesn't work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it works, but I think eventually they're going to get sued out of business, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By something... for something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not a new problem.  And it goes on at different levels and different places, and it has been for quite some time.  It's why there's certain articles from Wikipedia that kind of reach a consensus and they lock it down so nobody can edit it.  Because they have problems with people who are arguing back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Israel-Palestine, that kind of thing.  Where there's just abortions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Republican-Democrat, dog-cat, whatever it is.  And it's one of the... you have this incredible assemblage of knowledge,  some of which is more viable than others.  I was going to say, my wife, the librarian, I can hear her quivering in the back like...  She can come over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do we verify this? How do we make sure it's legit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet, I think Wikipedia is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, for quick information.  I'm always skeptical when I read stuff.  Well, you should be.  But the funny thing is, and your librarian wife would know this, and sometimes you can kind of smell whether...  Say that with love, John.  No, I think you can. I think that's what we have to train our kids to do.  Right, so you can smell out the BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You knew when you read it that it... I mean, you said it was funny.  You didn't take it seriously, the posting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who would? I mean, if anyone has a clue, they know all of it.  We've beaten the Kennedy thing to death.  I mean, where's this guy's damn crop about?  All of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's an obvious one, but I think that we assume that the Wiki is that much less accurate than the regular press.  And that's not necessarily true.  I know for me...  I know reporters.  Yeah, I mean, the thing is that most of the time when anyone writes about anything in a major magazine that I know a lot about,  I look at it and go, these guys have no idea what they're talking about.  I was in Zimbabwe during the 2000 elections, watching the elections happen on CNN.  And the city that they were reporting that they said they were coming from was not the city I was standing in.  I mean, it was just a completely different reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, anyone who was on the first trip to China figures this out because what anyone thinks China's like is completely alien to what it's actually like when you go there.  And I've always said when you travel a lot, you always have this preconceived window, what you think the world's going to be like, and then it opens up this way or that way.  With China, it's over here behind you.  And so you go there, you go, wow, this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always thought everybody in Germany would wear laterhosen and drink beer and eat pretzels.  What did I know?  Actually, they do.  Yeah.  It does a little known fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't it seem like this guy just did this for the publicity?  Segenthaler?  Nothing more.  Or Adam Furry.  Because every, no, Segenthaler.  Or both.  I mean, why raise such a fuss about a source of information that on every entry contains tabs for editing, discussion, reporting.  Because he's old school.  He's old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's an older fella.  He got very upset, wrote an article in the USA Today excoriating Wikipedia.  Well, it comes off as a whiny bitch to me.  I just, short story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Short story.  I don't know.  You know what?  That's clear he doesn't.  My mom doesn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody, I wrote about this on my blog and somebody wrote it.  Why didn't the guy just go to Wikipedia and change it?  Edit it.  You know, I do that once in a while.  Well, the info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you're supposed to do.  My bio said I wrote an article for Hustler.  So I went in there and took it out.  I thought you said two articles.  Yeah, it's two articles.  Yes, that's right.  I want to get it right.  Took it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It said in the centerfold.  It did.  Did somebody put that in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's funny.  But it is an issue.  I mean, I'll give you another example.  And it's very easy to create a false page on MySpace.  Somebody's done that for me.  I don't make a big deal out of it because who cares?  But it looks pretty credible.  A Sony Baloney Leo?  Yeah, but it looks pretty credible.  And I think people believe it.  We live in the world now where that can be done in a very public way.  What do you do about it?  You want to legislate against it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also called the National Enquirer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's called the, I mean, you know, all this stuff is, I don't see it.  I don't see the separation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's public figures.  I mean, I think it's a good example, though.  A friend of mine is a high school teacher.  And old former students of his made a nasty site about him.  And by the way, try to get a bad site about you that's phony off of MySpace.  Have you seen this arcane process you have to do?  You have to take a picture of yourself holding up a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you guys heard about the, do you guys know a local blogger named Thomas Hawk?  No.  Price Right Photo.  So it's, guy wrote a, guy went to buy a camera.  The guy said the, basically, he goes to buy a camera.  Some weird stuff happens when they try to charge him for a budget.  Because we were talking about this on DL.TV.  They go to the, you know, you should buy a, you know, you should buy a, you know,  four extra batteries and a lens cap and all this other stuff.  He's like, no, no, no, just ship it.  And they call back.  So a bunch of stuff goes back and forth, right?  They upsell you.  Yeah.  They keep trying to upsell him.  And he's finally like, look, this is horrible customer service.  I'm going to write about it on my blog.  So somebody at the, at the, the camera place who's like, I will never, let's see,  I will make sure you will never be able to place an order on the internet again.  I'm an attorney.  I will sue you.  I will call the CIO.  Just because he said he would.  He didn't even put anything up on the blog.  So the guy writes the blog entry, posts it up on DIG.  In about 20 minutes, it goes berserk.  And in about two days, it was about 4,000 DIGs, which is a huge story on DIG.  It's about 700 DIGs.  It's close to 7,000.  It's a huge story.  It's the biggest story of the year.  So far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So some other bonehead lawyer comes along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but this gets, no, you'll like this part.  The DIG, the DIG community just went off on this camera store.  Oh boy.  They went completely off.  They posted the store's aliases because they do the same place basically does business  under like three different websites, phone numbers.  When those nerds get mad, boy, they dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't mess with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They crank calling him.  They kept auto down the 800 number.  They Skyped him.  They launched DOS attacks against the websites, posted bad reviews on websites.  We are not advocating this.  No, no, we're not advocating it.  We're amused by it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could use the twit army this way, but we don't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let it be known.  They basically, they jammed the fax machine.  Basically, so thousands of people just assaulted this store for like three days.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did he buy the lens cap?  Go back.  Eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to read something that's on it.  No, actually, he ended up canceling his credit card because they threatened to charge his  credit card with a bunch of extra charges.  And eventually, the CEO of the company wrote him a letter basically apologizing and telling  him that they were very sorry and that they fired the guy who had been off on him on the  phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whether they really fired him or not.  Well, the guy.  He's now living in a cave in Afghanistan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently, they just, the business was pretty much shut down for about three  days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't take much.  I didn't do that.  I don't know, Leo, if you should be encouraging this with this thumbs up.  Anyway, so.  That was only for the video.  So I'm looking at Leo's phony blogs.  The one that he didn't do.  MySpace.com slash Leo is better.  So it's obviously a fan, but it's also a guy with some sort of a perverse sense of humor  because you read Leo's interests and it goes computers, technology, video games, call for  help, screen savers, and fixing appliances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's quirky.  Actually, that part's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should see me with a toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll bet.  It says you're straight, though.  That's the good news.  Well, that's the thing.  It wasn't too bad.  Five seven.  And it says body type five seven with some extra baggage.  I got a lot of laugh from the audience.  The peanut gallery loves that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, I do have extra baggage, but I'm a little taller than that.  It's hard to tell on TV.  Five eleven, it says there.  Five eleven?  Yeah.  Oh, that's, I'm a little shorter than that, actually.  That's the problem.  I'm too short for my weight.  So the.  We all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the what's his name?  David Byrne.  Talking head fella has a got in trouble with the recording industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you know, you know, you're in trouble when you start attacking your own artists.  You start going after them.  That's a bad sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So David Byrne has a I guess he has a downloadable radio show.  It's not even streaming.  And he did a Missy Elliott special.  And apparently the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he get the rights for any of the songs?  Didn't pay an Ascampo?  No, that wasn't what they were mad about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were they mad about?  The apparently the law or the law forbids that streaming radio feature more than four tracks by any one artist in a three hour period.  So you're not allowed to do a special about a single artist.  He says my stuff's not even streaming, but apparently they considered streaming and downloadable the same thing.  The assumption being the sale is lost is lost because I guess you'd record all the Missy Elliott.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Sure.  I know I do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those 64K streams are.  But then he makes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever since Sirius and XM did the satellite radio Elvis and Sinatra channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All Elvis all the time.  He does make a kind of stunning admission.  Back in the day, I used my boombox to tape things off the radio all the time.  That's how I found out about music I didn't even know about.  He's really it's so what's the fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's what's the what's the final thing that happens to him?  Are they going to sue him?  He pays the statutory fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He pays the fee to stream it, which is actually fairly steep.  That's how they put most of these streaming stations out of business.  He says, is there a higher licensing fee I could pay that would let me do this?  Is there a reason a radio station can play Springsteen around the clock, but I can't stream Missy Elliott?  Apparently you can, but you have to license every song separately.  Pay for each one instead of a lump sum.  It's a nightmare.  I just think that it's amazing that the recording industry is going after David Byrne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're going after David Byrne and then he hasn't had a hit for a while.  What have you done for me lately?  They're going after David Byrne and then they're going after, you know, 14, you know, 14 year olds, mothers of five, you know, over, you know, the grandmas.  Yeah, I mean, you know, this is great PR.  Just just really a great way to make friends.  You know, it's it's really just watching a whole industry take themselves down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So far in the last two years, the recording industry has sued 14,000 or has threatened to sue.  We should say that many of the most of these don't go to court, but it's threatened to sue 14,800 people.  They filed 14,800 lawsuits and most of the time people settle.  But now people are starting to fight back.  And I think that that's actually very good news.  Clog up the courts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clog up the courts.  I think they also they have to they have to I think they people need to start making the RIA prove that it was them that they were there.  You know, it was them in front of the computer.  I mean, there's a lot of I mean, it's you know, you can you can tie it to an IP, but there's a lot more to it to really know whether and I think people start forcing the RIA to make to really prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's also going to get a lot more complicated when you're in your room with a lawyer in a three thousand dollar suit that's looking at you and saying, I'm going to own this house.  Right. I'm going to keep your ass.  I give him five grand.  Absolutely.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's you know, and so really it's it's judgment proof.  That's my motto.  And how do you do that?  Stay broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm working on the D'Avora.  Stay broke.  I get no span.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this case.  Severely disabled mother of an eight year old girl.  The RIA claims the eight year old girl was downloading gangster rap at four thirty in the morning.  Could happen.  Yes, it is possible.  Here's one.  A Seattle resident allegedly downloading twelve hundred songs.  She's being sued.  She owes between seven hundred fifty dollars and one hundred fifty thousand dollars as a result.  That's a range there.  A big range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also the laws that they're using to sue people were designed to put, you know, large pirating operations out of business where they were printing and distributing CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what makes me mad.  There are good laws.  Go after the pirates.  Don't go after us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, Mr. LaPorte, you don't seem to understand the great piracy nexus in the entire world is in Malaysia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go into Malaysia and bust it.  Start shutting them out.  It's run by the Chinese triads and you know, maybe it's a little more difficult.  But you know, you guys are tough guys.  Go after them.  Lawyer in a three piece suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guy with a tattoo of a headless corpse.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, gutless guys.  They go after little girls and they leave the triads alone.  Eight year old girl is easy.  We got her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got her.  How about going after podcasters?  Apparently a podcaster, he runs vegan dot com.  Oh yeah, I heard this.  He's got like a thousand or five hundred customers.  He's got 1500 listeners.  Somebody hijacked his RSS listing and a pod keyword.  And then he contacted them.  They said, well, you give us enough money.  We'll give it back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was kind of an interesting story, but I couldn't quite figure out what was really going on.  I read that and read that and I could not make heads or tails out of what happened to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It couldn't happen to us, he said, hoping and crossing his fingers because we could contact.  The problem is that many of these sites.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you explain this story to me?  Because I read it.  Didn't quite get it.  What happened?  I mean, how did he get hijacked?  I don't understand.  He didn't lose his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, what you do is you tell Apple or you tell somebody else that your RSS feed address has shifted.  And so all of a sudden on iTunes or Odeo or Yahoo, when people go to what they think is your podcast, it's pointing to a different location.  Oh, OK.  Not your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you just change the pointer.  Yeah.  They think they're getting vegan and now it's a beef council.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be easy to fix, but I mean, there's that we actually when.  And it sounds illegal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's there's probably some sort of lawyerly construct you can put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that we would do is we have friends at Apple or we have friends at Odeo at my Yahoo.  We call them and say, hey, dudes, but most people don't.  But most people don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it not require a password?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what happened to to to Dignation early on is somebody that you could go and if you if you don't want Apple's iTunes carrier podcast, like let's say you're getting slammed on bandwidth or something or you don't like Apple or you could email them and say, please remove this podcast.  And they they were just auto deleting without doing any verification on the ownership of the podcast.  So somebody was, you know, decided to pull a prank on Kevin made Dignation disappear.  That's right.  The day after it showed up on the front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now Kevin has friends and he doesn't have to worry about a couple of crack pots that what they do is just kind of sneaky is they they point the feed to their own feeds, but they continue to make it work.  So people are downloading and as you build an audience, everything seems to be working.  So the podcast is not paying attention.  You can you can get, you know, you then you have a big podcast and all of a sudden you have no control over it at all.  And Apple says, well, what do you mean if for the last six months has been pointed to this address, then it's a little harder.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nerd extortion is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a vegan.  I don't have a lot of energy to write this one.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Leo at Leoville dot com.  All you vegans out there or loyal listeners.  I'm on your side.  Vegans are from the planet Vega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vegans don't eat vegans.  I don't know.  Universal tries to claim it's illegal to email their employees.  There's a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is unbelievable to me.  I love this website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's called the website.  The website's really cool.  I think it'd be completely useless to use the actual emails on it.  But it would.  But it's a it's it was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The website's called everyone who's anyone dot com.  And the idea is if you're a screenwriter, you know, you you you get all the agents, all the studios, all the addresses are there and you can bombard them.  That's how we got this job.  I'll never forget all the poor Patrick, the begging, the pleading, the emails.  He sent me flowers once.  Candies.  The flowers were for some other reason.  Remember Morgan asked for Smarties once and then got inundated with Smarties candy like 40 pounds worth.  You know what I found out recently?  She's Canadian, right?  The Smarties in Canada are very different than Smarties in the U.S.  Smarties in Canada are basically M&Ms.  She wanted M&Ms.  She got Smarties.  Yeah, they're like sweet tarts.  They're like, ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I like that.  She never said anything, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm surprised you never said, no, no, this is the wrong kind of Smartie.  She's got another 40 pounds of M&Ms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a gift horse issue here.  You don't, you know.  Somebody sends you 400 pounds of sugar.  You get excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is my friend, Tila Tequila.  Yeah, I saw that.  Yeah, I have 109 friends.  Rick James is one of my friends.  And well, he should be.  Back to my space, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how about that Skype and the video call update?  You want to talk about that?  Skype's going to do video.  I'm still trying to get over the fact that Skype got purchased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're doing it for three and a half billion dollars.  Which is a funny story because when I met with Michael Robertson and the guys, you know,  when they did Gizmo, they sat down at lunch with me before they rolled it out.  And they were talking about the guys, the Skype guys, were asking three and a half billion.  You know, and they were laughing and said, this guy's nuts.  He thinks he's going to get three, two or three, but actually maybe it was two and a half billion.  He got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Logitech's doing a deal with them.  They're going to offer a Skype video software with the cameras, I guess.  I don't know.  Who cares?  I mean, AIM does it.  Yahoo does it.  Everybody does it.  Everybody does it.  What's the big deal?  We did it six years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We started the NetCam network.  Yeah, which I think helped bring down Tech TV.  I always thought the NetCam network was the sleaziest thing that was on that channel.  And if you remember the, sorry.  You know how many NetCam people Leo and I talked to in the course of the years?  And so every review of the Tech TV, ZDTV thing would say, except for the amateurish kind of thing,  and they would always bitch and moan about these sleazy little images that were, that voices was wrong.  It looked crappy.  That was Leo and I.  And then it was the worst part about those things is that the image was really small  and the whole thing was not even put on the screen correctly.  You know whose idea that was?  Probably Peter Hammersley or something.  That was my idea, I'm sorry to say.  It was?  Yeah.  Well, you could have put the kibosh on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that was the whole idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What he's trying to say is you've emotionally wounded him.  Yeah, scarred me.  Before the show even started, I was talking with Candy Myers.  That's cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we were talking about, you know, we were still doing the site on MSNBC,  but it was pretty clear MSNBC was about to dump us.  Right, because of Diana.  Yeah, Diana died and Ziff Davis announced they're going to do a network,  and so why would you do a TV show with Ziff Davis?  And so we went to the cafe around the corner.  What was the name of that?  Universal?  New York Slow Club.  The food is slow, but the service is fast.  Or is it the other way around?  Actually, the food was quite good.  The food was great, the service was brutal.  We should do this show from the Slow Club.  It's too noisy to enjoy.  That's right, yeah.  Good lemon drops, though.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, back to the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're there with Candy Myers, you're toasted.  So she's saying, you know, what would you do?  And I said, well, I'd do this call-in radio show and be really cool.  You could turn it into TV if you only had some way to see the callers.  And that's when...  Bingo.  Bingo.  Oh, brother.  And you know, they got 20,000 of those used robotics cameras.  Literally, 10?  It doesn't matter.  Past 5,000, it's all the same.  Yeah, we're giving them away like water.  We couldn't get rid of them fast enough.  They discontinued the camera.  We still had 5,000 left.  They couldn't get software for the thing.  We still had 3,000 left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could still get it.  We just had to make it available in strange ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft OneCare.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of nerd distortion...  This should have been killed, this story, for today, but go ahead.  Why should it be killed?  It's just a stupid...  I mean, they try this stuff all the time.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's brilliant.  Listen, here's what you do.  You create an operating system that's full of security flaws and holes,  and then you make people pay you a monthly fee to keep it up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the first real strategy we've seen from Microsoft in a decade.  It's brilliant.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's free right now.  It just launched.  And by the way, the Microsoft product manager calls the beta a home run.  Oh, brother.  Next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check out Microsoft Max, though.  What's that?  The new beta.  It's photo editing slash sharing software.  It has, honestly, a very sweet interface.  I don't know how...  Now, what's this?  Microsoft Max.  It's a new beta that they just put out, and it is essentially codenamed Max.  It uses the WinFX runtime components, which are some of the graphical components  that will be part of Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to download a big chunk of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  List your photos, turn them into beautiful slideshows,  and share them with family and friends, yada, yada, yada.  It sounds like an open platform.  It will be more than just photos.  Flickr 4.0.  Exactly.  I've used Google's product, too.  Have you played with it?  I love Picasa.  I just discovered it today.  It's been out for a month or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you played with it?  Anyone play with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I played with it briefly.  It's beautiful.  I think it's one of those things where it looks great and how useful it is.  Check it out.  It's worth checking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The basic stuff, though, from Max, it seems like it needs a couple of basic features.  Some basic image fixing features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walt Mossberg has gone over to the dark side.  He's always been over there.  No, no, but this is it.  This is the worst, you say?  This is the worst.  What happened?  Walt Mossberg...  This is not the worst.  He says, I've been testing the new iMac.  Our verdict is it's the gold standard of desktop PCs.  To put it simply, no desktop offered by Dell or Hewlett-Packard or Sony or Gateway can match the new iMac G5's combination.  It sounds like ad copy.  It sounds like ad copy.  Ad copy.  This is the Wall Street Journal.  Can match the new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal.  It's even weirder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, listen to these adjectives.  Power, elegance, simplicity.  This is one sentence.  Any man that retires where he'd go to work?  Yeah, I guess.  Well, you know, he gets great treatment.  I've seen him at Macworld.  We were slogging away saying, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs.  And Steve literally pushes us aside and puts his arm around Walt Mossberg and they go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend of mine was working in an Apple booth at a trade show about two years ago before they started getting the processor speed up.  And he's got... there's sort of a young, very enthusiastic Apple employee there that he's trying to contain.  And Mossberg comes walking up to one of the iMacs.  And the kid runs up and he's like, Mr. Mossberg, I'm here to help complete your experience.  And Mossberg's hands are going up to the keyboard.  And apparently he just turns to him, looks and says, don't ask me any questions.  Leave me alone.  You can tell me why these things are so slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was a couple of years ago.  Because he doesn't... I see elegance, simplicity, ease of use, but I don't stability, security.  I don't see slow anywhere in here.  And he also says it handles all common Windows files as well as the Internet and email with aplomb.  And he says, a contrary to misconceptions, this Mac is competitively priced.  Actually, I have to say, I do like the new iMac.  The one thing that they did I really like.  Have you seen this new front row application?  It's basically a media server.  It's got a remote control.  It's cool.  I think it's really slick.  Well, have you heard about the rumors about the next generation Mac mini that's a media machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has potential.  It could be, but...  What will be the hardware support?  That'll make or break it.  I could care less.  It's vaporware at this point.  Microsoft has it in the bag right now with Media Center Edition.  Microsoft's i5 is an amazing app.  Really?  It supports.  It's as good of a front end as I've seen on any of the other applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually quite good.  And what's really nice is the way it interfaces with the Xbox 360 so you can just hook that to your TV, to your agency.  It's also key support.  It's high in TiVo.  It's 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.  The rumors are with the Mac mini, you're talking about a DVR that'll record it straight to your iPod.  That would be the...  That's their version.  You know, I think the iPod, I think all...  And that would just be a patch for Media Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's a dead end technology.  TiVo's already dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they haven't been selling any of them at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I say that you can sell them, but I'm telling you, these things are going to be door stops.  Nobody's going to watch television on this screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little small, I have to say.  It's not compelling to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you, it may not be compelling, but there are a lot of people downloading video in that format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's short term.  It's a bump in the road, you watch.  Two years from now, you can say, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You offer iPod version of TLTV?  Is that the biggest version that you download?  No.  But it's up there.  What is the ranking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I haven't gone over the last two weeks of log files, but we've been pretty neck and neck with WMV H.264 in the iPod format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TiVo, we talked about this last week, TiVo announced they're going to offer a way to offload your TiVo to your iPod and your PSP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they already offer, with the latest to-go software, you can now easily move, well, easily, as in moving it through a USB 1 connection, large video files, back and forth to your PC already.  Right.  Sure, you could always put it...  USB 1?  Yeah.  That's too slow.  That is insanely slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say direct download to the iPod and PSP.  I think that's what I gathered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that'll just mean that the TiVo to-go software will add the functionality for encoding to that format.  As it is right now, if you want to encode that to anything that will play outside the TiVo to-go software.  Don't they want to pay the extra five cents for the USB 2 technology, or what?  Or how about just an ethernet connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I bet you it's the movie company saying, you could do it, but it has to be really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You seem like you're trying to be funny there, but in fact, it's possible.  Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're also actually selling, apparently going to be selling movie tickets over the TiVo.  One of the many strange options that are coming up on TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, I talked to Samsung when they were bringing out all this uplink.  They have all these upconverters for their DVD players.  You can get 720p off of a regular DVD player.  And only through HDMI, you know what I'm saying?  I'm saying, why can't you get all of the early ones that DVI, and there's still some company that has one with a regular component video.  I hate HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? Why do you hate HDMI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't lock into the connection.  It falls off.  And a lot of these new TVs are putting the connections at points straight up.  And now, what's the solution?  Add a little strap to hold your cable in place.  You know what I like about television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $150 cable, 60 cents worth of duct tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many people realistically need audio and video on the same cable?  What's wrong with that?  One cable.  How many TVs have five one?  Oh, wow.  Let me finish my story so people don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because when you listen to radio, people go, what was the end of that story?  The end of it was they wouldn't do it in component video because Hollywood said no, we won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want digital because they can copy protect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, what difference does it make?  I want to rent a DVD.  I want to watch it at 720p.  I've got an older HD screen or projector or whatever.  I want to watch this thing.  No, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Macrovision is responsible for not being able to do the upscaling over component.  All the upscaling DVD players can only do it through digital output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can find you one that actually has component.  Oh, no, I know.  They have component connections.  No, that does the up...  With a copyrighted disc.  As far as I know, I mean, maybe there's some gotcha in there.  Mine is HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've just never seen a player.  That's legit.  There might be a hack that enables that feature.  I'm not saying there's not a hack.  Macrovision protection, part of the Macrovision protection is that you can't do that over...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the president of Apex still in custody in China?  I think he is.  Isn't that a wacky story?  Did you hear that story?  No, tell us.  So Apex is...  Remember, we all ran out and bought Apex DVDs.  The deal was a Chinese American fella realized that you could make cheap DVD players that  were good, and he did a deal with the Chinese government.  Kind of.  Kind of good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was kind of a 50-50.  It either ran for years or it blew up in the first two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they actually...  I think the later ones were better, and then they started making TVs.  But apparently he wasn't paying the Chinese government for these things he was selling,  or they claimed he was understating sales because he's in China now in custody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like things with no country code and they had all these features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the great thing about the Apex.  The Apex had a back door, yeah.  But anyway, so yeah, poor guy now.  I mean, he's a kind of...  There's no legal proceedings.  Was he not paying royalties to them when they were angry?  Paying royalties to who?  To China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  China was making them, building them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he never paid them?  And he never paid them.  That's what they claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, if you make a deal with a sovereign nation or maybe a high-ranking general in  a sovereign nation...  That's who it was.  You don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  You should pay them.  Yeah, it's just very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He claims they were being paid, but...  You know what?  Maybe he's right.  Maybe there's some corruption here.  You don't want to mess around.  If the Chinese government is making you TVs, you're right.  Pay the bills.  Pay the bills.  Hey, we didn't mention...  If Apple were going to do this media center, would they announce it at DV Expo?  It'd be unlikely.  That's a consumer product.  It'll be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a consumer product.  I mean, next week, DV Expo is where people will be showing off and announcing stuff.  What's DV Expo?  DV Expo is kind of like a smaller NAB.  I mean, a much smaller NAB.  Where is it?  It's down in LA.  There's a DV Expo West and East.  DV?  Digital Video Magazine puts it on.  And it's been a growing show, very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scuttlebutt is that Apple might do something with professional video down there.  They're not going to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's Mickey Mouse Show.  I'm sorry, a small show like that.  They have in the past.  So that's why...  But not a big thing like a Mac media.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to see them just standardize the interface on Final Cut, compressor, and everything.  Sorry, I've just been a little mac.  They're slowly moving that direction.  Well, it's just like, you know, the first nine versions of the operating system were  tightly controlled.  And you start shifting applications in OS X and it's like, wow, this is a wicked ripping  pain in the ass.  You know, it's right clickable here.  It's not right clickable there.  The menus come down there.  They don't...  Is that because they bought it or is it because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Final Cut, I mean, everything kind of wraps around, you know, what...  Like, Final Cut kind of came the way it came.  But you'll find that DVD Studio Pro and Soundtrack Pro, for instance, the interfaces are almost  identical because that's when Apple really has...  Right.  You know, they wrote it from scratch.  From scratch, yeah.  Well, I mean, DVD Studio Pro, the first one wasn't written from scratch, but the second  one was.  Or almost.  I mean, it was really rewritten completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intel in January?  That's now the Citigroup.  I think that's kind of given...  A Citigroup analyst is...  I think this is definite now.  Once the analysts start saying it's going to happen, it's going to happen, right?  That means they probably told them.  They must have told them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got to tell some of these guys in advance before this for the stock.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be totally blown away if we don't see it.  He says...  I'm guessing the Mini, the iBook, and possibly the iMac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think Seeker was saying iBook.  This guy's saying PowerBook.  That's the one that needs to ship.  The laptops need to be revved.  I mean, they are getting really long in the tooth.  I'd love a penny amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I think that...  going to be January.  It's possible.  They tend not to do it way ahead of time.  Yeah, but they seem to like to ship right away.  Yeah, but Apple stores...  Yeah, but Apple stores...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What they really like is everybody leaving the keynote, running across the street to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Apple store, and buying every single unit.  That's what they like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what the Apple store likes.  I have to admit, that's pretty much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's right across the street, so I am always...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why don't you just go to the Apple store, folks, and be on a cell phone, and then when  the word comes out and they throw the box in front of you...  I've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have?  Yeah, to get products for review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, a lot of these guys are selling them on eBay.  They know that there'll be a shortage in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that the Mac Mini is one that's pretty high up on the list, I think, because  Apple looks at it as their switch machine.  Powerbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I got some viewer mail this week, I want to mention.  Yes.  A couple of things.  One is that people are complaining or suggesting that you, Leo, get this store together because  Christmas is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's coming.  I'm working right now with a company in...  I don't know, somewhere.  I've got to be careful.  We said something about Tennessee, and I got a hate mail from people from Tennessee.  Tennessee.  Tennessee is a fine, fine place.  Tennessee, I love it.  It's from Nashville.  Actually, it's a very nice place.  They've got great barbecue there.  Francis and Lusky, they're putting the store together.  It looks great.  We're trying to figure out how many items we can have so that people can...  I don't want to have too many items because then there might be delays in getting them,  so I want to have a reasonable selection.  At least start small, but that...  No, we're going to have t-shirts, we're going to have...  I've already ordered...  Hats.  Hoodies, we're going to have hats.  The John C. DeVore Act.  I get no spam.  Underoos.  Underoos.  Yeah, so look for that soon.  I actually hoped it would be up by this week, but it's getting close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got another note from someone saying I was a bully last week or the week after, and  especially I was bullying Patrick.  I guess the guy's never seen Patrick lift dead lifting.  It's like...  You don't bully Patrick.  Bullying Patrick is like a laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were all over my ass.  It happens.  You know what?  Sometimes he goes right back the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, as well, these guys think that you're helpless, so I'm just mentioning it to you.  Well, I am sort of a wallflower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is.  He's a shrinking violet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick can walk down Market Street wearing a killed and carrying a high-performance off-road  shock over his shoulder and still gets the looks from the women.  I just...  I'm in awe.  You know, the funny thing is about...  Well, you know, Patrick's an interesting guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From the one perspective, he's...  Because I've taken his picture a few times because I'm a photographer junkie, basically,  I'm going to take everyone's shots.  Patrick's the most photogenic...  One of the most photogenic guys I've ever shot.  It's unbelievable.  Really?  Oh, he did tell him.  I mean, you know you're photogenic.  I mean, if you look at him in person, it's like, nah, this guy can't be photogenic because  he's not really that good looking.  But I'll tell you, in a picture, holy mackerel.  Really?  It's astonishing, to be honest with you.  Oh, no.  It's astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could eat you and my mother together.  You two could really be all over my face.  I'm telling you, no, seriously.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you take a lot of pictures, you see...  You learn.  But the thing is, the one weird thing about photogeneity is you don't necessarily know  it.  You can't tell ahead of time.  You can try to tell.  Is it bone structure?  Yeah, I think it's bone structure.  With him, it's bone structure.  I'm not absolutely sure.  He's got a big jaw and he's got a funny squint.  I have no idea.  And the calves.  It's a miracle.  But you look at it, you go, man.  It's a cover of GQ we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they say that you're the lunchbox Larry guy, what is that?  I own the lunchbox crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, so that's the two letters.  Did you steal my Blackberry?  You did.  Yeah, it's right here.  You going to talk about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can make calls with this thing.  We need candles on this.  This is an awesome phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually really like it.  Leo's got the new Blackberry.  Oh, look, it crashed.  That's one thing I don't like about it.  It crashes a lot.  It crashed right in front of me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's for firmware.  Error number 200, reset.  It doesn't...  Just press return.  Does it have a touch sensitive screen?  No.  But it's a beautiful screen.  Anyway, it may be completely useless in a month when Blackberry becomes a huge hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Blackberry lost their court case on Wednesday.  Did they lose it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember when you would buy something and the price would drop and the rest of us  could afford it.  Now you buy something and they lose court cases and they go out of business.  Out of business!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're definitely some sort of a jinx.  No new Macs for you.  So the deal is that there is a patent holding company.  This is the thing.  You create a company, you buy some patents.  No, that's not true.  NTP is not a patent holding company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, really.  The guy actually did some inventing and it's not like one of those sleazy patent holding  companies.  It's a legitimate guy with a legitimate patent.  He has several patents.  Yeah, and they're all around this sort of thing.  Whether the patent is any good is another issue.  But it's not like that's not to store them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's not a sleaze bag.  He has several patents though about how Blackberry delivers email.  Something about a proxy server and email delivery.  Claims that Blackberry is infringing.  They negotiate.  Blackberry claims they have a settlement early in the spring of $450 million settlement.  NTP says no, there was no settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It started with the $60 million and it went to one something and then it went to four  something.  It kept building.  Every time you read it.  It started in 2002 or something like that.  It's been going for three years.  And it's been going on and the money hasn't been paid to anybody.  It's been going into an escrow account just in case they do lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is what the judge ruled on Wednesday.  He said, I've had enough.  There is no agreement.  We're going to settlement hearings and that's it.  Both companies seem to be very stubborn.  Both are stubborn.  Both of them.  Blackberry says, that's all right.  We have an alternative method.  They haven't revealed this alternative method.  Most analysts are saying now it's going to cost them at least a billion dollars.  That's the latest.  To get the license.  But then a little monkey wrench.  On Thursday, the US Patent and Trademark Office says, oh, by the way, one of those patents,  it's not valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's one other thing here that doesn't get mentioned that much.  And I talked to one of the attorneys about this, which is that the guy, the NTP guys,  which shows that they're not really a classic scammer.  They don't know what to charge.  The royalty rate that they want Blackberry to pay is 8.5%.  The industry standard for this sort of thing is around 4% or sometimes less.  So they're actually wanting twice as much money.  8.5% is a ridiculous royalty for a licensed NTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you say this means that they're honorable people because of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it means that they don't know what they're doing.  Or they're greedy.  Well, no, I think it's in, I believe that they're just naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it sounded like, with the $450 settlement, $450 million.  $450 million.  $450 million.  You sound like the RIA here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either all is $450 or $450 million.  Yeah, we're not sure exactly which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we know there's some illegal songs on your Blackberry.  With the $450 million settlement, it sounded like RIM actually walked away from NTP for  unknown reasons.  It wasn't actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  RIM said we have a settlement, then it turned out they didn't have a settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounded like they walked away from some earlier grant that RIM walked away from.  This story's vague at that point.  And then RIM wanted to go back and say, oh, you know that settlement that we had six months  ago?  We'll pay it.  We actually want to pay that.  And I think that, I don't know, but I think that what happened was is their lawyers said,  I think we can invalidate the patents.  And so they said, we're not going to pay the $450 million.  And they're starting to invalidate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's 11 patents.  Five of them now are under review.  But that takes a long time.  They don't have that kind of time because the court has already said, no, we're going  to go to hearings.  We're going to go to settlement hearings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, whatever happens, happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you're...  Well, that's my conclusion.  Worst case scenario, in a month, blackberries don't work anymore.  You don't get email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think the issue is that the government is saying, we can't have our blackberries  turned off.  And RIM's saying, we can't separate it easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the real issue here, is how much infrastructure stuff like this, which becomes incredibly  important to the entire society, can be turned off by edict, by lawsuits, or by whatever,  or anything.  Michael Powell lived on his blackberry.  It's a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bad thing.  You know, the chairman of the FCC, I'm sure the new chairman lives on his blackberry.  They should just nationalize the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, for town of Connecticut, can kick a bunch of people out of their...  Well, the Canadians can do it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can nationalize them.  They're practically socialists as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And ladies and gentlemen in Canada, it's Leo at leoville.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I get my flu shots in Canada.  Don't you forget it.  I got my flu shots last year.  Yeah, me too.  Because I couldn't get a shot.  I happened to work up there, so they were doing it anyway.  No semi-dead viruses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you can go to these health places in Canada and get a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good news for New Orleans.  They're actually pretty cool.  This is surprising.  City-wide free Wi-Fi for everybody.  You may not have power.  There may be water in your basement, but you've got Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is actually the topic of this week's PCMagazine.com column, which is the fact that  this is a kind of a...  I think this is just a one-shot thing.  I don't think free Wi-Fi is ever going to catch on.  Why not?  I think politically, there's too many vested interests.  Yeah, Verizon will be.  Verizon has too much money.  No, I'm not just not down, but think about it.  You've got Verizon, you've got Comcast, you've got hotels that are charging $10 a night.  That's appalling, isn't it?  And you've got Starbucks, you've got McDonald's.  You've got any big city, you've got so many vested interests that are nickel-and-diming  the public to death with this crap that there's no way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems to be less of an issue right now in New Orleans.  And they've also said that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, New Orleans is an exception, but that's the only one.  And actually in Philadelphia...  Philadelphia was quashed, and you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Philadelphia has it, but no one else in Pennsylvania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as a result, 11 states plus however many they've gotten since the last time I checked  up on it.  I think it's 13.  Yeah.  Basically, you can no longer have municipal Wi-Fi.  Because it's horrible for rural communities.  I mean, forget about the big cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're the ones who should get the free stuff.  I think you put Wi-Max in a rural area and just put everyone online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem is if the state legislature pushes through like, oh, yes, sir, Mr. Verizon  represented, what a brilliant idea.  Well, that's what they did in Pennsylvania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know?  They screwed the public there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Louisiana, it's just limited.  It's simply limited.  It's 512.  Yeah, 512.  Well, 512 was...  Yeah, that's the good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the point of limiting the bandwidth?  Were they kidding?  No, it's 512 right now is the big bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what Google's doing in San Francisco.  By law, I think it's 128 in all of Louisiana.  So you can do public Wi-Fi in Louisiana as long as...  But that's being lousy.  It can't be...  It's lousy.  You can check your email.  You know, that's about all you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do public Wi-Fi.  Chicken in every pot...  Wide open.  What was it Huey Long promised?  A chicken in every pot and Wi-Fi in every home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so.  Chicken in every pot and a car...  Or two chickens in every pot in a car in a garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think that it is something that people should really look at as far as the rural  areas is where it's the most important, or more importantly, the small towns.  I agree.  This is a gentrification opportunity.  Right, not only that, but it's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you don't have all these vested interests trying to keep it from happening, so it's  more doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And frankly, it's in the interest of city government.  You can completely revitalize a community.  You can bring business.  There's a lot to be said for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, except if you live in a little town...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm on the telecommunications committee and we're working on getting Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's probably more educated than a lot of these little towns that I've been to or  lived in, which is that you got a bunch of boneheads and these hard sell sales guys come  in from some big company and they sell them on some horrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's what we did.  We bought a monorail.  We bought a monorail going through town.  It's got two stops.  And we've got two traffic lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the egg stop.  Exactly.  But we're modern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do think in an information age when you could really work anywhere, there's a lot  of people that would love to move to a little town.  If there was fiber running through in high speed...  I have a friend who has an ISP in Freeport, Pennsylvania.  There's one stoplight where I grew up and he's slowly running fiber through the entire  town.  This is something I want to hear from my parents.  I think there's a lot of this going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all under radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been happening in the Midwest for years where people were doing line of sight wireless  and wiring up towns and stuff.  But it was interesting to watch Verizon go berserk after Philadelphia was like, hey,  nobody wants to bring us Wi-Fi.  Nobody wants to bring the city broadband?  Great.  We'll wire the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If one of our Twitter audience members could fill us in on this, Verizon offers this Fios  thing, which you said is bogus.  Very fast.  15 megabits down, 2 megabits up, 50 bucks a month.  I got an email from somebody who said, but the latency is awful, which would be significant.  It doesn't mean a lot if you get a lot of bandwidth and if you've got 200 millisecond  or 1,000 millisecond latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you do web surfing, which you have lots of files, when you hit a web page, you're  not just hitting a web page.  You're hitting that server over and over again to bring every image and everything down one  after another.  It could be 50 things it has to hit.  If there's a lot of latency, the web page takes forever to come up.  It's our world of Warcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there any cell phone providers offering decent internet performance?  This has Edge, which is about...  Like Megabit.  No.  Megabit speed oversell networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's funny though, the third generation stuff has all these promises of this and that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 500, 512, 768.  It's about how nice it would be to have a Bluetooth enabled cell phone in your pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you can link to the notebook wirelessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bluetooth doesn't have enough...  I don't know.  Bluetooth.  You can do a megabit over it again.  It doesn't have much distance though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Not on Bluetooth.  Like 768 or 512?  It's very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much slower than that.  It's extremely slow.  It's not intended for that.  Instead of having to actually plug a USB cable in your notebook.  That's absolutely the dream, right?  It's not about Bluetooth and Megabit.  Surf on this.  This is Edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Singular's 3G's Edge and Verizon's DCVDO.  Both of them seem about 512.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The radio on this device is currently turned off or the battery's too low, which is probably  true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I turned it off the radio.  I thought I turned it back on.  No, you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were sitting in the airport once and Leo was trying to log into the Wi-Fi in the airport  and he's getting out his credit card and he can't get his laptop.  Fly JetBlue.  Whipped out for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You get nothing but flak for that, by the way.  Why?  Which is another example of people not letting you get free stuff.  Because the airport wants to make some money.  Oh yeah, they have these little areas, the JetBlue areas.  JetBlue is like a bad guy for giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in 30 plus channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does JetBlue still have all its call center representatives at warmins in their house?  That's how they used to do it.  Little old lady Mormons in the...  I doubt it, but I doubt it.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't.  All I know is that's one of the best pilots in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Recent performance.  They wouldn't be enough old ladies that are Mormons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are not currently in an area that can handle data communication.  You can tell it's a big place.  It's possible.  There's a lot of empty space.  Well, so much for Edge.  It doesn't work.  It says you're not in an area that can handle data.  That's not true.  It works great.  I don't know what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe this building is...  No, it's probably your batteries.  Maybe the batteries.  That's not true.  Yeah, that's what I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  It's been great for me.  How long have you had it?  25 minutes.  But the battery's still great.  So eBay is in court.  US Supreme Court's going to hear the story over Buy It Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a story of a site called eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's another one of these patent things.  Are they being sued by Amazon?  Merck Exchange says it holds the patent for something called consignment nodes, which  includes the concept of, they've patented this, logging into an auction site and buying  something for a fixed price.  That's Buy It Now on eBay.  Buy It Now, right.  The US Supreme Court's going to hear this, but this is why it's important.  If the Supreme Court overturns...  I wish Larry Lessig were here, because he's an actual lawyer, you know.  Yeah, I've heard that.  If they overturn the precedent of exclusivity of invention, this is from Mars Technica, which  grants absolute right of control over a patent to the holder, it could mean that they could  institute mandatory licensing, which would really solve things like this RIM case, where  you just say that the patent holder has to license.  There's a set fee, whatever it is, 4%.  And then RIM could say, all right, well, we know there's patents, we know it's encumbered,  but we can license it.  We know what it's going to cost us.  We don't have to go to court.  This could be a very big deal.  We should watch this story.  It sounds reasonable.  Sounds like another show.  This is Triangulation.  Triangulation, coming up.  So our first Triangulation was on the Google Print.  We'll release that probably in a couple of days.  You, me and Larry Lessig talking about that.  I didn't have much to say.  So it was really, what's a two-sided triangle?  It's a...  A line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a joke there and I just couldn't come up with it.  Let's give it to you.  I know, it was a softball and I was like, oh my God, I did first softball tonight.  And then I just choked and missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A stunning turn of events.  Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and Finance, Thomas Trimarco has revealed  that Microsoft's recent efforts to make OfficeXML a ratified standard may make the format acceptable  to the government.  Massachusetts is back in Microsoft's court.  Yeah, we know the reason why.  Yeah, because they were paying off that guy and he was flying all over the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still like it.  Basically, it's the openness of the patent seems to be.  If you reverse engineer their file format, their XML file format, they won't sue you.  That's pretty much my understanding of what the agreement says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why.  I just don't trust Microsoft to open the Office format.  It doesn't seem like it's going to be whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes you might not trust them, but sometimes I don't think they can.  I think there's a lot of spaghetti code at Microsoft.  Oh, I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can't reveal it because you would go, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Write that or they can't.  They literally can't.  It is a clever thing.  Undocumented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or incompatibility from the previous version, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the website tools we're running is based on .NET and it does some interesting  stuff where it generates code.  It's one of those moments where something goes wrong, you click on the part where it  opens the HTML and you look at it and you're sitting there.  It's like what they did with front page.  I can't code to save my life, but when I look at a page and I realize this is an atrocious  mess, it's obviously gone.  I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is still in Word.  The original Word format used a bytecode for letters.  They were trying to save space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's like the word's starting to flip the bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you could do eight bits a byte and you'd have plenty of space, but they were actually  getting each letter into a nibble, a half a byte, by doing that, by flipping bits.  Crazy stuff.  Crazy stuff.  And the word, a letter wouldn't end on an eight bit board boundary.  It'd overlap and that's what makes it hard to figure this stuff out.  Right, it's impossible actually.  So you may be right.  They may not be able to open this stuff because they're so tied to it.  So what's the deal?  Anybody know with this strike against Call of Duty?  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No, that was due to lack of updates and support, basically for online cheating.  It involves updates to the Pump Buster client and the server operators who basically, I  imagine it costs some money to run a server sucking all that bandwidth all day long with  multiplayer gaming.  December 16th.  And if the cheating comes rampant, then nobody wants to play anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're essentially striking against...  Who's they?  The guys who run the game servers.  They're striking against Activision because Activision hasn't kept Call of Duty 2 up to  date and reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starting with Call of Duty, the United Opposing Forces, United Offensive, which was the update  to the original, as well as apparently now version 2 of Call of Duty.  It just, apparently they're not keeping up with the security features.  Online cheating, as soon as it starts to happen with any game...  Oh, it kills the game.  It kills the game.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to play it.  The fun is gone.  So there's a manifesto.  They've issued a manifesto to Activision.  They said, I think this is fascinating.  I mean, it's a whole new...  The servers are going to shut down December 16th for 24 hours.  Unless you solve this problem.  I love this.  We will not be ignored any longer.  And this is all in caps.  You have caps.  Caps.  Talk to us and help us to help you make Call of Duty series better.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  This is Nathan Hale stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have been warned.  You have been warned.  Good Lord.  These guys need to get a girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me cheat fixes or give me death.  Go play another game.  Walk outside.  I'm like an Elliott Spitzer more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, me too.  Attorney General of New York.  Yeah, he's got a lot of nuts, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's going after Sony.  Now, Texas and California already sued Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Spitzer realized that there's easy money in some of these things.  Maybe that's it.  He's going for governor.  Yeah.  He's going for governor.  He saw what Giuliani did with all his legal...  It's the classic route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In New York.  You become a crusading DA.  I think it's in Batman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was the same.  I mean, he got his way to running for president.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure Spitzer wants to be president.  It is unacceptable that more than three...  I should do this in a Roosevelt voice.  More than three weeks...  Well, I got the microphone.  I'll cut my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After the serious vulnerability was revealed, these same CDs are still on the shelves during  the busiest shopping days of the year.  I don't know if Elliott Spitzer talks like that, but he ought to.  I like it.  You can't do the Roosevelt voice in the Rocks.  I strongly urge all retailers...  Now you're becoming Kennedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said a group of investigators disguised as customers to local stores.  None of them had any trouble purchasing these XCP copy protected discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Sony is doing everything it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony has really got a problem.  Isn't this interesting to watch once great company just die on the vine?  No, they're dying on the vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're having nothing but trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're making a lot of judgment errors over and over.  Over and over.  It's going to catch up.  It's going to ruin the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was it that...  The US will start spitting off stuff.  The transition to digital formats...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't make it.  They ignored it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what happened?  Akio Morita died.  That's the end.  That was the beginning of the end.  And that was in 98.  Then they started buying movie companies and record companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They bought that earlier.  Sony started buying record companies right after they couldn't get the DAT thing.  So that was like 91.  Oh, that's soon.  Morita was responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Morita in there was a different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When these new guys took over, it's been coming...  Now you've got a British guy running it who seems to be...  Howard Stringer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stringer seems to be clueless.  Used to be a network executive.  What's amazing is there's so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which just shows you, right?  There's so many places where they're so close to being successful and they're snatching  failure out of the teeth of success.  I mean, PSP, which is doing really well, if they opened up the Wi-Fi...  What a great product that could be.  If they opened up the Wi-Fi and just let anyone do whatever they want with it, they  could do it.  That thing would wipe out the iPod in like 45 seconds.  It would.  Because I'm sitting there able to just sit there and download stuff and watch movies.  They don't get it.  They don't understand.  They want to control it and they want it to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're control freaks.  That's why they have memory stick.  They brought that thing out.  I mean, what?  Do they even want to control the...  You know, if somebody wants to buy something, they...  You know, as part of their product.  They want everything to be their brand.  They're so close.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of control freaks, you see what China's going to do?  They're going to create their own DVD format.  Just because they can.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd take money on that one.  I don't think it's going to happen.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  They might want to happen within their borders.  I don't think it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's just too many roadblocks to it at this point.  I mean, if you have that DVD logo in front of any product, you're paying for the DVD

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  forum group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they just don't want to pay the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Essentially what they're going to do is they're going to end up doing a deal where they get  a better rate.  This is typical Chinese.  It's just a negotiation ploy.  Okay, well, you're going to get nothing.  Oh, it's a profit deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny.  So you should do this one, Alex, because you're the one who launched this phaser.  The U.S. Air Force has invented the phaser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now it is to blind people.  So it's not a...  It was a joint non-lethal weapons directorate.  That's special about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't there news...  For a while there was news that pilots were being blinded by laser pointers.  Oh, yeah.  Like terrorists were aiming laser pointers.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at first they thought it was some sort of tracking system for a missile launcher.  But it turns out you can buy on the Internet very...  Well, some are very expensive, but pen beams basically don't go 70 miles.  Yeah.  Really?  They'll cut through plastic and light matches on fire.  They're like modified...  Woz is totally into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Woz actually...  We're going to get Woz on Twitter in the next few weeks.  That's close to a...  He showed my son, my 11-year-old son, how to mod a laser pointer to do stuff like that.  Overclocking it.  Overclock the laser.  We'll get him on the show.  Make it on.  I think that this is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over the century, this is just the very beginning of the move away from projectile weapons and into energy weapons.  Yes.  This is the beginning of that.  Because if I watch too many Star Wars...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going to be a complicated transition.  It's going to be a complicated transition, but it'll by the end of the century happen.  Nothing works as well as a bullet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of AK-47s in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't even get fuel cells in our notebooks and cell phones and whatnot.  That's what we'll look at 100 years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  100 years from now, it will be different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But right now, bullets still is pretty damn good.  Dr. Divix is back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm happy about that.  This is another example.  Open source movements can make mistakes too.  The Divix folks, which created a pretty good codec, and they created Dr. Divix for encoding.  And then about, I don't know, it wasn't that long ago, six months ago, they decided to kill Dr. Divix and come up with some lousy replacement.  Everybody just bitched and moaned.  So the open source community has taken over Dr. Divix and it's out now.  So drdivx.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How does it compare to xvid, which is what all the kids use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  xvid is a nightmare to encode.  Really?  We're having problems.  It's supposed to have Divix, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it just supposed to be open source Divix?  Yeah, it's a German version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got less features, but it's supposed to be more compact.  All the verbs are, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very loud and very loyal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that, of the top DVD players that support MPEG-4, xvid works perfectly with those.  xvid encodes you, Phil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've looked at some stuff on xvid and it's like, wow, I'm stunned by the file size compared to the quality.  The quality is tremendous and the file size is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new goals for a lot of the stuff I see online for your widescreen TV shows is, or they're putting two onto a single recordable CD, so it's 350 megs for an hour show.  Yeah, I know.  And it still looks pretty, and they're starting with HD feed and then reducing it.  It looks terrific.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're selling it in HD feed and they put it at 250 megs and it's like, you look at it and you go, holy macros.  But you're getting some of those Mac breaks down to pretty small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, good encoders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We hover around a megaminute for the Mac breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's H.264?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's H.264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And one of the reasons is because it's a lot of screenshots, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The more screenshots you have, obviously, the H.264 gets really, really efficient.  There's a lot of ways to make things more efficient, and that's one of them.  That's a very pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people still don't realize how much CPU power is involved to decode H.264, the full advanced video, AVC version of it.  Right.  A lot of people are like, oh, why is it two frames a second on my PC at home?  Well, it's like your PC's a piece of crap and you need to upgrade.  But MPEG-4 can be the same way though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd say really few.  Simple profile stuff?  Scrubbing is something that a lot of times...  Are you talking post-processing filters or...?  No, no, no.  When you're scrubbing, when you're just looking, when you're jumping around, MPEG-4 a lot of times won't like that on a slower machine.  It'll really start to slow down and chunk.  So there are all of them.  You're going to pay for it somewhere.  It's either going to look good or it's going to need more processing power.  And so that's what you're...  You can't have the two of the three.  You can't have the two of the three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not all three.  We're going to wrap this thing up.  Remember to look for the...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to have my Christmas gifts.  Oh, let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alex is going to play Secret Santa.  So there were some people requesting that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a couple emails of people requesting, well, DV Garage, put some...  Put some coupons out for the TWIT Army.  And so we decided to go ahead and put one out.  So we have two and we'll put them in the show notes.  Patrick's doing that right now.  We rarely put any public sales out.  So it's kind of...  We have a DV Garage list of about 100,000 people and those are people who usually get all the sales.  And this is even deeper than that.  So if you use TWIT Army in the coupon code on the DV Garage site, you'll get 40% off anything there.  So those are training CDs?  The ones that I think a lot of listeners are probably most interested in are the Photoshop disks.  So I have some training stuff that I did on basic Photoshop and how to key...  How to remove people from stuff.  And so anyway, that's 40% off.  Also for the Pixel Core, which we're going to be doing tons of podcast training, Photoshop training,  super high-end film training all through next year.  If you use PXC TWIT, you'll get $125 off.  So normally it's $200 for three months.  So it's $75. So it's over 50% off.  Wow, that's a great deal.  So anyway, if people are interested, that's our Christmas.  We're giving them away.  Our Christmas cheer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm going to have TWIT hoodies at our meetup, which you're going to be at the meetup, right Alex?  December 15th in Toronto.  You guys, if you want to come to Toronto, December 15th is a beautiful time of year.  Oh yeah, as long as you stay underground.  They do. They have an entire underground...  Yeah, I know. I've been down this. It's great.  But we're getting some more TWIT hoodies and we'll have...  I hope we'll be able to get those also on the TWIT store.  We're launching productions like crazy.  So we're going to triangulate this week.  And then MacBreak is soon.  We're getting to work on that.  We're going to start doing some MacBreak minutes to kind of start warming up for MacBreak,  which is our 30-minute TV show, internet TV show about Macs.  Do you want to announce anything, Patrick Norton?  Digital Life TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still, DL.TV. Still doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is it DL.TV as well as DLTV.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it'll work as DL.TV or DL.TV.  That's very smart. That's very wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I might as well plug the Dvorak.org blog.  Please do.  Do you get no spam?  Dvorak, generally.  Okay.  How is that going? Is it still...  No, I still don't get any spam.  But I get, you know, the blog gets spammed.  Yeah, that's a problem.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Spam it.  Don't spam it.  It gets funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else? Anything else we want to thank?  Any plugs you want to do, Robert?  I'm pretty good.  Say hi to your mom.  Hi, Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your hairstylist.  That's my buddy Jeff.  Yeah, I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised they didn't carve your name in there.  Number two clippers.  What's it going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The number two attachment.  You're looking like Drew Kelly now.  Didn't you tell him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on TV, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm on standard def. I can get away with a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was actually an outcry because the baby mullet disappeared.  There were some people that were very upset about that.  I might let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anything's better.  After a year my hair gets pretty long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can go for a year without petting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to thank the folks at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this  and of course putting us on their podcast channel at AOLmusic.com.  Thanks again to Bob Heil.  Did you enjoy your microphones, boys?  They're delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to have to listen and find out.  We don't know yet, do we?  No, it's a crap shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want to talk to Bob about making a special Dvorak mic that's notched between 200 and 400 Hz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be helpful.  With a big diaphragm like this, I probably don't need it.  You may not need it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert and I are like, yeah, notched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's important.  It is if you have a lavalier, I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to notch between 200 and 400.  If not just lavalier, you have to have a special kind of voice like John has.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll do it.  That'll do it.  Anything else?  Anything else we wanted to talk about and I just can't remember.  No, we'll talk about it next week.  OK, we could do that.  Oh, I know.  I won't be here next week.  Oh, I know.  I'm going to be going to do Regis and Kelly.  We'll do a Skype.  I'll give them your best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you want to ask people about the enhanced version?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to have a poll on this.  Now, this is an interesting issue because currently we offer this podcast as an MP3.  That's the main feed.  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.  I'm against it.  Yeah.  But there is a format that works with iPods and iTunes called enhanced AAC that allows  you to do chaptering and images and links.  And it's really a great format for incorporating show notes into the podcast.  And I'd like to offer it that way, but the problem is it's not MP3.  It's AAC.  So should the main feed be enhanced AAC or should it be just MP3?  I'm against it.  We should stick with MP3.  Yeah.  And then offer a BitTorrent version of the podcast.  Yeah, we should offer a BitTorrent version of the enhanced or if we can talk AOL into  it, maybe they'll let us do two HTTP feeds, main feeds, one AAC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think eventually you move toward that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I don't want to do is cannibalize iTunes and have it split into two feeds because then  you'll get half this, you know, then it looks like you're a smaller podcast.  Right.  We like being in that top five day in, day out.  Right.  And it sustains.  By the way, another podcast has accused us of cheating.  What do we do?  I don't know.  Maybe we can use this trick.  If we were good at cheating, all my podcasts would be up there.  I don't know.  We should experiment.  They claim that we're telling our Twitter army to unsubscribe and resubscribe regularly.  I think all you do is keep on subscribing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never heard that.  We've never said that.  Well, you know, folks, now we know.  That was a good one.  That would be another reason to go to enhancement.  It sounded like all you had to do is just hit the subscribe button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a bug, but I think they fixed that bug.  It's certainly not as volatile as it used to be.  And we try to deal with the podcast that was complaining about inside Mac radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do they do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, you know, I should believe they can't say they're they're not number one inside Mac radio.  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen, I didn't hear it.  It's Scott.  Scott Shepard is a nice guy.  I know very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But somebody told me that they were probably somebody one of these guys trying to make trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.  I mean, they're already now that podcasting is kind of growing there.  It started very collegial and friendly.  A little bit of that going on.  It's going to get worse.  Well, look what Adam Curry's been doing with the Wikipedia.  It's just the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's also ironic because, you know, iTunes is such a it's such a strange metric that they're measuring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But people are like, and nobody knows how they're doing it.  In fact, Mac, I think it's inside Mac Insider.  Mac Observer swears that they're cashing their podcasts.  And Apple says, no, we're not.  We don't.  We all the only times we've ever cashed is when the podcasters specifically said, please do because I can't afford the bandwidth.  And we've we've occasionally agreed to do that.  But why would they cash podcasts?  It would just cost them more money.  I don't know.  All right, we're done.  Yeah, I know.  I'm trying to wrap this thing up.  I just can't.  I don't want I like this mic.  I don't want to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, taking the mic home.  He has a small bassinet for it.  Another twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he's in the Harry Potter series.  How would they know how rich he is?  It's not even real money.  It's wizard money.  You're not running in the Harry Potter zone.  The Muggle Crab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because we have children in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We might be able to guess.  Oh, there's a hint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a fictional character.  A fictional character.  A naughty fictional character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not naughty at all.  But do you think he's just a good guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he's the richest?  Think about it.  He's got all those elves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Minimally.  All right, so we're out of here.  We're out of here.
