No, wait a minute, that's a cow.  Joining us, and I'm sorry about that.  And let me start all over again.  This is just horrible.  Take two.  I never do that.  Even the dog was like, what the hell?  It's been three weeks, I'm a little rusty.  It's time for TWIT, time to talk about the tech news of the week.  I am back and I want to thank Tom Merritt for doing such a great job for me while I  was gone.  Episode 290.  Now, I missed a couple, but we have a great panel joining us right now, starting with  Kara Swisher who actually came to the studio with her dog, Phineas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking more of an internet time kind of old because I've been doing this for about  20 something years now.  That's pretty old.

Start time: 192.12
End time: 208.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's old.  That's old.  And also joining us right now, Mr. Om Malik.  He's home from his travels all over, you were in New York for a while, I think.  Just a day.  Just a day?  Yeah.  It's certainly worth it.

Start time: 208.20
End time: 210.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was totally worth it.  New York is always worth it.

Start time: 210.92
End time: 228.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love New York.  Gigaom.com.  So Kara, you had the scoop of the week this week because, I guess it's last week this  week.  I don't know.  Whatever.  You announced that Apple was going to announce the iPad 2 on March 2nd.  You stand by that because we've seen the invitation now.

Start time: 228.54
End time: 234.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think I'm standing by that.  There is a little curl.  Because of an iPad there.  So I'm guessing it's an iPad.  Yes, it is indeed an iPad.

Start time: 235.40
End time: 236.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you knew that before the invite went out.

Start time: 237.70
End time: 238.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that was called a scoop.

Start time: 239.56
End time: 241.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have people inside Apple who will tell you things?

Start time: 241.80
End time: 246.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, Steve Jobs is always at my house for dinner, but no, no.  We have really good sources.

Start time: 246.32
End time: 248.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say, Steve, raise one eyebrow.  Yes.

Start time: 250.34
End time: 261.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we have really good sources all through everywhere.  That's why we get so many good scoops on all things, Steve.  But we spend things, we report.  We do reporting.  That's how we get those scoops.  I know it's crazy, but here you have it.  That's a wacky idea.

Start time: 261.44
End time: 264.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, do you find it difficult to get information out of Apple?

Start time: 264.74
End time: 280.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, you know, it's like the Mount Everest of trying to get scoops, of course, which  is challenging.  But people have climbed Mount Everest.  We've had a couple good scoops when they bought that ad network.  We had that one.  And, you know, we've had a bunch of them.  It's harder.  It's definitely harder because the people there are more nervous to tell you things.  And justifiably, I suspect.

Start time: 281.10
End time: 282.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because their job is on the line if they get caught.

Start time: 283.74
End time: 286.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, there's lots of ways to leak now.  So that's, thank you Facebook.

Start time: 288.12
End time: 290.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not thank you, Julian Assange.  Thank you, Mark Zuckerberg.

Start time: 290.44
End time: 294.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I always say that Yahoo enjoys leaking through Gmail, which is always funny.

Start time: 294.68
End time: 304.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were at Yahoo.  We're going to talk about what you found out from Yahoo too in just a little bit.  So iPad 2, do your sources tell you anything about what that iPad 2 might be?

Start time: 304.32
End time: 308.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Pitchkowski has been doing a lot of reporting on it.  I think the camera is a certain kind of thing.

Start time: 308.46
End time: 311.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, a camera in front or in back or both?

Start time: 311.24
End time: 312.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's going to be both.

Start time: 313.06
End time: 316.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You agree, Om, a camera in back and in front?  Sure, why not?

Start time: 316.58
End time: 318.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I work hard with both.

Start time: 322.20
End time: 328.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I could pretty much say for sure that they're going to have a front-facing  camera because they're just trying to promote this ridiculous FaceTime thing.

Start time: 329.79
End time: 333.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, it's more for that.  But it's actually better.  The iPad is probably better for that kind of thing.

Start time: 333.96
End time: 344.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think there might be some question about whether you put a, like, well, the Galaxy  Tab has a real camera, but it's kind of weird to hold this big thing up and take a picture  with it.

Start time: 344.96
End time: 359.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it seems like it would work a lot better for FaceTime.  So when you want to show off somebody else doing something, you're holding up the iPad,  you just switch cameras.  I mean, if the iPod Touch already has it, I don't see why the iPad 2 wouldn't.  It just seems like it's just the natural evolution of this.

Start time: 359.94
End time: 366.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're looking for work, for work that you use them at work as networking.  Oh, really?  I mean, as conferencing stuff.  Conferencing?

Start time: 367.59
End time: 373.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I think these go to meeting on the iPad actually works pretty nicely.  I guess if it had a camera, but that would be the front facing more than the...

Start time: 373.20
End time: 376.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's just why...  Why can...  Who uses FaceTime here?  Not me.

Start time: 377.47
End time: 379.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  I, as a gnome, both do.

Start time: 380.28
End time: 386.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't.  I only have Walt Mossberg on mine and I don't really want to FaceTime with him all the time.  He's an excellent FaceTimer.

Start time: 387.20
End time: 390.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Who do you FaceTime, I, as?

Start time: 391.38
End time: 406.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My wife and my son.  Right now, we have a really odd living thing because I sold my house and now I have to  work in Manhattan, but they live somewhere else.  So, I get to see them during the week during FaceTimes.  It's kind of nice.  And the weird thing is that FaceTime seems to work better than Skype a lot for me.

Start time: 406.54
End time: 409.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, so you...  Because that's what I would use Skype for.

Start time: 409.89
End time: 410.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Skype.

Start time: 410.52
End time: 420.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I use Skype all the time to call family members, my daughter when she's out  of the country or now when she's at college.  But I use it on a laptop.  But you're saying you like it on the form, the phone form factor.

Start time: 420.82
End time: 446.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the weird thing is my kid, he's like eight months old, he'll grab the actual phone  or something, he'll actually be able to put it in front of his face.  So, he's actually playing with the thing.  He actually sees me and he can hear me very well versus a laptop where he can end up closing  windows really fast by just tapping like a baby.  And the other thing is I use a MiFi instead of a regular phone.  So, I can use FaceTime really well, but Skype really is lousy on a MiFi, at least in New  York it is.  So, that's why I like FaceTime.

Start time: 446.70
End time: 452.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FaceTime still doesn't work on 3G.  You have to use Wi-Fi, right?  Yeah.  Right.  Nothing changed when I was gone.

Start time: 452.80
End time: 470.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We would use FaceTime.  My partner Megan is just in Afghanistan and Skype didn't work and I would have loved to  use FaceTime, but she works at Google and they're apparently not allowed to have them.  I'm not sure.  Really?  There's a scoop.  I don't know.  Nexus.  She has to do Android, huh?  Yeah, apparently.  I like the Nexus S. I'm happy with it.

Start time: 471.07
End time: 473.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It reboots randomly.  Has she noticed that?

Start time: 473.54
End time: 475.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think she would say it if she did.

Start time: 475.44
End time: 479.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, because she works at the G-Word.  Yeah.  Ohm, how do you use FaceTime?

Start time: 480.16
End time: 482.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My friends, my family.  Really?

Start time: 482.88
End time: 489.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so I stand corrected.  I thought it was, I just thought, I can't imagine anybody using this, but I guess somebody  does.  At least two people on this panel.

Start time: 490.26
End time: 497.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Ayas made a good point.  I think the Skype client leaves a lot to be desired on the phone.

Start time: 498.64
End time: 501.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that gives Apple an opportunity.

Start time: 501.30
End time: 507.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually a very stable video chatting tool.  Very stable.

Start time: 508.80
End time: 511.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else will an iPad 2 have, Ohm?

Start time: 512.52
End time: 528.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have, listen, I actually have no idea given that I was traveling and I really didn't have  the story.  So I can't really comment.  My wish list for the iPad would be just more memory.  More storage.  It's got 64 gigs.

Start time: 529.47
End time: 531.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot.  You want more than that.

Start time: 531.20
End time: 546.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think that fills up really fast if you carry, let's say a season of some TV  And so, and it slows down as you have a lot of stuff on the device.  So I would like to, more memory would be my number one wish.

Start time: 546.24
End time: 550.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not more RAM, but more storage.  More storage.  More storage.

Start time: 550.90
End time: 555.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, a better network would be nice, but that's not going to happen in the US.  So welcome to that.

Start time: 555.96
End time: 558.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then AT&T?  Don't you think there'll be a Verizon iPad?

Start time: 560.40
End time: 581.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope so, but I really would like to see it on Sprint and T-Mobile as well because  their networks are actually better right now because they're not very common.  Because nobody's using them.  Well, that's not quite true, but they actually have better networks for now.  Yeah.  So from a broadband perspective.  So it would be nice to have more options.

Start time: 582.93
End time: 584.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kara, come on, you know, what else is a good idea?

Start time: 585.00
End time: 586.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I haven't seen it.

Start time: 589.08
End time: 595.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It ain't going to have a retina display because it would add to the battery, drain.  I think it's smaller.  I think thinner.  I think thinner and smaller.

Start time: 595.64
End time: 596.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thinner and smaller and hipper.

Start time: 596.64
End time: 606.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the Detroit model is what Apple's going on right now.  What they need to do is make the old iPad look old.  So what do you do?  You add fins.  You said you did that with the iPhone.

Start time: 606.36
End time: 612.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  I don't think it's going to be as dramatic a fix as the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 was.

Start time: 612.40
End time: 620.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And people do legitimately complain that the Kindle is so much easier to hold in bed when  you're reading.  I think the iPad is thinner and more rounded.  You agree, I.S.?

Start time: 621.48
End time: 637.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what I would like the device to do, apart from the style change, that's going  to happen no matter what.  So the old one looks outdated.  Right.  I'd like it to be like when you take it out of the box.  I don't want to have to sync it anymore.  I just want to be able to just use it.  Dream on, dude.  That's Apple's model.  It's the one thing.  If I'm going to have a wish list, that's it.  I just want to be able to.

Start time: 637.94
End time: 640.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dream on.  That's the one thing Apple will never give up.

Start time: 640.12
End time: 640.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on.

Start time: 641.52
End time: 643.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want you to hook it up to the iTunes.

Start time: 644.35
End time: 652.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I can have iTunes right on the device though.  I don't have to sync this thing up to do it.  Maybe there's some crazy way they can activate it wirelessly.

Start time: 652.96
End time: 660.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe if there were like this, somehow you could have a network that would go through  the air and you didn't need wires and you could surf and wouldn't that be cool?

Start time: 661.93
End time: 662.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're living in the future, Laporte.

Start time: 663.38
End time: 679.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's going to be a lot of iterations of this iPad over time because now finally  there's competition eventually.  And so all these Android tablets are going to be different in lots of ways depending  on which manufacturer is making them.  So Apple is going to have to obviously up the feature.

Start time: 679.72
End time: 689.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just Android either.  You've got the RIM playbook, which is very impressive.  You've got, we don't know what HP is going to do, but there's presumably a web OS device  coming out.

Start time: 689.58
End time: 705.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So I mean, I think that they, a lot of the, they're going to have to keep competing and  adding.  I mean, obviously they have, John wrote a story last week that said, you know, of the  4.5 million tablets sold, Apple made 4.3 million of them.  So they have to differentiate themselves and continue to innovate, I guess.

Start time: 707.08
End time: 714.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, I mean, it took, how long did it take for people to come up with iPhone competitors?  A couple of years at least.  Yes.  It's going to happen faster this time.

Start time: 714.84
End time: 722.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  There were so many at, we called it TES, Tablet Entertainment Show.  But what was interesting is you couldn't touch a lot of them because they were all in glass.

Start time: 723.78
End time: 744.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I was, you know, everybody said the Zoom, the Motorola, and by the way, the Zoom is  a terrible name.  Zoom, I guess.  Zoom.  Boom.  But you couldn't touch it.  You know, it was running a video of Honeycomb.  Right.  I was really kind of surprised that everybody said, oh, best of CES.  Well, it was just a video player from what we saw.  You got to see in the back rooms.  Did you get to go back?

Start time: 744.85
End time: 745.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't.

Start time: 745.56
End time: 749.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know what it was.  I've played with it since then and it actually works and it's nice and Honeycomb is great.

Start time: 750.02
End time: 753.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just, you know, people who want to buy the iPad want to buy the iPad.  Just the same thing with the iPhone.

Start time: 753.96
End time: 761.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can someone succeed against the iPad?  Is it possible to compete against the iPad?  Yes.

Start time: 761.52
End time: 784.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes it is.  Of course.  It depends on what people want.  I think Apple is going to have a streak at last year's DE conference, which I said was  like a giant waffle because they kept insisting.  It's too big.  Well, it was too big, too small for a tablet and too big for a phone.  Right.  It's five inches.  So I kept holding up my hand and calling it the waffle, which the guy didn't like it too  much when he did that.  But they'll be different kinds.  There'll be tons and tons of different kinds and that diversity is interesting to consumers,  I think.

Start time: 785.48
End time: 796.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it an issue if Apple changes the screen resolution?  One of the advantages Apple has is they only have two screen resolutions to support.  I guess they have three if you include the 3GS, so maybe it isn't a disadvantage.

Start time: 798.44
End time: 852.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think the big thing about the tablet economy right now is that everybody  else is playing Apple's game.  They're all trying to catch up with Apple.  So whatever Apple does this coming week will actually be a big leap forward compared to  its rivals.  And it's not going to be little tiny features.  It's going to be in the usability and the software, you know, in how it does things.  There will be new kind of software functionality built into it.  I am guessing that would be the key differentiation.  And that's how they're going to keep these other players guessing.  I mean, I've used a couple of these Android-based tablets and, you know, I've used them.  I don't want to use them anymore.  They're nice, but they're not a reason for me to not use an iPad.

Start time: 852.20
End time: 854.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're not that much better yet.

Start time: 854.88
End time: 907.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're not even close to being better.  I think the first one which had some semblance of an edge over the original iPad was the  HP tablet.  And that's not going to be available for another few months.  I mean, what are these guys talking about competing with Apple?  Half of them are not even on the market.  There are just two or three other tablets which are out there, at least in the U.S.  And you know, they're as expensive as Apple.  So there is still a big advantage Apple has.  And I think on the 2nd of March, we are going to be surprised one more time in terms of  like what they do with the experience of the iPad.  iOS 5?  Who knows?  Look, I have no idea.  So I'm not going to sit here and speculate.  Oh, why not?

Start time: 908.50
End time: 911.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, Om.  Join the fun.  There's other people doing that.

Start time: 912.06
End time: 922.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, they do a better job of speculation.  Make some crap up.  Alvin, you know, somebody else has to do something.  I'm kind of with you.

Start time: 922.54
End time: 932.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's ignoring you completely.  No, I'm kind of with you.  I think that that's, I think that especially in the mainstream press, people act as if  these rumors are fact and no one knows what it's going to be.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, what's interesting, I just noticed it.  No, well, I knew when it was and what it would be about.  We didn't report anything.  We got one.  Come on.  I have no idea.  I really don't.  He actually doesn't tell me.  But what's interesting is that, you know, someone was just going by saying that they're going  to be more honeycomb based, Google based, Android based tablets out than the iPad soon.  I think the issue is even though Android has surpassed iPhone in terms of money, not in  least, not even slightly.  I mean, these Android phones don't make money for all these individuals.  It's free.  Exactly.  So I mean, they may surpass them in size.  It's just, you know, what we what we lose in money we make up in volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is not I mean, they may surpass it in size and eventually they'll make more money  from it.  But it's not a money making opportunity for Google at this point.

Transcript:  I think it's the same logic we've had in the PC industry, right?  You had Microsoft make a lot of money from their operating system and applications, whereas  the PC guys have made little or marginal amount of money.  The men of the hardware manufacturers, I think you're seeing exactly the same thing happening  in the tablet and the smartphone.  You know, Google is going to do really well.  I'm happy for them because, you know, they've figured out a way to make money in a platform  which is very controlled.  And you know, I'm not so sure if other people actually the hardware manufacturers actually  do have a shot.  I think the guys who do have a shot are people like Samsung because they make memory and  they make screens and they make processors and they make a whole bunch of other components.  And then now they got an OS, which they can get from Google to put on their device.  So they can make some amount of money.  So, you know, I don't think we should like there is a lot of confusion which goes on  because Apple does the OS and the hardware.  So we confuse that.  And then we have Google, which does the OS.  So I think if Google OS in the smartphone and the tablet is going to be a spectacular  winner because it's going to boost Google services.  I think it's not about Google making dollars and cents in from the actual OS, but they're  making money from various services they sell, whether it's Gmail, advertising, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the things we've seen that Google, when they have their app market on actual tablets  and when they have it on phones, those phones and those tablets do a lot better.  So I mean, Google does have a small interest and their OS doing well, because once you've  Android on all these terribly cheap tablets, like I just saw one like on QVC, the next  book, you know, this terrible Android tablet, it didn't have the Google app market.  And it's when they have that right when they have their app market, they're going to get  a nice little cut of money there too.  I mean, they also have their subscription service.  So they're going to win any which way, because the more more things that have Google on there,  the better they're going to do.  And the other thing is with Honeycomb, they really went out there and tried some things  that aren't like the iPad.  It looks very different.  It looks like you can actually use it as a computer if you really wanted to, which is,  I know this is when tablets are supposed to be, but it's actually very interesting to  me to see what Google has done with Honeycomb.

Start time: 1129.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I think it's going to take a while before I mean, like I remember when when Android  was first introduced, it was supposed to be Google's giant iOS competitor and it was  really just kind of lackluster.  And since this is their first version of their own tablet OS with Honeycomb, I figured by  the maybe by next year, they'll have it completely down.  I mean, they seem to take their time, but they eventually get it right.

Transcript:  Ohm, you just wrote an article I thought very interesting about the FTC looking at Apple's  in app purchases by kids.  Both IaaS and Kara have little kids and the last thing you want to do is give a little  kid an iPhone or an iPad, especially if you're running one of those fishing programs or the  farming programs, because it's not so hard for them to buy stuff and spend a lot of money  without your knowledge.

Transcript:  There's a chilling effect because I think Apple, for instance, approved Google Voice  one year later, one year after the fact, because of scrutiny from the feds.

End time: 1294.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The AdMob went through because of Apple's actions right before with their things.  So there's some scrutiny, but there's no action.  I think the ITA one might be if Google decides to fight.  What is the ITA?  The software, the software flight information software companies that Google bought.  Oh, that's the Google bought that.  ITA software.  It's a very powerful company.  They've got an array of opponents to it.  That should be an interesting signal.

Start time: 1295.22
End time: 1297.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But of course it would be.  But you know, there are no airlines, not just Microsoft.  I know Google says it all the time, but there's legitimate people nervous about Google having  all this flight information, including myself.  I mean, it's just they have a that's a very powerful company they bought in that industry.

Transcript:  They're not tracking me.  But no, I think that they have they have a lock on a lot of critical information.  If you if you're a travel if you have a travel company for having Google owning the the travel  information, it could it could lots of things could happen.  I'm not an antitrust lawyer, but you know.

Start time: 1336.06
End time: 1380.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's the big issue is that it impacts the business of people like eating  your kayak and orbits and other other players who buy their data from ITA software.  I can't really fault Google for doing an end run around these guys and buying the company  which is selling all these third parties data.  I mean, that's what you know, if you have the money, you want to spend it right.  I think what the government needs to do is ensure that it doesn't get control of the  data and just, you know, basically locks out competition.  I think that is not what should happen.  They should be allowed to own this company, but they should they should be an oversight  and access to information to third parties.

Start time: 1381.74
End time: 1409.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other thing is Expedia actually has their own software service for their own travel  information and there's a number of competitors out there.  So Google even bought this.  I think this is actually a great opportunity for someone like Expedia to partner with like  Facebook or something like that where you see these results showing up there.  I mean, just because Google owns ITA or they end up owning ITA, it would seem like it'd  their best interest to license that software to make as much money as they can because  what I mean, they just lock it down.  It doesn't seem like it would make any financial sense to do that.

You know, I was fairly critical of the movie when it came out.  He knows that.  We had a little mock battle back and forth, but it's kind of fun when you know the guy  who's nominated.

I thought that was a great, I don't know whose voice he was speaking for, but I thought that  that was quite apropos.  I'm sure that Larry Summers did not in fact say that to the Winklevie.

Mark Pinkus from Zynga, Andrew Mason from Guantanamo.  What do you think of Mark Pinkus?  I've known him for a long, long time.  When he was in his first company in Washington, D.C.

Transcript:  Sounds like fun.  I can't wait.  More coming up with Kara and of course our guests.  Ayaz Akhtar of thisoldnerd.com and Om Malik of gigaom.com.  But I want to mention very briefly before we get to the more news,  how are we doing on the Oscar countdown?  What time is it?  Oh, we've got plenty of time.  Lots of time.  Oh, we're great.  Two hours.  Is Joan on the red carpet?  I suspect she is.  Oh, I better launch the TV application on our big screen so we can watch.  Meanwhile, I want to tell you guys about freshbooks.com.  If you're a small business person or a freelancer,  one of the big issues is getting paid.  And I know it was for me when I was first starting out on Twitter,  it was just me.  I used FreshBooks.  FreshBooks is the best way to invoice.  It's very easy.  It's online.  Of course you can upload your logo,  those invoices look just as pro as can be.  Your clients get an email saying here's the invoice.  They can download a PDF.  In fact, for an additional fee, and I did this,  you can even have a printed invoice from FreshBooks  mailed to the clients  complete with a postage paid return envelope.  So it's very pro looking.  But here's the thing I like about it.  The invoice is sent to the clients.  They can pay via credit card, via PayPal.  They have 11 electronic payment service options  or of course by check.  Makes it easier for them to pay.  Easier for them to pay means it's more likely  you get paid promptly.  There are automated late payment reminders,  so you follow up.  If you do time tracking,  it's got built in time tracking,  and you can consolidate those time sheets  into a single invoice with a push of a button,  which is very nice.  There's even an iPhone app that will help you  with not only time tracking,  but you can actually invoice right from the iPhone app.  Find out why 2 million people are sending and paying invoices  with FreshBooks since 2004.  That's when I started using them.  And I am a huge fan.  I'm just a great little company.  FreshBooks.com.  It's free for up to three of your clients.  It takes about a minute to set up an account.  FreshBooks.com.  Is this true?  Are they still giving away birthday cakes?  Are they?  Alright.  I see tweets from our listeners  who say, I got a birthday cake!  Everyday FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake  to one of our audience members.  And it doesn't have to be your birthday.  There's nothing better, is it,  than getting a birthday cake and it's not your birthday?  It's like just free money.  So they draw a name every day for the entire month.  FreshBooks.com to get in on the birthday cake.  That's kind of fun.  Alright.  Back we go to the news.  Kara, do you recuse yourself on Google stories?

Start time: 2476.41
End time: 2481.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have a big disclosure.  Peter does all the advertising ones.  Since your partner works at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't do anything that she works on.  And she doesn't come home and tell you.  She never tells me anything.

Start time: 2487.62
End time: 2502.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very clear.  We have a long disclosure that she doesn't tell me anything.  And if she does, I would put it in the story.  I've only recused myself once from a story  that she didn't tell me she was working on.  And I found out through another source.  So later you said, oops.  I had to stop writing about it.

Start time: 2504.20
End time: 2521.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this has been an issue for a while.  With Google as these content farms.  And Google has always said,  that's illegal or whatever it is.  But now they've declared war.  What does that mean?  Is it like worse than what it was before?  Google has always changed its algorithm.

Start time: 2521.78
End time: 2527.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think they're making a bigger deal of it.  They're making a big public deal of it.  When are they going to declare war on on-demand media?

Start time: 2528.16
End time: 2528.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they aren't.

Start time: 2530.12
End time: 2555.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They haven't.  What was interesting was that some of the content  on-demand is good, some of it's not.  It's like all these other sites, Mahalo or Associated Content.  What was interesting is some of these surveys  showed that Associated Content,  which Yahoo owns, got hit badly.  I'd be curious to know how Blogger got hit.  It's a Google property.  They didn't talk about that.  So it's a question of whether,  and also what standards of quality is Google imposing here?  This is that kind of authority issue, isn't it?

Start time: 2557.98
End time: 2559.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does a search engine judge authority or quality?

Start time: 2561.94
End time: 2586.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  I think that'll be interesting.  I talked to Yahoo this afternoon about Luke Beatty,  who created Associated Content,  which was bought by Yahoo about a year ago.  I think his argument was that we don't rely on search  very much for as much as we used to anyway.  We rely on social increasingly,  Facebook, and we rely a lot on the distribution  on the Yahoo-owned and operated networks.  But search has become less important.  That's his...

Start time: 2588.14
End time: 2589.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's true for everyone.

Start time: 2590.30
End time: 2670.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that is so not true for all these guys.  I think they just are making this up.  They're worried.  Go ahead.  What I was saying is, most of these guys,  I think there's two things to it.  I think Google needs these content forums  as much as they need Google.  They make a lot of money from each other.  Both the companies,  whether it's demand media or whosoever it is,  they are big proponents of the Google advertising system.  So Google is clearly benefiting from that.  If it really hates them,  it should stop doing all business with them.  I think that's the key thing.  This is somewhat like the old days of the PC  when you used to have to buy a bigger PC  because Microsoft would release a new software upgrade  and because it would need more horsepower.  I think it's the same kind of thing.  It's like more of these guys are actually doing things  to make the content more accessible.  They're doing things to use up whatever Google  is offering as an opportunity to make money.  And then they use, on the other hand,  Google's advertising systems to make money.  So I think there is a bit of the...  It's not all that clear to me.  I think there is something...  This is more of a PR exercise.  I'd agree.

Start time: 2672.46
End time: 2675.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2675.58

Start time: 2690.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2692.60
End time: 2693.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, no question.

Start time: 2694.86
End time: 2698.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's acknowledging it.  They're putting social search front and center.

Start time: 2698.86
End time: 2716.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, but they still don't have a social solution.  A piece that I haven't written yet,  is social to Google as searches to Microsoft.  Oh, I like it.  I like it.  I think it's a big issue for them to make a big issue of it.  I think Oam is completely correct.

Start time: 2716.74
End time: 2719.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's more PR, Oam, than it is substance?

Start time: 2720.06
End time: 2737.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Why would...  All one has to do is start looking into the financials  of demand and see where their revenues are coming from,  how much business they do with Google.  And you start to...  It all starts to make sense.  But wait a minute,

Start time: 2738.08
End time: 2740.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's a short-term point of view.  Let me finish.

Start time: 2741.90
End time: 2763.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what you're looking at is the guys at AOL  are trying to do the same thing.  It's like, well, we're going to set up our own content farm  so that we can make more money.  The whole world wants to go that way.  And they want to go that way because there is clearly  a clean and easy way to monetize that crummy traffic, so to speak.  And that is Google itself.

Start time: 2765.10
End time: 2784.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Google actually gets rid of these content farms  and they're still serving ads on these sites  that still survive this removal,  can they charge more money for the ads they're serving on those sites?  Would that make any financial sense?  I'm just trying to wrap my head around exactly  how they're making money from all this stuff.  So here is how they make money.

Start time: 2784.40
End time: 2800.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here is how they make money.  The more content farms are out there on the web,  there is more content on the web,  the longer it takes you and I to find things.  The longer it takes you and I to find things,  the more they can serve up ads.  But in the long run,

Start time: 2801.64
End time: 2805.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the longer it takes us for us to find things,  the less likely we are to use Google.

Start time: 2805.42
End time: 2817.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  So what they have to do is optimize their business  around the idea that,  oh, okay, we're going to just make it usable,  just usable enough.

Start time: 2817.38
End time: 2823.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So using longer but just not long enough to bother us.  Yeah.  That's cynical as hell.

Start time: 2824.40
End time: 2841.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just good enough to work.  I really think this is because their search results  have been nonsense and they have that little stupid preview now  so you don't have to look at the content farms.  I know I've been irritated by the results.  I've actually used Bing more lately  because I just wasn't getting the right stuff.  Can Google get away with this

Start time: 2842.89
End time: 2848.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because there isn't a credible alternative?  Yeah, sure.  That gives them more...

Start time: 2849.62
End time: 2865.61

Transcript:  Yeah, they can push it harder.  I think the issue is that they need stuff in,  as Ohm said, they need stuff to search.  And one of the problems is Google is this giant borg  that's been needing information for years,  including from the Wall Street Journal,  from where I work or everywhere else,  and they've run smack into...

Transcript:  They've done it.  Google hurts my business.  It's stealing my stuff.  Thank you for that lovely impression, Rupert Murdoch.  They've run into a piece...  Facebook is a planet that won't let it eat them,  or near them, or get near them, or anything like that.  And so what's interesting is that  I had a conversation with a Google executive  and they're like, Facebook should be open  because it'd be better for people if Google could search it.  I said, it's good for Google.  It's not good for anybody else, necessarily.  They've run into massive amounts of content  they can't eat,  and it's a really interesting problem for them.

I know when I would search for my own stuff every now and then  because I wanted to remember where the story was,  I would see content farms show up before my own work.  Oh, I hate that.  As a user of Google,  is anyone else actually happy about the idea  of finding your own work on your own site for once?

Transcript:  According to Google, this update is designed  to reduce rankings for low-quality sites,  sites which are low-value ad for users,  copy content from other websites,  like IaaS,  or sites that are just not very useful.  This is Amit Singhal and Matt Cutts  talking in a blog post.  Yes, Amit, the sweetest guy.  Yes, as is Matt. Nice people.  At the same time, it will provide better rankings for high-quality sites,  sites with original content.  But isn't that what Google needs to do and wants to do?

Transcript:  I think the bigger issue  which Kara was actually bringing up  is that a lot of these sites actually  do make decent content.  Not all of them, but some of them do.  I think Google needs to figure out  how to deal with those people  as much as it needs to figure out  how to deal with the nefarious people in there.  Should it be just page by page?  Why site by site?

Transcript:  is actually on a page to page basis also.  This is where people are just like people  were always saying,  you know,  you can't do this.  You can't do this.  People are just like people  were always writing viruses  for the Microsoft OS.  It's the same thing.  People are writing hacks for the Google  search OS essentially.  I think that's exactly the parallel right now.  This will be a battle which will continue.  They need to  make sure that  they don't throw out the baby  with the bath water.  There is one thing I would say  about Google.  All the companies of their size  of that magnitude  they are one of the companies which actually  tries to do the right thing.  I may be cynical about them.  I may be very critical about them.  I do want to make sure that I point that out  that they are actually  at the very core  as a company they believe in  doing the right thing.  Now as they hire more and more people away from companies  like Microsoft,  you're going to see their corporate behavior  go down the drain.  But as a company as of now  I think Kara can attest to that  given that she has been writing about  them forever.  I would say the same.  They have always strived to do the right thing.  It doesn't sometimes  work out the way  you and I would like it to work out.  I would give them full credit  for trying at least.

Transcript:  I think so.  I think you're absolutely right.  I agree with you completely.  I do think they're facing a lot of pressure from social networks  and you're beginning to see  that they need to compete better.  And they have to make it more obvious that they're competing.  They don't just get to operate  and be fabulous 100%  and make all this money. They have to face these issues  and talk about them.  So it's a good sign for them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a piece saying I thought  this was what life was like under Larry.  This is to me vintage Larry.  Aggressive.  Larry makes a lot of  remarks, including internally at Google.  He's very snarky.  He can be very snarky in his comments.  And I think what Vic did was something that might not have happened  under Eric.  I don't know if it was evil,  I thought it was juvenile and obnoxious.  And then it was followed by another Google executive  who did the same thing,  another engineer.  And it was sort of sour grapes.  And then Eric of course did say of course we wanted the deal publicly later.  He was a little more gracious about the situation.  There's been other companies  which have done the same thing.

I think it's hard to compete in a situation where Google has this much market share.  But I think it's a very good version of a social...  Social is an opportunity, a leap for Google.  Yes, it's absolutely. And it's something that differentiates themselves from Google.  Which they've been trying to do.  They're not stupid. They're not doing a brute force kind of fight with them.  They're doing a much more...  Finding other features of Google.

Because I want to make sure that if they're recommending stuff,  I'm actually finding out really important stuff instead of like,  Oh, look, your little kid did this. I don't care. That doesn't help me much.  But if they're recommending an actual place to eat or the best place in town to have kids around to jump around and tire themselves out,  I mean, that's useful.

I'm going to take a break and I will get this commercial, this fine commercial mentioned for our good friends in New York, New York.  The Squarespace folks.  I love Squarespace.  Squarespace is hosting and software that makes it easy to create an exceptional website.  You know, for all the talk about Facebook and Twitter and stuff,  if you don't have your own website,  you really don't control your persona on the web.  It's just absolutely vital.  And sometimes it's a little challenge if you don't have your own website.  Where do I go? What do I do? How do I start it?  Squarespace.  Now, I know everybody listening to the show has their own website,  but maybe family or friends come to you and say,  hey, you know, I want to start a site.  Can you recommend this? This is the way to go.  First of all, easy to use. Go to squarespace.com slash twit.  Click the green button.  And without a credit card, without any trouble, within just seconds,  they can set up a site for two weeks free.  Login, password, actually you give it a site name,  password, email address, and then a captcha.  And that's it. No credit card, nothing.  And you can use all the features of Squarespace,  including their incredible templates,  the social widgets that make it so easy to integrate social networks into your website,  the statistics, the photo galleries, the forums, the forums.  And then if, you know, they can say, is this it?  This is my site? Is this what I want?  You could even do it for them and say, I know Alex Lindsay has done that.  He's here. He was at a restaurant the other day,  and they didn't have a website.  So he went, before he left, he went on Squarespace,  set up a quick site, said, look, you need a website.  If you decide you want to keep it, $12 a month.  That includes hosting and all of the software.  But you can get, get there right now for free.  Just by going to squarespace.com slash twit.  I'm a big fan. I think you'll like it.  And, you know, if you've got a blog or whatever, you want to import it,  you can movable type WordPress, typepad and blogger, all the big APIs.  But really, I think the thing to do is to tell your friends and family,  at least set up this page so that you own your presence, your site on the web.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  We can, did we talk about Watson?  We haven't talked about Watson. What did you think about that?  I love Watson.  I love Watson too.

So not everybody can sit there and write 2,000 words.  So not everybody can sit there and write 2,000 words.  Not everybody wants to share their whole life story  in a blog post.  They want to do it through either Twitter,  through photos, through videos,  through Facebook, whatever.  I mean, people are essentially sharing more.  And I think that is  the key thing.  I think 10 years later, you know, I've been blogging  for more than 10 years now.  And people still haven't figured out what blogging is.  Blogging is an act of  sharing yourself.  It's not about a tool.  Tools don't define  what you do with.  And I think that is so amazing  that people still get it wrong all the time.

That things always change.  Whether it's the media  or it's the society itself.  I think that's exactly what's happening right now.  That's why people say,  blogging is  coming at an expense  of something else. You say, no, it's not.  Everything is evolving.  Things change. That's what technology  is all about.

Start time: 4661.00
End time: 4750.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What tipped me off  was when I was doing Giga Om,  I was getting more reader interaction  from the blog  than I was from my magazine.  That's so funny.  I sold my  book, initially when I wrote it  back in the day,  pretty much entirely through the blog.  Everything was  people wanted to do  wanted the interaction.  I think I realized that. I said, this is  huge.  It makes no sense to have  a big corporate infrastructure  to do basically  the main  task of a media organization  is to present information  to its ultimate customers  who are the readers.  If you don't do that, you don't have a business.  I think most of the big companies  still don't quite understand that  that's the problem they have.  They're not serving the needs  of their customers.  They're not doing the job  they're supposed to do.  It brings great journalism. Why is it  that Kara can do it or I can do it  with a little tiny staff  and the other guys can't do it  with such massive infrastructure?  It's because they're focusing on the  wrong things. I think  our business  when I started out doing it,  it was a very clear realization. I'm in the  business of making my customers happy.  My customers are readers.  If they're happy, everything else will follow.  That was it.

Start time: 4759.72
End time: 4787.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things that Ohm said  is that they have this giant infrastructure  so they can't actually do it.  That's fine to be a hindrance for a lot of companies.  They want to go and be nimble  but they don't want to continue  doing the things  the way they used to.  Layer after layer after layer.  If you're working with a small staff, you can communicate  so much faster and get things done  faster and change really easy.  Once you start adding layers of infrastructure,  you start running into problems I think.

Transcript:  I'm a little sympathetic as a business owner.  When you design a business, you design it around a business plan.  The business plan includes how you're going to make money.  The business plan includes how you're going to make money.  A newspaper was designed  around the business plan of display ads making money.  When things change,  it's not quite so easy to change a business on a dime  and to change your business model  and change your revenue model.  Particularly since anything you do on the web these days  cannibalizes your existing business model.  Very hard for a company to do that.

Start time: 4821.74
End time: 4871.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. I think, Leo,  this is where I would disagree with you  probably for the first time.  I think media companies  are in the business of information.  They define themselves  through the medium.  They do not realize  that they are all about selling information.  Whether it is sold  as a newspaper  or as an online service  or as a TV show  or as a podcast or whatever it might be.  See, this is why  you see a company like Bloomberg  thrive in this down market  is because they're in the business of information.  What you are doing  is actually you're selling  information  and the focus on people who matter the most  in your business  who are your readers or viewers.  No, I agree with you.

They didn't understand what they were in the transportation business  and so they lost to the trucking industry.  But the problem is, the point I'm making  is you might even know that.

Transcript:  I think that is the problem.  We basically define...  I wrote a piece about this recently  on the site  which called,  Changes is Good,  but it's also really, really hot.  I shared my story.  I'm trying to give up.  I've been smoke free for three years now  and not a single day  goes by when I don't need to fight  that urge.  Change is so much harder on an individual  basis.  It's much tougher for companies  because they are also predisposed  to do certain things in a certain way.

Transcript:  So that is the key thing.  This is one of the main reasons  why media companies  find themselves in this trouble is because  they have these behaviors  which they don't want to get rid of.  They don't want to say  we are going to stop doing this.  I think it's been pretty clear  that the internet was going to be  a destructive force for the newspaper business  for about 12 years now.  Pretty clear.  They still haven't done anything about it.  I think that's because  they're refusing to embrace  any kind of change.  This is why  you see newer entities come up.  That is why  opportunity arises for all things  the or me or anybody else.  It's because  we are willing to make a bet  on the change.
