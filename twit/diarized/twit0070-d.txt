Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a website that doesn't suck.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did ZD do that for you?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice.  Actually props to Nevin and Dinah for putting together the design and the whole crew,  Michael and Robin, who were able to get us moved over to movable type enterprise.  Oh, it's movable type.  Yes, and it's glorious after having spent a bunch of time trying to run blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were you guys using Vignette still or what were you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're using a variation of community, intelligence community server.  Okay.  Just like a 1.0 version of the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a really good looking engine.  I mean, it gives you and I can tell it's flexible.  Also here, that's Will Harris.  You recognize the Brit, aka Nick.  He's in San Francisco for the Intel Developers Forum starting on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And isn't it lovely here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I know why you really came here.  You're here to meet Lala on Tuesday.  David Prager is going to get us in.  David Prager from Revision 3, big party for Revision 3 on Thursday, Tuesday.  What's the party about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Revision 3.  There's free drinks, free drinks for us.  The party is all about the fact that Revision 3 has been around for a while and we're kind  of turning the corner and every time at the end of the show.  It's a relaunch, man.  Going on with Revision 3, we got all this stuff we're working on.  We got all this stuff we're working on.  I can't say anything.  It's just 3.1.  But yeah, it's kind of like the relaunch versus just a launch.  So there's a whole bunch of new stuff that we're going to announce on Tuesday.  We'll go live the very, very next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, cool.  So Wednesday, there's going to be something brand new.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then we've got to say something, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys at DIG and Revision 3 are acting like it's 1998 all over again with the parties,  the t-shirts.  You guys must have VC.  The parties are pretty tame.  Oh, are they?  I haven't been to any.  I'm going to go to this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure you could manage to bankroll any one of these.  Not to take any.  The parties have been great.  But we're not talking product isn't shipping, and they spent $75,000 to bring an 80s pop  icon in and threw a party for 2,000 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, it's really fun to do everything from the whole grassroots mentality.  There's this pretty cool club in Petraeum called Mighty, and you get to know the folks there.  And you say, hey, we want to have a launch party.  And you work out deals with them almost different than if you were playing  and you're like, hey, we want to have a party.  And they're like, OK, we're going to charge you X thousand dollars.  We're like, all right, where do we sign one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is everybody invited to this, or have we just given out information that nobody should act on?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably almost a month ago, we went over to Upcoming.org,  and we were all excited about the fact that we knew this is going to be our launch date.  And so we went over there and talked about, hey, this is where the party is going to be,  and whoever wants to come wants to come.  And then we have a...  Is it booked up?  We booked the club for the night at the 26th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you must have more than a few thousand people who said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in the Upcoming.org, which anybody can see...  I mean, if you go to Google and type Upcoming.org and space revision three,  you'll find the invite.  It's not the invite, it's just the event.  So we sent that out and then we put that online and then we typed in.  We put together a list of as many people we knew that we thought of as friends of revision three.  And then we copied a bunch of different press folks because we wanted to get some publicity.  And we fired that off as official invites.  And then we're expecting, I don't know, I'd say at least 300 people, maybe more.  I know the venue is larger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just asking, can the Twin Army come?  Absolutely.  Oh, you're in trouble now.  I know we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're absolutely, absolutely invite.  Anyone's free to come 7 p.m. at Mighty, which is in San Francisco at 119 Utah Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you'll be there, right, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I'm just laughing because like the...  If you go to SanFranciscoForUpcoming.org, there's Friday was Yahoo Pack Day.  Tuesday is the revision three party.  Tuesday 10-3 is the delicious birthday bash.  Then there's the Web 2.0 conference.  It is 1998.  Laughing Squid 11-18 for its second decade.  It's all over again.  We're doing it all over again.  That's funny.  There's a big hole until Mack Word Old Expo.  Well, you'll be glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's got IDF going on next week and all that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of people are in town like Will for the Intel Developers Forum.  We'll have an update on that next week.  And maybe Will, you'll join us.  Although I'm going, I'm sure you're going, Patrick, right?  To which?  IDF?  Yes.  Yes, we're going to go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When are you headed down to Ontario, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then Podcast Expo is...  I'm going down Thursday for Podcast Academy.  My keynote is Friday for Podcast Expo.  And then, you know, I'm getting the award for a podcaster, a pod person of the year, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was waiting for you to...  No, that's us.  ...talking about what you were going there for so I could introduce that fact and congratulate you.  Thank you.  You make us seem all swank and humble.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mean if I hadn't tooted my own horn, you would have done it for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been waiting for a chance since we started recording.  You got my back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Is there a gift bag?  There is.  Oh, there is?  I'm probably give it away, but there's some nice stuff.  Yeah, there's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they announced to the IRS over at the Emmys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that kind of a gift bag.  I don't have to worry about the Sopranos stealing my gift bag.  No, it's...  I'm getting a Morant 670 recorder.  Like I don't have enough of those.  A pair of Sony headphones, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it is.  You know, you should...  It's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd help a young blogger with it.  I'll help a young blonde.  I mean, blogger, yes, I will, yes.  No, I think it's a...  I mean, I'm very honored.  I think it's great.  Doug Kay won the award last year, the first award, and this is, you know...  I feel bad.  I might give the money to Adam Curry, I think, you know.  But anyway, that's nice.  It's nice acknowledgement.  It'll be a lot of fun.  We didn't win any awards for our podcasts, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the podcasts weren't eligible for the awards next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were not eligible for the Podcasts of the Year award.  We were not.  But we were eligible in the categories, and I think Security Now was nominated in technology  but did not win.  So...  That hurt.  Big story.  Some interesting stories.  As long as we're talking podcasting, did you see that...  And actually, I'm interested in what your reaction is on this, Patrick, because of Extreme  iPod.  Apple has gone after Podcast Ready, which is a company that does a podcast client called  My Potter.  Now, I can understand why Apple would say you can't use My Potter.  It sounds too much like iPod, but apparently they're also saying you can't use the word  Podcast Ready.  Is Apple trying to trademark the word podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're trying to control all use of the word pod within the context of audio and the  net.  Well, doesn't that mean podcast?  Well, that was my next logical extension.  I'm scared!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously, now I know with some of the sites like iPod Lounge, they went after them a  while ago and they had a change into iLounge.  Did you have to change Extreme iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Really?  Yeah, anybody with iPod in the name is going to have legal action taken against them by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ZDNet had a very interesting, on the ZDNet blogs, Russell Shaw's blog, post today, in  which he actually looked at Apple's trademark filings and so forth and came to the conclusion  that this was happening because A, Apple was trying to trademark new uses of the word iPod,  including a trademark for iPodcast and was getting some pushback from the Patent and  Trademark Office saying, you know, you guys haven't established to our satisfaction your  ownership of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think Apple is going to be able to own the word podcast.  It's in the dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they're not going to try.  I mean, actually, scratch that.  It's not going to try.  What they're going to try to do is not own any other following use of a word or phrase  created around the word iPod or iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've said for a long time that it's really, the choice of the name podcast was unfortunate  because it does imply an iPod.  But more than that, what's really unfortunate ever since iTunes came out is Apple really,  it looks like podcasts are an Apple phenomenon.  Without iTunes, there would be no podcasts.  You know, a reporter called me from Wired News and asked me on the anniversary of iTunes,  wasn't it great that iTunes saved podcasting?  And I said, no, it's terrible.  It looks like Apple, like podcasting belongs to Apple.  And this just further, do we need a new name?  Netcast man.  I like netcast, but I'm the only one, apparently.  A lot of people said, ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The funny thing was Creative Labs tried to make out like podcast meant personal on demand  cast.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's like, yeah, well, nobody's buying that one.  A lot of people have suggested odd cast, A-U-D, like audio, odd cast and vid cast.  There have been a lot of suggestions, none of them so salubrious.  I think netcast is simple and straightforward, but apparently maybe too generic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Podcast has too much traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's right.  It's too late, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My thought was like, it'd be like, you know, changing.  It's not hacker, it's cracker.  Hacker's a good phrase, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that never worked.  On the other hand, it's a new medium.  It's only a couple of years old.  A lot of people don't know about it.  And I still run into people all the time who say, oh, I would listen to your shows, but  I don't have an iPod.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of difficult because I mean, even for us, when we're trying to like have  revision three and people like, what is revision three?  And we're trying to come up with a formal statement of what it is.  And we want to say, well, we create original shows.  They're not TV shows.  We don't want to say podcasts.  And for Twitter, you don't want to say that they're podcasts either.  So what do you call them?  It's just difficult to decide what to call it.  Downloadable video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Internet distributed video programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you see, that's like, hey, guys, you hear about that new Internet distributed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  audio program, the catchy name and podcast.  Let's face it.  One of the reasons podcasting is successful is it had a good name and it wrote on the  coattails of iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can ask your grandmother about podcasting and chances are she might not know what it  is, but she's heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  We're stuck.  So what happens now?  I mean, I don't think I have I would be shocked if Apple went against around suing or sending  cease and desist letters to podcasters at this point.  You wouldn't be surprised.  I would be surprised. I'd be very surprised.  That'd be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because Apple still wants to call it podcast, though, don't they?  But they just want to own the name podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that would be I don't think they're even trying to own the name podcast.  But they've they've they've rigorously defended any use of iPod anywhere.  So, you know, who knows?  You know, maybe they think they have a claim podcast ready or they're going to try to do  that. Maybe it's a flanking maneuver to keep  Microsoft from, you know, suddenly paying attention to Microsoft for a while, called

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  them blogcasts, which is even worse than podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're still refusing to build, you know, they still haven't built they still haven't  built RSS, you know, and then the ability to download podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm praying, frankly, that the Vista has the ability built in to download podcasts that  would finally break the monopoly that iTunes has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I seven has I seven.  It seems like they're they're refusing to put RSS anywhere other than I seven because  I got to talk at CES this year.  I got to talk to one of the product manager or the product manager for Windows Media 11.  I was like, hey, who do I need to buy a case of scotch or a lifetime supply of pizzas to  get RSS to port integrated into Windows Media Player 11?  And and it was the kind of answer I got was we'd like to have that.  It's not our number one priority, but we'd like to add that in if, you know, and  it is in IE seven.  What's that? How hard can it really be?  Well, having never, you know, managed a project of that size within a company that is up  tight about, you know, I mean, I always get this vision of Microsoft being in a sort of  a terminal battle between trying to own specs or create quote open unquote specs that it,  you know, has the ability to lean on and making it something as open as, you know, it was  a big deal for them to put it, you know, RSS readers in IE seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's so much that it's hard.  I think they're gunshot. I mean, after doing Active Desktop, I think there may be a really  reluctant to put push technology into the OS.  It makes sense to put it, frankly, in IE seven.  I mean, that's the OS.  Right. I mean, what would the only other way they might do it and I would hope they might  consider this is putting it into Windows Media Player, although have you been following

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talking about us? We've been talking to them about doing that.  Right. Well, we'd like to, but have you been following the discussion over the copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  protection in Windows Media Player 11?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds crazy. I can't believe that it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fill us in because I'm not completely clear on what they're trying to do.  This is the new beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So apparently, I mean, I haven't tried this myself, but it's if you download DRM'd  music currently right on Windows Media Player, you can back up all the licenses for that  music to a file and then you can also back up the actual music files.  And then if your computer dies, you can have a backup being transferred onto your new  computer. You've got all your licenses there, all your music there.  Everything works fine again.  What apparently happens in Vista is that you can't back up the licenses, so you can  back up all the music.  But you can't play it because you don't have the licenses.  And they're saying that this is by design that you can't back up the licenses.  Why not?  Which would seem, well, because then you could transfer the licenses to another computer  simultaneously and you could have the music and the licenses on two computers at once,  which would clearly be illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the Inquirer calls DRM an infection and they say that you can't.  Isn't that brilliant?  I think it's true.  You cannot back up your licenses, which means if your hard drive crashes, even if you've  backed up your music, you've got to buy new music.  Yeah.  Now, here's the amazing thing.  If you rip your own CDs with Windows Media Player, you've got to make sure you, and this  is true, actually, of current versions, you've got to turn off that copy protect music.  Otherwise, it will copy protect your own burning and you'll have the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is that is true with current CD burns.  You have to turn it off and say, actually, with my own music I've bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Current CD rips.  I mean, it's it's natively set to use WMA.  It puts it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it puts it on.  And of course, the Zune adds copy protection when you transfer files from the Zune.  So if people's if I'm sitting here with a Zune and you've got a Zune, you said, have  you heard the latest twit?  Let me send it to you, mate, because that's how you guys talk.  I'll get a copy with DRM and I can play it three times and then it stops playing until  I quote license it, which, by the way, is a violation of our license, our Creative  Commons license.  You're not allowed to DRM the file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's really interesting.  I didn't realize that the Zune added itself.  Yeah, it adds it to like, well, they say it's breaking license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's breaking the license.  They say we have to do it because we can't tell when you're transferring a file what's  copy protected and what's not.  Of course, they can, but they say they can't.  So we've got to do it to everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, like I'm reading the Microsoft page on backing up and restoring licenses.  And it's it's yeah, it's kind of fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this is this is and that's why I agree with the Inquirer when they say DRM  is an infection, it spreads just like the GPL, you know, that people complain about  the viral.  And of course, without it, we wouldn't have open source.  But the viral elements of GPL were if you use a new public licensed piece of open  source software to create your own software that automatically inherits the license and  so has to be free as well.  This is the opposite.  It's, you know, it automatically inherits the DRM and has to be copy protected as  well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of curious, has has has Microsoft responded anywhere to say why they are not  allowing licenses to be backed up?  Not as far as I know.  And when does in only that it's intentional.  Only that they just said they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, correct me if I'm wrong, Will, but didn't you just say they said that this was  intentional behavior?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe that if you read through the page that's linked in that article, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what I'm backing up.  Yeah, I believe if you read it through, it says it's by design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All it says is Windows Media Player 11 does not permit you to back up your media usage  rights, previously known as licenses.  However, depending on where your protected files came from, you might be able to restore  your rights over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a pretty big that's a pretty big moat to throw out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Of course, you don't have that problem do you on iTunes because your licenses  are stored with your user account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you better not lose your it's actually the same because you better not lose  the files because you can't you can't download them again.  Of course, you can't at least back up the files and move them to another computer.  Yeah. Right.  Although, you know, it's funny because for a while you could deauthorize and it's easy  to accidentally, you know, reformat.  Forget to deauthorize a computer.  Exactly.  And forget to I do it all the time.  And those of us who use a lot of computers, you know, you're allowed five computers,  which I think is fairly fine.  What's interesting is if you forget to deauthorize, you can only deauthorize all  systems once a year now.  So I'm waiting till December 5th because I can't run my iTunes music on my new  computer until I can deauthorize the old formatted one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, for a fact, there's quite a number of users, iTunes users who have actually  just accidentally erased all their music.  And Apple has actually allowed them to re download everything because they keep records.  What do you do?  Do you beg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you how do you because if you just ask, you know, normally they'll say, no, sorry.  What do you how do you get them to I know I've heard these stories, anecdotal stories  as well. But what do you do?  Most I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the most recent one that I read about was on Will Wheaton's blog, Will Wheaton,  he was the.  Oh, so if you were on Star Trek, you can do it.  Well, that was that's what a lot of the people because he posted this on his blog and  it got submitted to dig.  And I was like, oh, that's really cool.  Apple's so nice. And then, of course, a bunch of the commenters on well, you know,  you have to do this and this and this.  And it does be well, Wheaton.  So there's arguments in that.  So Apple's saying, no, this is our policy.  If someone does this, we can give them their stuff back.  I don't know. You have to go to his blog and read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is not their policy.  I know that it's not their policy.  They're very specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I thought was quite interesting was I tried this the other day is that you can  actually play it is actually I didn't realize it was computer.  I thought it was user account because I have two iTunes accounts.  And even when I'm signed in with one, it will let me play music from the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it stores more than one license.  Yeah. Look, it's clear DRM sucks.  It only inhibits honest users because if I were a dishonest user,  I'd merely run the program that removes all copy protection and I wouldn't have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  problem. There's worse stuff in there than the DRM, Leo.  Reading through this, the Inquirer article and reading through that page.  Yeah.  You know, it gets I'll just I'll just, you know, quote the Inquirer because they're  obviously doing a hell of a job covering this.  After three days, it basically cuts your TVO capabilities.  After three days, it kills your recordings for you.  Going away for a week, tough.  Your rights are inconvenient to the proffer.  So they have to go recorded TV shows that are protected with media usage rights,  such as some TV content recorded on premium channels, but not playback after three  days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this Windows Media Center or Zune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows Media Player 11 beta 2 for XP.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you use Windows Media Player to playback TV shows or record TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You use it as a DS.  If you have Windows Media Player 11 beta 2 running on your media center edition PC  currently, it'll erase your you know, it can possibly erase your files after three  days. If there's if there's basically media usage rights set with the show.  That's very hard.  So that's like it's also kind of strange, like it's like, hey, you know, all that  cool stuff we built into the media center edition to complete with TVO.  We're going to kill it now in a really strange way.  That's just sad.  Well, I tell you, I and everyone started quietly weeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just it's frustrating.  And frankly, it's it's we should get Cory Doctor on.  He could do a little a little eulogy, but it's just frustrating.  I mean, I think really consumers have to stand up and say, look, we're not going to  accept this and we can't let Congress go ahead and promote this.  Did you see the latest?  This is I can't quote the Valley Wag headline because that's what Nick Douglas

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  likes to write, because it's good because he good headlines get good attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Congress says, FU to net neutrality with blatant pro big business push poll.  This is actually kind of interesting.  You know what a push poll is?  It's basically a fake survey that members of Congress use, politicians  use to promote their ideas.  They they ask very loaded questions and then they come back with a result.  Look, 87 percent of people said net neutrality is a terrible idea.  So clearly, I mean, they're campaigning hard.  It said, according to the results of this poll from the Senate  Committee on Commerce, the Ted Stevens committee, only five percent of voters  had ever even heard of net neutrality.  When they asked voters whether they wanted a law, quote, delivering TV and  video choice or a law enhancing net neutrality, guess what people chose  TV and video choice.  So naturally, when the results of the poll come back saying 90 percent of people  hate net neutrality, which just shows you that when you get Congress actually  campaigning in favor of AT&T and Comcast and Verizon, that's a scary thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. You could also look at the fact that even within groups like the  EFF, which are normally or normally always appear to be utterly and totally  together and what their viewpoint on a particular issue is, is some of their  management's pretty heavily divided over whether or not net neutrality is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to be at a government level.  Do we do we want the FCC to be sniffing into our business?  And I mean, I understand.  And until there's a real issue coming up.  But I see the light on the railroad track heading straight for us.  When you see things like this, it's very clear that these companies are adamant  about about forwarding their point of view on this.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're just trying to protect our relationship to the consumers that built

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this company and trust us to deliver the best end user experience possible.  Mr. LaPorte, are you trying to suggest that there's some insidious opportunity  we might take advantage to not prioritize the packets that are running over our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  network, courtesy of Peering?  Are you against choice, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LaPorte? Do you not understand how the how the Internet works, Mr.  LaPorte? I don't know, it's a bunch of tobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, it's tobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, before we go on, I want to talk in a little bit about about the big HP scandal,  because there's even more news.  This is becoming the People magazine story of Twitter.  But before we do that, I just want to mention, of course, this is the last  tweet to a feed. Well, I guess we'll have one more featuring our friends at Visa.  They've been very supportive of the Twitter podcasts on as a whole.  We just want to remind people that when you use your credit card, use your Visa  card, help support them in the way they've helped support us.  Visa is working hard to protect you online.  Whenever you buy something online with Visa, you know that you are protected  by their fraud monitoring and and of course, they're the ones that do the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  pockets of protection with all the football players surrounding what's his  name on the Patriots Tom Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, are they?  I don't I don't watch NFL, so you have to tell me of protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what their protection.  I like it. And they have all the linemen protecting the quarterback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you use when you use Visa, you have a front line.  That should be their slogan.  Actually, it's very.  Yeah, it's actually just safer, better money.  Life and Twitter takes Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they've got the different linemen joking about being metaphors,  metaphors for different types of protection that the quarterback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Visa for cleaner, safer tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. I also want to thank Dell for their support.  Remember, we've got some great Dell specials online.  Twitter TV slash Dell for the Leo's picks and some really good ones,  some good prices.  Again, I can't give them out on the podcast, but if you want to see what  they are, Twitter dot TV slash Dell.  And if you want to help us out when you buy your next Dell, just go through  that website, just click through there.  That gives us a little extra leverage with Dell, Twitter TV slash Dell.  And that concludes this this portion.  So HP, let's talk about this one.  This is developing now.  Patricia Dunn is out.  We predicted it here.  She's forced out by the board.  She's the former chairwoman of the board on Hewlett Packard.  Mark Hurd, the CEO, is even having to step forward saying, well, you know,  I did it. I admit I had something to do with it.  And finally, for the first time, HP stock is taking a little bit of a hit.  Do you think the market is being skittish?  Is HP still a strong company or does this really hurt them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what's really interesting is that the market has taken a hit,  not because of the scandal, but because of the way that the scandal has been  handled. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's a good point.  But then that was what Watergate was the problem was was not so much  the act, but the cover up.  Often how badly these companies handle these crises really is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think the first rule of PR is that when something like this happens,  you just you fess up and you put all the details out there  because that way you're headline news for a day.  But the next day you move on.  But the way HP is playing it, where there's a little bit new  coming out every day, you know, they are headlines every day  for the last two weeks or whatever.  And it just works out so much worse in the long run.  And they're really paying the price for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is about having pissed off a lot of pivotal,  pivotal news organizations and journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CNET's got now a whole landing page with all their stories.  I mean, you know, they're milking this sucker because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look, Bill, the landing page of the drop of a hat.  That's true.  They've got a great they've got a great interface for that.  They move fast on lots of editors.  And there are a lot of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they that's, you know,  more than a dozen stories on that page.  Have you seen that?  I'm a little disappointed by CNET and others coverage of this  VML exploit in Windows, which is, I think,  one of one of the more serious exploits in Windows.  And what the story broke on Wednesday, I haven't seen any coverage at all.  Have you have you guys seen anything about this?  I didn't even heard about it. Yeah.  And this is what bugs me.  Well, let me let me fill you in.  We did a whole we actually had finished security now.  And this story broke.  And we actually took the one we've done it  and we'll put it off for next week and did a whole new security now around it.  We talked to Eric Stiles.  He's with Sunbelt Software, which makes distributes the Cario personal firewall.  They're good company, good security company.  They discovered this in the wild.  It's an exploit in the wild.  It was not discovered, you know, theoretically.  It was they found what they do is they constantly surf the net  to kind of bad websites, in this case, porn sites, adult sites,  but more more commonly cracks and wears sites.  And when they get to these sites, they they have a variety of ways  of sniffing out exploits on the sites.  And all of a sudden, they found these sites, quite a few of them,  with an exploit that takes advantage of a hole in Windows XP,  no matter how patched, even if your patches are fully updated.  If you're using Internet Explorer six, for sure, it's not clear.  Maybe seven as well.  There is it's possible to make a malformed VML file.  A VML is a vector graphic format that is only displayed by Internet Explorer.  Firefox ignores it.  That's rarely used on the net.  Turns out, though, the library that it uses to display this has a horrible bug in it  that allows any page with a VM with this malformed VML image on it.  Or, by the way, HTML email can do it to to embed any program they want.  Adware, spyware, Trojan horses, keyloggers, anything on your system.  This is WMS.  It's just like WMF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this the exploit that has something to do with like vector images?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's vector images.  And the thing is, I haven't seen any coverage of this.  Microsoft has no patch for it.  There is a simple fix.  If people know about it, you unregister the DLL for this.  It's a command line. It's complicated.  We have I'll have a link to it on the show notes.  You just go to GRC.com.  But I think I have to say, I'm a little disappointed at how little  it's been covered in the tech.  Is it is it that we are just now shell shocked?  We know a Windows a horrendous Windows hole no longer is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's quite possibly it.  Otherwise, you'd just be writing it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is this is anything  it can blow by a fully patched XP system is pretty bad juju.  And I'm also looking at like, I think, 130 articles talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's starting to come out now, but which is good.  But I mean, it's just if it's if it's coming out,  it's just now coming out.  You know, I made it.  We made a big deal about it because I really think people  have the right to know about this.  Microsoft is not offering a patch.  I suppose they may next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you just did a search and I found that Ars Technica  published something about a company called Zer0 Day  Emergency Response Team that are announcing that they've put out a patch for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a patch.  And I'm not recommending the patch only because it's so easy to do it yourself.  And the problem with patches, you really have to test them.  You know, before you do use somebody third party's patch.  You know, who are these guys?  You know, I'm not saying it's a bad patch, but, you know, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  especially as the company named Zer0 Day is a little like,  you know, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  However, zombies, you know, it's interesting about this, though,  is that these exploits are actually sold.  This is a commercial package sold out of a Russian company.  Twenty bucks.  Webmasters subscribe to this package and it gets updated with new exploits.  It's it's trivial for webmasters to put these exploits on their pages.  And the reason they do it is they get paid clicks from these adware companies. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is it? So it's installing adware on your system.  Is that essentially what? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although it could do anything, it could install any program,  including a keystroke, logger, spam forwarders, anything.  A virus is, you know, I could, you know,  I could put someone there to erase your hard drive.  There's no there's no limit to what it could do.  But most of the time, the reason this spread so quickly is these webmasters  make money. They put adware on people's systems.  People click the adware and the webmasters make money on it.  The the the exploit is is, in other words, completely automatic, easy to implement.  They found Sunbelt software founded founded on one site in the morning.  There was one ad piece of adware on it.  When they came back in the afternoon, there were 50 different pieces of adware  would be installed if you went to that site.  And this is with a fully patched version of Windows using IE6.  I guess you could use Firefox. You'd be safe.  But you'd also have to turn off the preview pane in Outlook  or make it a text only preview pane  or anything that's using IE to render HTML.  I mean, it's it's a pretty big hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think my question would be kind of curious to find out what the what the sites are  that are like the number one source of these.  Yeah, you know, we asked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was they're reluctant to give out the addresses,  I think because they know people just surf to them.  www.hackerwares.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's going to be a great job, though, hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just spending all day going around adult sites looking for stuff.  It's automated. I'm sorry to say, Will, you don't don't apply to the webmasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't apply for the job right now.  They use VMware and and a lot of specialized.  You know what it is? I do see it now on News.com.  It's coming up a little bit on the news stories.  It's not the top story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always have. But this is always how nasty.  Unless it's unless it's been one of those things where it's been a palpable  impact on Internet performance.  It always takes a while for the for stuff like this to build up momentum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just on the bleeding edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess so. If you listen to Twitter security now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll know. I know what we're doing in our block on Tuesday.  We're going to show people at a patch. Would you?  The nasty hole. Please do. Yeah.  Yeah. Well, actually, we'll do a video on how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So DL TV on Tuesday.  It's a it's a one line start run command, but it's  it's certainly I think important to get the word out.  Absolutely. So Toshiba batteries now blow up.  I'm sorry, John's not on today because he was crowing last week about how  my Toshiba hasn't blown up.  No recall with Toshiba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toshiba hasn't blown up.  Toshiba is having battery reliability issues with two of their models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So they are doing a battery recall, but it's not exploding batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, there has been a Lenovo that lit itself on fire in the last.  I saw that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I see that even apparently three airlines, I don't have the names of them.  It says have temporarily imposed bans on using the notebook  notebook models from Dell and Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about this last week.  It's Qantas, Korean Air and Virgin.  And I got a lot of email from people who flown on Qantas  because we have a lot of Australian listeners and said, no, no,  I brought my Dell or I brought my Apple.  But what they're saying is you can't plug in if you've got a battery in there.  You can't use your computer if you've got a battery in there.  So what you have to do is take the battery out.  And if you want to use a computer, you have to plug in.  Of course, not all seats have plugs.  You have to wrap your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Virgin's changed it now.  So it's only if you have a battery that's affected by a recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so you can look at the serial number of what they check in serial numbers.  What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows?  That's what they're saying now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the TSA, I mean, that's like the whole stripping your toothpaste  and all liquids out of your bag. Right.  I'm still kind of no.  Toe son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's that? What's Mr.  Priggan? Did you hear about Richard Branson and from Virgin and what he  donated three billion dollars to? Yeah, good for him. What?  I think that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did he donate it to?  Global warming, the global warming, fixing global warming.  I'd like to give I'd like to give billions to global warming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To further the global warming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's really interesting.  I saw that Al Gore film this week.  Ah, that's that's a convenient truth. Yeah.  What do you think? And it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you really, really, really count and donate it to global?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it did convince me to buy a slightly better car.  But what was really interesting was that he pointed out that  apparently in California, there's been some push to like get cars  to have better emissions regulations.  Yes, we just passed a law, in fact.  OK, and apparently the car companies are complaining.  But apparently those are still less than compulsory in China.  They made the point like it's ridiculous that like American companies  can't comply with regulations that are currently in place in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but but part of the issue is that U.S.  companies actually are completely complying with all of the current  California resource laws, and they're being sued for still being a major  contributor to greenhouse gases.  OK, well, that's interesting.  That's at least one of the more interesting analyses of the  you just can't wait for politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, but yeah, but I mean, you know, you know, my dad is a is a  earth scientist, is a retired earth scientist.  And when we were in the cruise in Alaska, of course, we're looking at the glaciers  and everybody's seen the Al Gore movie and they're all going,  oh, the glaciers are melting, they're melting.  Now, my dad, this is his specialty.  And he said, well, you know, they melt every 40,000 years.  This is kind of not wouldn't be the first time.  In fact, you know, there's very cyclic ice ages and meltings  and ice ages and meltings.  And, you know, he he said, we undoubtedly are  accelerating it, but it would happen anyway.  And the best thing to do is just people should rezone.  Don't build on the waterfront right now, because it's going to rain.  It's going to go up.  Just a word of warning from my dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't think we really want a new ice age there, do we?  I don't know about you, but well, we're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, we're going to have a new ice age.  It's every 40,000 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm not real stoked about the whole rising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As is that water going?  It's good for surfing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. No, it's not, actually.  It's going to change all the breaks.  You got you got time. You got time.  I mean, but one of the things Will brings up,  though, is a pretty good point is if you have, you know, it's it's it's good.  I think fighting against, you know, air pollution is an outstanding thing.  I agree. I agree.  And, you know, I think catalytic converters are a miracle  with the amount of crud they basically keep from entering into the atmosphere.  And on the flip side, you have large numbers of companies  who may in some cases be signatories to the Kyoto treaties,  who dump unbelievable amounts of crap directly into the atmosphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True. Although, you know, it's funny.  Look, and I'm not one of those guys who says, oh, global warnings, false science.  No, obviously, we got to pay attention to this.  But there's not all bad news, for instance.  You know, one of the bigger issues, which is the hole in the ozone layer,  because that, frankly, is not a natural phenomenon.  It's caused by chlorofluorocarbons. It's actually shrinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, that's really good, which is a direct result of the sort of  the regulation that was put through to ban CFCs.  And I mean, that is pretty freaking awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, I don't know what I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just. All right. OK. How about this?  I guess I just say go watch the film. Is Quick Throw recycling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we're for recycling.  For reuse whenever possible? Yes, we are.  We are for intelligent consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we are. OK. That's a word.  I just love that phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun to toss out. But keep buying those computers, kids. OK?  Every two years, whether you need one or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how about at least buying green computers and making sure they're  properly recycled or reused at the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you listen to the jokes on this show enough, you'd know we're in favor of reuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in my case, just using the machines until hell freezes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  There we go. Right there.  There's one right there.  John is not here.  And the reason he's not here is because his son,  J.C., is celebrating his 21st birthday today.  So we say a happy birthday to J.C.  We we're going to have a stand in curmudgeon Jerry Purnell wanted to be on.  But but I guess he couldn't get the tubes working because I don't see him online.  So who wants to be who wants to be the curmudgeon of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will volunteers.  We should get off my lawn.  You do a very good American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I suppose that's all he has.  That's all I have to say.  I'll take that as a compliment, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disney's Eiger says that the new Apple unit has a small hard drive.  I don't know. It sounds like an insult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's talking about ITV. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't think it had a hard drive.  But but Robert Eiger, who ought to know, because he's the CEO of Disney, says  that, in fact, there is a small hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this this is really interesting because there seem to be two  really different schools of thought about what the ITV actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jobs left it left it up in the air, I guess, because there was there was another thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which was could could you see Intel processes, sort of core process or whatever  in the new ITV?  And I thought it was going to be five.  Well, my no, my understanding is that is just literally a box which  streams and so all the processing is done on your  iMac or whatever.  It goes straight across and then goes into TV.  It's like an airport express.  But the video. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what little information they've released.  Sounds like it sounds like a slim devices or slim B3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the thing from from Eiger and a couple of other reports that have turned up on  CNN things seem to say that it's it's more like a Mac mini, like a Vive  room theater PC that can store its own content and the and physically decode stuff  off its own hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no truth to the rumor that will back up your Windows  Media Player 11 licenses that don't don't count on that.  The Zune is going to be cheap.  Did you see the price for the Zune?  Walmart accidentally posted it and then it went back down and then  Walmart said 284.  But I think it's even lower than that, actually.  I've seen people say, no, it's only 225.  Yeah, 230.  I wouldn't be what was them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was quite interesting to see that J Allard, which who's the guy  that's in charge of the Zune project.  He was saying that we made sure that it plays MPEG for because that's a really  popular way that people like to rip their DVDs to.  He said that he said it.  And everyone just went home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their home DVDs that they made themselves.  That's right. Yeah, it's a ticket.  Well, it should support Divx then, because that really is the format people use,  isn't it?  What do you read?  You wouldn't know, Leo.  What do you rip your home DVDs to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can rip whatever DVDs I like.  I live in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, are you allowed to?  You don't have a DMCA over there?  No, it's sweet freedom.  You better not travel to the US, though, will bust your ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's merely violating whatever, you know, copyright law might be in place.  He's not, in addition, violating federal federal statutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on reverse engineering, copy protection.  I'm glad to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's some this.  Go ahead. And it's OK.  It's OK. It's actually OK under the DMC.  It's OK to reverse engineer.  You just can't tell anybody what you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You got to keep it a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't publish it.  I was saying that ITV is probably going to be a really, really, really big deal.  I mean, you know, they've already got, you know, there are  apples already fighting all these certain terms that surround podcasting.  That's even independent. I mean, they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's going to be the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've got their movies out there.  They just put up, you know, iTunes seven.  It's got high resolution stuff.  And obviously everything that they're going to make it.  So everything that you purchase, everything you purchase through the iTunes store.  It's not like music store anymore.  You're going to pop it onto your HDTV or pop it on your TV using the ITV, probably.  In the same speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've only got one of the they've only got one of the movie studios on board.  Yeah. The effectively job owns a significant share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the same speech, though,  Iger pointed out that they've sold a million dollars worth of movies,  one hundred twenty five thousand movies in one week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much audio they sold in the same space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not comparable.  I bought I bought some TV service.  I bought some of the new.  I wanted to see how the 640 by 480 looks.  I bought some new TV shows and I bought a movie.  The life of Zissou, whatever that Bill Murray was like aquatic with Steve Zissou.  And the movie does not look as good because it is wide screen.  So you don't get a full 480 lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're overcharging for the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are. Which it was 14, 15 bucks, which is ridiculous.  I would, you know, I could about the DVD for that.  On the other hand, it take to download.  Well, I think their servers are jammed because it wouldn't download  for like half a day.  And then all of a sudden it comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, but the the other the other services have never had that.  They usually can they usually can start streaming the movie, the Windows based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, and iTunes will stream.  I to day or at least Jobs said would stream.  I didn't actually try that.  The TV shows looked good.  The TV shows, because they're four by three.  They get the full 480 lines.  And I thought they looked quite good.  Now, I've been playing them back on a big screen on my 30 inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the full 360 lines, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's 640 by 480.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should all be 400. OK, it's 480p.  So there's 60. OK, so there's 640 wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, 640 wide, 480 tall, and it's progressive.  And so that I mean, look, there's a lot of compression, too.  So it's not merely how many lines is how compressed it is.  And it's heavily compressed.  But they look OK. I don't I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you watching them on an HDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm watching them on the 30 inch LCD screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's a pretty big screen to scale that video up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's what I'm saying.  I mean, I think that's challenging.  Yes, TV. Yeah, I think they look fine on a standard TV  and they look fine on an enhanced TV, I think.  They look great in an iPod.  Well, yeah, of course, on a two inch screen, they look fantastic.  Fantastic. But it is noted.  I'll tell you this, because I have lost season one,  which was at the old 320 by 240 and I've lost season two,  which is at the 640 by 480.  It does look a lot better.  Well, you'd expect it to. It's twice as big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they're going to release Lost on Blu Ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then I'll have to buy it all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it's going to be Blu Ray.  Did you hear that?  I guess maybe engineers that work for Warner Brothers  are looking at making a disc that since the Blu Ray and HDDVD  are burnt in different layers on being able to maybe make a disc

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that has both dual format disc, actually triple format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But D on it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  But will anybody do it?  I mean, we've talked about this before with the Dvorak,  didn't they say that there's some limitation,  the studios may not have the options of doing it both ways?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they're cutting cutting private deals with production companies.  Right, right, right. Movie houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So looking at this Life Aquatic with Steve Zizou,  it's a two hour movie, one point three two gigabytes.  It's quite low.  Yeah, it's MPEG four, 128 kilobit bit rate,  low complexity. I guess that's the audio.  Encoding Fairplay version two,  total bit rate one five eight nine kilobits.  That's pretty good.  Fifteen eighty nine kilobits is a pretty high quality, isn't it?  It's not bad. You're the video guru.  You do more encoding than the rest of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Prager is catching up.  The the it's interesting.  I mean, like a typical typical hour and a half feature on Cinema  now would be about two point three gigabytes.  Oh, it's a lot bigger.  It's a lot bigger.  And those those those scale OK on like a fourteen hundred  like a 16 by 12 notebook screen.  Not great, but they do all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's about what I'd say. This is not great, but watchable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it's certainly more watchable than VHS.  But you're also what's the resolution on that 30 inch screen?  It's something insane, like twenty five sixty.  Twenty five sixty by sixteen hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a ten. It could do 1080p.  It's a little you know, I'm looking at it's a little blurry.  I'm watching it right now.  It's it's you know, it could be it could be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also tough because, you know, you have to literally compare  against a DVD of the same content.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  The same range being upscaled on the same monitor. Right.  Because I've seen some people call it a little short when they go,  this video is crap.  And you make them play a DVD scaled up to the same thing on their system.  And it's also crap. That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  I'll tell you, though, I have seen HD DVD and Blu-rays,  as I know Robert Heron has on the on these big 1080p or larger monitors.  And they look fantastic.  I mean, they are larger than 1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Better than Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it you like it better?  Well, to be honest with you, in either one of them should be equal  in terms of the video they can deliver.  However, the first few titles we've seen in Blu-ray, for the most part,  was not using the transfers were not coming from the best quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bad transfers. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're looking at something and you're seeing scratches and specks  and dust and other things that have been encoded into the film,  in the transfer, it's kind of depressing  because you really notice it on a 65 inch, you know, 1080p screen.  Neither one of them is really generating out true  1080p video, 1080i only out of the Toshiba boxes.  And the 1080p that's coming out of the Sony's are essentially using  from the Sony's it's being done, is basically being upscaled in the Sony box.  So if you have a bad upscaling processor in your TV,  the 1080p out of the Sony may look a little better  than feeding the 1080i into it and upscaling it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, look who just walked in. My realtor just walked in.  George Crowe, his former producer, Call for Help, is now making millions  in real estate. Is that a chocolate or LG chocolate you have in your hand there?  Samsung. OK, I always thought you were doing better than you are.  Oh, no, that's cool. It looks like the chocolate. Yeah.  He spray painted it.  He spray painted the chocolate colored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So talking of 1080p and Sony, did you see all the stuff  that came out of Tokyo Game Show this week? No. What happened?  Well, Microsoft announced that it's going to allow the Xbox 360  to put out true 1080p, which is something previously  Sony claimed would be exclusive to the PlayStation 3.  So that's another bullet point knocked off.  Sony said it was going to put HDMI on  all the on both versions of the PlayStation 3, which the Xbox does not have.  Amazingly, they said, well, we made the decision  in recent months because when we revealed the PlayStation 3 E3,  there weren't any HDTVs in the market with HDMI.  But now there are. So we're going to put HDMI on.  Yeah, there are. Yeah.  We suddenly discovered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they did say they're dropping the price in Japan down to just over $400,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is a significant not in the US, just in Japan, just in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll fly to Japan, pick one up and come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that region free?  You have to import games in Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, I'll have to go back and get the games

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and learn Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's all right. I'll save 200 bucks.  We're going to need a bigger language tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, the guys that one up interviewed them and said, no, actually,  it's it's it's only going to be in Japan.  No price cut anywhere else. Really?  And the the Sony press conference was described by by joystick  as a train wreck.  Yeah, I believe that. Which was really interesting.  They said, you know, everybody wanted firm details on the software,  firm details on the online capability, firm details on real launch plans.  And all they got were more regurgitation of nuances of hardware.  So that was a bit disappointing, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's something they've always been like, you know, it's  it's just trying to argue why it's such a technically superior platform.  And no one should ever consider gaming anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I thought also very interesting was that Xbox 360  is going to have an HD DVD player for a mere 200 bucks in time for Christmas.  Now, that's going to be a nice add on.  Yes. Which would you which would you choose?  Would you buy a PS3?  Well, let's say the PS3 really was 400 bucks.  Would you buy a PS3 or would you buy an HD DVD player for your Xbox 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I just want the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want a Wii, too.  Mostly because I like to sing like saying, we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, the Wii is like, you know,  could night out at a serious restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. It's cheap.  So all right.  I had a curiosity. Let's I mean, I don't think it does.  Anybody here have an Xbox 360?  Nobody's committed. You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I do. I have a 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you've committed, but you'll get them all probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I won't bother with PlayStation 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You won't. Why not?  You don't like Zelda. What's wrong with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Zelda is on the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nintendo. Oh, OK.  I don't know. I'm trying to sound cool. Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the only game that's on the PS3  that I remotely care about is Metal Gear Solid.  And that's not going to come out until the end of 2007, beginning of 2008,  by which point it will, you know, the PS3 should be substantially cheaper.  I know. I've got my 360 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about Final Fantasy? Don't you want to play?  That's the one I was thinking of. Final Fantasy.  Did you want to play that?  I can give him monkeys.  All right. Final Fantasy 25.  You don't you don't want to play that. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I played the first 24 and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say, the Wii sounds intriguing.  The I like my old Xbox.  I suppose I would I would want to upgrade.  And I think if you're going to buy an HD DVD,  seems like it'd be sensible to buy the Xbox 360 and HD DVD for not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're saying that the that the bun that if you buy it,  if you buy the two together, the bundle will be cheaper.  The HD DVD will work out of 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but also HD HD.  There will be less expensive HD DVD players by then.  Debuting this.  You think by Christmas time for the for the shopping season,  you think you think so by Christmas? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a you're going on the record predicting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, that's a good phrase for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Norton says there will be by Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have I have been told by sources smarter and better informed than I  that there should be next, you know, sort of the the there should be less expensive,  at least pricing, if not units.  And that sure blame smarter people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And while you like, I'm the one who's saying it, I'm going to get the email from hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blame blame the smarter people. They said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's what's what's interesting is a talk I had recently.  They said, look, the next generation of the HD DVD players  are going to move away from the gigantic 40 pound Linux box.  You know, it's a pricey Linux box.  And it's going to be more of a piece of consumer electronics equipment  and less of a of a, you know, a highly customized Linux machine.  I'm sure it'll still be running Linux.  Yeah, that makes sense.  It debated me on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the prototypes would be really more of a clue.  And now they can kind of put it all in an LSI and then.  And yeah, that makes sense.  So, Patrick, Tuesday on DLTV, we're going to show you how to fix your windows.  Yes, that's exciting.  IDF is coming up Wednesday.  Will Harris will have, I'm sure, reviews on Bit-Tech.net, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Do we expect anything new?  I mean, it has an Intel blown there.  I mean, how could they have any new things to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're going to talk about their actual plans  for bringing out quad core gaming processors for Christmas.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're going to have quad core gaming processors for Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, they're going to be there.  They're going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What game will use a quad core processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not about whether or not a game will use it.  It's about having it before your neighbor does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about the fact that you can run four games simultaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, and then I get it.  Now you need to quad SLI so that each one has its own video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they'll they're also going to talk about,  I think what they're calling the era of terror,  which is not like Afghanistan and Iraq.  It's like terabytes and terror, lots of different things.  And there are rumors that they're going to be showing off  the first working prototype of an 80 core processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  I wonder if I could drop that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if that'll be pin compatible with my Mac Pro.  I'd love to drop it.  I'm sure it will.  Love to drop that in.
