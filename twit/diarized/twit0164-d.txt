This is Tweet This Week in Tech and a great panel to get today.  Kind of a different panel.  One newbie and I'll introduce him first.  Scott Rosenberg has never been with us before.  Former print journalist who left the print world to help co-found Salon.  Gosh, almost more than 10 years ago now, Scott.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's got to 12, 1995, however.  How many years is that?  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't count.  Crazy.  And Salon's still going strong.  It's really become a resource during the election year of great information.  And now is working on a book.  He wrote Dreaming in Code, which is a great book.  And now working on a new one about the story of blogging from beginning to end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we don't actually know where the end is.  So from beginning till the present and wherever we are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting job to tackle, I would imagine.  It's kind of an amorphous subject, as I'm sure you find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It starts out somewhat manageably because, of course, you start with a handful of people  and then over time it explodes and becomes this kind of, you know, the tidal wave of  stuff.  And at that point, you know, you really have to be very selective and say, what are some  key events?  What are some key people?  And what does it all mean really?  It becomes less about what happened and more about, you know, how did all this stuff change  the way we live and the way we use the web and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is, again, the election.  It's huge.  Harry McCracken is also here.  Is that you, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was.  I was wondering if Scott is even attempting to determine who the first blogger was, given  that I'm not sure if anybody knows for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, it seems like there are so many claimants to it and that it kind of goes  back at this point.  The easy way out of that is to just say that the first website that Tim Berners-Lee set  up had a reverse chronological list of new websites.  There you go.  And that, you know, you can say that.  That kind of preempts all the other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, so that's Harry McCracken of Technologizer, another print fugitive, although a little  more recent, former editor in chief at a PC World magazine.  Technologizer is his new, dare I say, blog, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep wavering back and forth on whether I claim I am a blogger or I'm not.  I mean, ultimately, it's all just about whether the content is worth reading.  But I am in reverse chronological order.  And I guess if that's the definition of blogging, then I am one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a problem.  I don't know what a blog is anymore.  I mean, they're all just websites.  But Technologizer, the last time we talked, Harry, you hadn't launched it yet, has now  launched a smarter take on tech and great stuff, great information.  Yeah, I'm really enjoying it.  I think it's right on.  I hope you do well with it because it's a very useful site and really, you know, good  reading, which is probably the most important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things are going well.  And the best part about doing it is I actually get to do the stuff I got into this business  before, which is to touch stuff and use products and to write about them and to start a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  That's the fun stuff.  Also with us, Tom Merritt, who is no stranger to Twitter from Buzz Out Loud.  Tom, you're not a fugitive from anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try not to be, mostly because I'm not a member of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing to flee.  I have to then flee from.  There's nothing to flee.  But you have done print.  You've done television.  You've done web.  And now you're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have done GeoCities homepages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing to be proud of.  Angel fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done Blink text.  I've done tripod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The top story of the week, I guess, is going to be a story that really breaks on Tuesday.  Apple did, in fact, send out the email on Tuesday, as it is want to do, saying come  to our event on October, what is it going to be, the 14th?  And it said the spotlight is on notebooks.  So clearly this is going to be the announcement of the MacBooks.  I know, Harry, you've written a little bit about it.  In fact, you've even got a great post saying let's build an $800 MacBooks.  And so that's one of the rumors is that there'll be one that cheap.  Tom, what do you think Apple's going to announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For once, they took all the wind out of our sails, right?  Put notebooks right there in the invitation.  And then they said, well, put the spotlight on notebooks.  And so then we caught ourselves going like, well, what does that mean?  Is it talking about search?  You know, you should get over parsed these things.  I think I come out with a with a refresh line of notebooks.  You know, we'll see a new MacBook Pro, a new MacBook.  It's been a while since they really totally revitalized that line.  The $800 notebook rumor sounds reasonable to me that in these economic times, they  might try to like put out a midway point between like a cheap notebook and a MacBook.  The MacBook Air is they're portable, but it's way too expensive.  So maybe it's more of an an ACES EPC competitor.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This time around, I think the rumor sites have been very active and and probably accurate as well.  They say three new MacBooks, one of them might be that inexpensive $800 MacBook, two MacBook  Pros, one of them or maybe both might be the one carved out of a solid brick of aluminum,  which might as well be solid gold for all the cost of that'll be.  And then two new MacBook Airs.  Terry, is it possible that they're making a brick?  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wish I knew enough about manufacturing processes to have something smart to say.  I've seen some people who do know about manufacturing saying that actually the brick is not a  particularly innovative idea.  And some of those things are happening already.  I do know that we know that Steve Jobs hates seams and imperfections.  And then he's for many, many years, decades, even, he's been trying to build computers  that look like they're carved out of a solid brick of something.  So I think the idea would be appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'd like to not have any buttons from what some things I've read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No screen, just a solid piece of aluminum that somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, he once he once said that the bottoms of Mac laptops look better than the tops  of everybody else's computers, which is true.  They even care about how the battery fits in and whether there are any seams there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I think it's exactly the kind of thing his ego would fall for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I don't envy anyone having to unveil a new product line in the face of the current  news, you know, to say, hey, here are a bunch of laptops and some of them are going to be  expensive. And, oh, by the way, you know, have you looked at the Dow today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. How do you say here's a thirty one hundred dollar notebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enjoy. Although you have to remember that the original iPod was announced right after  nine eleven. That's right.  Far lower low point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, maybe the timing of that was good because it gave us something else to  think about. Well, and he's not well, we don't know yet, but we're not expecting anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crazy new. I know there was the Calcans interview on CNET UK where he told Nate Langston  that they have an HDTV in the works that would have an Apple TV built in.  That's completely credible, don't you think? I don't think you'll announce it this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you'll see that announcement right now because that because that this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bad time to hit a whole new product line. But but refreshing the MacBook line, you kind  of have to do that. It's the right time to do it.  Actually, a little earlier this year might have been even better, but it's the kind of  announcement that if you're going to hear one, I would guess I would expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Harry, was it possible to build an 800 MacBook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's entirely possible. I mean, the the current MacBook, which sells for eleven  hundred dollars, has been around for about two and a half years.  And today's eight hundred dollar computer is what an eleven hundred dollar computer was back then.  So my guess would be you'll see an eight hundred dollar one, which is is roughly comparable  to the current MacBook, which will open up room in the line for a new aluminum MacBook, which is  maybe eleven or twelve hundred dollars plus a revise of the MacBook Pro, which is actually a  design which is very comparable to what power books were like in terms of the industrial  design five years ago. Right.  And then maybe a modest update of the MacBook Air. Nothing radically different but a new CPU.  And I do think that Apple there's always a delta between PCs and Macs in terms of how much RAM and  hard drive size and so forth you get a certain price point that delta has gotten wider lately.  And I think that if all they do is give people a little more RAM and a little more hard drive  space at each price point, it will help. And that would in fact be a message which is kind of  consistent with economic challenges. If Macs start to sound like better bargains than they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are right now. Isn't it amazing, Scott, how Apple how much attention Apple is able to kind of garner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from these? I mean, it's just a notebook. Really? It seems like, you know, Steve Jobs is maybe the  only person. He certainly gets more attention than President Bush at this point. I mean,  President Bush, you know, he's got a press conference. He has an address to the nation  at this point and no one cares. You know, the, I guess, you know, in a sense, Steve is sort of  an opportunity at this point to just focus the mind on something that, you know, people care,  you know, people, they have a passion for Apple, they have a passion for the product and they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have to think about this painful reality. We've seen a lot of leaked pictures so far. I don't know  how, you know, their provenance or how accurate they are, but we've seen a lot of leaked pictures  of these and there's some speculation on some sides that maybe because of the position of the  ports on these parts, the movement from the front to the side of the CD-ROM that maybe  this will be a dockable Macbook. I'm sure Tom Merritt, all the crazies who write to Buzz  Out Loud have proposed this, right? They certainly have the crazies who visit my chat room have  proposed that you might, they might make a screen that looks like an iMac but has no guts that you  slide, this doesn't seem on the face of it very credible to be honest with you, that you slide  the Macbook into like a toaster and then suddenly you've got a desktop. Apple tried this before  with the Duo. I don't know if this is really a... Yeah, I've heard the dock rumors, I've heard the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tablet rumors, those are kind of the two far out there but at least in the ballpark of a notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not a Netbook? Aren't the Netbooks the hottest things out there right now? You've got that new  Lenovo, you've got the amazing Asus S101, you've got the Dell, everybody's doing these little two  pound simple... and it seems like that's Apple's territory. Yeah, I think, well that's why I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's what the $800 computer will be, it'll be their Netbook. But it's twice as much as the other  guys. Well then there you go, it fits the pattern. Maybe you're right. So you think it'll be a  Netbook? Yeah, I do. I think the $800 one will be sort of a... well we have the Macbook Air as our  Netbook but you know, but for some people it's too expensive and it's too limited and so we know you  want ports and we know sometimes you want a CD-ROM drive in there so we've got this new whatever they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  call it at the $800 price point. Yeah. Any surprises you think at all on Tuesday? Somebody in our chat  room, and I thought it was a great rumor and I'd almost like to upload it to CNN's iReport,  somebody in the chat room said Steve Jobs will announce his retirement and future plans for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple on Tuesday. I suspect when that day comes he's not going to do it in front of a room of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  reporters most likely. You think? After announcing Netbooks, no. After announcing Netbooks, right? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one more thing, I'm out of here. That's the one more thing. I'm gone. After what Scott was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying is people may pay more attention to Apple than President Bush, maybe he'll announce a run

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the presidency. Yeah, I would put it past Steve, it's the kind of thing he might consider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's combine those rumors. He would have to reveal his full health records though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yes. Yeah, done. No, you're right. He could get that doctor who checked out McCain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. The guy who just said... And McCain actually hasn't revealed his full health records,  so you can do it. Yeah, you can get away with it. A couple rumor sites lately have gotten to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  better about actually figuring out almost everything a little early. I think it's  probably the last time that anything was strikingly new and unreported were the details about the iPhone,  which was almost two years ago, and even then everybody knew there would be an iPhone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they did manage to keep specifying. But don't you think that gets under Steve's skin  and that he will find ways to... He'll just do something to spite those sites. He'll find things,  if not this time, next time, sooner or later, he's going to stick it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love to think so. I mean, you kind of wonder whether at some point Apple might release false  rumors just to get people excited about the wrong thing. Yeah. I'm not sure he hasn't... Or Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hasn't done that already here or there, because around the time of the iPhone, there were some  pretty cool looking pictures that got out, and then there were some fake stuff, and it was hard  to tell truth from rumor. And it ended up that there were so many rumors that even if some of  them were true, it was hard to tell which ones had been right. Nicholas Ciarelli, the guy who started

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ThinkSecret and was hounded out of business by Apple and Apple's lawyers, a couple of weeks ago  did a survey of Mac rumor sites. And he said, the consensus is that no, Apple hasn't been fighting  leaks this year. He said, nobody's received a letter from Apple. Nobody's gotten in trouble.  There's no doubt he says that Apple has changed. He says, Jeremy Horowitz, editor in chief of iLounge,  told me in an email, probably due to the awful PR its prior lawsuits generated, and because  cease and desist letters only confirm links, Apple has wisely stopped going after the people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who generate its buzz. That would be a real change. Maybe that part of the campus that had the fire was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the department that went after rumors. That's where the lawyers were. Oh, we don't have a desk. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, that's enough of that. Forget it. Let the rumors fly. Yeah. It's certainly true that when

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple tells you to take down photos you've put up on your rumor site, that is the closest thing  to an absolute confirmation. So it's probably self-defeating. Apple's got so much mileage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  though, out of this secrecy, this penchant for secrecy. It really has amped up the interest in  what they're going to announce. But I think we're finding it's a little hard for us to even whip up  any excitement over this. So we'll just leave the matter and wait till Tuesday. We'll be covering  it live. I'm going to go down there with a camera crew of one and we'll cover it. And usually when  they do these events at One Infinite Loop, they have a little demo room next door that you can go  to. That's the last few times they've done that and see the products. I'm hoping they'll do that  and if they can, we'll stream a live video of that. What is the quality of announcement of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One Infinite Loop versus a Moscone Center? Well, isn't that interesting? Moscone Center,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that was the last one, was to the big iPod announcement. Although the original iPod

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  announcement was at One Infinite Loop. And the last One Infinite Loop that I can remember,  and I think I might be missing one though, was the Hi-Fi. Yeah, that was stupid. And the sock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An Apple iPod case that was really just a sock. They came in colors. That was the silliest  announcement ever. But that was one where you did it. In fact, remember they really were elaborate.  They had different rooms of the house, like a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen  and a student's room with bunk beds and each one would have the Apple Hi-Fi in it.  It was really silly. I don't know if they'll do that this time, but it is true that they're  not going to go up to Moscone. They're going to do it at this much smaller venue.  So Richard Garriott, he's Lord British, right? Yeah. He's in space right now as we speak.  Without a toilet.  There's no toilet. On Sunday, about three in the morning, he was blasted off in a Soyuz TMA-13  capsule, which by the way shows amazing bravery to go up in a Soviet era rocket. Alongside U.S.  astronaut Michael Fink and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Lankakov, they will circle the Earth a few times  before docking with the International Space Station. He will at that time conduct, this is  according to Gizmodo, a series of experiments. I don't know what, but they say they will probably  not include level grinding. Although level grinding in space might produce a smoother,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  finer character in the long run. How does Tabula Rasa work in space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Apparently that $19 million toilet isn't really working.  I bet the latency up there is horrible too. He's a space tourist, right? How much does it cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to do this? Like a million bucks? I think it's more like $20 million. I interviewed Charles  Simone because he did this too, you know, from Microsoft. He's going a second time, he liked it  so much. And I'm pretty sure the figure was somewhere, something like $20-24 million. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not cheap. I guess there's more money in role-playing adventures than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to AFP, $30 million. Whoa! So it's gone up since Simone. Inflation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, space tourism. Richard Garriott's dad was an astronaut. Oh really?  So maybe he was able to wrangle a discount of some sort. Oh, I didn't know that. So he's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he wanted to do what his dad had done. That's kind of neat. That's the ultimate adventure. Do  you think he'll write maybe a sci-fi adventure based on space? I think that's pretty cool. One

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of ours is up there. His dad went up on Skylab back in 1973. I didn't know that. Was his name

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Garriott also? Owen Garriott. Owen Garriott. I'll be darned. So he's essentially donating money to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the development of the space program. Good for him. Somebody's got to do it. Some people complain  like, oh, he could be doing so much more with this money than just wasting it on a trip into space.  But they're essentially letting him do it to fund the continuation of their program. That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And 30 million probably isn't much. It's probably, you know, one tank of fuel.  So the new Google sat, which is not, the GOI-1 is up and we're seeing the first image from it,  a bird's eye view of Cuttsdown University in Pennsylvania. It is the world's highest  resolution commercial satellite. Google, among other users for its Google Maps. Boy,  the picture looks amazing. It is really crystal clear. Looks like an aerial photo from a plane.  Well, yeah. What's that guy reading there? It looks like the onion actually. I can't quite tell.  GOI-1 has a big Google sticker on it, but actually its main customer is the National Geospatial  Intelligence Agency. So it is kind of a national security satellite. But Google is going to buy  the images from it. It'll be part of Google Maps. I think they have exclusive rights to them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Commercial rights, non-spy rights. Yeah, they get any of the 50 centimeter images and then I think  it can do as good as 41 centimeter, but those are off limits for public use. What is that when they  say centimeters? Does that mean the resolution? Each pixel, I just learned this from a Buzz Out  Loud listener this week. Each pixel represents 41 centimeters in 41 centimeter resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, 41 centimeters, that's two feet, right? Something like that. 41 centimeters. Something  close. Yeah. 100 centimeters. You couldn't read a newspaper. You might be able to read a license  plate. You could read a billboard. The main thing is they just look, the image really looks nice.  I mean, it's just, it looks crisper. It's like they have better lenses or something on that thing.  Google's 10th anniversary was last month and their Google phone is coming out in a week.  They're really becoming almost an extra national institution with their own spy satellite.  Seriously, an NGO. They're an NGO. They're really, I don't know, does that bother anybody?  Scott Rosenberg, do you have your eye on Google while it has its eye on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should all, it behooves all of us to be a little cautious, a little concerned.  The motto, don't be evil, has all of this kind of, it makes people feel good. People love Google  because the homepage is clean and they don't throw lousy pop-up ads in your face. They've got all  this goodwill, but all the goodwill in the world doesn't really matter when someone has a huge  amount of power and you don't have any transparency on it. Google remains an incredibly closed  institution. All the people who have beefs with their advertising system, it's really hard to  deal with them. Google is all set up to have machines talk to machines and that works great  for them, but it's not a very sort of people talking to people kind of a company. So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  caution is definitely called for. Witness the flap we had over getting their privacy policy  linked from the front page. They seem above the law. We don't have to do that even though the  state of California says so. And then they finally begrudgingly figured out how to drop one word to  another page so they could make room for the privacy word and link that right next to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  copyrights. Well, at least they're not listening in on our phone sex. They're leaving that to the NSA.  Not yet. Maybe they are. We just don't know about it. It'll allow you to search it. They just don't  listen. A Navy linguist, David Murphy Falk, Intercept operator, said that Intercept operators  shared a number of titillating conversations while eavesdropping at the NSA on phone calls made by  US military personnel. He told ABC there's good phone sex or there's some pillow talk.  Pull it up. It's really funny. Now this isn't the inquirer. But it's from it's actually from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the anecdote is from the new book by James Bamford, who is the world's greatest expert on the NSA. His  first book was called The Puzzle Palace. It came out like 20, 30 years ago. And basically it revealed  the you know it exposed the NSA to the world. And he is an amazing writer and researcher. I haven't  read the book yet. His new book is called The Shadow Factory. And this detail is from it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  although the inquirer did not mention that. No, no. Although in the Senate, chairman of the  Senate Intelligence Committee says he's going to investigate these allegations. So they took it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  seriously. But it should be I think given that Bamford is the source, it should be taken seriously.  And I am not you know, I can't say having read his first book that I'm surprised. Yeah, it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  least surprising thing in the world. It would have been amazing if stuff like this didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the flippancy of the quote that really gets you. I mean, Folk says there's good phone sex or  there's some pillow talk. Pull it up. It's really funny. It's good. Shadow Factory comes out next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  week, by the way. So that might end up being our audible pick when that comes out on audio. I'd love  to listen to that. I mean, listening to Legacy of Ashes right now. And it's just it's really kind of  mind boggling to hear what these government agencies are doing in the name of security.  But of course, they're doing that. You get some young guys. I don't care if they have a security  clearance. They're going to do that. There's something hot going on. Hail is this. You won't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  believe it. No harm, right? You know, you just listen it in for a little bit of fun. It's a  little creepy. It's real. It's the kind of thing you assume goes on logically. But then somewhere  in the back of your mind, you're like, oh, but it can't be really. Yeah. But yeah, yeah, it really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does. It is. It's why you need courts to have some kind of oversight over this stuff and why that,  you know, that battle is still really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The FISA court or somebody, though, because you got to keep it secret still, right? You can't  let everybody know what the NSA is up to or it loses some of its potency.  Fine. But at least the FISA.  At least FISA. Yeah. We're going to take a little break. As long as I mentioned Audible,  I want to actually talk about some new book that Audible is allowing you guys to download free.  It is a special exclusive to twit listeners. And I am really excited. I've been listening to it all  week secretly. It's called Metatropolis. Let me tell you a little about audible.com first. Audible  is of course the premier source of audio recordings, books, lectures, debates, speeches. I love Audible,  51,000 titles and counting. And now they're doing a lot of exclusive stuff. This is the new  sci-fi book that Audible commissioned. It's called Metatropolis. I love the idea. They took  five of the top sci-fi authors in the world, Jay Lake, Michael Hogan, Tobias Buckel, and actually  those are the narrators. I'm sorry. I'm giving you the guys. The authors are John Scalzi who  edited the piece as well, Elizabeth Bair, Jay Lake, Tobias Buckel, Carl Schroeder. And the idea was  all these guys got together first, and gals, got together first to create a new world, a kind of a  dystopia in the near future called Metatropolis, a world where the big cities are dying or  transformed. And the suburbs are now the treacherous wilds. It's actually a really timely  book. I'm reading the first, and then they wrote five novellas around this world. So they're not  collaborating. They only collaborated in the creation of the world. And then they said, okay,  now go out and write a novella on it. And they went out and they got narrators from  Battlestar Galactica to read it. And I'm reading the first one. We're going to give it to you free.  Saul Teig of Battlestar Galactica, Michael Hogan reads the first one in The Forest of the Night,  written by Jay Lake. I'm going to play a little bit of it for you. It is so good. I invite you to go  to our special URL, audible.com slash twitmeta, T-W-I-T-M-E-T-A, and you're going to be able to  download the first story absolutely free. You don't have to have a credit card, no geographic  restrictions. We listened to you, and I know some people were upset that some of the books we talk  about aren't available worldwide. This is available worldwide. Whether you're an existing customer,  a new customer, or no customer at all, all you need to do is submit your email address and create  a password, no credit card. So you're going to go to audible.com slash twitmeta. And I'm going to  play a little bit of Saul Teig reading this. I tell you, I'm loving this book. You're going to  like it, Tom. It might be something for a sword and laser. I don't think there's a print version  of it. I think it's only for audible.com. It's exclusive. Let me see if I can find the  this is from the first story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice, but inaccurate. Tiger arrived the way almost everyone comes to Cascadiopolis,  either by accident, by judicial design, or by following the damp silences between the trees  higher and higher until there was nowhere left to go. Cascadiopolis is in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pacific Northwest. It's a green community created by, I just love it. Just follow the damp silences

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  till you see the open spaces. Take a right. They'll be there. Michael Hogan's reading that one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Colonel Saul Teig. Candice McClure, Officer Anastasia D. Duala on Battlestar Galactica also reads  one. Stefan Rynicki and Scott Brick, two of their best narrators from audible. And Alessandro Giuliani,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who is Lieutenant Felix Gaeda. That was really kind of distracting actually to hear Colonel Teig.  It's a little, you know what? He is good. The old man wouldn't put up with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's really good on this book. You've got, look, just take my word for it.  Twitmeta is the keyword. So go to audible.com slash twitmeta and download it. And I think you'll get  hooked. And I'm not sure how soon the full book is available. You could pre-order it now,  but you will be able to hear the first novella from it. Jay Lake wrote this. I have not read  any Jay Lake stories and I'm going to read more. He is really good. And by the way, it's political.  There's, there's, it really is timely. It's really kind of the aftermath of the great,  you know, economic upheaval and destruction of the American economy. I just loved it.  October 21st, the book comes out. So you're going to get a preview. Oh, this is exclusive by the  way. We're not promoting this anywhere else. Audible is not promoting it anywhere else.  They want to see if there's anybody listening audible.com slash twitmeta. If the site hasn't  gone down, go there right now. Cause I think there are a few people listening. It is really good.  And we thank audible for their support of this week in tech. So maybe the NSA would get them to  stop listening to the phone calls and start listening to more audio books. Court has banned  the sales of real DVD. This is a real networks attempt to make a DVD ripping program that was  legal. Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, remember her from Napster, has ruled that a temporary restraining  order blocking sales of the software will stay placed indefinitely until she figures out whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it violates the DMCA. This story just kills me. Right now you can go to download.com or freaking  Google search for DVD ripping software. You'll find hundreds of titles. There's a great one called  Mac drive-in that does exactly the same thing, but that's fine. We can allow those. But this  is real networks and they better not do that. And when real networks comes and tries to do it with  added protection and efforts to try to get licensing and cooperate, then they get slammed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  down and thrown into court. Is it because the movie industry has to do this? No. Well, if they had to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do it, why wouldn't they do it with all these other programs? Because they're often they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  off offshore. They can't find these guys. Yeah. They're not companies that are legal targets the  way a real company, pardon the pun, like real is, you know. And real tried to play the game by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  law. And I think it's real, real shame. No pun intended. They went, didn't Rob Glazier go to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  movie industry and say, we're going to make this work. And what do you think? And they even have  their hope was that Hollywood would say maybe we can sell, you know, if somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  rips their copy of the Godfather part one, maybe we can sell them part two and part three through  real DVD. But the real ended up suing Hollywood preemptively the day the software came out. And  then Hollywood sued them later. That's the same day. And I think it's kind of a shame because  this is actually I think it's a pretty good product, but it's also a product which is  inherently crippled to please Hollywood. Once you've burned, once you've ripped a movie onto  a hard drive, you cannot move that to another hard drive. You can't put these things on your  home network, let alone on BitTorrent. And even that wasn't enough to satisfy Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the point of this is that people want to get their DVDs on their computer so they can fly  somewhere so that they can, it's just more convenient. Hollywood said, well, the problem  with this is you could rent a movie, rip it, and then bring the movie back. Can they do that, Harry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could do that. Yeah. I mean, there would be nothing preventing you from doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess that's a loophole. I could understand. They may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a loophole. But if you know, if you, if you fix every loophole, if you wait until every loophole  has been eradicated, then nothing will ever happen. And you would think that Hollywood  would want all these people and all these DVDs to jump into the digital age a little more quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why doesn't an executive sitting in one of these buildings in Hollywood say, well, wait a minute,  as you pointed out, it's easy to do this illegally. It's trivial. Anybody can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And they finally are getting that with MP3s. They tried to kill the MP3. And today you  can go to Amazon and buy, you know, unlocked MP3s. Unlocked songs, which you could immediately turn  around. Has that put the music industry out of business? No. It's one of the few pieces of  brightness there is out there for the music industry. And I don't know. I mean, I'm looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at Flip for Mac's website. They make the drive in software that I just mentioned. They have their  company addressed right there. Flip for Mac is a legitimate company. Yeah. Telestream Inc. Nevada,  city, California. They're doing exactly the same piece of software as real. Just runs on a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No trouble. Well, now they're in trouble. You busted them, dude. I forgot about that drive in  program. That's not like Shrink to Five or anything. No, it's not a fly by night thing.  That's a legit program. This is a big company. So their drive in allows you to take a DVD,  put it in the drive, rip it to your hard drive and watch it. It's a bit doing the same thing as real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's doing bit for bit copy. And then I think it even encrypts that copy so that you're limited  with what you can do with it. It's following all the rules of the, oh, what was the case that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one as long a while back? Kaleidoscape. Oh, this is the DVD jukebox. Yeah. Where they-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very similar except it costs like 30 or $40,000. And the court said, it wasn't the record,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it wasn't the movie industry that said, okay, it was the courts that said it's okay. So the idea  was you've got a button, you got 300 DVDs or whatever. You put them in this jukebox, it copies  it into the hard drive. Now you take the DVDs out and you can watch it on the jukebox. Although

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they never ruled on whether that was a violation of copyright laws. It had to do with the licensing  agreements that the kaleidoscape people had with Hollywood on the DVD encryption software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You have to unprotect a movie to play it. Every DVD player can do that.  Right. Every DVD player program can do that on your computer, but they do that by license

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with Hollywood? That's right. I mean, if you couldn't decrypt this stuff, then nobody could  ever watch it in any form. And the kaleidoscape people had a license to do that. And I assume  real did too. And with kaleidoscape, it was proven that what kaleidoscape was doing, which is very  similar to real DVD, was not a violation of the license they had. But the court did not say,  okay, this is not a violation of copyright law. Right. And that's what this judge is saying is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to decide if this circumvents the DMCA. And that's a really key question here because  you're not cracking the encryption. You're doing a bit for bit. And if doing that violates the DMCA,  that means pretty much anytime you make a copy of something that someone attempted to copy protect,  you're violating the DMCA. And the real copy protection isn't good. Yeah. Which sort of is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what the DMCA says, isn't it? I mean- They don't believe in fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. There's no exemption for fair use in the DMCA. And that would be a fair use application,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  making a copy of something you already own for backup purposes would be fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be, but the DMCA doesn't explicitly say that. There is no fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is fair use, but it still violates the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The DMCA doesn't allow for fair use. Yeah. And we're actually on Buzz Out Loud,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're trying to get a couple of people who are patent lawyers in the audience to submit fair use  as a proposed exemption to the DMCA, to the Library of Congress, because they're taking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  suggestions right now. Oh, good. So that's good. I'd like to support that. Go to bol.cnet.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Go to the forums, forums.cnet.com. Look for Frank Latuca's posting about it. That's where

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's trying to get it together. Good. Good. I mean, that's the kind of thing that might make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a difference, just little grassroots- You never know. I mean, the chances of them accepting it  as an exemption are pretty slim, but it's worth a shot. Well, you got to figure out. It's terrible,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it's probably true. You got to figure that the copyright boy, royalty board just before they,  you know, they see that, okay, good. Let me just call my friend at Universal and see what he thinks.  You got to figure they do that, right? It's possible. Let's just see. Let's just see what  the MPAA says before we rule. We don't want to make any mistakes. A Russian security firm,  Elcomsoft says we can now use Nvidia video cards in PCs to speed up the cracking of WPA keys. This  is the encryption used on wireless networking, thought to be uncrackable. We could speed it up  100 times faster, fast enough that we think that in most cases we could brute force your  WPA key in just a matter of days. Now, I think this is just Elcom- I think Elcomsoft's trying  to sell software here. They're proclaiming it's the death of wireless networking and business  networks. And I guess that would be true if you had, if you were General Motors and you were  worried about Toyota doing industrial espionage, there would be some incentive to sit outside,  you know, company headquarters, download a bunch of data and spend a week or two cracking it. But  nobody's going to do that to your home Wi-Fi. Isn't it a legal problem now for any decent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sized company where now that they've said that this can be cracked, you know, even if it's sort  of a dubious claim or debatable, their lawyers are going to say, well, you know, we have to  disclose this as a risk. This is not, you know, you don't, you know, as you, as you do your  review of your security procedures and so forth, you're going to have to say to your shareholders,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is a problem. I see. Well, that would make sense. You know, it's one of those little fudge  disclaimers you got to put at the bottom of the thing. We should point out that a brute force  attack is still going to take a long time. Even if it's a hundred times faster, it's still going to  take a long time. If you have a truly random password, the real problem is people don't use  random passwords. They use short kind of non-random passwords. That's a lot easier to brute force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think any business that's using Wi-Fi ought to be forcing anyone on the network to be  using VPN as well, just to be safe. Even before they cracked WPA, I would never have relied on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wireless for security. Well, let me do a little calculator. This is lastbit.com has a password  length calculator. How long is your WPA password, Tom? Somewhere in the 20s, I think. Oh, I'll just  say 15. Sure. And we'll say that this brute force calculator, let's give it, let's say it could do  half a million passwords a second. And they said now they can use a hundred computers at a time.  Let's just calculate how long it's going to take. Oh, it's going to take 1,078,485 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you're safe. Hey, if you have enough time. I guess you're safe. Well, this is AES  encryption on WPA, right? We're not talking about WEP. No, this is strong encryption. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the only way to crack it is by trying one after another. You can only, the way they do this is  you download a bunch of, you have to download the data. You can't sit out front of somebody's house  and do this. You have to download enough data and then you have to kind of brute force it,  using many, many, many, the NSA maybe could do this. We should ask that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any encryption given enough time is crackable. I mean, given enough time. You've got a billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years. I think this, you're probably right, Scott. It's probably a corporate weasel word thing,  but Elcomsoft probably should get a little ding for scaring people with something that really  isn't that scary. A hundred times faster is not nearly fast enough. On the other hand,  according to Gizmodo, a computer named Elbot has managed to achieve a 25% success rate in the  Turing test, convincing a human being that they're talking to another human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is hosting the show today in place of- I am Elbot! Fooled ya!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, you know, I don't know if 25% success is really going to knock me out, but apparently this is more,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is a lot more than ever before. Well, you need what, 30 to pass the Turing test? 30, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they must have used dumber humans for this test. I still am really skeptical about it.  That's a very good point. It seems like it's so easy to just spring a question on a computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or try to make the computer laugh. It's a good point, yeah. So you have a panel of people who,  in a blind test, talking to, do you have to have them talk to a human and a computer to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the classical one is just you're talking to somebody and you don't know whether it's a  computer or not and if the computer fools you, then it's passed the test. I don't remember Turing  say that 30% was enough of a success rate. I thought he made it kind of more binary than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You either do it or you don't. Yeah. Yeah. And often these tests are conducted by, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am or, you know, typing where the laughter possibility isn't really an issue. It's more just,  and even in those, even with that kind of handicap, it's pretty, in the past at least,  it's certainly always been pretty easy to figure out. What was the one they used to have called,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was it Ethel? Eliza. Eliza. Eliza. That's what I'm trying to, yeah. How are you today? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are you? I mean, they have come a long way since Eliza. I am fine. Fine is not. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know anything about piss off. The thing about Eliza was that even, it was surprisingly effective,  even crude as it was. Right. If you had the slightest suggestion to the person who, the  human being at the other end, that if you told them in advance, they're talking to a human being,  they wanted to believe that. And they actually were willing to buy that this was another person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, more than that, you can also, that's why Eliza was a psychotherapist, because then you  could say, well, the way she's, the reason she's keeping to repeating what I'm saying is because  she's- That's what therapists do. That's what therapists do. So that's- That's what they get paid for.  That's how they work. She's trying to get in my mind. Yeah. In fact, if you compared to Eliza,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  two psychotherapists, Eliza did pass the Turing test, I think. Freudian only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that Santa Claus, there was a Santa Claus, this was last Christmas, something like that.  Microsoft had a Santa bot on, I deemly remember this on its MSN mail. And after a while, it  started inviting you over to his house for, it was like, it kind of had some like, got racy.  How old are you? Would you like to come over to my place? They shut that one down pretty quick.  Santa learns fast.  Santa. It's amazing what artificial intelligence, where it goes. Speaking of artificial  intelligence, I'm going to get in trouble for that. Sarah Palin has to save her emails  because they were used for state business. Now, this kid, this Tennessee kid, who was the son of  a Tennessee state legislator, used basically social engineering techniques to break into her  Yahoo mail. What was it? AlaskaGov at Yahoo.com. Apparently they had set up email accounts known  only to each other. That's a violation. The Washington Post says that Sarah Palin maintained  a private email account that she communicated with a small circle of staff members outside the  government's secure official email. And now courts are saying that she has to preserve all this email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is- Well, a kid in Tennessee has got them all for her, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. He's good.  He got indicted. Apparently it's not the first time this kid in middle school  hacked into a school computer. So there. Watch out. He's a hacker. Shocking.  That's got to be embarrassing to the legislator though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he didn't do anything particularly brilliant. I mean, things like her mother's big name-  Where'd you meet Todd?  Yeah.  Yeah. It's just kind of shocking. It's taken this long for people to figure out that none of this  stuff is secure in the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know- Was it just a dictionary attack on her?  No. He just guessed. He just socially engineered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The secret questions were, where did you meet your husband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he had the secret questions. That's right. I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he wrote with Salah High School. Yeah, that's right. Actually he tried with Salah High School.  That didn't work. So he tried with Salah High. Yep. Bingo.  It's like when Paris Hilton got her sidekick hacked. Remember the secret question is what's  the name of your dog? Which she, of course, everybody knew because she was on TV with the dog.  Yeah. Don't use- My answer is lie. When they ask you the secret questions, lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You have to have an alternate identity that no one but you knows about with a backstory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to remember it though because yeah, you got to have a whole backstory. You got to remember  it because they're going to ask you, where'd you go to high school? Muncie. Quickly.  Warsaw, Indiana.  But I remember, I think it was Bill Clinton who said, I don't use email. I know President  Bush doesn't use email. He doesn't, for instance, email his daughters. Not because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Carl Rove got into this problem in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Not because he doesn't know how to use email, but because this is public record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they keep trying this dodge of, oh, I'll set up a private account. No one will know. And no  one will ever find out. And that is where they get into trouble over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That's ignorance of how the internet works. I mean, I think a lot of people who listen to this  show know that you never really want to put anything in email that you wouldn't be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  handle getting out sometime. Are you not allowed to have a, she is not allowed to have a private

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  email? Well, I mean, I'm just talking practically just having an email account, even if you think  you deleted it and shut it down, email has a way of finding its way into dark corners of the  internet that you had no idea existed and then popping up at the most inopportune times. As far  as with the legality of having a private email, I guess she's not allowed, the governor of Alaska  is not allowed to conduct official business outside of official channels. Is that what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going on there? Yeah, it's true in California. I served on a committee in our local town and  there's this thing called the Brown Act and you're not allowed to have, you can't even have  correspondence with the other members. It actually is extraordinarily frustrating. It was a tech  committee. We were not allowed to set up a forum, exchange private emails because the rules are  against meeting in private essentially. Anything you do has to be public. And I'm all in favor of  that transparency. But at the same time, if you're trying to do a tech committee and you can't use  any modern technological tools, it's really frustrating. I ended up quitting. Now I understand  a little bit better why things take so long in government to happen. So apparently they have an  IT guy who set up these email addresses, 10 to 15 email addresses, chiefly the small circle of AIDS,  known in Alaskan political circles. This is according to the Washington Post as Palanistas  for their fierce loyalty to Palin. They wanted an email system they had control over. They also  inquired about options for encrypting their email but gave up when they heard that the commercial  encryption product was $1,000. So these weren't encrypted. They were stored on Yahoo's servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just pay a little money to get pop access to Yahoo Mail and then PGP it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe hushmail is free, but okay. Or hushmail, yeah.  Obviously they need a better IT guy. Anyway, they're going to have to preserve all those emails.  I would be, it would be hard. So, but answer my question. Scott, maybe you know,  can the president of the United States have a private email conversation with his daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe I'm not, I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that yes, you can have a private  account to have private conversations, but if you're doing anything related to government work,  that needs to be, you know, needs to comply with all the rules and the rules involve

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the preservation of public records. I think Bush said he was concerned

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about a freedom of information request. Yeah, well that's that you preserve the records so  that sooner or later they can be used by historians or the, you know, the general citizenry.  It's, it's there, you know, we're paying them and they're doing our business and we have a right to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know how it's proceeding. Yeah. But that's a tough, that's a burden that you have to consider  in public office that you really don't have any privacy. I certainly understand the impulse to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go around an IT department that doesn't give you what you need. I mean, I did that in my previous  job. We did it right. He took away our email system at tech TV. So we just went to Yahoo groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't want to use Lotus, so we made our own. But that's the difference between being in  public life and being a web producer at a small time cable network. That doesn't even publicly help.  I'm going to talk just a little bit about the Android phone and amazing, amazing sales figures  for the Android phone. But first I want to thank the folks that go to meeting our sponsors today  on the show. Go to meeting. I've talked about it before. I use it all the time. It is a online  meeting system that is just swell, easy to use, very easy to set up. Just took a couple of minutes  to set it up. You can do it right now. Go to, go to meeting.com slash twit, a couple of clicks of  the mouse. Within a couple of minutes, you'll have it set up Mac or PC. And then it transforms  your meetings. Nobody wants to travel these days. Who wants to get on an airplane, go through security,  take off your shoes, get the middle seat. I talked to a friend of mine is going to Japan today  for a meeting, like a two hour meeting, and then flying back the day after. It's 11 hours each way  for a two hour meeting, not to mention the cost, the time. Go, I said, David, go to meeting. You  got to learn about go to meeting. Here's what happens. You set it up on your computer.  Then during a conference call or ahead of time, if you want, you can send out an invitation via  Outlook or any email program. But it's so simple. Even during a conference call,  you get a couple of clicks of the mouse. And now you're on the phone and you say, look,  I want to show you this PowerPoint or I got to show you these documents. This is so cool. Let me  show you this. I want this website. I got this great YouTube video, whatever it is. And you say,  okay, go to, go to meeting.com. I say, okay, enter in the meeting ID boom. Oh, there's your computer.  They see your computer on their desktop. You can show them anything you want. You can give them  control. It's great for training, for sales, product demos. I used it, as I mentioned,  just a few weeks ago to rehearse a speech with somebody and they were in LA. I was up here.  Awesome. Try it for free for 30 days, a month of unlimited online meetings. Go to go to meeting.com  slash twit. If you've never tried this before, try it free for 30 days. And I think you'll see why.  I don't travel anymore. I stay here. I use go to meeting, go to meeting.com slash twit.  So, uh, Harry, have you, uh, have you ordered your G one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have not. I'm my understanding is that they gave first dibs on them to people who were existing T  mobile customers, but I might well be in line now when the rest of us can get it. I'm really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  disappointed. I emailed, uh, contacts at Google and I said, yeah, we have a limited number.  We'll send you one for review. It'll be embargoed, but you'll be able to talk about it before it goes  on sale. And then I, so I didn't get it. And I sent a note to the woman. She says I'm on leave  till October 27th. It's like, no, no, but I did order one. I am a T-mobile. I have a T-mobile  account. So I will have one October 22nd. I, am I crazy? Am I, I'm very excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's more excited when I saw the launch than I thought I was going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's wide open. Look, we're not alone. Um, it looks like they've gone through  two, you know, they had the, the first round, all the pre-orders sold out. T-mobile tripled  their original quest request from HTC. Uh, a second round sold out as well. The number of  pre-orders sold out combined to be about one and a half million units. This is according to pulse2.com  one and a half million units pre-sale. That's Tom. Is that bigger than the iPhone? I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, pre-sale. I think it is. Yeah. Cause I don't think they hit a million until what?  Like 18 days or something. Why? Why is it so, because people are out there dying.  Oh, you sat on your mute button again. It was Apple. They were trying to stop me.  You can't say it, Merritt. I think people out there are dying for an alternative to, uh,  to the iPhone. So, uh, you know, it's, I mean, there's the LG there, there's the Samsung instinct.  These are, these are actually really exciting to some people, but nothing that's really captured  imagination, but you put Google's reality distortion field of their own behind something,  make it look decent. Like it's, you know, it's usable and it's got cool features. And I think  that's why people are getting so excited about it. It's weird to me because it's on the T-Mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  network. But I think there's also... I think the Blackberry Storm will also be a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Storm will be a big deal too. You're right. And it's on Verizon. I think there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot of people are hungry for something cool, which is on Verizon. You know why I want the  G1 and not the Storm? I want the keyboard. Yeah. A lot of us come with a keyboard. Yeah. And I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a lot of people just hate the idea of switching their carriers. Even if they hate their carriers,  it's just such a pain. And they're just, you know, sort of if there are T-Mobile customers,  they're sitting there and, well, I would like to have an iPhone, but T-Mobile's not giving me an  iPhone. Oh, now they're giving me this. Hooray. Yeah. It is sad because the T-Mobile is for most

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of us will be edge in San Francisco. Tom, you'll be able to use their 3G network. I don't know how  fast it'll be. They have it. I think 20, 22 markets, something like that. They will have 3G  networks. In fact, they won't sell it in the stores in the T-Mobile stores unless the market  that they're selling into has 3G. That's good. But you can't order it as I did from a market  that doesn't. So I'll be using it on edge. I'm not, you know, I can live with edge speeds. If the  thing I'm really interested in, first of all, you buy music from the Amazon music store, unprotected  Toyota 56 kilobit. I like that. There's going to be an app store. I'm looking at already what's  out there on the Google app store or on the Google page. And these look pretty good. You know,  you can download an emulator and play with them and they look pretty good. It's got GPS. It's  going to have a lot of the features that the iPhone has. It's got a real keyboard, a little  clunkier. It's not as elegant. Has anybody, any of you played with the Storm? I haven't got my  hands on it yet. You know, there's this weird thing going on. It's not haptic. I thought it was haptic.  It's not haptic touch, but you have to push to click. It's got a spring in it. Yeah, you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  press this down. What a terrible idea. Really? I like that. Again, I haven't put my hands on it  yet, but I like the concept of actually having a little tactile feedback there. But it's not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  haptic I get excited about because then you could feel the controls.  But you know, you have to push to click instead of tapping. What's wrong with tapping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's too much effort to push. It's too much effort to tap.  Well, with the tapping though, you don't get any real feedback. I know with the haptic,  you get a little bit, but you get that misreal. I'm pushing on this. I feel it. It's a giant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  button. Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't bother me at all. Well, we'll see. I guess we'll know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when we get it. The people I know who have touched the Storm are relatively enthusiastic about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that approach. It does sound bizarre though. I think what's going to be really interesting is  when you start seeing Android phones on the other networks. Because I think you're right about  Verizon. The LG Dare has been the most popular review on CNET for the past three or four months.  I think that's simply because it's a Verizon phone that's kind of like the iPhone. You get an  Android phone on Verizon. It's going to go through the roof. There'll be an Android phone, you think,  eventually for almost all the carriers. Will AT&T get one? I bet they will. Motorola says they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  making them. The only company that's not making them is Nokia. Everybody else has agreed to make  them. So there are going to be a lot of great choices. As somebody who's ordered one, I like  the idea that there are one and a half million others who have ordered them. Because that means  there's an ecology for the app store. There'll be developers moving to it. It's an easy platform to  develop to. It's Java. I think you're going to see a lot of applications even from the Apple store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ported over. Google is not going to be out there killing apps, right? I mean, as far as we know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's totally open. You could put up your own web page. You don't have to go through the store.  I could surf to your web page with the G1 and download it right there. There's no requirement.  I think the store is important. Is it T-Mobile or Google? I think T-Mobile is running the store.  I think it's important that you have a store. I think that for novice users, that's one of the  things that makes the iPhone very attractive is you can just go to that store and browse and buy.  But I think for advanced users, who cares? I mean, BlackBerry, for years you've had over the year  downloads from websites. It's not a difficult thing to figure out.  I actually am excited about it. I'm very excited that the sales are so  high. I think that that's a good sign. It means that this will be a strong competitor.  I've used the instinct. I haven't used the dare. I'm totally unimpressed.  I'm still an iPhone. I'm an iPhone user until I see this G1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the browser is the killer on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's the bold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wrote about that. I wrote several times about the fact that the bold was supposed to be  out from AT&T during the summer at about the same time the iPhone 3G was. I was really impatient  about it. But just this last week, Orange in the UK, which had been selling the BlackBerry bold,  pulled it off the market and said that the software was just not reliable enough.  That's bad.  And so I blogged again and I said, well, maybe AT&T did the right thing by not putting it out  until they felt like it was ready for prime time. But I think for a lot of people, the bold is going  to be an exciting phone too because it truly is sort of a BlackBerry that's part of the next  generation of phones. And in terms of dots per inch, the resolution is higher than that of the iPhone.  And it has a real keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody raves about the screen. I haven't seen it, but everybody says the screen is gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw the bold, gosh, back in the spring when I was still at PC World and it did  kind of knock my socks off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there anything besides these phones, any dark horse that's going to come out of nowhere?  Anybody got something coming that's, I mean, you've got to figure it's been a year and a  half since the iPhone came out. Every company. Where's Nokia on all this?  Why is it-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nokia has the 5800 Express Music, which is yet another sort of iPhone-like phone.  And Nokia has this, comes with music plan, which lets you download all the music you want.  For the time you own the phone. And that looks like the closest thing  that Nokia has come up with to an iPhone killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they've got their own open platform to try to compete with Android now that they've  opened up Symbian too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Symbian needs a lot of work though to sort of be a modern phone offering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little 90s. I was a big fan of the Scion.  Oh, me too.  Yeah. In fact, in a way, Harry, I'm kind of hoping that this G1 will be a Scion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been looking for a modern Scion since they stopped making Scions years ago.  It had a better keyboard than any modern phone does by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I love my 3A. I would still use it if I, you know, if it were a little more modern.  Honestly, that's what I'm really hoping from the G1.  I'm looking at this Nokia. It looks just like an iPhone.  It couldn't be more like an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I remember when they first announced it, everybody was joking that they  just took an iPhone and Photoshopped it to be a Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does. It looks like it. I mean, it's got roughly the same size, same screens, kind of same bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somewhat better camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one thing the iPhone really lacks, that 2 megapixel camera nowadays.  The G1 will have a 3 megapixel, but come on, let's get a real camera on one of these phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, all you want is 2 megapixels.  Really? Why?  Because that's what Steve Jobs said.  Oh, of course. I'm sorry, Steve.  You don't want more than 2 megapixels.  Don't ever retire, Steve. Please, we love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Nokia also has an FM radio, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does anybody want a radio? I don't need a radio. I've got about 4 radio applications on my iPhone  that are far better, including many radio stations, that are far better. Who needs a radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need an AM radio. They never put an AM radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They never do. But I'm telling you, that's why.  Look, Tom, on the iPhone. You have an iPhone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you get the AOL radio app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AOL radio, Pandora. But then there's also this, from a Null River, the reason I know about it is  because we're broadcasting on it, is the Tuner Internet Radio, which has hundreds of stations,  including our station, which is twit.am. Then Clear Channel just put out one called iHeart  radio that has half, it's kind of silly because it only has about half a dozen stations, but  if you want to listen to one of those stations, it's there. It's pretty amazing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just all about coverage versus FM in those cases. I'm not sure how many people really want  radio on their device anyway, for real. Don't you want Pandora instead of an FM station?  If you do, AM and FM are a little better coverage than 3G and Edge sometimes.  Oh, okay. I guess.  Yeah, I don't know that it makes that much of a difference. It's one of those things I like to  have. When I had FM radio on my phone, I used it from time to time, but I don't terribly miss it  that I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if I were a satellite radio, I would just be, if XM in serious ways,  it might as well just give up the ghost. Who's going to pay?  Truckers.  Truckers. Yeah, but I listen to my car on Edge to our station all over town.  Yeah, that's true.  I guess if you're in the middle of Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There aren't enough truckers to pay down their debts on this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Truckers aren't going to pay for Howard Stern. Half a billion dollars ain't going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not enough to keep a business going. Yeah, it doesn't seem like it.  The other rumor that dropped this week is that the Zune or that Microsoft would be  making Zune software for all of its mobile operating systems.  So a lot of people were putting two and two together and saying the Zune phone would come  out of that effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Zune phone. Oh, that'll be big. That's going to be huge.  Well, it actually is a good point that Microsoft's Windows Mobile,  which does power a lot of phones right now, is starting to look like S60 as much of an  awesome and Palm has also ran. I mean, they're just really not in the game at all anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are these rumors that the next generation Windows Mobile has been delayed  again until I think 2011 or something.  Are you going to PDC, Harry?  I am. That sounds like it's going to be a good show because it's going to be the first time that  Microsoft really talks about Windows 7 in any great detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Live Mesh. I mean, I think this is going to be the Live Mesh show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Windows Cloud, which Walter talked about a couple of weeks ago and nobody is quite clear  what it is.  Strata. Apparently it's going to be called Strata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think actually that's...  Cumulo Nimbus.  Little puffy cloud. I think this is... I don't know if Microsoft will be able to turn it  because this is a big turn for Microsoft to go from desktop based operating systems and software.  But boy, this is the cloud computing is the future. And if anybody could really  kind of throw a lot of weight behind it, it's Ray Ozzie and it's Microsoft.  And I think I'm very intrigued about what this Live Mesh slash Strata is going to be.  We'll do a special show after PDC. Maybe you'll join us, Harry. I hope you will.  Paul Therotte, Jerry Pornell, we have you too. Certainly there's a lot of attention to Windows  7. I wonder if Windows 7 will ever ship. If cloud computing really takes off,  who needs an operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows 7 may well be the last sort of Windows as we knew Windows for the last  almost quarter century.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I kind of think so too. I think they will ship Windows 7 just because they're  so far down the road with it. But they may actually do with Windows 7 what they intended  to do originally with XP, which was it'll be the Microsoft experience and you'll just  keep adding to it and it'll extend into the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's Midori, which is a project to build whatever replaces Windows whenever that comes  that Microsoft has talked a tiny bit about, but I think it has to be real someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't Midori a melon liqueur?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Midori margaritas are quite tasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also a famous classical musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I wonder. So are the next editions of Windows going to be named after classical  musicians or liqueurs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any combination, that's what it'll be named.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft Yo-Yo Ma.  No, no, maybe Microsoft schnapps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would work.  The great classical musician schnapps.  Schnapps.  How about schnapps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's see. There's one more story. I don't know if you're going to get all  head up about this or not. I am. I think that it's appalling what the cell phone companies  charge for text messaging and somehow they miraculously all came to the same price  together without colluding in any way.  20 cents a message, which translates to 1,500 bucks a megabyte.  Now that's not enough.  Verizon has announced that starting November 1st, they're going to charge  three cents for the other side.  So if your bank or your airline or Amazon is texting you, not only do you pay the 20  cents for the incoming message, but they have to pay three cents per mobile terminated  message. It's called a mobile terminated message charge.  And I wonder if that's just enough. Maybe it's enough to kill spammers. Maybe it's so  much that it'll kill all of this. Do you get your baseball scores sent to you by text message?  You following the world series that way? I am. I don't know if people will continue to do this  if it's going to cost them three cents a message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Goog411, all of that stuff. I mean, and I guess the way I read it and I don't know,  maybe Harry or Scott knows better here, but I believe the termination rate on Verizon was a  penny. And so they're essentially quadrupling the price. They're raising it three cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was less than a penny. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my understanding. It reminds me of ATMs where I get charged by both my bank and the other  bank. It seems like they can make enough money off me once and they don't need to double dip  and it might just kill SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sad. I had a dream that Google was going to buy this 700 megahertz frequency stuff.  They were going to set up kind of an open, new style wireless communications and using  voiceover this wireless thing as well as data and just put these guys out of business.  The cell phone companies are just appalling. They're rapacious. They're worse than the record  companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google that was going to be able to do that was the Google whose stock was 700 or whatever  it was. Sadly, I think that the prospects of that sort of building from them are not good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, we went through this whole show and didn't mention the stock market.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, what's going on with stock market?  I don't know. I hear things. I don't know.  I just keep bars of gold under my bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting how you're watching CNBC and all of these Forex ads start showing up?  Get into the foreign exchange business.  I'm waiting for Franklin Mint to start up again.  Gold coins in the backyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might have a fortune in your closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talk about this every week, but is it scary for the tech industry?  We've seen some layoffs this week. eBay fired 1,000. Smaller companies like Seismic laid off 9.  Are we going to start seeing that? It seems like it's a little early for this to impact  the tech industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody's getting ready for it. Everybody who has any venture capital investment  is in a mode where they're going to spend as little as possible and just hunker down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, it's going to affect everybody.  It's going to tighten up a lot, isn't it?  This is not going to leave anyone untouched. The more capital investment you need  to run your business, the harder it's going to be. The things that I was reading at the end of the  week last week, basically we're saying if you're a small startup, your venture capital funding may  push on you to be more efficient, but it should keep coming. If you're in green tech or biotech  as a startup where you need huge capital outlays, that's where you're going to really feel a pinch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too bad. That's what we need the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always think of the crash of 87 when I worked for a small tech startup. When it happened,  the president called us all together and said the good times were over for a decade to come.  He laid off a third of the company. Within a matter of months, that crash,  the stock market was back to where it was before that happened and boomed thereafter.  I think even the smartest people are not that great at predicting the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Who knows what's really going to happen, I guess.  The market for books about blogging is going to go through the roof.  There's no doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all people have left to do after they get laid off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cost of starting a blog is less than zero. It's just your time.  A lot of blogging actually started during the last downturn.  That's true.  It took off during the last downturn.  A lot of people at home?  Exactly. You had all these people in the tech industry who were  unemployed and putting a lot of their energy into keeping their name out there on their blogs.  Y'all joking aside, I think it is strangely a recession-proof industry since it's not  really much of an industry at all. The costs are minimal and the only thing that it really takes  is some kind of passion or insanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kathy Sierra actually was saying that on Twitter last night. It was the last downturn that got her  changing career and that got her doing what she's doing now. She's grateful in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on how you support yourself by your blog. I think if you're operating in some sort of  micro economy of your own, and I think of people like Jonathan Colton where they're getting the  money direct from their fans for what they produce, I think that is very recession-resistant  because people still want entertainment. It's not that costly to pay 99 cents or so for a song and  to go out and see a show. You might be able to afford that. I think if you've got a big blogging  enterprise that relies on advertising, I think advertising money is going to dry up a little bit  for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technologizer is a federated media, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. If the advertising market just dies, it will be bad news for me. But my costs are low compared  to even a salon or let alone something like PC World. I don't have dozens of people. I have me  and a few contributors who are not on staff. I appreciate you not saying CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, you're a CBS joint now. You can't go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank goodness we have a papa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would think that, I would hope, and certainly as a podcaster, I hope that advertisers would see  new media as a more targeted, more efficient, less expensive, more valuable proposition and maybe  flock to it as opposed to abandon it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they will. I think the newspapers are, and to some extent the broadcasters have a lot  more to fear right now than the smaller, nimbler online publishers. People understand that this is  where the growth is. There's growth even in a downturn. They're going to be looking to spend  advertising dollars as smartly as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right. I don't think the advertising market is just going to die.  They're going to be a little pickier about where they spend their money. You're right,  that could benefit certain blogs and podcasts for certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seismic, I'm sorry, laid off seven, not nine. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now was Gawker talking about laying off people?  Gawker had some layoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gawker really cut the staffs very heavily at the blogs that were not the most promising  advertising vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nick Denton does this every two years or so. He declares that there is a recession coming.  That's kind of his shtick. This time he happens to be right.  His whole modus operandi has always been to talk down the future. Blogging is never going to make  anybody any money. He's been pulling in his horns on a regular basis for a long time.  I don't take that as a real bellwether. I just see that as his natural behavior.  That's just Nick. He's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sky is falling. The sky is falling. Oh wait, look, the sky is actually falling this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rafe Needleman on his webware column on CNET wrote about companies that might be gone  in this big recession. He put Twitter among them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meibo, which is a great service and one which I really hope does find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meibo is like Facebook kind of or MySpace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meibo is instant messaging that works fairly within the browser and it's very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking of Bebo, not Meibo. Yeah, Meibo is, yeah. Tripit he mentioned, Zillow,  Pandora, of course. Here's a surprise, Second Life.  Second Life has a revenue model you pay to be part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a matter of whether people, enough people are paying, which I think is  questionable right now. If the economy turns down, it could dry it up really quickly.  I think what he's saying in this column is these are the companies that have to really act. It's  not necessarily that they're done for, but they have to do something now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter has to find a revenue model if they're going to succeed, if they're going to survive,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should say. I mean, at least Meibo does have a revenue model. There is advertising there and  Twitter has kind of had the luxury of not seeking one yet. And so you think maybe their investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will say, okay, no more money. You got to come up with some way of making money.  Skype, here's an interesting one. eBay has already made noises about selling off Skype,  which it bought for an astronomical amount of money, but Rafe points out there's nobody  going to buy it at that price, so they can't sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'd have to take a loss on it at this point. And I don't think it really makes  sense for eBay. They had all these ideas of how they were going to integrate it into the auction  process and they never really took advantage of that. Here's the biggest surprise, MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the logic behind that? He says, although it's generating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of revenue and under the aegis of Rupert Murdoch, the notoriously ruthless,  business man could easily cut loose. Oh, he's thinking Rupert could cut loose MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I asked him, he was on Buzz Out Loud Friday and I asked him about that one particularly.  And he said he thinks that Rupert is impatient. He'll dump stuff if it starts to turn sour  quickly. And he thinks that MySpace could start to be a little rocky and that Rupert might ditch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The momentum is against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure I entirely agree with him. I think that thing is so huge.  And I don't think Rupert's going to dump it as quickly as he might dump some other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if you're Rupert Murdoch or any sensible businessman, this is the time that you say you  hunker down, you reduce the spending as much as you can, you prepare for downtimes, but you use  this as an opportunity to build audience and to build market share. It's actually a great  opportunity. I think Jason had said that a couple of Twits ago. This is an opportunity if you can  survive it. So the key is hunker down, not spin off or get rid of. Well, we're going to get rid of  ourselves here because I think we've talked enough about the tech of the week, but I am so glad we  could get all three of you on here. Scott Rosenberg is working on his new book. You have an ETA? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know you said your deadline is December 1st. Yeah, it will be out next June or July of 2009.  That's the target. Isn't publishing lightning quick. And this is considered a fast turnaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing? Is it a little frustrating after working online? Oh man, that's the hardest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. But I forced myself to take a very relaxed Xana attitude and I figure, you just have to accept  that the printing presses are in their own space and that's just what it takes. It's just a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way of being. You never did answer Harry's question, who was the first blogger?  Oh, well he was obviously. Justin Hall, some say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really don't think there is any one person. I think Justin Hall is in my book, Dave Weiner is  in my book, Jorn Barger is the guy who invented the Word web blog, and it was an evolution.  Each of these people contributed something and it all kind of coalesced over time into what we call

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a blog today. I remember having Justin on. Justin helped us, didn't he Tom, early on in  Tech TV as a consultant? I remember having him on Call for Help. Yeah, I think he helped, I think he  talked with David Miller in that era. He came in in a kilt. Yeah, he always had a great outfit.  Yeah, he was a great dresser and then I remember we had him on Call for Help and we went to the  front page of his blog which featured a full frontal nude picture of himself which was I think  the first time, not the last time that happened on Tech TV.
