Her freshman year has already started on Saturday and we were bawling our eyes out.  Have you heard from her?  Once.  One brief, happy email.  I know she's happy.  She's still unpacking.  That's all I care about.  Well, she wouldn't let us unpack for her, so yeah, you're probably right.  She probably hasn't unpacked.  That's Denise Howell, who is also a mom, but her son is only 16.

No.  It's just chickens and cows, but it's really great.  It's really great.  So thanks to everybody for being in studio with us.  We have quite a large in-studio audience of people from all over the country and the world  visiting.  And of course everybody at home was watching it live at www.twit.tv.  We watch the chat room as the show goes by.  And if you have thoughts or questions, you're always welcome to contribute them.  I'll be glad to ignore them at irc.twit.tv.  This is episode 261, so our stories are online at delicious.com slash twit slash 261.  And I guess we have to talk about really the biggest story of the week.  There's actually now some additional stuff around it.  Oracle's suing Google.  Google does a deal with Verizon.  There was a great tweet, a guy named, I think Phil Nash posted a tweet which I retweeted.  And I think I'm getting credit for it.  I really shouldn't get credit for it because it wasn't my idea, but I did retweet him.  And unfortunately the way retweeting seems to work on Twitter, sometimes you get credit  for stuff that you post even though you're just retweeting.  You lose the provenance.  The provenance gut.  So I want to say his name.  And I'm going to read his tweet, which I really liked if I could find it here.  Of course it's been retweeted a bunch.  Welcome to the new decade, said Phil Nash.  Java is a restricted platform.  Google is evil.  Apple is a monopoly.  And Microsoft are the underdogs.  That kind of is true, isn't it?  We were thinking on this week in Google when we talked about the Google Verizon deal that maybe Bing was the place to go to hide from Google.  So let's start with this Google Verizon thing.  First of all, maybe I should ask Denise.  Google said this isn't an agreement.  This is just a proposal for legislation.  What's the story?

Start time: 356.34
End time: 363.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I think it's even more removed than that.  It's sort of and I don't know.

Start time: 363.18
End time: 365.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not an operating agreement.  It's not something they've agreed to do together.

Start time: 366.14
End time: 404.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  They got together and they decided.  And kudos to Google for actually taking a stand on an issue and taking it to Washington, which is something that people complain about a lot.  But there are technology companies that are involved in issues that touch all of our lives every day.  And their users certainly care a lot about these issues.  But sometimes they just let those issues go by and don't do any lobbying.  So I think of this as kind of like a lobbying effort.  They got together.  They put together a policy statement and they took it to Washington.  It's a little bit like writing a letter to your congressman.

Start time: 405.04
End time: 427.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's also stepping into a policy vacuum, I think, which is what Susan Crawford has said in her blog and in a guest post, I think, for Giga Home, that the FCC should grow a pair and step into this.  And the problem is that they haven't.  And that's why Google and Verizon kind of step out and say, oh, the rules should look like this.  Yes.  The sad part is why the hell Google made this deal.  I still just baffles me.

Start time: 427.20
End time: 451.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Google was one of those companies that says we'll never work with Verizon.  We don't believe in limiting your your internet access.  We don't believe that companies like Verizon who want to do things.  Well, remember the Wired magazine article where AT&T went to Apple saying, could you please limit those YouTube videos to 10 seconds because it's killing our network?  You would think Google would be the first one to say that's a bad idea.

Start time: 452.06
End time: 483.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google, who says customer first in nothing in this is thinking like us.  What we want and Google should want because it is aligned with our interests is a hugely open, free Internet wherever you get it.  And to limit that, I wrote a post on Buzz Machine about Internet Schminternet.  And we have the Internet now.  And then the Schminternet is where everything goes going to happen.  And that's going to cost more money.  And that's going to be limited.  And that's going to be censored by phone companies.  And that's no good.  And that's why everyone is so distressed that Google would go along with us.

Start time: 484.06
End time: 492.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Nexus was their attempt to open this and then they got rid of it because the phone companies.  So they were going there and then they suddenly started backpedaling.

Start time: 560.46
End time: 561.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I was thinking. What's in it for them?

Start time: 563.14
End time: 571.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's in it for them? Well, Google says, and we will get,  I apologize to all my friends at Google, including Chris DeBona,  who did send us an email, said, I'd love to come on and talk.

Start time: 571.52
End time: 573.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did ask Google Public Relations to come on this week.

Start time: 574.30
End time: 606.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we will get somebody on this week in Google on Wednesday,  and maybe it'll be Chris DeBona.  So I will give Google a chance to say, but they, in their blog this week,  they responded to all the criticism saying, well, it was the best we could do.  It was the best we could get. We had to get something.  So we said, okay, we'll protect the landline Internet with net neutrality.  And that's in fact what this agreement says.  Okay, landlines, no problem. Net neutrality rules.  But if you're wireless, you could do whatever you want.  Because it's so much harder on wireless to do good Internet.  So is this true? Is this all that Google could get?  Did they get a concession that's of value?

Start time: 606.04
End time: 617.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does Google put themselves in the position that they think it's up to them to negotiate this?  When China came along, they said, oh, no, no, we're not a country.  We don't really want to be in this position.  And now they set themselves up to negotiate with Verizon and not on our interest.

Start time: 618.57
End time: 619.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, I mean...

Start time: 620.04
End time: 635.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does this, it doesn't have any impact of law.  It's not an operating agreement. It's not a business agreement with Verizon.  It's just two companies who are hereditary enemies getting together and saying to Congress,  this is what you should do.  But doesn't that have a lot of weight, especially if it's Google, you know, two enemies saying this?

Start time: 636.04
End time: 649.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's very educational, I think, for the people in Washington.  In a lot of instances, this is going to be their talking points, their bullets on how all this works.  Well, that's what's scary.  Yeah, that is a little bit scary.

Start time: 649.08
End time: 658.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their reaction is going to be what any, you know, ignorant normal person would say,  oh, well, it's Google and Verizon. It must be the way it should be.  Right.  Oy.  Oy.

Start time: 659.60
End time: 674.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And, you know, I mean, there needs to be some definition and texture around  what the Internet becomes next, because the world where we all had a desktop and a landline has gone away.  Right.  And, you know.

Start time: 674.04
End time: 676.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Internet is wireless in many, for many of us.

Start time: 676.50
End time: 696.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll be entirely wireless, including, you know, Google itself fought for white spaces to become Wi-Fi on steroids.  And that would give us what we really need, which is competition.  For Google to say that there is competition in wireless is just ridiculous.  We don't have competition.  We're stuck with 2.2 bad choices.  Right.

Start time: 697.32
End time: 726.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what should we as consumers, what should we fight for at this point?  Should we say, I mean, obviously the answer to this is simple.  Just write to your member of Congress and say, well, that's Google and Verizon.  But we don't agree as users of the Internet.  The Internet should, I always, I hate the phrase net neutrality.  I think that confuses people.  I would say anti-discrimination, because that's really what we're saying is that no, that a bit is a bit.  No bit on the Internet should be treated differently than any other bit.  Open, competitive, capitalistic Internet.

Start time: 727.04
End time: 727.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see.

Start time: 728.24
End time: 731.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that because Congress likes that open, capitalistic, competitive.

Start time: 731.12
End time: 732.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we're talking about here.

Start time: 732.04
End time: 733.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're saying a free market on the Internet.  Yes, a free market Internet.

Start time: 734.06
End time: 735.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, that's good.

Start time: 736.04
End time: 738.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Congress likes free market.  That's a safe thing to say.

Start time: 738.04
End time: 742.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we need you to organize the Constitutional Convention of the Internet.  Well, this is the irony.

Start time: 743.56
End time: 785.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That PSA that I ran, that public service announcement was for a site called savetheinternet.org.  And Google got behind it.  And the whole idea of savetheinternet.org was to fight these anti-open initiatives.  People like Verizon and Comcast who were saying, well, the Internet's okay as long as you don't use Skype or BitTorrent on it.  You better not try that.  I really, so Jake, are you saying that it's greed basically that now that they are effectively in bed with Verizon over Android phones and every other cell phone company, that now their interests coincide with the wireless company's interests?

Start time: 786.54
End time: 796.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it's just I don't understand why they feel the need to step in and be the big bully about this.  I don't think the backfire is worth it for them.

Start time: 797.24
End time: 805.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they certainly get in a lot of backlash.  Right.  That's clear.  Do you think they underestimated, Jeff, what the response would be?  Or do they even care?

Start time: 806.22
End time: 830.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would scare me if they don't care.  Do they need to care?  Why do they need to care?  They've cared in the past.  Look at it this way.  We give a lot of crap to Facebook, but Facebook is more responsive to the fix people have.  Ironically.  Exactly.  Then Google thinks they need to be.  I just don't understand what they get out of it.  It's not, you know, I'm flummoxed.  I'm absolutely flummoxed.

Start time: 831.04
End time: 837.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was, you, Gina, and I tried to understand it as well on This Week in Google.  And that was the why Google Why should have been the title of that show.

Start time: 837.10
End time: 849.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what David Weinberger wrote a wonderful post talking about how he is a Google fanboy.  He loves everything Google has.  He uses every product and we just don't understand.  And the response that Google gave didn't help.

Start time: 850.45
End time: 856.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  At all.  No.  It sounded like they were, what was the phrase they used in Wired magazine?

Start time: 859.21
End time: 870.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like arguing with my German in-laws.  I've learned how to argue with Germans, which is that they just repeat themselves and say it over and over and over again.  You'll finally say yes.  And that's what it was.  It was just repeating the same points with more space.  But it really did.

Start time: 871.04
End time: 878.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wired called them carrier humping net neutrality surrender monkeys.  I think that kind of says it all, doesn't it?  Yeah.  All right.

End time: 902.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jake and I had breakfast with Oum Malik this weekend.  What did Oum think?  Oum is making arguments that Google is kind of on the way down.  And I hear that all the time.  Wait a minute.  He says Google is on the way down?  Yeah.  And people try to say to me that, yeah, your book, what would Google do?  Ha ha ha.  I still believe in Google.  I'm with Weinberger on this.  I still think that they're the smartest company around.  I still think they get it.

Start time: 902.12
End time: 913.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he was talking about how he was talking about his phone and how he uses apps to go  directly to Yelp and everything instead of Googling like restaurant reviews.  Right.  So in that sense, searches, I would say I would agree searches on the way down.

Start time: 914.28
End time: 940.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's but it's not the be all and end all.  There's other ways of getting stuff.  I think the app to me, the app ecosystem is actually a negative.  I think so.  We've talked about this, Jeff, on this week in Google.  It's it's a it's a Virginia Heffernan's phrase in The New York Times.  It's the it's the suburbs of the Internet.  Where you go, it's safe.  It's protected.  People use iPhones like apps because they want that kind of perfect experience.  But it's not the real Internet.  Yeah.

Start time: 941.81
End time: 950.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost saying, as I remember, Jake, that that it wasn't just search.  It was also that that ad model then starts to go away.  When you have the closed app world, the more attention it grabs.  Yeah.

Start time: 951.04
End time: 984.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yelp's got and Yelp and Facebook, because they have location information tied with social  graph.  That's more valuable, really, than this the plain search index.  Although it's nice to have the search index to one of my experiences.  I've started doing trying check ins on Yelp.  I was using force.  I still use four square.  All these different Yelp has four square style check ins.  But Yelp doesn't have a huge database of businesses.  That's where the search piece is kind of missing.  Right.  And I imagine they're they're using something like Google's database of businesses.  So you do need search in conjunction with all of this stuff.  People aren't going to Google.

Start time: 985.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going less, but I think maybe my son is.  This is this.  Tyler uses Google.  What we're not unfettered.  But I guess what I'm getting at is all of this is scaring me as a parent that the Internet  that he's growing up with looks far different than the one that I knew.

Start time: 1012.24
End time: 1026.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is how hip you are because a normal parent would say, oh, this is much safer.  There's no porn.  There's no Steve Jobs.  Our phones have no smut.  And so that's what that's what a less hip parent would say.  But what you're saying is I want an open Internet for my child.  I don't know if I'm saying that, actually.

I think Microsoft, although nobody ever really wanted to admit it, but all of these big companies,  when you have tens of thousands of employees, there's a huge diversity of opinion within  the company.  There's no unified point of view.  And I think it's pretty clear in at least in the China situation, Eric Schmidt had one  point of view and Larry and Sergey, the founders, had another point of view.  And Eric won briefly, the founders eventually won.  I don't know if there's that same kind of division up at the top.  This time there might be.

Oh, it's like three dreams.  Yeah. Yeah.  They take to me for the last.  All right. Well, let me give you the kick.  Are you ready for your kick?  We're going to we're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  We've got a great cast of characters here.  Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine dot com, his son, Jake Jarvis  from Jake Jarvis dot com and Denise Howell, Bag and Baggage dot com.  And we have much more to talk about.  Google's being sued.  Now Google's going to be the bad, the good guy and the bad guy.  We got an even worse villain in the scene in the scene here.  Only Larry Ellison could be a worse villain in this situation.  Before we do, though, I want to say hello to the folks at Ford and thank them  for bringing us out to the Ford plant.  We had so much fun watching those F-150 trucks being built.  I hope you saw the specials that we made from the Ford plant.  Three of them and then one from Maker Faire Detroit, which was amazing.  That's all on the specials feed.  This episode is brought to you by the all new 2011 Ford Fiesta.  That's yeah, that's the car I crashed into.  By the way, not a scratch.  I drove a flex into a Fiesta.  You didn't see that, did you?  Yeah. Anyway, my fault.  They wanted me to tell you that it works fine.  And it was just Leo that doesn't.  And not a scratch on it.  The Fiesta is really cool.  The new 2011, I drove it the other day.  It's the most fuel efficient compact car on the road today.  It's a gas vehicle with, get this, an EPA estimated 40 miles per gallon highway.  That means it can go from L.A.  to San Francisco in a single tank of gas.  We could have driven up here.

So how does the Fiesta compare more miles per gallon highway  than the Yaris from Toyota  over the Honda Civic, you'll save up to one hundred eighty two dollars  a year in gas.  And of course, it's a great ride.  They're really, you know, you put your foot on the pedal.  It's very responsive, very energized.  That's because it has that Duratec one point six liter  I-4 engine in it, a front strut MacPherson suspension.  That might even rival your Porsche there.  It's front sway bar, twenty two millimeter sway bar and twist beam  rear suspension.  Give us a very nice ride, very snappy punchy.  If this thing feels great, you don't feel like you're getting 40 miles  to the gallon. Let me put it that way.  Best in class fuel efficiency, great performance, a good looking interior  and exterior design you want to see for yourself.  Yeah, it's really kind of something special.  Tri-Afford Fiesta, the 2011s are just out this week  at a Ford dealer near you.  Drive one. We think you'll like it.  This week in technology is a is a Google show, is an Oracle show,  is a Microsoft show, is an Apple show.  All of those companies, the big names in technology,  Facebook, too, in the news.

Transcript:  You know, that's what Shakespeare said.  First, let's call a lawyer.  The the folks at typo.  Wrong. The folks at Sun put up with the fact that Google rewrote  the Java virtual machine.  They call it Dalvik  and made Android based on Dalvik, the Java virtual machine.  I guess it is technically a violation of the the rules of engagement in.  I'm not an expert on this, but in the in Java.  But Sun knew it and said, maybe because Sun was a lot smaller than Google.  Oracle buys Sun.  And one of the first things they do is they sue Google, saying  you're violating our intellectual property.  This one's going to go on for years, isn't it?

Start time: 1643.34
End time: 1729.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. One of the things that puzzled me is that Android and Dalvik  is licensed under the Apache license and Sun is GPL.  And they which seem on the face of it seem incompatible.  I know this is real arcana.  And I don't expect you to respond in any way,  tellable way to it, but it just it's not a potlour.  I know it's insanely complicated.  It also seems a little bit hostile, but not that Larry Ellison has ever been  anything but aggressive in his business practices.  There's a great article which I have put in our show notes  from Tico Systems on on this lawsuit.  Let me see if I can kind of summarize here.  It's not Oracle versus Google.  Why is the question mark?  This is a red monk dot com.  When Android debuted debuted in 2006, I couldn't figure out how Google  had managed to apply an Apache license to the project.  This is, as I mentioned, it was a GPL licensed project.  Google wasn't using Sun's virtual machine.  They built their own as danger did before it.  Of course, the Google Android is based kind of on danger.  Google said it's a clean room implementation.  We've seen this before.  This is how the whole bio swore is back in the early days of the PC.  The PC clones were based on the IBM PC, but they did it in a clean room.  What does that mean when they say clean room environment?

Start time: 1733.98
End time: 1766.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, I think they're reverse engineering it.  They have to read code from scratch.  They cannot look at the code.  They cannot try to disassemble the code.  They have to merely emulate.  You're the programmer in here, Jake.  They merely emulate what the code does without actually looking at it.  What he says in this blog post is it's not clear why Google  re-implemented the JVM, but they knew it was risky.  Google, he says, could have reasonably assumed that the probability of Sun  suing them was near zero.

Transcript:  But mostly it cost to Skoll because Skoll lost big time on this.  And Linux was-  And Unix-  You know, Skoll bought the Unix name basically.  And they said, well, it's Unix and you're stealing Unix code.  And there was no merit.  Although, remember that Microsoft also owns some of this stuff and has in fact  licensed- remember they indemnified people who use- what was the deal?  They indemnified people who use Microsoft products or Linux.  I can't remember the deal.  They made a deal with Linux over that and said, okay, if you pay our license,  we'll protect you.

Start time: 1860.07

Transcript:  In this blog post, he says really the issue is you're going to damage the Sun  Java ecosystem by this lawsuit.  You're going to make it very unlikely that people will look at Java and say,  oh, we should use Java.  But on the other hand, the benefit, you might make some money.  They spent something like six billion dollars, six and a half billion dollars  for Sun.  So he's saying basically they're trying to get back their money even though,  in their financial justifications, even though there'll be ecosystem long-term  damage to the ecosystem for a short-term cash windfall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not very likely in the wake of the Supreme Court's recent statement on that  front.  What are they saying?  That software patents still survive.  They're not going to be ruled out as they have been in other countries such as the  EU and I believe Australia has a similar piece of legislation pending where  they're just going to say that category of item is just not going to be unique  enough, have that whiz-bang factor that leads something to be able to be  patented.  They're going to say, you can take this on a case-by-case basis and we're going  to let the Patent and Trademark Office work it out.  We know they haven't been doing too fabulous a job on that.

He's the guy who did GNOME and he's currently doing an open source mono, the  open source version of .NET.  And he thinks it's just a good chance that Google will just give him some billions  of dollars and go away.  And then Oracle goes one by one through all the OEMs.  Google gives them money for the Google implementation of Android and then it's  on to HTC and Motorola and one by one.

They opened Handset Alliance and Google did not license Sun before they made  Dalvik.  And I guess that's the issue.  And perhaps it was something that Jonathan Schwartz knew when he was shopping the  He told Larry Ellison, hey, by the way, you know, you can always get some of this money  back by showing Google.  Anyway, it's a bad thing.  At the same time as they did that, I guess they thought, well, everybody paying  attention to that maybe will also announce that we're going to stop open Solaris.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is really disturbing.  I'm hoping the ACLU is paying some attention and perhaps going to go in and challenge this  practice because, you know, these people have privacy rights.  I don't know that you give up your privacy rights simply by being accused of a crime.

Transcript:  Oh, okay.  We had a story like this on Twill where someone was riding the subway in Boston and engaging  in some not safe for anywhere sorts of activities.  And another passenger got angry and posted a picture to Twitter and didn't know who this  person was, but wanted to see if they could apprehend him.  And sure enough, they did.  Is it legal to do that?  Sure.  You can take a picture of a person in a public place.  It's a public place.  Especially if they're breaking the law in some way.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You're innocent to prove it.  Even given that the police blotter may be public.  And I just think you have that information there, but you're not.  When you start having a police department posting it on the internet.  But I think, well, hold on, counselor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that we have to be more public.  And yes, there's an issue that you're innocent to prove and guilty.  Amen.  We like that.  Yes, we do.  I particularly enjoy that.  But it happens all the time now in a high profile case.  So who's to say what the line is between high profile and low profile?  What freaks us out here is this could be any of us.  And these are not serial murderers going off and doing things.  These are just plain old people.  But it's still, they are people in the public record who are accused of a crime.  And that right now, unless it's, I'm wrong, unless it's quashed in some way, that's open.

They were hiding in a neighborhood.  Here's their picture.  Their age, their city.  Is this punitive?  Is this, they're not asking for information, but these people have not been convicted of  a crime, but they're being punished without due process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh look, look at the disclaimer.  All persons on this page are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  Like that gets them off the hook.  Sounds like a voice from Dragnet.  Your Honor, we posted it on our Facebook wall.  It was our status post for crying out loud.  Look at all these, look at all these perps on here.

Start time: 2440.44
End time: 2459.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, also though, there's this tradition of saying allegedly is accused of...  They're looking for somebody in conjunction with an investigation of an event.  They never say something like this.  Because Leo, a journalist...  Patricia Figueroa, age 45, was arrested for shoplifting from the Kohl's store.  Here's her picture.

Start time: 2460.20
End time: 2469.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, here's what we do in journalism.  We quote the police saying that, so this is just the police saying it.  This cuts out the middle man, the mediator of media.  Everybody has access to the police water now.

Start time: 2521.76
End time: 2536.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not clear cut.  It strikes me as by posting it there.  And it's, you know, as a normal person reading this, you they're not saying accused of or  was in the investigation of.  They're saying we arrested these two for doing this.

Start time: 2537.02
End time: 2558.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're used to the language of the journalist as mediator between this and the police.  This is the language of police.  The perpetrator, they're saying the perpetrator did this, did that.  They don't say allegedly they say we're charging this person with this.  That's right.  That's the way they talk.  So it's all the journalists are saying it's the journalists who add in the allegiance.  It's the journalists because the journalists are covering their rears in this and they

Start time: 2558.64
End time: 2566.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  attribute it to the police.  They do use the word suspect here.  They don't use the word bad guy.  I don't know.  Does that let them off the hook?  I don't know.  Right.

Start time: 2567.92
End time: 2596.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Sometimes when you take already publicly available information and you have the public entity  that is in charge of that information, all of a sudden making it widely available on  the Internet.  I'm thinking of court documents, for example.  It does change things.  All of that is public.  All of this is the same as you would see in the court documents.  Somebody could start posting all of our household deeds somewhere online.  That's all public.  But if the county started doing it, I don't know.

Start time: 2597.64
End time: 2620.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then I think there's a troubling line if you go back the other way.  Say, okay, well, see, we don't like this with the DWI because it could be anybody.  Then where does that line end?  And I argue that what's public is public.  And if you enable people not to put this stuff up, then at some point when the mayor  is arrested for DUI, and the mayor claims the same right, the mayor says, no, no, no,  you can't release my name.  We will all be screaming bloody murder.  No, you're the mayor.  Okay.

What I find very interesting is, and this is really what you are studying and it always  comes down to is our notion of privacy in public has completely changed.  And it's only because these tools, when things are public, they're public.  And when they're private, they're private.  And these tools change.  The internet changes that.

Nice guy.  said that what's happened economically is that the price of privacy used to be free  and publicness, publicity, cost you a lot.  It was very expensive to be a star.  It's the exact opposite now.  Yeah.  Publicity is cheap and privacy is expensive.  That's true.  Privacy takes effort.  That's true.  And then David Weinberger came in and said, we have a public privacy axis here.  They're not binary.  It's not one or the other.  But he said that in the old days, you were either Marilyn Monroe or you were a schmo.  And now we all have a celebrity.  We all deal with these issues.  And it does change how we deal with having a public face because we all have one now.  Even if we don't have our own Facebook page, we could be tagged on a Facebook page.

That's just what it's all about.  It's about saving you time and travel money.  It's about being engaged.  Go to meeting keeps everybody on the same page during conference calls.  Everybody on the call could see your screen.  See, this is what happens.  You're on a conference call.  You can do it on the fly.  You just say, okay, everybody go to go to meeting.com right now.  Here's the meeting ID.  Now suddenly they're seeing your computer on their screen.  You could show them the PowerPoint or the keynote presentation.  Yes, Mac or PC.  You could show them spreadsheets.  You can collaborate too.  You can say, here, what do you think?  What's wrong with this paragraph?  And they can type.  They can take control and show you what's on their computer as well.  Up to 15 people at a time.  Everyone on the call, more focused, more interested, more engaged.  You're going to love it for sales presentations, for product demos, for training, collaborating,  weekly update calls.  We use it all the time here.  We have several accounts.

Apple bought Siri, which is a really cool application that lets you say things like,  book me a dinner for two at Humble Pie or whatever.  But this new ... I think the voice commands ... Unfortunately, you have to have 2.2, so  it's really only a few phones like the Droid 2 or the Nexus One that can do it.  But it's amazing.  You press a button.  It's great.

We were talking about this on This Week in Google.  Yeah, there you go.  Denise, that looks good.  She's talking to her iPad.  We were talking about This Week in Google.  That's the difference between Apple and Google.  Apple, you know, Steve Jobs probably, at some point, there was a table with all different  size screens for the iPhone.  You know, everywhere from two inches to ten inches.  And Steve goes, that one.  And that's it.  And as you said, Jeff, the difference is there's still a table with all different sizes, but  we get to say, that one.

Transcript:  I think it's a little different in phones.  I love Macs, and I think that Macs are much more open than phones, though.  The iPhone is so closed, you can make a pretty strong case for the choice in the Android  phone.  So what obviously is happening is that the balance of power is shifting.  Android phones now are going to be...  What I'm curious about, and you're a developer, Jake, I'd be curious what you say about this.  I wonder how long before developers start saying, okay, we're going to develop for the  Android platform first, and then if we've got any resources left, we'll do an iPhone  version.  How long before that happens?

End time: 3393.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you, if I'm a developer, I don't care why.  I'm just looking at 200,000 phones a day.  That's a new market.  That's a big market and it's growing fast.  I think it's obviously permanently outpaced the iPhone.  Do you think?  Can Apple come back?  What if Apple goes on Verizon in January?  Has that changed it?

Start time: 3394.48
End time: 3397.65

Start time: 3407.68
End time: 3416.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That will be the test of your assertion because if it's suddenly available on Verizon and  then it says, oh, now we're going to sell 150,000 more, then okay, maybe.

Start time: 3417.43
End time: 3420.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3421.27
End time: 3429.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  200 bucks.  The monthly fee's pretty close.  They'll be free Android phones.  I'm sure there are.  Oh, you mean the iPhone's more expensive?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

Start time: 3429.68
End time: 3435.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So you have more risk with the iPhone that you go to all this effort, you make the app  and then Steve says, no.

Start time: 3436.37
End time: 3496.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  That's to me the risk.  I tried to get Lisa DeBetany to come on and she says, we're not allowed to speak.  At all.  But Lisa worked with a company called Tap Tap Tap to make, she's a photographer, been  on Twitter many times.  She's a great person, to make an application called Cam Plus.  This is a very cool application.  I have it right here, in fact, on my iPhone.  So you use it to retouch photos, to create different styles.  It's a nice application.  So they released an update to the Apple Store that turned the volume switch on the iPhone  into a camera button.  This is actually something pretty cool on a lot of Android phones, or a lot of phones  in general.  You have a camera button, not on the iPhone.  It's a soft button.  You have to press it.  And Apple said, no.  Read, look here, see the fine print.  In the developers agreement, you may not, thou shalt not modify the functionality of  the volume buttons.  Not allowed.  So they did not allow that app to come out.

Start time: 3496.40
End time: 3497.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The app was still in the app store at that point.

Start time: 3498.60
End time: 3499.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was an update to the app.

Start time: 3499.82
End time: 3502.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But in the next revision, they hid the feature.

Start time: 3502.14
End time: 3571.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what happened is, exactly, it was already in there.  They posted a tweet, which was immediately redacted, but too late, the internet, everything  lives forever.  They posted a tweet that said, well, you know, it is a funny thing.  If you go to Safari and you enter cam plus, what was it?  Cam phone plus colon slash slash enable shutter button.  I'll get the actual URL for you.  You can Google it.  It's easy to find.  Oh, lo and behold, the original app, it turns it on.  I've got it right now.  Here, watch.  It's really cool.  I'll take a picture.  So Apple, oh, I just took a picture of me.  That's not good.  Apple said, whoa, and they pulled the app off.  Well, we don't know.  See, look, it snaps it just like that.  When I press this button, this is a very nice feature, but Apple is very clear that you're  not allowed to do that.  I understand why Apple said that because it's confusing, right?  Their position, this is always Apple's kind of aesthetic, is no, a button does one thing  in one thing only.  If you make this button have two functions, people will be confused and we don't want  confusion to reign in the land of Apple.

Start time: 3574.08
End time: 3595.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the one button mouse.  So the nice thing on a Mac, you could just buy a new mouse, but you better not do that  on the iPhone because it will pull your app from the app store.  Now I tried to get Lisa to tell me whether it was, and there's still a little question,  was it Apple that pulled it?  These guys at Tap Tap Tap are great marketers.  It could very well be that they pulled it to get the attention that they're getting right  now.

Start time: 3595.80
End time: 3605.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same with that flashlight app a few weeks ago that if you pressed a certain configuration  of colors, it turned the tethering on.  Apple pulled that one too.  Well, obviously, yeah, but this one's a little more innocent.

Start time: 3606.14
End time: 3631.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A couple of things that are embarrassing for Apple in that.  First of all, their vetting process isn't and couldn't be perfect.  So if you can do that, you could probably put malware out there, spyware out there.  It's completely possible because you're not giving the source code to Apple to bury stuff  in an application.  That's obvious now.  So it's a little embarrassing to Apple.  But also this issue.  Now, is Apple in the wrong in yanking this?  Let's assume.  I don't know if Tap Tap Tap did it.  I'm going to assume Apple yanked it.  Is Apple wrong in yanking the app?

Start time: 3631.54
End time: 3641.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in their eyes, this app is the same thing as the tethering app.  They're hiding a feature that Apple told them not to do.  That's against their terms of service.  They violated the terms of service.  So I guess technically, legally, yeah.

Start time: 3642.62
End time: 3647.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I understand they have the right to do it.  Were they wrong to do it?

Start time: 3649.24
End time: 3661.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They weren't wrong the second time to reject the app because it was a hidden feature.  But the first time, I think they should give their users a little more credit.  All iPhone users are not stupid.  They can understand that when the camera app is open, the volume buttons do not change  the volume.

Start time: 3662.52
End time: 3681.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as just my two cents is saying in our chat room, look, if you were smart enough  to find this cam plus colon slash slash URL and enter it in, presumably you're smart enough  to know that you did it on purpose and that the volume buttons are changing their functionality  only in this context.  So it seems to me that Apple could reasonably say, all right, well, go ahead.

Start time: 3681.90
End time: 3689.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if any other company would say, hey, listen to your customers.  They want this button.  But of course, Apple doesn't listen.  So that's my point.

Start time: 3691.00
End time: 3708.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess that's just my point.  And tap, tap, tap.  Now, it's interesting because tap, tap, tap says, and I believe them, they've sold half  a million dollars worth of this application, which means Apple got 30% of that hundred  fifty thousand dollars in their pocket.  And so they're willing to turn turn turn their back on quite a bit of money.

Transcript:  Seinfeld says he saw a study that found Apple users are more anxious about computers than  other than Windows users.  So maybe Apple is just rightly saying, well, we don't want to create any anxiety.  Another story from Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal, an Apple employee, a  mid-level, not a not a high level, mid-level Apple employee was arrested.  He was arrested on Friday for receiving one million dollars in kickbacks from six suppliers  to Apple, six companies in Asia that supply to Apple.  By the way, they published his name.  So I guess accused, alleged, charged.  He was indicted by the federal grand jury for wire fraud, money laundering, unlawful  monetary transactions.

Transcript:  About Hurd?  You know, it's interesting because I talked to Paul Thurad, who does our Windows show,  who was a big fan of Hurd's.  You know, Hurd came in and rescued HP.  Carly Fiorina pretty much dug a deep ditch for HP with a compact merger and a bunch of  other things.  And Mark Hurd came in, turned the company around, laid a lot of people off.  In fact, I saw his approval rating among HP employees was down like 34 percent.  Nevertheless, he's made the company very successful, very profitable.  I think the acquisition of Palm is very intriguing and perhaps a very good idea.  That was clearly his idea.  He really championed that.  And of course, he was fired.  Paul thinks it's because HP is just basically kind of an old fashioned company.  He was fired because.  Allegedly, reputedly, reputedly.  Well, there is some debate about this, actually.  Allegedly, he fudged his expense accounts, not even for very much money, some say, just  a few tens of thousands of dollars, to wine and dine a lovely young lady who happened  to be an HP contractor and put travel and so forth on his company expense report.  And HP said, well, you can't do that violation.  She had sued him for sexual harassment.  It's not clear whether he was fired for harassment or for.  No, he wasn't.

They actually it's General Electric and they were doing a green tech show.  We're really happy to have General Electric as part of our partnership  to make the green tech show possible.  G.  He has something they call the 200 million dollar eco imagination challenge.  They are giving I think this is so cool.  G and its partners are giving 200 million dollars out to ideas that help build  the next generation power grid for the 21st century.  So if you go to eco imagination dot com slash challenge, you can find out more  about this, they're making investments in three energy categories of first is  renewables, they're looking for better ways to integrate renewable energy into  the power grid.  Of course, you know, sun, solar, wind, water.  I was just on the Vanderbilt estate in upper New York state.  This is a gilded age of states.  Beautiful, so gorgeous, beautiful house.  They this is they built it in 1898.  They were the first home to have bathrooms, you know, not outhouses, but  bathrooms with running water.  But they had they put a a water power station on the creek.  This is at the turn of the century and the house had electricity from the from  the creek.  It was like this was like a state of the art house.  Not only do we have toilets, we have lights.  So we're getting back to the old ideas, I guess.  The second category grid efficiency, they want to convert the smart grid to  digital energy.  This is that's the new name.  The new term people are starting to use for smart grid to improve transparency at  every step of the grid from power generation to consumption to reduce waste  and to give consumers and energy service providers better choice.  Do you ever think you could choose your electricity, where it comes from?  Push a button.  The third investment category is eco homes and buildings.  GE says energy consumption is growing so quickly it's creating an imbalance  between demand and supply.  We know that.  That's obvious.  That's leading to higher energy costs, of course, for everybody, consumers and  business.  So they want to change how and when we use energy to lower energy costs.  So you can enter this, believe it or not.  If you enter GE's eco imagination challenge, you'll have the opportunity to  develop a commercial relationship with GE.  We're looking for entrepreneurs, business types, tech types, smart people.  GE will help you scale the concept quickly with their sales and distribution  infrastructure, accelerate development.  They've got a lot of technical people that can help you and even secure  investment either from GE or their partner VC firms in Silicon Valley.  Two hundred million dollars in this.  This is great.  Go to eco imagination dot com slash challenge to learn more, submit your  ideas and enter the challenge.  You can review and this actually everybody, even if you're not an  entrepreneur or an inventor, I want you to go there because you get to look at  pull this up the and review the the ideas already submitted.  Just click participate in the challenge.  So anybody can get involved as eco imagination.  Dot com slash challenge.  They announced this the other day in San Francisco, actually, and I was going to  head out there and we, I think we were out of town.  Oh dear.  I hope that's not the case.

Is, is that, you know, I think it's where we need to go in all kinds of ways.  And it wasn't that long ago when companies would say, no, no, no, no, don't  send us our ideas because we're going to be liable if we open a envelope and,  and we don't want to hear any ideas.  And this is the way the world has to go.  And the fact that they're going to invest a large amount of money in  entrepreneurship and new ideas is where it's a capitalistic thing.  I'm starting a, an investment fund at CUNY where I teach journalism.  Are you?  New business models for news.  That's great.  Once I get some, a lot of lawyers do a lot of pro bono work to figure out  all the details of how to do that.  But, but I think that that's what we have to do in industry after industry is  we've got to invest in entrepreneurship and new ideas.  And so doing this and advertising it to a geek entrepreneurial technology

She's an actress.  Except I'm going to miss you all.  Except one.  I'm looking at you, Spencer.  Being your assistant has been a special hell.  I put up with your temper and your bad breath.  You know why this resonates?  Everybody's wanted to write these.  Right?  Yes.  Hopefully she'll inspire someone.  On Friday, I transferred you a call.  I was about to hang up when I heard you call me a Hopa.  Hopa?  Hopa.  And then she defines Hopa as hot piece of beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, she said Hopa, but it's really H-P-O-A.  That's interesting.  You'd think in a hoax, you would spell it right.  Is that really all you thought of me?  Look how sad she looks there.  Did you ever wonder why everybody in the office called the trash a garbage dispenser?  That's a little odd.  That's a little.  Yeah, that's a little.  That should have been a red flag.  Yeah.  Right there.  That's a little Steve Carell.  That was too convenient.  Yeah.  Office morale is down since you installed the little office snitch so you could  monitor how we spend our time.  This I believe.  So I wondered how does Spencer spend his time online?  You gave me the codes after all four hours a week on Scott trade.  It's supposed to be a brokerage, right?  So that's his real job.  5.3 hours a week on TechCrunch.  Incidentally, there's the giveaway.

Transcript:  They missed a boat on that one.  And drum roll 190.  No, I'm sorry.  19.7 hours a week playing Farmville.  This, by the way, if you think about it, half his workday playing Farmville.  It's not that compelling.  Even I, who was addicted to Farmville, never, I don't think.  Maybe I did.  You need one big herd.  If I get a message like this from Lisa.  Wow.  So this Hopa, now, by the way, this is when I started to get a little suspicious.  She moves the whiteboard out of the way to show off what a Hopa she is.  She also changes clothes.  And suddenly she goes from her blue tank top to a white tank top, throws away the  glasses and she's wearing short shorts.  So this Hopa is moving on.  Although, and by the way, again, this is clearly calculated, right?  I mean, it's obvious why we fell for this.  Although I don't have another job.  Something tells me I'll be just fine.  So I saw this.  I came really close, but I didn't to forwarding it to somebody and saying,  Oh, isn't this funny?  Didn't.  And I thank God I didn't because Jenny has been revealed to be an actress.  Elise Porterfield.  Yeah.  In fact, there's a video now on the website from Jenny.  Oh, yeah.  They really, this is quite brilliantly done.

Transcript:  And he did a good job.  He tracked down the chive.com and who owned it.  And he said, oh yeah, it's the rest eggs.  Before that, they ran a site called D rober, which features doctored  photos of celebrities in their underwear.  And it was at de rober where in December, 2007, where they had the story about  Donald Trump leaving a $10,000 tip on an $82 bill Fox news and the post ran that  story.  So, uh, Peter called him.  He said, uh, he calls Leo Ressig.  He says, uh, Jenny's a fake, right?  Ressig says, Jenny's very real.  This is good.  I love the way they handled it.  Um, he says Jenny's with his brother, John, at this very moment, the three of them  are trying to figure out the best way to identify her and tell her story.  Jay Leno wants her on the show.  Good morning America wants her on the show.  He says, we're not sure how to proceed.  We want to be respectful of the girl.  Um, now Peter doesn't give up.  He's a good reporter.  I have to say he really handled this well.  He says, okay, but you're the same guys who gave us the Donald Trump story.  That was fake, right?  Is this one different?  Pause.  Good homework.  That was a good time.  Oh, so this is, so this Jenny story is real then this one is to be determined.  People are kind of making up their own stories.  In other words, they hedge and they hedge.  Finally, he says, since, uh, Leo won't tell me the story is real and the Trump  story definitely wasn't, I'll assume this one is make believe to quote, well, if  you want to assume that you can, we have a track record.  True.  They claim the chive, the Barry, the brigade and the throttle.  Their four sites have a monthly audience of 5.6 million uniques.  The chive has 1.3 million uniques, according to comscore.

Uh, one of the reasons was, is you keep on talking about that wonderful Ford  sync and, uh, I was waiting for the day when a car would come out that it's a  car that I wanted from Ford that would have Ford sync and, uh, so I bought one,  the 2011 Ford Fiesta.  I bought a magenta, actually the same car that you hit with the Ford Flex.  And, uh, I'll do that the same.  And, uh, I just hope it wasn't that car.
