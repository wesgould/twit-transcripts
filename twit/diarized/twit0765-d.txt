Start time: 502.76
End time: 530.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it the world has changed  It's very in so many unusual and interesting ways  um  Of course a lot of people who weren't using zoom all of a sudden are using zoom which is I would guess the number one  video conferencing technology  Zoom says they went from 10 million daily active users in december to 200 million last month  Uh, and of course as a result, we're seeing all sorts of problems

Start time: 533.88
End time: 544.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all, that's crazy numbers by the way before we get into the problem  I mean, when have you heard of a platform going from 10 to 200 in a month not since facebook?

Start time: 545.18
End time: 565.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, I mean, I mean that's probably the last time we've seen that type of growth  Right would be facebook would be and even then  I don't know if you saw that uptick that quickly  Potentially once they once they kind of hit their stride and were going to more and more places  Maybe you did like maybe once they really started investing in asia and south america  but

Start time: 566.76
End time: 575.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably the last time we've how did zoom win this it seems like there were was zoom the number one choice in business  I mean, what about cisco web ex or go to media?

Start time: 575.30
End time: 585.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's easy it's ease of use it's what I think it is. Yeah, it's the only one that really works  Right. Sorry go on. It's it's also that's

Start time: 586.60
End time: 608.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem though is it was so easy to use that that's why they're running into these problems and some of the people are  saying that some of the fixes that they're trying to do now are going to be  kind of shooting themselves in the foot because even doing something simple like having a password to join a  A zoom call is going to make it more difficult for people to use. Yeah

Start time: 609.32
End time: 696.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's an interesting story zoom bombing is now a federal offense  That could result in  Imprisonment. I don't know if that's reduced the number of zoom bombs federal prosecutors are saying  That if it was posted as a press release to the department of justice website of the u.s attorney's office  For this for the eastern district  Of um, I don't know what state of some state  With support from the state attorney general and the fbi probably new york. I would guess that that the most aggressive in something like this  Zoom bombing is a big problem for schools for churches  I have a friend in a 12-step program recovery program and of course they can't meet in person anymore  They do their meetings as zooms and meetings and because they're public of necessity  Anybody can come in and people are doing horrific  offensive triggering things  Not just pornography not just racial epithets, but intentionally going after alcoholics things like that  It's it's just appalling and it's my understanding that a lot of the organizing is going on  I'm sure it's happening at four chan nine chan  Discourses being used. There's a discourse channel for zoom bombing where they share  Public  Ids for zoom events so that they can all have so much fun. It's just shocking really how awful some people can be

Start time: 697.86
End time: 738.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's it's funny. My mom sent me  Like an email, I guess this was maybe maybe tuesday this week. Maybe wednesday  um, we were I think in the the middle of either the first or the second wave of zoom scandals of the week and  Her bible study is going to be using zoom and she wanted to know she was like should I use this?  Maybe I don't want to bother with it at all. And so I like sent her like a detailed thing  I took the time to take the screenshots and go through the process  I was like this is how you can join from your web browser. Just that's going to be your best bet  You know, don't sign up for an account. Don't do the other things  But I was really proud of her a for reading and keeping up on it and be like asking  Okay, what's the best way for me to do this? It's all over the place

Start time: 740.38
End time: 741.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because everybody's using sure

Start time: 742.64
End time: 797.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely but still i'm i'm i'm still proud of my mom for wanting to like know like how can I mitigate even asking the question?  Should I be using this and like part of me wants to be like no don't use this at all  And then another part of me is like yeah, but I don't want you to miss out on being able to connect with people  You know, that's that's to me  I think the hard thing about having the advice to just be don't use this product if you're an enterprise or a school  Or something. I think that's one thing where maybe you should appeal to the higher authorities who make those decisions to say  Have you actually vetted this but if the decision's already been made and this is what your school is using or your bible study or your  you know, um,  You know a a meeting or something else. That's what they're choosing to do  It's a really I think not fair thing to say to regular people. We'll just opt out of this  Just don't use this this communications. It's the same thing when people say oh, just don't be on facebook  You know where it's like, okay, that's that's really that comes from a really privileged position to be able to make that point

Start time: 797.54
End time: 993.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. Yeah, and the thing about zoom look, there's still lots of great things about zoom  It's funny. We used to have up until the last couple years  I've even been saying really until the last like 18 to 24 months when zoom has kind of gotten much more popular  We used to have this joke  for the last uh  Four or five years of you know, we've got now we've got self-driving cars  But we still can't get a video call to work and we still can't get a powerpoint, you know  And zoom really has kind of solved that um, it has gotten to where  Uh, it's made these things easy enough that you can get a lot of people connected  um, I agree with christina it you  People shouldn't be too freaked out about it. Obviously the nsa shouldn't be using it for uh, you know  And and some companies that are doing corporate secrets, you know, you saw  SpaceX say that they're um, you know, they banned it. Well, that makes sense. They're dealing with highly proprietary  and sensitive information, right that that deals with their core business, so  That makes perfect sense for the average people, you know stuff. I I had a friend that yesterday  Did their uh on their zoom?  they did a their sister's baby shower and it was amazing and she talked about the fact that  What it's enabling them to do and I did one this wonderful organization called interfaith paths to peace because a lot of  Um, uh, you know a lot of religious organizations, they don't really have tech departments  And so this organization has helped sort of provide a platform using zoom where people of different faiths can come together and  You know have fellowship and be able to worship together and get inspiration  So there's great things that are going on with zoom the thing where the the onus is is  The people who are hosting these meetings, they just need to implement a few good things  brian mentioned the  Password thing which now zoom is kind of imposing you can still send somebody a zoom link with that password essentially embedded in that link  And so it makes it easy for them to just click and join  But if somebody's doing that random looking, you know typing in random zoom numbers or finding, you know random  zoom  Rooms to jump into they can't get in if they don't have the password and even then if you set up a waiting room  The host of a zoom can help kind of screen people and if they see people that are jumping in and are being  Impropriate you can hit the remove or you know jump them back to the waiting room if for some reason it's somebody you  Don't recognize so there's plenty of ways to mitigate this for most people that are using zoom  It's just that the people who are using it and we're considering using it to do very proprietary things  They obviously need to to think twice about it  But by the same token, it's still better than like we used to do these calls  Where you know you have your just your number you dial into an 800 number and then you put in your corporate sort of  Nine-digit id well, the thing is we never knew who was on those calls with zoom  At least you can see who is on there  And so it is generally even more secure even as insecure it is right now the problems it has with encryption  And those kinds of things it's still a step up from the average conference call

Start time: 993.18
End time: 1021.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But my my question is because you know, we're largely we've been talking about consumers using this  But the question that I have is, you know  Usually you see problems like this when you have a consumer product try to move into enterprise  This is an enterprise product that's suddenly being used by  Consumers, but there are all these security issues who where were the the cios and ctos  Where was everybody like?  Checking out all of the security problems that zoom had before this

Start time: 1022.12
End time: 1064.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a great question and  I actually disagree  I I disagree with zoom zoom says that they were an enterprise product that is now being used by consumers  I I will I will say I think that's patently false and I think they're being misleading when they say that  They may have had some specific enterprise, you know implementations like apparently they have one for HIPAA  But the vast majority of the the times that I was using zoom was either for small teams things  I saw a lot of startups using it  Individuals kind of wanting an easy way to set up conferencing systems  Um or or hobbyists, you know, so I think that really most of their users before this were  Small businesses startups maybe medium-sized business places that don't have cios and ctos

Start time: 1067.80
End time: 1073.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would use the big cisco conferencing systems much more expensive much more complicated but better quality

Start time: 1074.92
End time: 1131.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I I don't think it was yeah  Exactly. It's very much like slack in that sense and a lot of people use slack and zoom together  And so I actually reject their statement that it was enterprise because I don't think it was if it was enterprise  To your point brian, we wouldn't have seen some of these things because that would have been a complete like, you know  Breaker what I think has happened though is that as there were companies even big companies that might not have had solutions  That worked for this number of people like one of the big frankly like the secret soft of zoom  Not just its ease of use but also its quality and it's it's relative ease for having very large groups of video chat working together  In a way that webex and some of the other solutions just can't do  And and to my to my knowledge  They're still the only you know solution where you can see kind of everyone's video at once in that kind of style  And I know that some other products are working at bringing that type of feature  Up, but but they're the only one who does it. There's a great actually there's a great open source solution

Start time: 1132.20
End time: 1138.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That I use called jitsi  Jitsi, yeah, and I set up in about 10 minutes. I set up a jitsi server at home

Start time: 1139.56
End time: 1151.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That we use how many people can you do with that?  How many people can you do with that because i've heard that it really caps out around 12 or 13?  And and so that would be my only like remark because i'm talking about people who might need like 20 or or it depends on

Start time: 1151.36
End time: 1342.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bandwidth that you have available to it. It can use it can do a hundred people easily  In fact, i've seen bandwidth tests with jitsi. It's very light on the cpu  Usage it's really about bandwidth  The thing to remember with any service is for a video service to work  You know, especially in the way you want where you have the the grid of people  You have to have it unencrypted at the server  side and so when  Zoom says it's end-to-end encrypted. It's not in the same way  We understand end-to-end which means no one can see it except the participants zoom can see it jitsi's the same way you you can  You're it's it's encrypted  But but at some point the server needs to coordinate so it needs to be unencrypted  But the beauty is jitsi is it's open source. You can run your own server. I am and then it is fully private  There's no one can see it. It has it, you know  It has some of the same problems zoom would have you still have to set up a password if you want to protect it  And that's the big problem for churches for schools  Maybe not so much schools, but certainly for churches and recovery groups and groups that want to be public  You can set up a waiting room you can do all sorts of things  But ultimately you can't lock it down because you want anybody who be able  You know who wants to come to the meeting come to the meeting and so that's the problem people are having  And that would be the same problem with I think any service  um, and I think what happened I first hated zoom in  months ago  When they had that problem and a security researcher warned them about this with malware they installed  on the mac a web server  A hidden web server that would run all the time on your mac  Their their idea was of course you should be able to just click a link and zoom would launch  But this hidden web server did not go away when you uninstalled zoom it stayed there  Again, so that even if you uninstalled zoom you click a link zoom behind the scenes does what it needs to do to get  Get a thing going  And and hackers discovered it and started using it to inject malware into macintoshes  Zoom had been warned about this dragged their feet fixing it apple finally had to push out a fix on their own  Apple actually had to push out a malware fix on macintoshes because zoom wouldn't fix it that now zoom says  You know in their credit, I guess that they're going to stop they said this this week  They're going to stop working on new features  Everybody on the zoom team is going to work on privacy and security features  So I guess the proof will be in the pudding  But I I lost faith in zoom when they claimed end to end encryption when that wasn't the case  And when they didn't fix the server problem, and of course then there've been other reported issues the ios  Version sent data to facebook because they used a facebook sdk zoom stopped doing that  But they only seem to stop this stuff after they get caught they were routing calls through a china call center  They said oops, we did that because we were so loaded up. Oops. Well, we won't do that anymore  I don't know. I'm not against zoom. I and i've tried by the way, we use it for all our sales calls  I've tried to get lisa. I said, you know, there's I have this great jitsi server  You could use this it even has our brand in the name because I set up a domain for it  So now zoom everybody knows zoom everybody knows zoom and it's hard to get people to use something else  So i'm hoping zoom will step up there. There's an opportunity here for them to step up

Start time: 1342.62
End time: 1367.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hoping they are too  But i'll i'm with you look when the thing happened last summer with them installing the web server  And honestly, it was their response to that that really bothered me more than it was even the act itself that initially they they barred  The the security researcher they wouldn't communicate  They tried to kind of sweep it under the rug say that it wasn't a big deal  And then once they were properly chastened they had a belated apology and the whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth  And it was very facebooky

Start time: 1369.12
End time: 1373.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very much so and our move fast break things apologize later, then keep doing it

Start time: 1374.28
End time: 1397.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And our team had had been using zoom and after that we were like we're done. We're not using this anymore  And so I was done with it then but again if someone else wants to use it for something i'm not going to be  Like zealous about like oh I refuse to to use the system you want to do  what bothers me now though and and this is the thing that bothers me from  All the different issues they've had is that a I think that one of the reasons that we're seeing this is because they've gone from

Start time: 1398.22
End time: 1399.84
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  10 million to 200 million users

Start time: 1400.06
End time: 1487.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're getting an outsized, you know amount of attention and I think if you put this attention on any sort of service you would see  You would also be able to find flaws, right?  But but the thing that bothers me is that they have this amazing  Differentiator in in the irc right now  We're kind of all talking about how the system hasn't changed in 22 years and they're all terrible and that's basically true  Zoom has been the first thing that works really well. It's easy to set up  I think the reason you saw businesses  enterprises who maybe normally would have gone through a stronger vetting process  Not go through that process is they suddenly had to be remote for the first time and needed to support a large number of people  And just started with it, right? So I think that's another reason why it's had so much adoption  But they have this huge differentiator. They are easy to use. It's well done. It has good features. It's high quality  That's something that is a massive differentiator and rather than using that as the selling point and rather than using that  As what they want to focus on everything that they've done  It seems like has been in you know  Search of like sort of growth hacking and and kind of cutting corners  And it makes me question a lot of fundamental things about the company. I love the product but i'm not  To be totally honest, i'm not convinced by even the the latest blog post that the ceo put out  I I don't really feel like I believe anything  I don't feel like they have proven themselves to be trustworthy, which is so disappointing because this is  Genuinely a product that is head and shoulders a bed of the competition and I feel like they're squandering a lot of this by

Start time: 1487.78
End time: 1508.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Going after ways to growth hack a lot of the things that make zoom good  Jitsi does for instance jitsi uses a more modern protocol web rtc  Which means you don't have to install any software if you're using chrome  It's just a link and it does it in chrome without any additional software  Uh, and that's really nice. That really is easy to use and I look in jitsi. That's great

Start time: 1508.86
End time: 1514.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if we're being honest the the setup process of people getting started with jitsi  Meet whether they use that service or set up their own instance

Or are these guys nefarious as bruce schneider said in his post the errors that zoom  Has committed fall into three broad practices bad privacy bad security bad user configurations  That doesn't that doesn't sound like ineptitude.

Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that the the the comparison to early facebook is especially  I think poignant because of they were it was it was very much like you say move fast break things innovate  Create a great product and you apologize later when we make some mistakes  um  Not a great business model. I think you know facebook is  Is finally feeling the pain of that from a user standpoint and and it's likely to although there it has been  some  Indication that more some of the people who've left facebook are going back during this time  But also people have a ton of time on their hands. So, you know, I don't know if I take that as a long term  um, yeah power

Transcript:  For geeks, so this is for all of us a question  Because we all this is not an unusual  Conundrum for geeks, we know better  We know that this isn't a good idea. We know what's wrong with it. We know in great detail what's wrong with it  And yet, I mean I had a we had a family  Meeting on friday and I tried to use my server my jitsi and one one member couldn't get it working  So we we went back to zoom  For geeks, it's easy to say. Oh, yeah, here's all the reasons. But as you said christina, it's hard  And zoom just works  So what should we say as geeks should I mean I I did a radio show on thursday and I said  Well, yeah, it's got all these problems, but I know it's easy to use so go ahead. It's it's it's not that dangerous. Is it?

Transcript:  I I would be really  Should I tell people not to use it?  I'm not going to tell people not to use it  I am going to say if you're going to be having any sorts of conversations where you might be sharing really private or personal things  That you're you know worried about maybe other people having access to  I I would be I would be sensitive to that like for instance if you know a school is using it  I would say okay. Look, I understand. We can't switch, you know what we're doing mid cycle  But when the school year starts up again, if we're still doing, you know learning from home stuff  Look at using another solution  And and I would say definitely to people even if it causes more friction, you know  Set a password for the meeting that you're doing because as jason said you can send out a link that has the password appended to it  Which still makes it relatively easy to join. It's pretty easy. I'm not at the point still by the way, though

Transcript:  I mean you you can um, uh choose not to install it and there is a way you can join from the web browser  Which they try to hide so you don't have to install. Yeah, they they try to hide it away  This is what I sent to my mom. I like annotated the whole thing and I was like this is what you need to do  To join your bible study. Uh, don't install the app. Um, and so that's kind of what i'm telling people i'm like look  Don't install the app use it from chrome  or a chrome-based web browser because I think it might have some issues in firefox and safari and um, you know,  Don't create an account if you're not super comfortable with that  If you have the opportunity to use alternatives and you think people will do it  I think I would go there but i'm not at least me just speaking for me  I'm not yet at the point where what they're doing even though I don't have a lot of trust in the company  I'm not yet at the point where I want to say to people don't use this  because I don't know if any of the replacement solutions we have are consumer friendly enough where  You know, you can make that assertion without having okay. Well, what are we going to use?

Transcript:  That's the conclusion I came to I told them about other choice choices like jammy and jitsi which are open source  But I said, but you know what it's not the end of the world if you zoom what do you what what do you think brian?  What do you tell people?

Start time: 1840.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell people uh that  The the the people that are also winning aside from zoom would be uh, our friend christina at microsoft and their uh teams product  Who were the ones that were reporting the biggest numbers before zoom revealed their numbers? And by the way christina, I will say this  Uh, the joke I made on my show was you know how the old saw used to be  No one ever got fired for going with ibm  Um, like my my wife's uh architecture firm. It was no question as soon as they knew they had to work from home  They said all right microsoft teams it is. That's good. That's good

Start time: 1873.74
End time: 1886.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's getting better. I mean teams is going to benefit from this but they only have 50 million  Daily actually subscribers  Uh, did did microsoft not offer a free for during this crisis a free there is a free version

Start time: 1887.12
End time: 1898.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a free version. Um the the way that it's set up right now though  Like you can do it as an individual you can do it for schools and for other things  And it's it's I think like a six month free is is what they've got offered and you can sign up with one of the speed

Start time: 1901.72
End time: 1960.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, no actually the some of the personal things you can actually often you can authenticate with a non-microsoft account  The the issue is it's still not going to be as seamless for setting up something like teams as it would be to do something like zoom  Because teams is kind of a combination between something like zoom and something like slack  You know you pat and it's frankly it's sharepoint underneath. So  There's there's like a whole file server component. There's the chat function and then there's the video part  They did announce this week. I believe and I don't know I don't work on that team  So I don't know the details but there's going to be a more consumer version of teams  I think that's going to be coming later in the year. This is the microsoft 365 product which we'll get to yeah  Yeah, and that I think  That I look I think the sooner they can do that the better because there's clearly an appetite for this and  Look, it may be more competition  You know will will make zoom take some of these concerns more seriously and and you know  Get in a way where their engineering and their other kind of business decisions make us all feel a little bit better

Transcript:  And that's what you know what I did do though. It hasn't come yet  I did break down and buy the facebook portal and i'm going to try that out  I got the one where you can put it in front of your tv  Yeah, well, did you see that someone wrote an article a week ago that totally convinced me?  They're like this is the time for it's mainly because I have a three-year-old and a five-year-old  Um, and because grandma has facebook exactly exactly. So the theoretically like I said, I haven't gotten it yet  That tv version. It's like a soundbar you put it underneath the tv  And then it has that facebook technology where it follows people around which three months ago sounded creepy as hell  But right now if I don't have to sit there be the cinematographer the whole time every time we talk to grandma and grandpa  Um, that sounds pretty pretty darn good to me

Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, I figured out why I can't get to jitsi from here  We have too good of an it department cisco umbrella is blocking access to my  To my server. I oh  Okay, russell, could you please open?  But that's a problem, right? I bet you zoom goes right through effect. I know it goes right through probably true  That's another issue. What do you tell people jason?

Start time: 2080.72
End time: 2108.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think the the other so I tell them  Continue to use zoom but the a lot of the onus is on zoom hosts  To improve some of their best practices  Um in these things. I also even before this I told people  You know if you got something really confidential you don't want to be doing it in any of these platforms  Um, what would you use if you really wanted to be private?  I mean a phone

Start time: 2110.26

Start time: 2114.88
End time: 2236.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah for historic reasons if nothing else exactly for all of these things. I I don't have a ton of trust in them. Um, I  I  you know  Today it's zoom but it's because zoom is under the spotlight if it was another one of these products  Products  Another one of these products we'd be kicking the tires on it and we'd be finding all the problems that they have absolutely  Which isn't a terrible thing, right?  Because if you have that much attention and you have that many people using it by all means you  Deserve to have that kind of scrutiny and then uh, you know if they want to stay in business, they will fix these things  um  I think that the challenge is that  Uh, you know the more consumer friendly something is there just is this natural push and pull right security and  And convenience and it's a tough tough line to walk in that's not an excuse for zoom  But I think some of these things are a little bit of an inevitability of they made things so easy  They tried to make things so easy that the the horrible web server thing, which is a terrible idea  But at the core it was one of those things that made it simple enough that you could just send somebody a link  And they could easily get into a video conference one of the hardest problems to solve over the past couple decades as we've talked about  um  and so you know there there's just  Those tough trade-offs that not everybody really wants to to think about or is going to think about you know, the average consumer so  These things are a necessary part of zoom being under the spotlight of so many people using it  They've got they've made some really  Portraits and some things that they've got to fix and I hope that they do to all the you know points that everybody's made  Because it is a good product. They have solved some things and now they really need to  To up their game on on privacy and security while still holding the the balance on usability and I don't envy on that  But um, but that's an important some important work that they're going to need to do

Start time: 2237.14
End time: 2342.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is some question about apparently the washington post found a treasure trove of zoom video recordings on the internet  including one-on-one therapy sessions  Training orientation for workers doing telehealth calls which included people's names and phone numbers small business meetings, which included private company financials  Elementary school classes in which children's faces voices and personal details were exposed a video  Including nudity such as one where an aesthetician teaches students how to give a brazilian wax  May be useful, but probably they didn't expect that to be stored on the internet  Apparently they're in s3 buckets  In a lot of cases how they're getting recorded is zoom doing that in the background is unknown  Schneier's bottom line is zoom is a security and privacy  Disaster, but until now it managed to avoid public accountability because it was relatively obscure now that it's in the spotlight  It's all coming out. Uh, he mentions the company's announcement. They're going to work on security  Let's see if that's anything more than a pr move in the meantime  You should either I think he agrees with what we've all said you should either lock down zoom as best you can or better yet  Abandon the platform altogether. He mentions also jitsi is a distributed free and open source  uh alternative  um  by the way, it's  Before elon musk's spacex banned the use of zoom nasa had forbidden it for some time  It's not I don't think the department of defense allows it people who do pay attention to security  Have have a long uh banned zoom. I think it's just unknown whether zoom  Is poorly run  Or malicious, right? But either way  It's not a good look

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it almost doesn't matter right now. I mean, I think ultimately whether it's it's you know, incompetence or um, uh, you know just  uh people having various purposes  That ultimately is a good question to ask right now. I don't think it matters  It's just a matter of like being aware of what these things are  And and as jason said any place that had this much attention would be having similar scrutiny and we would find similar things  That would make us uncomfortable that said there are some things about this that do seem to be  Even more making me go  Actually, I don't I don't know about this. You know hard to tell but it might actually be worse than

Transcript:  Like that's that's not necessarily true either and hackers have a tool brian krebs tweeted this a couple of days ago  Called z war dial that will find a hundred  uh  Unprotected zoom meetings an hour  You can just run it and run it and run it and find these meetings and I would guess that's what the zoom bombers are using  Uh, and while the feds are saying it's a federal crime you could do jail time  Uh, most of these kids are smart enough and know enough to keep themselves anonymous while they're doing this nasty  nasty work  Um, that's all right with you know what?  For a lot of families  House party's a good choice do play games on house party. Yeah, uh facetime if you've all got iphones or apple devices facetime is  Again encrypted except for apple, but you know people I think trust apple a little bit more than zoom  They certainly have better security policies in place  Um, and you could even use a facebook portal you nut  I bought two of those I bought two of those big tall portals when they first came out  But I didn't I was thinking of giving one to my mom  I didn't want to inflict that on her but we do phone calls all the time over facetime  And it works great. In fact, i'll set mom up  We used to do this with the echo show  I do it with facetime now put her on the ipad and set her up while i'm cooking uh dinner and stuff  And it's a great way to kind of for all of us who are you know, she's 87. She's alone  She's isolated. It's a great way for us to be together and I think  I'm glad zoom exists these it's a it's a tool people are using  And um, you know, i'm glad it exists.

Transcript:  And I think when steve so steve said we're gonna make it open source  In the announcement, I think he they didn't anticipate that there were some encumberment whether it was genuine or not  That would make it impossible for them to do that  So I don't I don't think this was a case of apple walking that back because they wanted to protect their profits  I think it was something else  Let's take a little break. We have lots more to talk about  It doesn't have to be the zoom show, but I thought it'd be good to kind of  Do the ultimate discussion?  uh  of uh of zoom so everybody kind of get that out of our system no more now  I want to talk about outfitting your home office  We're all working at home, right?

Thanks apple  and fortunately that was relatively easy to do other than battery life because  Uh the phone the guts was the same as the 6s, but it was a 6s  Body of the of the five so i'd already reviewed the phone before but uh, they i'd asked them  It was like what does se stand for and they were like  There's there's no official thing that it stands for so I don't know  It's kind of like it's kind of like 10r like I I don't know what with the moniker somebody somewhere knows, but I have not heard

Um, I think they were selling the six  I don't know if they were selling the five s  So because right now they're selling yeah, I could see them dropping and maybe keeping the plus around but I bet when  Next year rolls around they might only you know  sell like last year's 11 and then have the se and not go back as far as is selling um,  Like like the the 10r or something like that, which I don't even think they they're still selling where I think they drop that entirely

Transcript:  So the really crazy thing is they might still sell the eight because they i'm sure they still have it  There's been no reports of that thing going out of inventory  They may drop the price of that eight down to like 199  250 or something which would be insane.

If you a press release update  Yeah, it was a press release  They had briefings with a few members of the media and like I said there was it was the only time i've ever had  An iphone where there wasn't an embargo because usually what happens is  They have a couple of different layers of you know when the announcement goes out  So they have the big unveil at the apple events and then depending on what tier the reviewer is in they get their device  Either, you know two weeks or a week or the week of the the release  And sometimes you might even have a briefing after the product comes out  And this is the only case I ever remember having a briefing and then asking  Okay.

Transcript:  This will be you know, this is these are unprecedented weird times apple. I mean imagine the difficulty apple's having  in looking at these phones because normally  They you know  If you're going to if you're designing this if you're working on this you go into a building that's completely sealed. It's locked  You have to have special access. You can't take anything home. They check you now people are have to I guess take stuff home blumberg  Had an article apple tests its secrecy  somewhere new  employee homes  This is mark german, of course because it's blumberg  And uh, it's it's got to be a challenge for apple  To a lot of things that apple does they never thought about work from home  Uh, they did put out a notice to staff saying whether you're working at home or at the office  It's always critical to keep confidential work confidential  Always securely store confidential items and documents when not in use somebody told me that in some cases they were giving  Employees special safes in which to store these these new products so they could keep them.

Start time: 3350.08
End time: 3410.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem is is that is that china's not letting anybody fly into china?  So what's happened is that yeah, the factories are coming back online, but there's no apple employees to supervise  And the issue is because they very much understandably have to keep the factories under lock and key and you have to have a lot  of special permission to even have like, um, you know a phone that has  A photo capability or anything is that they only have like a set number of approved devices and typically how you can take a photo  In the factory floor is you have to use a certain type of camera  You have to physically take the media card out of it put it into you know  A computer then securely transmit it and so it can add sometimes a day  You know what used to be able to be able to be maybe a couple of minute interaction to get you know  Questions that are happening on the line or other issues back with an engineer  in in san francisco, so  You know that I think is the bigger problem is that they can't you know, people can't fly out and can't be there  So that's I think the bigger challenge rather than the factories are closed or not

End time: 3563.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This would be a good reason to keep support going although  I just I just don't see I  I  I imagine in my mind a scenario of me calling my good friend satya  Say satya do me a favor do a buddy a a a service here  Can you just keep supporting windows 7 to the end of the year and and satya just laughing me out?  Out of the office I don't it doesn't seem like that's something microsoft would even  Consider, I mean they're doing a lot of other things  But that I don't see I don't see happening  according to  95 mac iphone 9 case inventory is already at best buy  Did were you is that what you were doing there?

Transcript:  So then put all these things together number one the the weather app on ios has sucked out  For months and then suddenly if we can have widgets on the home screen that are active  Put it all together and I think we can see pieces coming together here. So so yeah, tell me this is ios 14

Start time: 3775.48
End time: 3783.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and uh, you have to look at the code is this from the  Leaked code or is this from an actual beta of 14? This is from the leaked code, isn't it?

Start time: 3822.82
End time: 3832.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, or it might be similar to like what the the one that they have on on mac os where you know, depending on what kind of day  It is, you know, it'll it'll get a darker or lighter. Uh, so that would be cool. Yeah

End time: 3873.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is one of the things I love about android one of the few reasons  I would I would hate to have to give up android is widgets  The android and this is where I think apple's really behind they have an updated springboard. The last update was folders  I mean, I guess for for ipad you now have the the quick look on the left, but  It's really pretty much not so much changed since the iphone came out  Uh, and meanwhile android you have multiple third party launchers available to you  You can put live widgets. You could have a live weather forecast on your desktop  This is the one thing that I think has been missing from the iphone. I hope this is  True, and I would love to see this home screen  uh widgets

Start time: 3876.18
End time: 3915.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think brian's onto something about you know, the the timing of this, you know with uh, because you figure  It's not likely to come out until the fall and so if they you know, they've been probably working together  typically these these  Acquisitions come after the team has been working together with apple  So probably for the last six months they've been working together and apple sort of decided  You know what? We're going to do some really cool stuff with this and we like it so much  Why don't we just why don't we just buy this?  um, and so  That makes a lot of sense. Uh, and I agree that the sort of lie  I remember the live tiles that was like the one thing I liked on the windows phone was I thought that was that great

Start time: 3916.34
End time: 3955.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved that. Yeah  So right now i'm looking at my iphone, uh home screen there is one icon that's live  It's of course the clock icon and that was relatively recent. It actually shows the time  I've seen many people say gee. I wish the weather icon  Showed weather maybe with dark sky now the weather icon  Should actually show the weather. Oh, yeah, and the calendar icon shows the day the date  Yeah, um, but that it doesn't really they're not real. This is basically a grid of icons. That's not that useful. I'd love to see  Them do more so you think 2007 yeah since 2007 a grid of icons. So you think that's why why did they  Why did they buy dark sky?

Start time: 3956.04
End time: 3964.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  aside from the fact that as I said their their weather app is terrible and has been sitting in a  Crap folder on my iphone for years now. Yeah. No, that's a good reason

Start time: 3965.16
End time: 3971.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it uses weather channel and weather channel got bought by ibm too. Yeah, watson watson's doing the weather now

Start time: 3972.68
End time: 4090.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and I they they probably don't want to to use that they want to have their own  I mean honestly the more I think about it  Even though to me the biggest shame like I I definitely understand for android fans  Why they would be very upset understandably for the app going away for me  The bigger bummer is that the api is going away. However, as we're having this conversation  it strikes me that the api was probably the the really valuable part of it here because  Um, I I profiled dark sky back in 2013  They've been around for a little over a year at that point and  Right after they kind of announced um the the api  But I think before anybody had really adopted it and I I thought it was so interesting then that that was going to be their  Business model, you know was the api and you've seen a ton of apps and services  Use it and and they've had their usage model, but I never have gotten the sense that it's been something that's been like  Spectacularly profitable for them. Like I think that it's been profitable and they've been able to continue to evolve the app  But it hasn't been one of those like runaway, you know success things, right?  so  I could see if you're buying this the app is beautiful and it has good features  But it's really that api that has the power especially if you could put it into  You know your home screen you could you know, put it on the apple watch  You could use it in these places where these third-party apps that are using the api are already doing really interesting things  Like you mentioned carrot weather and there are some other ones  That the reason you would want this is so you can get that real-time information and be able to use it across your devices  And platforms and if it's something that other people could use, I mean, it's kind of terrible for the existing  People who've been using the api at least they get a year and a half or or so, you know to wind down and find another solution  but  You know it's still you know, part of me would wish that that would remain open to people  But you can also understand why somebody who's buying the company would be like no actually we we really like this  And this is what we're going to be just using for own internal purposes

Start time: 4091.08
End time: 4107.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just think of it like siri or apple maps, right?  It's it's another one of these things that it's a pillar that  They feel like they need to have as the future part of the they want to have deeper integration into the os  Think about all the things that weather touch and does yeah exactly

Start time: 4107.96
End time: 4148.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also and I keep trying to stir up this controversy, but uh, nobody's buying  But I think there is a controversy with weather in general the most of the services including dark sky use  weather information from the national weather service  And that information has been offered as most by the way, every nation meant most nations have  National weather services and they offer that it's taxpayer paid and they offer that information for free  The national weather service I don't think has an api  so I think what a lot of weather apps do is they take the raw data from the weather service and they  Their meteorologists then create forecasts out of it, right?

Start time: 4148.90
End time: 4162.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they used to have you used to have weather underground which was kind of a you know  Anybody could have their own weather station and that was kind of a collective of a third-party information and then ibm bought that what?  Like five years ago. Yeah, so there's been in my mind

Start time: 4162.20
End time: 4195.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's been this and john oliver did a great piece on it last year  There's something there's been a move in the federal government. There's a there's a group of people that want to start charging for noah data  uh, yeah trump proposed failed  to take the uh, the the founder of weather the weather channel to have him run the national weather service  Fortunately congress got wind of that and said yeah  No, I don't think so, but there's something going on with weather and and it seems like ibm's making a big play  To do its own weather service basically

Start time: 4196.50
End time: 4270.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, yeah, because so weather channel bought weather underground first  I just googled and found that out in 2012 and I remember that in the weather underground community was apoplectic  And then ibm bought weather underground but didn't buy the weather channel  But then they bought the weather channel and so ibm is clearly working on on something  I'm from i'm from atlanta where the weather channel, um, it was based  And I actually when I was in high school, I was friends with a guy who was at georgia tech  in grad school who uh was like  You know meteorologist studying that stuff and and he worked at the weather channel for for many years and it was really interesting  I mean this was you know, like, you know close to 20 years ago now  But I remember the conversations being very very interesting about the stuff that they were doing but you're right  It's an interesting question about how we have like the private sector essentially  Running and in some cases, you know using the public resources around weather  But also in some cases they're creating their own right?  Like that's that's kind of the the the rub is that a lot of they're making investments that the national weather service  Might not be you know, it's just historically it was smaller companies more independents and the weather channel has had various ownership structures over the years  too  But I think when you see, you know a giant like ibm buy it. That's when you're like, huh

Start time: 4271.40
End time: 4306.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think it's very fitting that the weather company is a subsidiary of ibm's cloud platform  Yeah, it's a it's a tangled web  And and I just think apple buying into this  Is I mean it could very it could be very simple. They could say hey these engineers are great. It's an echo hire  They could say hey, we want a live weather widget on ios 14. It could be as simple as that or it could be apple has aspirations  To do something more like apple maps  With weather and they see ibm coming in here and saying well, we're going to do weather

End time: 4352.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right  Well that that to me I think is is what i'm kind of sort of hopeful for  Um, if there is any kind of hope to be had about this for the third party, um, and india companies that use  dark, um, uh sky as api is that  This might the fact that now essentially, you know two giant tech companies own the biggest kind of you know input things  You know weather channel and and dark sky this might be an opportunity  For a third party to come in and maybe the data won't be as good at first  Maybe it won't you know have the same power in the beginning  But this might be an opportunity for a third party or or even kind of an organization to step in and say okay  We're going to create an alternative that others can use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the I think the reason the dark sky was appealing to a lot of people was that their terms were their api usage terms  were  pretty reasonable  whereas some of these other services i'm sure they exist but aren't going to exist maybe for people who either have a free or  A 99 cents or a dollar 99, you know like you know mobile app  So I think that's that that's that's the bigger question when you presumably have a bunch of calls  Going to check those things out. So  But but it is look take it take advantage of that absolutely, you know get your name out there  Because yeah, I mean this is a massive market for the climate change for other things and for a bunch of different industries  Iot is is heavily involved in many cases around, you know things like agriculture and and you know  Weather sensors and data around that.

Yeah, I thought that was pretty funny  All right, let's get back to the tech news that was a little break a little break from the tech news  This actually in the has gonna get heavy again  But the intercept and others have had lots of articles about  the threat  proposed posed now by the fact that  We're all trying to you know, beat this virus. And so we're looking at  location apps  and using  Using location information to fight it, which is of course a good idea and  Yet there's always this risk that when you do that  You open a Pandora's box  I mean, let's not forget that it was after 9-eleven that the Patriot Act was passed that gave the government unprecedented powers to snoop on us and  Is it still in effect?

Transcript:  But I can't say I got the link if  That's right  You can read from it or talk about yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the point that I took away from it was this is Mohammed  Tej are you know, however, that's pronounced but he's with the ACLU of Southern California his point was  that it you could have data-driven approaches to  Tracking the pandemic but what would be a good idea is to before you start doing it have limits built in place  Yes, and then require  Justifications every step of the way so that alright. Here are the parameters for how we will use  Data from Facebook we will use data from Google and your cell phone and all that stuff  But every time you go beyond parameter one to parameter two to parameter three  You have to justify it in the same way that you know  The police have to go to a court and justify, you know increased surveillance and things like that

Transcript:  and then the this week the stories that were coming out that in the US the  Municipalities that are using it that have started to use it in recent weeks  The reason that they're able to use it is because they're going to the ad companies and the the ad brokers  Because there's no laws in place for what they can and cannot do with them so much information  And so that data is just sitting there  So you're starting to get municipalities going to them because they're in the business of selling that data anyway

Transcript:  Yeah, and as Bob says in our chat room I'd opt into tracking for public health in a heartbeat  That's a good. This is a great benefit and maybe could help us end this quarantine faster and do it more effectively, right and after quarantine  We've got to think about well  How are you know this the virus is still going to be out there and potent for at least another year and a half  Until we get a vaccine. How do we track?  Infections and shut them down so that we don't have to all go into quarantine all of this can be enabled by this kind of

Transcript:  Location information here's some of the apps some of the apps that are already doing it in those other countries  Again, it's a thing where you know you turn on Bluetooth. Let's say everyone has an app  We agree to it we say for the course of this pandemic. I will turn on  The coronavirus test and trace app right and then it would run over Bluetooth so that it would keep track of other phones that you  Come into contact with within say six feet or whatever  So that then if you are tested and you come down with it  Then they own then and only then and that gets into the point of having these guardrails in place  Then they could go and see well Leo was within six feet of these  72 people over the last week and so let's go test them. I think it makes sense. Yeah. Yes

Start time: 5399.74

Transcript:  but I understand also the concern these are the  Suggestions Sam makes in his article health officials must drive data decisions  It can't come from government. Oh, we think this is a good idea  Yeah, it should come from health officials trying to do the right thing for health  Coronavirus related surveillance must be clearly justified against the costs  Data collected should expire  There shouldn't be just oh, hey, we got all this data. Let's keep it  And it should be walled off  It should be treated like the US Census is currently treated as as privileged information not to be used by other agencies  Not to be used to arrest people or to find undocumented immigrants things like that  I think these are these are  Absolutely good points raised and normally the intercept  Yeah, maybe a little bit more to the left left leaning than I like  But I think in this case, I think these are things we have to really pay attention to I

Start time: 5462.14
End time: 5507.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think the core point from Muhammad Taj Sar from the you know, ACLU there is is really critical  It's just that governments tend to make these  requests  With it's kind of like okay. Let's just let's take that data  You know, right and and once they acquire the data then once it then it becomes privileged government information  We're all the sudden somebody else wants to use data for something else and they're like, oh we've got oh, we've got that data  We can go look at that to figure this out. It's like no no that that's not what nobody's there to say  Oh, no, that wasn't what we originally got that data for they just now look at it is like  Oh, we now have the access to this  So we're gonna use it for all these other things that we might want to use it for and that's the key thing to  Make sure does not happen in something like this. Yeah

Start time: 5508.40
End time: 5585.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that that's my big concern is that  You know just history is born out as as we're all kind of discussing that anytime you ever give any  institution government or otherwise  additional access and it's just for a short period of time like they don't like to give that access back and as  Trying and as you know  We're all in panic and these are like extraordinary times  They cause for extraordinary measures that has to be balanced with we can't give up our civil liberties and some of the are the core  parts of what makes America America simply because we're in this time because we will as the  Patriot Act it's a great example. We will never get those powers back and and you know, we have to look at  What are the opportunities to do this without within the systems that we have in place because there are opportunities  It might be easier if certain things are suspended, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible  So, you know, I think I'm gonna err on the side of civil liberties every day of the week similar to the few weeks back  You know, there were reports of them wanting to do, you know  So tracking about you know, where people's activities are to try to aid and you know, it's talking to spread and it's like  That's a that's a great idea. I don't want the government being aided by Facebook or Google or or anybody else  Tracking my location no matter what they say. The reason is like I don't want that, you know

Transcript:  Google released that thing this week where they're showing and it's completely anonymized and all that stuff but showing the amount of  visits to parks and things like that and and groups and things I mean the problem is this is a I  agree with everything that everyone has said in terms of the civil liberties concern the the government power concerns  but at the same time in the same way that you know in in  1919 or whenever the the Spanish flu thing happened. They didn't even understand fully things like  antibiotics and vaccines and stuff we have we have the advantage right now of if the problem is  tracking  Testing and tracing and tracking contacts with people we happen to have the perfect tool because everyone is carrying around  supercomputers in their pockets so that there has to be some way to take advantage of the fact that for the first time in human  History we have the perfect tools in everybody's pocket to stop it an epidemic to trace an epidemic  That there has to be some way to do it and not let this perfect tool go to waste and and I  Agree with all the concerns, but at the same time it's like your house is on fire and you're standing there with a bucket of water

They have other

Transcript:  Singapore has and there's a couple of other South Korea  I don't know if they're using but I believe Singapore has one of those apps that something like six hundred thousand people have downloaded  Again, sorry, it's because I've been doing a podcast on this every day for three weeks, but  You're an expert. Yeah, the counterbalance is no way. I'm not an expert  I just read all the things the counterbalance is there's another country who's the identity eludes me right now that they've encouraged  I think it's one of the countries in the Middle East  They they created their own app encouraged all of their population to download it and when security researchers looked at it  It was one of those apps where it's like, oh, yeah  Also, it's gonna grab all of your right messages all of your photos and everything right so

Start time: 5726.10
End time: 5772.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my point is that even Singapore it's not a requirement right now if I'm if I know correctly right like that's so  and I would also I would also posit that the Singapore government is very different from the US government in terms of  You know  There are a lot of reasons why they've been more ahead of this than we have and one of them is that it's  strictly a place where people listen to the government and follow rules more and and because  That they know that the government will will take action  It's it's it's very different from our country  But I guess my point was gonna be even those places that have done this it hasn't been like it's become kind of like  requirements so I  Look and I'm like is this is this necessary right now because I would argue that part of the reason that Singapore  Has been so much better at it has nothing to do with the app  It has everything to do with you know, their system of government which

Start time: 5773.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely. Let me do one more real quick  Devil's advocate for you because Leo and I were talking about this before we started recording  Which is alright if we want to buy the summer get people back to work some people back to work  Lee and I were talking about the second half of it, which is in theory if people  Contracted disease and recover from it. They might be immune for a period of time  So those people can start to go back to work  But all the people all of us sitting at home that haven't contracted it to send people back out into the workforce  You're going to need some sort of a situation where you can monitor those people  So what if it was a situation where they said Christina?  You can come back into the office as long as you download this app  Maybe it's done through Microsoft or whatever. So there's layers of protection, but it's like some sort of a situation where  If in in the office an outbreak happens or someone in July comes down with it after people have cautiously gone back to work  Well, then we can immediately lock down that section of Microsoft and allow the rest of Microsoft to continue working  I'm just saying that there has to be some way once the sheltering in place regime  Hopefully ends sometime soon  Because inevitably there's gonna be flare-ups again  And so there has to be some way to set up a system to immediately seal off like a leaking ship  Right areas where flare-ups occur and and I don't disagree with that

Start time: 5859.10
End time: 5869.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think my response to that would be that I'm in favor of that  But I would wonder if the better response isn't an app but getting widespread testing and getting widespread antibody testing

Start time: 5869.92
End time: 5926.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to me this is what I'm saying. It's all part and parcel  It's a combination of things because even in a best-case scenario  And this would be a best-case scenario that some small percentage of the population gets it as opposed to 70%  The idea of people going back to work has to be I want to be safe  You know  I'm not willing to go back to work until you can start to give me assurances that  in in your we work or whatever if that wing of the we work someone had a  Got reinfected or something like that that you could know that within hours you could begin to like send people home within hours  so I'm saying that  Again, there are tools that we have today that we've never had before  That would allow some of us and some large portion of us to start to get back to life as normal but that also includes  Non-technical things like maybe we need to have people outside of every office just testing temperatures and things like that

Start time: 5927.20
End time: 5984.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I would just say that I guess my fear is that we're immediately going to this place of using  Surveillance and technology to try to contain this when we aren't even doing in the United States that the basic things that we need  to do which is testing and  Until you have widespread testing and testing over and over again  So it's not just one of those things where you've been tested once but you know testing people repeatedly  I don't have that we don't have that infrastructure like to me  That's that makes more sense if you want to use technology to aid with getting people tests. I'm all about that  but  Yeah, but I'm concerned about some of these other reaches just because I think you give access to that information  You're never going to get it back ever and you know, it's like the dark night, you know, it's like, you know  He made you know him he made him Lucius like destroy the tool because it was too powerful  It's that same sort of thing. It's like once you have that I I don't care how  Caring and how good the intentions are of any company or government. They're not going to give up that that access

Transcript:  I just they're just not it's interesting too that in in all of this a lot  We're starting to understand a little bit better how companies are tracking us and keeping that information. There's a company called a unicast  That's business is selling location information, which they collect from a variety of apps and so forth  They've actually made a social distancing scoreboard  They know so much about people's locations that you can actually go look and see how your county is doing  Let's see how New York is doing in social distancing New York County, New York. Oh  Good, you guys are doing well a minus. I don't know. Look out my window right now. You see a lot of people out there

Transcript:  We should think it's fine. They already have this information. I'm what I would say get it  Or well what well the same way that they can get other things  Yeah  Probably services on your cell phone what I'm opposed to is having more information that we're not already giving like that

Start time: 6082.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm opposed to is giving more access. Right? Are you guys aware of the the Kinsa smart?  I use it. I love the crisis. Yeah, so you've seen their maps as well  Yeah, the health weather of right that's data that we didn't know that they were keeping and then no we did

Transcript:  No, I take no that's not true  Kinsa has been handing out these thermometers  They have over a million of them out there to schools for precisely this purpose that's anonymized data  There's no way of knowing which their mom is owned by anybody but it before kovat it was about flu  But it's very valuable information  So we see here it even says influenza like illness near you. You can see what's typical a typical trends  So you can see where the hot spots are and observed and this is based on thermometers. They've been handing out  I actually went out and bought one parts partly because I wanted to take my temperature with a Bluetooth enabled  Thermometer every day but also I'm glad to help in fact, they've tied into the University of California at San Francisco  So every day I think it's UCS now who are they tied in with? I can't remember. Is it UCS of?  Say again  Aura, that's right. My ring is tied with them with UC. This also is measuring my temperature  I have temperature measurements all over the place, but this is kind of cool. So I actually have a timeline of my  temperatures now, you know, unfortunately  Unlike influenza  There's a kovat has a lot of asymptomatic  Cases, we don't know how many but it you know, this is some valuable information as well  And you can even see how we get a better report card here  if I look at Sonoma County because we have flattened the curve at least according to  Temperature readouts if I look at the graph here, this is normal for this time of year with influenza and we're well below  That well below normal  Because of I think as a social distancing nobody's getting the flu ward

The data is anonymized. There's no way of knowing. It's your thermometer and  Be this they've been doing this for years. This is a this is actually very interesting  public health effort from Kinsa, so  Hey, if you if you know cobalt  good news  New Jersey wants to hire you  New Jersey wants to hire you apparently the New Jersey  financial assistance software runs on a  this is from the register, of course creaking mainframes and  Governor Phil Murphy is looking for  people who know cobalt because  He called it cobalt  Computer skills because that's what we're dealing with in these legacies  We have systems that are 40 plus years old  There'll be lots of post mortems one of them on our list will be how the heck did we get here where we literally need?  cobalt programmers

Transcript:  This is really funny, you know you you mentioned Leo that I used to work with in enterprise  With tech Republic and I remember in 2001 we did this story  It was one of our most popular stories of the year was like the hottest skill of 2001 and it was almost this was almost  like a joke  Was cobalt programming because there were all these old government systems that had you know  Modernized and so there weren't enough people that still knew the language  To actually keep them running and they had no plans to you know, make them obsolete and and move them to new  systems

Transcript:  Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. No, it's so funny my my late aunt  She was an engineer at CSX and she  Was in very very high demand in around the year 2000 because she knew cobalt and they were having to fix all those systems  And I think that she did ultimately I think she moved to Java  But she was still I mean you're exactly right Jason like we've had 20 years ago. We were having this conversation  about we've got to like update these systems and  Just nope, if you know cobalt, there's always gonna be a place for you. I think is the lesson

Transcript:  There there are a lot of these systems like this in government and and it's not just cobalt  There's some other these outdated systems that it would cost  In some cases often hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade to get the same capabilities that they already have  Nothing you know added features know anything that's hard to sell  Hundreds of thousands of dollars to just get the exact same stuff on modern architecture  Sure, and the problem is you're almost never gonna justify

Start time: 6403.38
End time: 6459.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the problem is even if you did get it exactly the same  There are sometimes like there are bugs maybe that were written around in that program that if you then you know modernize it  Go away and like what are the repercussions there?  I mean I can totally understand why for places that have budgets where they wouldn't want to a pay hundreds of thousands of dollars  To get the exact same thing which from their perspectives like well, it's working  Why do this but also from the perspective like you don't know what the what the potential ramifications are of making this upgrade  I think in general it's probably a good idea to try to you know  at a certain point assess your legacy systems and look at how do we modernize the whole thing and  You can amortize the cost more easily  But it's certainly not one of those things where a lot of people are gonna have that budget to do it and I can see  Why it would keep getting pushed, you know to the side every single year. Okay, we could spend a few hundred thousand dollars doing this or  updating something, you know, it's

I have to say hey  Let's take a little break when we come back lots more to talk about  Oh one more thing. I should mention if we're gonna mention cobalt. Let's not forget who wrote call ball the late Admiral Grace Hopper  One of the great  computer  programmers of our time and a woman and and the woman who also was the first person to use the word bug in  relationship to a computer  Program our show today brought to you by  Extra hop another new sponsor, but a one that everybody's gonna want to know about because as we're starting to  Work from home if everything moves up into the cloud  You need to protect yourself extra hop is a threat monitoring system that that keeps an eye on your  business on your cloud and  Helps you detect threats and performance issues.

I think this is their first ad on the network. Good job extra hop  This is a this is the time for you. This is the time to check it out extra hop comm  slash twit  Speaking of the cloud. Let's talk a little bit about Amazon. Remember they said they were gonna hire a  100,000 new employees. They're already hired  80,000 workers including a member of our twit family  Let me I'll hide his name here because I don't I don't want him to get in trouble  He said I'm actually working at his Amazon warehouse at the moment  He posted this in their Twitter community forums with our business closed an extra time  I noticed Amazon is advertising for jobs like crazy  I always wanted to see how the warehouse is working if they're as bad as the news suggest  So I applied for a temporary part-time  Position and he says there are lots of things in place to keep the warehouse workers safe  They have to keep two meters apart everywhere lots of cleaning of handles doors tables in the canteen  Cleaning the scanner and arm computer. That's the thing you wear on your arm as you're doing the pick  Only one person per table in the canteen shift times are staggered to stop everyone arriving at the same time  When I signed in this morning to my scanner, I was asking questions about  From Amazon about if the safety measures were being obeyed  And that we were made and helped to keep two meters apart, which I felt good about so there are a few little gaps  It's actually  Worth reading the whole post. I really appreciate the post  He mentioned that the sign-in pen was being shared and then he updated it a couple of days ago  It says no more sharing this shows the sign-in pen  Somebody scans us in and out from a distance now so they don't have to sign in anymore with a manual pen  So I think that's kind of good news Amazon workers though did go on a strike  You may remember this and you probably saw the story kind of a shocking story that the guy who led the strike Chris Smalls  Was fired but Amazon said oh no, we fired him because he violated quarantine rules  kind of  Convenient and then you might have seen the  internal notes an Amazon  Lawyer was taking at a meeting suggesting how they could it use PR by calling the guy  dumb and  Kind of it it's it's a it's a not it does not reflect well on Amazon  No

Transcript:  Inarticulate was the word inarticulate. Oh god means that's such a dog whistle in such a terrible way and  Amazon's culture from what I understand is is very right heavy where people write things a lot, you know  They take notes a lot. It's it's very driven by by writing communications and and so  It's interesting to me that this is one of the first times that I can recall that we've seen a leak of these sorts of meeting  notes  released in the public like this and

Start time: 6887.24
End time: 6925.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah to your point does not reflect well at all no matter no matter and Jason Del Rey also had a leak of  I think it was yesterday some internal Amazon messaging between employees that them saying, you know  If if this is the sort of stuff that leadership is doing like what are we even doing here?  So I agree with you Christina. It's the first time that I've seen, you know  We've seen this happen in other big tech companies, but it's the first time we've started to see leaks  from the Amazon rank-and-file and faithful that are like  We we we do not approve of what is being done in our name here

Transcript:  Vice got leaked meeting notes from Amazon's general counsel  David Zapolsky saying talking about Chris Smalls  He's not smart or articulate and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him  We will be in a much stronger PR position  Then simply explaining for the empty time  How we're trying to protect workers if we just put him up in front of the microphone let them talk to him  You should meet the PR strategy is to make Smalls the face of the entire union organizing movement because he's not smart or articulate  Oh, yeah. Yeah now admittedly. It's a private meeting  Yeah, people might write things they would never say out loud

Transcript:  So Polsky and a statement device said my comments were personal and emotional  I was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of the other  Amazonians I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me  Yeah, on the other hand, he was also a union an organizer not a union organizer, but an organizer and organized a strike  Instacart says the strike against  Instacart on Monday didn't hurt their business at all Instacart the pickers and delivery folks for Instacart were saying we  We need hazard pay. We need face masks. We need wipes  Maybe it didn't hurt their business, but Instacart by the end of the week had provided  Additional pay and the materials that the workers wanted. So sometimes these things  Get the job done  It's it's a tough time and it's tough for everybody who's out of work, you know, we're with you  I you have my deepest sympathy  This is the time when the cracks and the inequalities in the American economic system  Rear their ugly head because so many people so many people I know  Are no longer working in restaurants or salons or service businesses their home travel agents  you know, it's it's  It's a difficult time right now and I don't know what the answer is  South by Southwest was called off in Austin  Amazon is going to show a virtual film festival for the films that didn't get shown  At South by Southwest. It'll be a virtual film festival on Amazon Prime. I think that's kind of fun  People are watching a lot more TV than they used to  Filmmakers this is great. Yeah, they were notified and given a chance to opt in  It'll be a 10-day run sometime later this month  according to a South by  press release  The festival will be free to US audiences on Amazon Prime video. You do not have to be a prime member  You'll just have to have a free Amazon account and the filmmakers will be paid a screening fee  Even though you won't be paying anything

Transcript:  Nice. Yeah, I like that  And you know, honestly, I mean it's nice that it's free  But I'm hoping that for some of the other film festivals, you know, Tribeca  You know, there are some other ones kind of coming up that they will embrace the full kind of you know, virtual thing  Tribeca has done that to a certain extent over the years  But not for the whole slate because there are plenty of people like me who will pay like I'd be happy to pay, you know  You know what a cost of a pass would be to enjoy those things online to still support the filmmakers  Like I don't need it to be free just because it's online streaming like that's that's not a concern  Like I'd be happy to support their work  So I hope that other film festivals as they start to explore being online like you can charge for this stuff  It's great if Amazon wants to step up and do a partnership and it's still gonna give the filmmakers a fee  But I mean you can still charge for these things the people the audience of people who go to film festivals  And you see movies like most of us. I think we genuinely want to support the arts and  Just because we can't go outdoors doesn't mean that we're not still willing to pay for that. Yeah

Transcript:  Certainly we're watching a lot more TV I walked downtown  Yesterday walked by the movie theater, which of course is shuttered and it was kind of sad to see all these posters  You know, they have the display boxes all the way around the theater for movies that will never open in the theaters  But now are being shown streaming for 20 bucks to rent  I think I  Don't know is that is that a reasonable thing for a film company to do?  We're not gonna be able to release the trolls world tour. So let's offer it for rent at 20 bucks  It's still cheaper than the ticket price. I think so. I think so

Transcript:  I mean, I think that there there's a big question to be asked about  because I worry very much about the future of  Distributors after all this is over meaning it were exhibitors. Yeah, sorry  But exhibitors I worry about  Absolutely, and their margins are already thin they've already been you know pushed  They're already getting less percentage from the students than they used to you know, they have rents  they have employees and and my fear genuinely is that if you get rid of the exhibitors a  Big portion of the entire economy around Hollywood goes away that I don't think people are quite ready to embrace

Transcript:  We can just go online not realizing that there's a whole long tail that's involved in that where you know  Yes, Netflix spends 15 billion dollars a year on  Entertainment, but that's still a fraction of what the global box office is  So I worry very much about the exhibitors having said that I do think that in times like this for certain films  It certainly makes sense to say is $20 for a rental because to your point if you're a family and that's  Trolls to that's gonna be the audience  $20 it's going to be less than the price of everybody going out and getting tickets  So, you know and if you need kind of a distraction or whatnot that that's a good way to do it  But at the same time, I think you know  I don't know how successful it will be for other types of films because there are certain  audiences who will pay $20 for the rental and then there are certain audiences who won't because they will just say well  I'm just gonna wait for it to either, you know come out so I can buy it or  Come to one of the services that I subscribe to so I think that that's what we're they're gonna figure out  What the actual I guess demand is of people willing to do that because they've done day-and-date  Releases, I think Steven Soderbergh first did a day and date release with bubble in like 2006  I think that was with what with the with video on demand on on Comcast and some of the other cable providers  So this has been something we've been doing for you know, almost 15 years

Everyone went back to the movie theaters  Yeah, but then at the same time the you know  you've seen all of the Marvel movies and all the big tentpole movies moved back to the to the winter because  Those are the things that are guaranteed to bring people back to the theater  it is kind of even though we're saying that the Alamo draft house has  This it's an event or it's it's more of an experience you can go and you can get food  But you're not gonna see a Marvel movie there. That's for exactly right  So then the problem is is it's what the problem has been with Hollywood for the last couple years  It would be a smaller movie a 20 million dollar budget movie a period piece movie where well  People are have already been starting to say well  I just wait for that to come when I can watch it on how at home anyway  So if I was one of these indie theaters, why not?

I'll I don't want to end on a sad note. Let's see alright. I'll do these and I'll find something good  Jack Schofeld who is the Guardians ask Jack tack columnist died at 72 this week not related to kovat  Although whenever you hear this now every time I see somebody's name trending on Twitter. I'm going oh my god  Oh my god, and Nick justinan who was the technology writer at the AP for a very long  time  Passed away.

Start time: 8913.94
End time: 8957.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting timing. I think I read something. I didn't read the article  I just saw the headline that is either like the best or or the worst timing for a launch  You know, I've I'm intrigued by this because I think the concept is interesting  I definitely think that there's a market for it there depends on the execution a lot content is hard  But but Jeffrey Katzenberg, I would I would never bet against him  Because his you know track record speaks for itself. But uh, yeah, I mean, it's it's interesting  I think that there is probably a place especially as we're all consuming stuff to kind of sit in between, you know, YouTube and  You know Netflix and Hulu and and tick-tock and other things. So I'm  I'm definitely I'm definitely gonna sign up. I went to their

Start time: 8979.58
End time: 9022.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because number one  Who who needs why why are they hamstringing themselves and doing the short form so like  Some of the things are just like little web episodes episodes or whatever  But some of them are shot like real movies where you have to watch it ten minutes at a time  So why are they not just putting it together as a two-hour thing?  It's like this weird experiment and not to put on the the history hat but Leo you will remember this  I mean Katzenberg and Spielberg and all those guys did pop.com back in the dot-com bubble and it was the same thing  Where he was obsessed with five minute or two? It's like Katzenberg  Somebody told him that kids today don't have an attention span or something and he it's just never left his head. That's right

Start time: 9023.40

Start time: 9028.08
End time: 9043.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that's my point. It's like why are they artificially?  Artificially  Hamstringing themselves like just so okay. We we're only gonna make the quibi the name is quick bites  So like that's their whole reason for being but I just don't understand why they're doing it that way

Start time: 9045.54
End time: 9076.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what I find I will find intriguing is  If they find if this is a new medium where they can say look you got you know  That's what tick-tock did and and vine before it and it became something pretty important  Because the constraint made it interesting so I'm if you just take a 22-minute  You know sitcom and chop it up into chunks or a two-hour movie and chop it into chunks  That's not interesting and I'm afraid which is what they seem to want given their Hollywood roots. They may do that

Start time: 9077.28
End time: 9088.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I'm with you. It's like if that's all it is and that's not interesting  But this has always been the promise of these mediums to me and we've seen some people do it successfully  But many of them not usually by accident right? Yeah

Start time: 9089.76
End time: 9093.78

Transcript:  Who knew that vine was gonna become make these celebrities and stars, right?

Start time: 9094.02
End time: 9154.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you adapt the medium that's actually I think you're right. It's an interesting constraint  But if all you're gonna do is chop the existing things up  I mean it's similar to I think Netflix now people finally hit their stride and starting to produce  TV shows for the age of binging but for a long time and in summer still produced this way  It is still very much produced in an episodic way  Even if all the episodes are released at once and that adjusts your story structure, you know  You have to give background you have to catch people up because you're you know  Producing them in capsules whereas now we have started to see more shows go into a we're not going to give you the backstory  We're just gonna continue more previously on right  But but you know  It'll be interesting to see like if it if they can start to create new things just for this medium Maya  My podcast co-host Simone de Broche for  Polygon where she works they are working on something for a quibi and it won't be launching at launch  But it'll be available after that and she seems pretty excited. So very least I

Start time: 9156.00
End time: 9203.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would never root against Simone. I think she's great. I  I'm not a good person  And so I'm rooting against him because I have a little it's a little it's almost schadenfreude  I don't want them to succeed because I don't want to see Hollywood march into  Our realm I feel like if if it organically develops if vine or YouTube or  Periscope or or tick-tock  organically develops as a new medium  From the ground up from the grassroots up. That's great. If Hollywood says oh, let's see what the kids are doing  We're gonna make up something that the kids will like  Come from the top down. I hate that and so I think it won't work  That's why I'm rooting against them and it may work who knows but that's what we don't you think

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think I think Netflix is probably the closest we have to that right or maybe Prime  But even then I think you could argue like the reason that Apple TV's initial  Forays into constant work is they didn't have content people doing anything, you know, and that's why we got things like, you know  You know attack of the apps or whatever the the game show was called  And and once they hired actual content people from Hollywood the content got a lot better  So, I don't know you need a mix but it's interesting but I'm with you. I mean, I'm skeptical but I'm also  It's I don't know any times this much money has gone into something and you have people  This cache is either going to succeed despite the hype cycle or it's going to be one of those really interesting  You know, wow people really thought that was gonna be a thing right it wasn't you know, I
