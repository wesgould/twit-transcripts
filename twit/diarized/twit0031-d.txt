Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 31 for November 20, 2005.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And we're back to Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a stripped down basic, you know, TWiT unplugged today.  John C. Dvorak is on Skype from his Fortress of Solitude.  And Steve Gibson is also joining us from his Fortress of Solitude.  We're all kind of by ourselves. It's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Patrick's down.  Maybe somebody else will show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll keep an eye on the Skype and maybe somebody will come in.  Patrick is down in Baja Racing, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Fortress of Solitude is the only way to get any work done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you guys are. We're all in our offices by ourselves.  I think there's some festival in Tennessee going on right now, like the Create 2.4.  Tennessee Festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What, some sort of a blogging thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like multimedia creating kind of thing. I don't know.  I know Dave is there.  Sounds thrilling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have seen the Podfest last weekend, John. It was something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the one Leo went to? He was telling me about it the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was there too. And it was really reminiscent of the first couple years of Comdex.  Remember those very little Comdex shows in Vegas when it was sort of like,  okay, what the hell is this going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Felt to me like the West Coast Computer Fair.  How many people were there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a little smaller than both those items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't know how many exhibitors, but, and this is kind of interesting,  33 countries, 42 states.  So it was, I think podcasting in some ways is a more international phenomenon.  What kind of exhibitors were there?  There were a number of hardware exhibitors showing stuff for podcasters.  You know, like Telus, the folks who make the Zephyr, which I use for doing the radio show, was there.  Microphone manufacturers were there.  There were a number of software companies offering software solutions.  And then there were some, you know, the nicest booth belonged to the iLounge.com team.  That's the old iPod Lounge website.  That's an iPod website.  They had a beautiful, god, they have a gorgeous Comdex style booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that overall the feeling was that it was a show from people who were like saying,  okay, here's how we're going to enable people to do podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a lot of that.  And then people, advertising agencies, you know, companies that were hoping to kind of make money on the podcast,  like PodTrack, which I think is the front runner at this point.  Where was this event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Ontario California Expo, you know, conference center, like right next to the Ontario Airport.  I mean, really.  They went big time.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It must have been cheap.  The thing about Ontario is an interesting city because it's in the inland empire.  You know, it's inland.  And I think it's really like a big truck terminus.  It's like where all of LA's stuff goes or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whenever I do any UPS package tracking, if it gets to Ontario, I know it's, you know, it's at least in the same state as I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the UPS has a big terminal there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge, huge terminus there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it looks like.  It looks, I mean, as you fly in, it's kind of strange because you just see giant warehouse after warehouse after warehouse.  And there's all these trucks lined up like puppies at the nipple, you know, I mean, there's all the way around it.  Well, so let's get to the news this week.  Yes, lots of good tech news.  And one thing that we have, we've missed you, John, because you've been gone a few weeks and we haven't had a chance to talk to you about the Sony fiasco.  What's your take on the Sony BMG Root Kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, I wrote a column about it.  It reminds me of the old In Living Color where the guy says, I wrote a song about it.  I don't remember that.  Sing it for us, John.  I wrote a column about it in Market Watch.  And I kind of thought that, I mean, it is a total fiasco and it may actually put Sony in some sort of legal difficulties because there's, you know, some, apparently some laws about this sort of thing, essentially, you know, installing malware without the permission of the user.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope there's actual liability here.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If somebody, if you go to that column, just for people out there on MarketWatch.com, there's a link in there to probably, I think, the definitive article ever written on this thing.  I mean, some guy who would actually, you know, has broken this thing down to like, you know, the, to the bit level.  And then there's a follow up of about 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Mark Krasinovich's column from Cis Internals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't, to be honest about it, I can't remember.  But whatever the case is, this is the comments that are interesting because that's where people keep citing case law about how, you know, this could be a serious problem for Sony that they even did this.  And one person pointed out the most interesting fact, which is that they headed this company, which is the Internet for whatever that...  First for Internet.  First for Internet.  Apparently some of the guys that work there are ex-Sony people.  And so there may be some nepotism here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, of course, you know, the persistent rumors that they borrowed code from LAME and from another...  What was the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were some LAME copyright strings found in the binaries that are being installed, which is a breach of the GPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bruce Schneier had a very, I think his blog column was very interesting.  And he made a very interesting point.  You know, he rehashed the whole thing.  But then he said, but here's the story.  Are the security companies giving Sony a free pass?  Why weren't they on this story sooner?  Why did it take them so long to make removers?  Why did they respond faster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the other side of that is notice how everyone's downloading patterns and updates and running anti-spyware and anti-virus.  And this thing went unnoticed for a year.  I mean, it was in apparently half a million machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that because it was a rootkit and nobody could detect it or because they were turning a blind eye to it?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know, I was just during this outbreak or when this was discovered, I happened to be of all places in Bilbao, Spain at the Panda Software Labs.  The anti-virus company that also makes anti-spyware.  And there was a discussion about the problem right now.  Besides the fact that there's 200 variations a day on spyware, they essentially have to set up, there's no, I mean, they're using this heuristic stuff now to try to kind of out-guess, you know, like when something weird starts happening in the computer.  To look at behavior instead of...  Yeah, looks at behavior, but then what it...  Instead of signatures.  Right, right.  The signature thing isn't working anymore.  So what it does is it looks at behavior, then it sends, and I think all those virus companies are starting to do this.  In the Panda case, they send a memo to the home quarters.  At first they ask you if you want to send it, and then they send a bunch of information from your machine to see what the heck's going on.  And then it's after the fact that they developed a cure for it.  And this seems to be a serious problem with spyware, mainly because they, you know, you just, the stuff could be installed in, you know, and not recognized for, like you said, a year.  And I don't think it was anybody turning a blind eye.  I think they were just, didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's also the bigger issue that they may have been reluctant because it's illegal to remove this root kit.  You're violating the DMCA by reverse engineering copy protection.  Now, I don't think anybody's going to go to court to pursue...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't, and I don't think that's their concern.  I mean, I don't think anyone's sitting around saying, oh, God, what do we do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, why does it take Symantec a week to come out with a patch or at least an alert?  Why would they wait so long?  Don't you think that this happens all the time where it certainly happens with keystroke loggers.  If a keystroke logger is from a big company, they ignore it.  If it's from a hacker, they find it.  What's the difference? You know, if it's who, what, where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to start asking them. If you insist on this line of questioning, Leo, I'll have to look into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm curious. It's not me, it's Bruce Schneier. I think Bruce is a pretty credible person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's certainly not unreasonable to suggest that maybe the fact that it came from Sony would have given them some pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. And yet now, well, maybe it won't anymore because now we know that even Sony can do something absolutely horrendous.  And I mean, you know, there's going to be half a million machines that will always be vulnerable to this attack now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, I do have a link on my blog, and I think it's fairly current, maybe a day or two ago,  that links to the Sony site that lists all the CDs that have the Rootkit software.  And there's about 52 of them, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are finally recalling them, aren't they? In fact, Steve ordered one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I purchased the number one CD on Amazon, which was this old Neil Diamond 12 favorite songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I almost bought, by the way. But I was going to buy it on iTunes, which wouldn't have had the problem, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. And a couple days ago, I received email from Amazon following up telling me that this CD was defective.  And if I wish to return it, opened or not, they would gladly accept it back.  It's defective. I love that.  Defective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do they know?  Because it's got the Rootkit on it. That's defective.  So is Sony going to suffer a long-term black eye for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I wonder because I think it's just the cognoscente, you know, the people like ourselves that really get all worked up about this.  But the large audience, the people that buy these CDs that are not computer savvy and maybe never put it in a computer.  I mean, not everybody who buys a CD ever drops it in a machine. They tend to put it in their car and that's the end of it.  I think that's the majority of the users. And so I think it'll be a very small blip, to be honest about it.  I think they'll get a lot of ragging. I think people will give them crap every time they turn around, point the finger, and they'll be called pulling a Sony.  But I don't think it's going to really hurt them that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of sad. I mean, I think this is just one more brick in the wall for Sony.  I mean, they've gone from being a premier consumer electronic company to kind of not any more the leader.  I mean, Samsung and LG have kind of taken over as technology leaders in the consumer electronics space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that CEO that was really the top guy at Sony that I guess he passed away.  He, I mean, right now the people managing that company seem to be kind of arrogant. They always have public relations problems.  I've never known any public relations outside agencies that have worked for the company for more than like nine months or so.  Now they get new ones. It's very difficult to get sample products from them because you can't find who you can get them from.  It's a very difficult company to work with. They're not very friendly and their products are not necessarily competitive, even though they do make a lot of great products.  I also think putting all their eggs in the Sony PlayStation basket may not be such a good idea in the long term because that company has always been very diversified with all kinds of professional TV gear to little walk-ins to all kinds of things in between.  And they pretty much end the movie, they got a movie business too. And it seems to me that right now they're putting all their eggs in the PlayStation basket and banking on that thing.  And it's possible that this PlayStation 3 won't be the big winner that it needs to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of funny though, you might have said after Marita died that maybe Sony over diversified.  I mean, that's when they went on this big acquisition campaign and turned into a movie company and a record company.  Maybe that's when they lost their focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, maybe that's an interesting point because, yeah, maybe they went too far.  But they've always been diversified, but it seems to me that they're still putting most of their emphasis, if you read enough of the business trade journals about Sony, they're putting all their emphasis.  They're making most of their money off the PlayStation. And Microsoft is very aggressive with this Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that takes us to our next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Microsoft wants to be in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes on sale on Tuesday and already there are big shortages.  In fact, if you want to buy one, your best bet is probably to go onto eBay and pay twice the going rate.  They're selling on eBay for $800 and $900.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's for the low end ones.  I actually have a PlayStation 360 and I have the loaded one.  And?  And, you know, well, the thing is the games, we have to wait for some games. There's some built-in games.  I have played with this thing for some time now.  And it's, I mean, besides the one I have, I've played with the sample with the, you know, they've had some dog and pony shows.  I'm very impressed with it.  But one of the most impressive things about it is the user interfaces is fairly astonishing for Microsoft.  And my son was playing with it and the one who fixed the Skype thing here.  He, you know, made the interesting comment.  Why don't they have these guys do the user interface for Windows?  Right. Maybe they should.  I, you know, I wouldn't argue with it. It's a very interesting user interface.  Well, how does it compare to the old Xbox user interface?  It's just different. I mean, it has, it uses a tabbed, it's just hard to explain.  I mean, it's...  You'll have to see it, I guess. It's good.  It just flips, it's a funny thing. I mean, it's kind of fun to play with it. It's just, you'd have to play.  When you play with it, you'll see. But it's a very nice box and it's sleek, it's well designed.  They went through a lot of trouble to make it look, you know, Italian.  And you get some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it actually Italian or just looks Italian?  It looks Italian.  It's kind of the Porsche.  You know, they got skins...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a sports car.  Like a sports car, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They got skins for it and they have the hard disk that comes with it, comes on and off the thing so beautifully.  It's very nicely engineered.  And I can see a lot of third party people dropping big hard disks on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shortage, though, might hurt them if they can't get enough. I've been talking to...  The shortage may be BS.  You think that's to create demand?  It could. I mean, that's what I would do.  Retailers are getting a quarter of the allocation or less.  Do we know that for a fact?  Well, I've talked to a couple. A lot of stores are saying they're getting...  The local Walmart got four.  Well, that's good news.  So, you know there's going to be a battle. Now, of course, that does certainly help the buzz if you see people in line fighting to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really funny, too. When you think about this shortage this year versus what it'll be next year,  next Christmas there'll be huge pyramids of these things.  You won't be able to not buy one when you go into a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is a key opportunity because PlayStation 3 comes out in the spring.  They've got six months to really make this thing ramp up.  So you don't have any games for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple games that come with it, including one of the new Tetris-like games designed by that Russian character who works for Microsoft.  Pajit Muff, does he work for them now?  Yeah, he's been working for them for about eight years, I believe.  He was at Tech TV, came in one time when we were there.  Alexey Pajitnov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Pajitnov.  He designed Tetris and they gave him an XT for it, or an AT. That's what he got because this was still Soviet.  But he was happy.  Yeah, well, he's happy as a clam working at Microsoft because apparently he gets to do all kinds of little projects, mostly games.  I wonder if he's doing the UI.  You know, the Xbox UI kind of migrated into Windows Media Center, so it isn't unheard of that if they do have a good idea with their user interface that they might migrate it into a Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the thing that I liked about, or at least the demos of the Xbox, if you have an HD, by the way, the Xbox is HD, which is nice.  720p, out of the box.  So it looks very good on like a computer screen.  But anyway, they have it set up so you can run, if you run it on a network, they want you to network it.  So you say you're networking on your home network somehow with wireless or whatever.  It coordinates with a media PC someplace else in the house, so you can have all your slideshows and all kinds of videos and you can move TV through it.  And it gives all kinds of interesting features.  This is well thought out, this product.  And I think it should do well if they just have a couple of blockbuster games for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Microsoft selling it at a loss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got three 3 GHz power PC processors in it.  You know, there's a RAM, a 20 GHz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Historically, these boxes have always been sold at a loss.  So it would surprise me if it wasn't.  But this is an expensive loss.  Because I mean, this thing, the loaded one, it's $400.  Well, you know, if you get the big hard disk and the wireless and you put everything in it, it's almost $1,000.  It's a computer.  Yeah, what is a computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the original Xbox was cracked, the copy protection, and it was cracked within a week by Bunny Wong, the MIT grad student.  I wonder how long it will take before...  I'm sure as soon as the 360 is out, people will try to crack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but what are you going to crack it for?  What are you going to run on it?  I mean, it's a bunch of power PC chips.  You're going to put the Mac OS on it or you're not going to put Windows?  Well, I think Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people would probably be interested in putting their own OS on it.  What happened the last time, of course, is they created their own dashboard  and were able to copy games onto the hard drive and unlock them.  And, you know, of course, this time a lot of the capabilities that that hack put on the old Xbox is already built in.  Things like showing slides and playing music.  But one thing that people want, obviously, is to crack the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it just benefits Microsoft.  It creates a whole interesting underground.  People want it in order to play with it and crack it that way.  You know, it doesn't really hurt them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what people said about the old Xbox crack, which is that Microsoft was watching carefully  and built features in that people wanted based on what they were doing with the crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also one element that Microsoft doesn't want this, and that is with their online gaming.  They don't want it so people can cheat in these environments because, you know,  these environments become their own little worlds.  They have like a net value on eBay.  And you can't, right, you just can't go in there.  And the next thing you know, you walk out a millionaire and they go to eBay and sell your position.  All your loot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Item three, Microsoft Office 2006 is out in beta and lo and behold, bye bye menu bars.  Microsoft is changing the user interface in office.  And I have to think this is something that they're looking at for Vista as well.  No more menu bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen this, you guys?  I can't imagine how it works out a menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got these you've got these context sense.  It's Microsoft doesn't seem to like menus much anyway.  Remember the personalized menus?  This has a kind of a context sensitive tab bar with functions like write, page layout and review.  You click the tab bar and then it'll have context sensitive items.  But at no point do you have a menu where you can see all the commands all at once.  I think it's terrible because I use the menu to figure out what I could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's sort of the way you use a GUI in order to bring yourself up without reading the manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We haven't seen this so we don't know that is bad.  I mean, it might be great.  Yeah, I mean, I've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's a long shot, but it might be.  I'm looking at the piece.  I have played I haven't played with it for any extensive period of time.  So I don't know.  I've only seen screenshots of it.  I'll have to download it.  But I mean, the company's getting that's a big shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're getting desperate to make this thing different every so often so they can, you know, re kind of reinvigorate the cash cow.  And they get they I guess this is their latest idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in fact, according to PC magazine, most of the changes are user interface.  There's not a whole lot different.  They just made it look different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish they would do something about PowerPoint and make it a little more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could be, you know, actually, I use keynote now from the Macintosh.  And it really is nice because people who are so bored with PowerPoint presentations, I mean, you load up a PowerPoint slide, people have seen it all.  And you can't do anything new.  No. And people hate it.  They go, oh, God, another.  So I always use keynote because at least that's going to give them somewhat of a different look and feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, I've started to put little movie clips in the PowerPoint show.  It helps a little bit.  Yeah. Yeah, that's one way to do it.  Of course, half the time they don't start like they're supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another issue entirely.  That's true of keynote as well.  I was trying to play some audio in my presentation and I couldn't get it started.  Couldn't get it started.  Finally, it does.  And of course, it's too loud.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you guys think about the issue of presentation, appearance versus content?  I mean, it really ought to be what's on the slide, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Edward, Edward, is it Tufty or Tuft?  The king of this is coming to town and I would really like to get him on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he's coming next month.  I haven't known that guy forever.  Do you know him?  Well, you see, we used to correspond a lot when I was writing my columns, you know, maybe 10 years ago or so when he was first getting his reputation.  And I haven't heard from him for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's still around and he's coming to town to speak.  And of course, he wrote what is considered a classic called the visual display of quantitative information, something like that, on how to make these PowerPoint presentations contain information instead of just looking good.  It's kind of the classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the thing is when I do, I do, over the years, I give a lot of speeches and over the years I've used everything.  I've produced films and put them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You used to use your Amiga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, the video toaster.  I'd make some presentations that way.  Also, I spoke without PowerPoints for a while.  How was that?  Because I'm thinking of doing that.  No, don't do it.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  Like an old fashioned speech.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  Why not?  What happens is people are so used to looking for some diversion, some power, something up on the screen,  that if you think you're going to stand up there in this day and age and entertain people, you better be the best speaker in the world.  I mean, because when you're just up there talking cold with nothing for somebody to glance at or any talking notes,  you either have to be looking down a lot because you've got to see what you're going to be talking about.  With PowerPoint, you just look at the slide because it just triggers what your thoughts are.  I mean, this is, of course, normal professional speaking where you're not just sitting there reading a paper,  which as far as I'm concerned, I don't understand why people even give a speech like that.  Anybody can read it.  Mail it to me.  Exactly. Just hand it out.  Yeah, hand it out. I don't need to have you read it.  And most of these people can't read very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do like you. I find myself using more video, audio, multimedia and fewer slides.  I don't put a lot of text on slides and I don't use as many slides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just use them as talking points.  And people can refer to them or sometimes they want to see the slideshow or they want to download it afterwards or whatever.  But if you think you can go out there and give cold speeches without PowerPoints in this day and age to these audiences,  it's a huge mistake. You've got to have something.  But then there doesn't have to be PowerPoints. There's got to be something up there.  And that's just the way it is. I mean, I've experimented with it.  I get really, you do not get the good, you don't get the results you're looking for when you just stand up there and, you know, pontificate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe this is a product opportunity for a good product because PowerPoint isn't really as good as it ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got a press release the other day. Somebody has just done something.  And again, this is another one of those things I can't remember.  But I sent them a note back saying I want a copy of this immediately.  And as soon as I get it, we'll talk about it on the show.  But it's a PowerPoint competitor that just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you do very well if you came up with something that just looked different.  Even if it had the same capabilities but it just had a different feel to it, people would be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, there's a couple of things out there.  There's a couple of, I mean, things that modify the PowerPoint just a little bit.  The thing from, I think it's called Ovation from those guys at Serious Magic up in Sacramento.  You can download that. It's a beta. It's in beta right now.  Michael Miller was telling me about it.  I've downloaded it, but unfortunately I had some other plug-in and I never got it to work.  But it's beta. I can't criticize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's got to be more than another template. It's got to kind of really change the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. This is like a thing that changes the model.  But it still works off of PowerPoint. I'd rather see something all new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if it looks different enough, I guess that's fine.  Google Base, have you looked at it? Speaking of looking different, this thing...I don't get this at all.  Would you explain this to me? It's now alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve, you tell them, because I didn't even pay any...  Did you know what it is?  I just passed it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have no idea either, Leo.  Well, then maybe we won't talk about it.  I think what's happening at Google is they're just pushing stuff out of the labs now, sometimes with no good reason.  This is the one everybody was saying is going to kill eBay or kill classified ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me get my son to see if he knows about it, because he plays with all this crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Base was initially released and then it disappeared again after a few hours or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's base.google.com. I guess a play on database is kind of a separate part of Google.  You can search individually.  As examples of things that they want you to put there is course schedules, articles, of course, wanted ads, vehicles, rentals, the standards of classified ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the sorts of things that individuals might have on their own websites, they're trying to host that kind of content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's no real formatting. Google's already searching your...I'm not sure I understand it.  What's your son say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says it's just basically Craigslist done by Google. I've heard this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more than that. It doesn't have to be stuff for sale. It could be articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, that's the same thing with Craigslist. Craigslist is a lot of discussion.  That's true. All right. Yeah, you're right.  But anyway, he says if anybody out there really wants to know what's happening, go to Metafilter. There's a ton of discussions on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, Metafilter is always a good place to go if you want to know what's happening.  I don't know. Mostly.  So we talked a little bit about it, and I thought I should just kind of circle around on the attempt by some to get the United Nations in control of the Internet.  It's been overturned.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ICAN retains control.  I ran into an op-ed there, ran into one of the big newspapers from some tech writer, and he's talking about how it's important that we give it to the UN and all this other crap.  You know, I'm thinking this really makes zero sense to me.  I mean, it's not broken. What are we trying to do with this?  I mean, it works fine the way it is. It's not bothering anybody. We're not using it to bludgeon people.  I mean, it's not like our control of it is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can also understand. It may be, in fact, it's just other governments trying to get a little wedge in, and it may in fact have been a very terrible idea.  I guess I can understand that if they feel like the Internet is U.S.-centric, maybe, I don't know, I can't justify it.  We invented the thing. Of course it's U.S.-centric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and China will take it over anyway.  Yeah, ultimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do ultimately have the problem of a committee that just is going to end up tearing itself apart because they're trying to do too many things at once.  Right.  I think it's exactly as John says. It's working. We already have weird little problems like Network Solutions, who tried to change the way the root servers were working  so that non-existing domains all went to their own little search facility.  Right.  And it would be a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was also down in Southern California talking with the ICANN people, and they say that the people that have been trying to take over the Internet,  if you talk to them, they're technically incompetent, and most of them, their fear is that the DNS system would be ruined by these people.  I mean, it's likely that their incompetence could just completely ruin the Internet if we gave control to like some international body that doesn't know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand, as Steve has pointed out in the past, the Internet is kind of a house of cards anyway. The DNS system isn't all that robust to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's old, but it's there. I mean, it's asking your mom to type HTTP colon slash slash www before you get started.  Right.  It's just like, okay, well, this really wasn't designed for prime time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, you don't really have to type that anymore.  No one does anymore.  Every browser pops it in for you. I do agree it's kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It still exposes that you still see it. So even if you don't type it, you see it. And I think that that is kind of an unusually.  We're stuck with it.  So one last story, one last story. ThinkSecret and other Mac rumor sites are saying and they say they've got from the same source they got other great scoops from that were reliable that the first Intel Macs will debut at Macworld that will be the low end Macs starting with the iBook.  You think it's credible? Intel Macs at Macworld?  That's soon.  That's much sooner than they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought I think it's totally credible, but I don't know if it's going to be an iBook. I think it's going to be a Mac mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's what Apple has said.  The announcement was mid 2006 for the low end Macs and mid 2007 for the high end Macs.  Certainly makes sense to do the low end. And of course, Apple of late hasn't made anything but consumer announcements at Macworld.  They don't announce pro products at Macworld. So I could see a Mac mini.  I could even see an iMac. You know, the new iMac that they released, which is pretty slick, is thinner.  And some say the form factor is designed to slip in an Intel motherboard. So it could be even an iMac. I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the benefit from the consumer standpoint is just based on the Pentium, it's lower power, more performance or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think for an iBook, the best benefit is you get a Pentium M. There's never been a low power chip, a decent low power chip for Apple's portables.  Right.  So huge improvement. You get six hour battery life all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve, have you installed the Mac OS 86 for on a machine yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I never did. Although we had somebody up at Tech TV a couple months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did a call for help, yeah.  Everybody says it runs faster.  Yeah.  That's what's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't this going to create some sort of public relations problem for an Apple who's always spent all this time talking about how this other chip is so much better and now it runs faster on the Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After all this fud, finally the truth comes out.  Well, even, I mean, this is the Steve Jobs reality distortion field. He's very good at this.  And you can switch on a dime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may well be that Intel has continued to push the technology forward and that Apple was leaving the PowerPC because it was pretty much a dead end architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the story. Yeah, that's it. It wasn't fast enough before, but it is now. It's a ticket. Yeah, I think you just helped them with the spin. That's good.  I think it would be a big coup for Apple.  I mean, if I were Apple, I would have been given very conservative deadlines and then come out early. That looks good, right? Looks like you're on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And John, you never think that they will willingly divorce the OS from the hardware and create a box like Solaris tried to do that would just run on a PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm convinced that when they finally get a clue, they're going to make a premium product for the Apple lovers, which is what they make now and probably hold the same market share or maybe even increase it a little bit.  Because it might be a machine, for example, an x86 machine running a Mac OS. It might be some I'd be interested in, especially if I could dual boot it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want dual boot. I want seamless windows. I want a Windows. I want to be able to be running OS X and double click a Windows application and it runs in its own window. And I've got Windows running on the same time.  You know, it's very doable. And I think it would be very cool. Totally doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. There's enough virtualization technology now that it's sort of been creeping out, but that's just not hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that is a very compelling product. Talk about solving the switch problem. The one thing keeping people from switching at this point is that one Windows app they can't get on Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Now, anyway, once they get a clue, if they could just come to the conclusion that I keep coming to, which is that they would keep the same market share or maybe even increase it by selling these expensive Macintosh machines with the x86 processor in it and running x86 operating system.  And let the operating system also be sold as an individual product for $99 or whatever for everybody else. I think they would eventually take over the entire business and still have a hardware business that would be at least as big as they have now, if not bigger.  Yep. And they would impinge on Microsoft. I still see the future being Linux on servers, OS X86 on the desktop, and office applications owned by Microsoft.  That seems reasonable. That seems to be.  That's a nice world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. Thanksgiving. We're going to wrap this up. Our Thanksgiving is coming up on Thursday. Just thinking I'll maybe ask you guys, each of you, what you're thankful for in this tech industry this year.  Anything to be thankful for, John C. DeVore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it's ramping up again, and I'm also thankful for high speed wireless, since I'm in the back room now.  But I just think we're going to see another bubble, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and we're just going to have to be a little more careful this time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think we will be, and I think we're exactly en route to do that. We've built the infrastructure with the first bubble, and now we can take advantage of it. And I think there's amazing stuff happening.  How about you, Steve Gibson? Anything to be thankful for this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I'm thankful for, I think, is the incredible drop in non-volatile memory pricing.  The fact that I can now get a little 2GIG SD card and put a ton of media on it. And it's just, I mean, it's affordable. It's just phenomenal.  And in general, the overall fall of prices. You can go out to a Fry's or a Micro Center or wherever and get some amazing technology for a couple hundred dollars now. It's really phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the LifeDrive, because I ended up buying the Palm with the hard drive built in. The LifeDrive has crashed, Steve. So I'm going to trade it in for that Tungsten. I think you were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought one. I own a TX now, Leo. Solid state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, people complain about that Tungsten. Really?  You know, like screen busts and there's that, they still don't sell that yellow dot problem, doesn't that happen once in a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about, but I have two T5s and now I have a TX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's going to start stockpiling them and putting them in the refrigerator again. I love it.  Steve, refrigerator Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, there's something else we should be thankful for.  What's that?  University of California 27, Stanford 3. That was the big game the other day. I couldn't let the show go by without rubbing it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak, thank you for joining us. Thank you, Steve Gibson. It's a skeleton twit. We're going to be back next week after Thanksgiving.  Probably also have a small crew, but then back full bore with video and more for Twit 32.  We've got some great things in the works. I'll tell you what I'm thankful for.
