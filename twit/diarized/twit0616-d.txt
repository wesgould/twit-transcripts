You've covered the presidential campaign.  Three of them.  Three of them.  There been that many?  It feels like I only remember one now.  They're all fake though.  All of these campaigns.

Nice to see you.  My personal friend of Donald J. Trump.  No, no.  The opposite would probably be true.  You would do me a favor the next time he's on, would you wear the Wookiee mask?  Just go, rawr, rawr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think he likes me much.  I mean, I do.  Has he ever tweeted you about you?  No, no.  I always ask the tough questions of the people from his staff that are on our show, and I'm  not afraid to ask those questions.  But I don't think he's, when other people are fawning over him, I'm not.  And I'm just asked a straight question.

Start time: 298.64

Start time: 312.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  And this morning we had on a group of veterans who were riding to DC for the, I think the  thunder, forgive me for butchering, all the motorcyclists, maybe Tim, you might even know  there's like 96,000 of them come to descend on rolling thunder.  Some come from Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To honor those forgotten POWs.  I mean, there's tens of thousands that have gone missing, that are forgotten.  And anyway, we had the founder of it on this morning and we knew, I knew that the president  was watching after his nine day trip to the Mideast.  And they're frustrated with the government spending thousands on the defense budget,  but not spending any money to find these soldiers and really trying to find and do as much as  they can to get these folks back from these foreign wars or identify grave sites, et cetera.  And I said, if you had a message to the president, we know the president is probably watching  right now.  Do you have anything to say?  He says, president Trump, we'd like to meet with you.  We want to take, so that's a powerful, that's a powerful mechanism.  He was frustrated.  He's frustrated with this administration.  He was frustrated with the last administration.  Talk about a bully pulpit.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's a crazy time.

End time: 443.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  No, sometimes we beat, you know, we go up against the Today Show because they're broadcast.  So we neck and neck with those, some of those guys.  That's really a big deal.

Start time: 444.57
End time: 507.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's crazy.  So here's a, here's a top story.  Just come in.  The Steve Jobs hype is over.  According to ZD, it's not a ZD net.  They auctioned off yet another rare Apple one.  I don't know if this was Mitch Waits.  We had Mitch Wait on the show.  He had a Apple one look just like this was auction and cologne.  And it only, there are only eight working model ones.  Apple ones out there.  The guy who bought it, $130,000.  That's all.  That's all.  They sold, remember, for $666 back in 1976 or 77.  But the reason the guy was disappointed, the seller was disappointed.  One had sold for $905,000.  Another one sold last year for $815,000.  I think it's a little much to say that the Steve Jobs hype is over, however.  It's a great headline.  Yeah, it's a great headline.  Got me to click.

Start time: 507.95
End time: 508.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Got me to click.

Start time: 509.86
End time: 514.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A German engineer bought it.  But it did include the cassette player.

Start time: 515.78
End time: 516.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many are there?

Start time: 517.46
End time: 553.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eight working.  There are many more not working.  So Mitch Wait, who is, some of you remember is from the Wait Group publisher.  He's now famous because he's done some really nice, believe it or not, bird watching apps  for iOS.  But he has an Apple one that he got ages ago.  And he got a friend and they worked on it and they got it working.  We did a triangulation.  You can go back and watch.  It was a working Apple one, but it was nontrivial to get it working again.  Because these things really kind of have corroded over the years.  But I think Mitch will be disappointed because I'm sure he thought he was going to make a  pretty penny off of that.

Start time: 554.20
End time: 558.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the idea that Jobs hype is over, though.  I mean, this really like...

Start time: 558.52
End time: 603.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  Is it over?  Is it really over?  In fact, Steve's greatest accomplishments opening now, Apple Park.  The brand new campus.  That was his last...  It's actually very sad when you look at the video of Steve presenting Apple Park at the  Cupertino City Council because he was really on death's door.  It's almost open now.  In fact, let me show you.  Remember all those drone videos.  Matthew Roberts, one of the drone videos, has made a time lapse of the construction  of Apple Park, which took several years.  He's got it down into a minute and five seconds.  The spaceship campus, starting March 2016.  Why do they always have this music on these things?

Start time: 603.60
End time: 605.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't they have some trouble with the glass?

Start time: 606.63
End time: 668.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe you heard me talk about that because I thought I had a scoop.  I probably should have written it up for some important journal like Tech Republic.  But we had an engineer in.  He said, you know, I'm working on the Apple campus.  I said, oh, really?  He said, yeah.  And I said, oh, how's it going?  He said, well, it's settling.  I said, what?  He said, it's settling.  I said, anytime you build a building, he said it settles, right?  The problem is these panes of glass are massive and they were breaking.  And he said, and you know, the real problem is they're expensive.  They're like a hundred thousand dollars each and you can't just make one.  You have to make them in big batches.  So they make a million dollars of these at a time.  So if one breaks, you've got to make a million dollars worth of glass windows.  I guess it stopped settling though.  Because they're moving in.  In fact, I talked to an Apple employee who was in the studio visiting us Saturday.  And I said, you get to be in Apple Park?  He said, yep.  I said, when you move in?

Start time: 669.32
End time: 672.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, later this year.  Yeah, they're doing that batches, right?  Like 500 at a time, 300 at a time.

Start time: 672.50
End time: 681.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First people gone in are the ones who are setting it up.  Yeah, the important ones.  Yeah.  But he's an engineer.  He works on the human interface devices on the iPhone.  He gets to be in there.

Start time: 681.66
End time: 689.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you guys don't, with all that clout, you guys don't have like any earthquakes in California,  which is pretty good.  Right.  That's a relief.  That's a relief.

Start time: 689.66
End time: 693.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  No tornadoes, no earthquakes, no acts of God of any kind.

Start time: 693.54
End time: 699.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is, isn't it on like Four Foot Springs or some insane?  Oh yeah.  It's an earthquake, actually it is an earthquake proof building.

Start time: 699.44
End time: 715.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And nowadays when they build buildings, there's one building in San Francisco that's actually  falling over.  But normally.  They build them on big rollers so the building can move.  And I'm sure that they've done that with the spaceship campus.

Start time: 715.20
End time: 733.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, joking aside, like Apple Park is, I do hope that this is the last kind of jobsian  effort that we see this this little push up the hill.  And I hope this allows Apple to kind of move into an era that is defined by their successes  and failures as well.

Start time: 733.92
End time: 738.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of just wish they'd spend more little less time on that and more time on the laptops.  That's just my yeah.

Start time: 738.78
End time: 751.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's precisely what I mean.  Like we I would like to enter into an era with Apple where we can say, oops, we kind  of messed this one up.  Well, they did.  They said that the Mac Pro after a couple months of people betching about it a couple

Start time: 751.48
End time: 760.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  months.  I bought it three years ago and they never updated it.  I actually had it as it was a doorstop for a while.  Literally.

Start time: 760.78
End time: 801.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you are seeing quite a shift, though.  I mean, wouldn't you guys agree more to a more open at least, you know, more open Apple  you see hearing from executives doing, you know, Phil Schiller just did an interview  the other day.  Jimmy Iovine and that and that music publication just did an interview.  But you're right.  They still have a long way to go if they're going to move completely in that direction.  I also think it's not it's not a terror.  You know, they're also I think drilling down or doubling down on secrecy.  So we don't know a lot of what to expect at WWDC.  You remember past keynotes where everything was detailed.  I mean, we knew everything and it kind of took the shine off of we don't know much  about anything, I think, for WWDC.

Start time: 803.22
End time: 817.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I don't really thought about that.  Mark Gurman of Bloomberg did say that WWDC they will announce new laptops, some upgrades  for their.  You know what?  I don't mean new in the sense that the design will change in the least, but they will have  Kaby Lake laptops.

Start time: 818.62
End time: 825.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this was an intentional leak to kind of stop those drip, drip, drip of  negative press about how bad this current crop of laptop.

Start time: 825.66
End time: 858.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I almost feel like now when you see Tim Cook and Phil Schiller giving interviews, when  you see leaks like this, that it's all part of an Apple campaign.  Yes.  To dampen expectations, to set an agenda.  Tim Cook has now several times said we're doing augmented reality.  You would never have heard Steve Jobs say that's right.  But what does that mean?  I mean, you've got people like Robert Scoble.  He's been on this show saying, oh, it's the end of the year.  It's going to you're going to be amazed.  And I'm thinking, no, I'm not.  Yes, but that's Robert.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I'm not going to be amazed.

Start time: 858.70
End time: 864.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad you take shower, take showers with Google Glass.  And I love Robert, but you know.  Oh, no, he's an enthusiast.

Start time: 864.88
End time: 885.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, you can't knock him because he's an enthusiast.  I love Robert too.  He's an old friend.  And I'm not knocking him.  But I don't completely.  We have a bet.  I said I if he says the next iPhone, I swear to God, he said the next iPhone will be clear  right.  You said what?  The one in the fall will be clear.  He says it's in Paris.  I said, fine.  So I hope it's not clear.

Start time: 887.44
End time: 890.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does he just mean no bezel?  I mean, because I think we that's not clear.

Start time: 891.10
End time: 904.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know it won't be an OLED screen.  Probably.  It'll probably be like the S8 and the LG G6.  It won't have much of a frame.  No bezel.  But that's going to be the state of that's going to be the standard, I think, in smartphones  or launch.

Start time: 904.46
End time: 920.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for Apple as well.  I think like the era of the next big thing, like the surprise Apple is long gone.  I think they want to try to delight users in their language.  But I really think that we will see predictable incremental upgrades from Apple for a very  long time.

Start time: 920.78
End time: 926.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much of that is Apple and how much of that is the industry?  It's the industry and the saturation of the smartphone.

Start time: 926.86
End time: 934.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And it's not like I mean, IOT is coming, but it's way more of a business thing.  It's not like consumers are going to get hyped up about their next wearable thing.

Start time: 935.66
End time: 993.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another thing Tim Cook's been hyping, I think.  He mentioned it.  He mentioned it at a in Cologne, Scotland or Glasgow at a university talk.  He said, yeah, I've been wearing, I just took it off.  A Apple watch that tells me my blood, continually monitors my blood sugar.  He mentioned it again.  But if you read Rachel Becker's article in The Verge, no one has ever done a needleless  blood sugar monitor, at least none that's still on the market.  It's a very difficult thing to do.  Sure, it's a big market.  30 million Americans have diabetes and would want this because right now those, I have  type 2 diabetes, we have to prick our fingers several times a day to draw blood.  It's painful and it's annoying.  If Apple, it may not be Apple.  Tim didn't say we're doing it.  He just said it's on my watch.  Probably be in the band.  If they have a non intrusive blood glucose monitor, that would be huge.  It could be really huge, yeah.

Start time: 994.50
End time: 1006.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's been plenty of others who've tried though and nobody else has been able to do  this.  In fact, it's almost like a perpetual motion machine that a lot of companies have said  they can do it, but none have actually managed to do this in a reliable, repeatable way.

Start time: 1006.12
End time: 1008.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the cold fusion of public health.

Start time: 1008.84
End time: 1009.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 1009.72
End time: 1025.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and having the idea of being able to take off different bands and be able to put  them on the watch that interact with the watch, right?  Isn't there the lightning connector inside on the backside of the watch as well, which  kind of hidden down there?  It's a hidden one.

Start time: 1025.56
End time: 1029.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nobody's ever developed anything to do it with it, right?  It's just Apple uses it as a diagnostic.

Start time: 1029.60
End time: 1042.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Apple uses it for diagnostics and other things, but to be able to use the bands that are specific  instead of just having like a Nike sport style, there might be a special glucose monitor that  you could wear.

Start time: 1042.92
End time: 1077.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be amazing.  I would buy it.  I think every diabetic would buy it.  Google, remember, was working on a glucose monitoring contact lens.  But according to Rachel's article, by the way, no one has said anything on this in the  last couple of years.  According to Rachel's article, it's really hard to do.  I did not realize this, but there's only about a sugar packets worth of glucose in your blood  at any given time.  She quotes Mark Rice, who's a diabetes expert at Vanderbilt.  It's an incredibly difficult problem.  And everybody so far has failed.

Start time: 1077.56
End time: 1139.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and then the other side of it is, of course, getting the regulatory approval.  I had a chance to moderate a panel on this exact topic a few years ago at CES, and you  had consumer medical device companies as well as ones in the industry that had to be regulated.  And the problem, of course, is the lead time, two years.  And so can you build something for an Apple watch that's going to be relevant and have  the same size and shape?  And you know how Apple likes to change connectors and sizes and cases.  And so by the time you get approval, have they wanted to move on from that same technology,  that same style, that same shape?  I interviewed a company that was doing, you know, with heart rate measuring and be able  to do on the back of the iPhone case for an EKG monitor so that it would snap on.  I have that, the Cardia.  Right.  And it took, I think, two years for regulatory, but by that time, then the iPhone is a totally  different shape.  Right.  And it won't snap on anymore.

Start time: 1139.48
End time: 1192.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this thing is cool, and it works with Android as well as iOS, and it's really small.  You don't have to snap it on.  They now come with a thing you glue on.  The Cardia, it's Vic Condotra, the guy who was big at Google, Google Plus, left to go  to LiveCore.  But they did get FDA approval.  It is available.  It's 80 bucks.  And I have to say, if you have AFib, if you have a heart issue, Jeff Jarvis, one of our  contributors on This Week in Google, has been hospitalized for AFib several times.  And he has this, and he can send an EKG.  If he feels weird, he sends an EKG to his doctor, and the doctor can say within minutes,  get to the hospital, or it's okay.  That's huge.  But I'm wondering, so now we know it's A, very difficult to do the glucose monitoring,  B, it's years away no matter what, because they got to get FDA approval.  Why does Tim Cook keep bringing this up?

Think about, I don't.  I mean, marshaling the forces to when you realize that, hey, you know, people, not everyone  can stand.  Well, let's literally devote an entire team to work with people who are wheelchair-bound  and who then, you know, and have to monitor their activity, work with folks who are in  wheelchairs and have to really study how they move, what types of exercises, and really  drill down on that.  Swimming, you know, a whole range of different activities to get people moving and, you know,  a better life.  So I'm not terribly cynical about this.

I think trust is at the center of this.  And I don't think the market...  I think the market is emerging, but we're not talking about humans now.  We're talking about the market that will emerge.  And I don't think Apple is...  I think they're looking five and ten years down the line.  And I think that you really have to bake in, you have to start planting this top of mind  awareness with consumers very early.  I think so.

But I think that Apple sees...  Maybe Tim Cook buys into this, maybe he doesn't.  But what I think they see is an emerging market and they see an emerging market that may take  a long time for Apple to earn consumer trust.  So yeah, go ahead.

There's a lot to unpack with this because Apple could also, if it's approved in the  right ways, could be subsidized by your insurance.

Transcript:  Look, Apple is so big that probably they don't consider anything that's not a multi-billion  dollar business worth their energy.  This is a big business and if it were any other company, it would be an oversized company.  This is huge if they can make it.  I don't deny that at all.  There's a sniff test, is what I'm saying, where I'm starting to sniff a number of leaks,  quotes from Apple that feel to me like they're desperately trying to look like they are relevant  and cutting edge when if you didn't look at any of that but merely looked at the products  they're putting out, it would be quite the opposite.  When you say the AirPods are the coolest thing Apple's released in three years...  Who said that?  I say it.  Right?  That might be the coolest thing they've released in three years.  I'm just saying that.  When you say that's the coolest thing, a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, this is a company that  isn't cutting edge.  And I think that they're really...  Look at this.  Another leak to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg a couple of days ago.  Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices.  That's clearly an Apple house leak to say no, no, no, because Google said the same thing  at Google I.O.  No, we're doing that too.  I mean, I feel like this is Apple almost desperate.

I mean, this is the way the industry works and the way it's worked for a long time and  it's particularly the way Apple has worked for a long time.  I think that these leaks are...  You say relevant, I say top of mind awareness, but I don't know that cutting edge really  is in the cards for consumers anymore.

And it's something the chairman said and I think I couldn't agree with him more.  Apple's sliding into Balmer land.  The difference between...  This is RF 2020.  The difference between public relations, propaganda, vaporware and authentic marketing is the difference  between Steve Balmer and Elon Musk.  Apple is moving into Balmer land.

Transcript:  I use the software keyboard.  I love it.  I like the simplicity of it.  I really appreciate just having Split View.  I like being able to sit and just focus on one task at a time, have Split View open.  So you don't feel like it's a compromise for you?  No, I really enjoy...  And I like being able to snap it off and just hold it in my hand.  And the True Tone display is gorgeous.  I mean, I wish all Apple products had True Tone display on it.  And once you see it, like Phil Schiller said last year, you're never going to go back,  by the way, and you're going to wish every device had that, which is odd that the iPhone  still doesn't have it.  So I think with new iPad hardware, we'll probably see True Tone display on everything.  But I think there's huge strides they can make with iOS for the iPad.  And I would love to see some really step-up moves on the pro side on the iPad.

Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question right there.  What's happening with the iPad?  The only iPad announcement they made was a cheap one.  They haven't announced anything new on the iPad in a while.

Start time: 1553.52
End time: 1592.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and that iPad was really a step back, if anything.  There has been expectations of a new iPad Pro and a new form factor, but ultimately  that was pushed back, presumably due to some sort of internal production or design issue.  Or it was a book slumber.  The last MacBooks were delayed, effectively, because of some issues internally as well.  And that's why we wound up with new MacBooks with touch bars, because ultimately they didn't  know what else to give us, more or less.  So there were definitely internal issues with Apple as well, not only in terms of being  creative and coming up with mind-blowing products, but actually getting these regular updates  to market even.  And so I think I have a doubt even whether they can maintain a regular cadence of these  new products, even if they are pretty predictable updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't doubt it.  I wouldn't doubt it either, yeah.  I mean, I think they need to.  I think they're way overdue at this point.  There's been suggestions that maybe there's a new form factor that's going to be shared  between iPad and iPhone.  And so for that reason, we may not see the new iPad until the end of the year.  But I think it's time, even if it is just a predictable spec update for the iPad Pro  and for the other iPads, I think we're overdue for that kind of thing.  And so unless they want to try to do everything in September, it would make sense for them  to try to do that now, especially if we're talking about more productivity-focused updates  for the iPad Pro.  And by the way, I actually use my iPad a lot for productivity now too.  Just like Clayton, I really actually I've come to appreciate the fact that I can focus  on a given document and write something without having notifications pop up all the time.  But I tried to do photo editing on my iPad at an event a couple months back and absolutely  just wanted to throw the damn thing out the window.  So there are certainly times when I've...

So if I'm sending something to a client and I want to have multiples of something that  I need to send them, okay, three PDFs, not just one that's stored in Dropbox.  And I have to go back and open Dropbox again, go through that subfolder, go all the way  down.  Why can't I select three when I'm in there?  Nope, I can only grab one.  I mean, those are severe areas of restriction.  And I think hardware is clear.  I mean, we haven't seen an update to the larger iPad Pro, the 12 inch one since 2015.  I mean, that was the first one.  So it's been like a year and a half.  That's definitely long in the tooth.  But I want to see what they really do on iOS because, I mean, the hardware is fantastic.  I mean, the iPad Pro is pretty darn good.  And the camera is pretty darn good.  It's pretty darn fast.  Obviously, we'll see.

I am sitting in front of a giant Windows machine, the Surface Studio, which I happen  to really like. I really, I really wanted to like the new MacBooks.  I bought the new MacBook Pro.  The touch bar is so problematic for me.  Aggravated. I traded down to the touch barless version.  And then I said, but now I only have two type C ports.  So I ended up getting a Windows laptop with USB and HDMI and Ethernet and and type C  and two type C's.  I feel like I'm and this is what I'm going to be doing my light room on a ThinkPad, not  a Mac. And believe me, I was an avid Mac guy for a long, long time.  I just feel like Apple's maybe lost its way a little bit.  Here's the leak.  Nine to five Mac apparently got ahold of some cases.  This is sometimes an indicator of what a new device will look like.  The case manufacturers, although it's my understanding, I talked to Griffith some years ago.  Apple never gives samples of anything to anybody ahead of time.  They just say, wait until it comes out.  Then you can design your case.  But Pelican, which makes a cases, makes a rugged case and somehow this leaked out and it is a different dimension.  It is apparently for a 10.5 inch iPad Pro.  If that's the case, if maybe they had some insight from Apple, maybe this will be announced on June 5th.

And I'll have all sorts of colorful pictures from Griffin, from Belkin and all these cases will hit your inbox.  That's amazing.  They're all just you know, they're all just renderings.  I mean, I don't think anything actually really exists.  Maybe they do. They've got prototypes.  They have some idea maybe where this camera hole will go.  I don't know.

That that branding alone is worth considerable money to the company that's pitching you.  They could be a peripheral company, whatever.  Like that company gets a lot of value, even if the story isn't true.  That's true.  Right. Yeah, absolutely.  You're like I Bob's cases, right?  Nobody's ever heard of you.

I mean, I, you know, I the touch bar, the only reason I use it is for touch ID.  I don't ever use, you know, I'm in some I'm in calendar and I don't even know what's popping up.  Yeah.  And Fantasticality, email.  Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like a stopgap measure to something.  You know, next go moon to what would it take?  What would it take for you to go back to a MacBook Pro?

Transcript:  Well, one of the things that's changed and one of the reasons I can actually even contemplate using Windows is that nowadays, and I think you're all probably in this boat, too.  A lot of our computing is kind of operating system independent.  I mean, I live in Chrome.  It's in the cloud.  Chrome looks the same everywhere.  I'm using Adobe's products, Lightroom and Photoshop.  That looks the same on both platforms.  A lot of what I do is cloud based, so it doesn't really matter what hardware I use.  So really, I'm choosing now at this point, I'm choosing machines.  The thing about the Windows ecosystem is there's hundreds of manufacturers and they're all struggling to do something innovative.  So with Apple, you don't like the touch bar.  You're kind of screwed.  There's only one person making it with Windows.  You don't like that. Get this.

It has a little red nipple, which you can disable.  And I did immediately because I never understood the value of that.  But some people love it.  It has ports.  It has three USB three ports.  It has two type C Thunderbolt three ports.  It has a full size HDMI port.  It has a micro SD reader.  I don't know why.  I don't know.  I would like a regular SD card reader.

OK, well, let me let me give you a great example.  The iPhone 7 there there is these are unlocked phones and there is the Apple  upgrade program.  There is one model of that that is hardware locked to AT&T.  Apple knows about this and they communicate with their customers about this.  Right.  So if you want to go to Verizon or T-Mobile and you want to leave, even though  you have an unlocked phone, it is one model that's locked to AT&T.  AT&T, of course, is AT&T and they're a pain in the neck to work with.  Apple will for months walk you through.  They will take care of you this morning.  They'll let you on.  They'll help you unlock it.  Oh, my goodness.  I had the best experience with Apple.  They said not only that, they refunded me.  The price of that phone, they said, this is our mistake.  It is our manufacturer.  We've had a tremendous and this is off record.  I won't.  Well, it's I won't tell you the store, but they said we have had a tremendous  problem working with AT&T.  This was the iPhone 7 and we just had a manufacturing batch that was tied to AT&T.  We are going to refund you.  Wow.  This and they I'm not kidding.  This was so I do.  I agree with you.

And it wasn't very expensive.  And they will come to me.  They have they're in 160 countries and replace it.  And it was Corey Doctorow told me about that.  Corey only buys Lenovo.  Of course, he immediately puts Linux on it.  That's by the way, the other reason I bought it is there's a fallback.  I can always put Linux on it.  But he said, no, because I'm a writer, I can't be out.  I can't be out of pocket for a day.  So I buy Lenovo's and he says the one thing I treat myself to once a year,  I buy a new Lenovo ThinkPad because I can get next business day on site replacement.  And I will be able to continue to write.  By the way, that's the other thing.  This actually has a nice keyboard.  You can't tell me any current Apple MacBook has a decent keyboard.

Powerful, but maybe not enviable position of doing the hiring at your company.  You know that everything's resting on your shoulders.  The person you hire can make the company can a company is just a bunch of people.  Right. So great employees are transformative and a bad employee.  You're going to be suffering.  You're going to pain. It's going to be painful.  So it's a big deal being in charge of hiring.  And of course, it always happens at the worst possible time.  You know, it's you. You're at the end of a quarter or you're you're down a person.  If you're a small company, even that could be, you know, you got you're like in the penalty box.  Zip Recruiter is going to transform your life.  It makes hiring the right person easy as can be.  First of all, let's presume the right person's out there.  The question is, how do you find that person? How do you get to them?  There's more than 100 job sites in the world.  How do you know how do you get on the one that that person is looking at?  You go to Zip Recruiter, one click of the mouse, one posting on Zip Recruiter  goes to 100 plus job sites, plus Twitter, plus Facebook.  So it gets out there, gets to the most people possible.  And then I know immediately people say, well, that's terrible.  I'm going to get all those calls, all those emails.  No, no, no, no. This is the beauty part.  It all flows into the Zip Recruiter interface.  They they reformat all the resumes to their uniform.  So you can scan them quickly.  You can even put questionnaires on the on the posting.

We thank them for making a fabulous, fabulous product.  I think we can stop talking about Apple.  It's hard. You know, it's funny, they get somebody in the chat room said,  and this is so true, Apple gets such unearned press constantly.  We love talking about it.  I don't know. I guess it goes back.  Intriguing. It goes back to Steve Jobs days.

Transcript:  That's a good point.  I mean, they are the most valuable company in the world.  I mean, it's not like Apple's suffering and failing there.  You know, they're they're doing OK.  There is one more little Apple tidbit before we move on.  You know, one way we kind of know when new products are coming out  is that the Apple Store gets warned.  The employees get warned, you can't take a vacation.  And the blackout dates for the Apple Store staff.  Imply this is a memo sent to Apple Care workers, actually,  that it will be September 17th, that we will hear.  Or maybe even buy a bullet, buy new iPhones.  Now, that's a Sunday.  But typically they do hold those iPhone events in September.  This has got to be the first one on the campus, right?

Apple, like everybody else, like Samsung, has got to figure out something  to make people come back to the store more than once every few years.  Not easy to do.  Let's talk about Google.  Big victory yesterday for AlphaGo  three in a row against the world's best Go player, Ke Jie.  This happened in China.  I was told I have not been able to independently verify this,  that the YouTube stream of the games have been blocked in China.  The government doesn't want people to see a machine  beat a Go champion.  An American machine. That's right.  An American machine.  AlphaGo, this is it's retired now.  It beat him decisively three games in a row.  And it's retiring.

Transcript:  Go out on a high note.  I wish a few football players would learn this.  The research team.  This is a press release from Google behind AlphaGo  will now throw their considerable energy into the next set of grand challenges,  developing advanced general algorithms that one day could help scientists  as they tackle our most complex problems.  Sounds like it's following in Watson's footsteps.  Watson was based on Deep Blue, right? The chess playing robot.  Such as finding new cures for diseases,  dramatically reducing energy consumption or inventing revolutionary new materials.

Transcript:  There are some people who within the machine learning community,  I mean, some are like Ben Goertzel and they're a little aspirational,  but some people really believe that Google is inches away from a G.I.  Oh, yeah. Right.  No, no, that's that's in the past.  We've already got this guy down there.  We already did that. What is a G.I.?  Artificial general intelligence.  So artificial intelligence is a frequently misapplied term  that can be broadly applied to many different topics.  You get a little more specific when you talk about machine learning  or you talk about algorithms.  But these things, we are already living in an age  that is defined by machine learning and will be continued  to be defined by machine learning.  But often this is what's called narrow artificial intelligence.  This could be like anything from a game.  Winning a chance is easy.  Right. But artificial general intelligence and what what AlphaGo has done  what with Go and by the way, this Go, my very first I've been playing Go  for 15 years. Oh, you're a Go player. Oh, yeah.  I've been playing. Go is a peaceful game.  If you want to both challenge your mind and kind of have a peaceful,  relaxed, relaxing experience with someone, I really encourage you to play Go.  If you're on iOS, there's a great app called SmartGo Kifu.  I have to try this.

Start time: 2844.06

Transcript:  I played Go when I was a kid.  I played chess much more seriously.  What's interesting, I remember when the chess community,  when Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue, it was a big deal.  It was not only a big deal, it was kind of depressing.  It was like, oh, our game is solvable.  A computer can best a human.  And the chess community has kind of come around.  They now train with computers.

Start time: 2864.42
End time: 2986.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the real interesting nuance of both Go  and artificial general intelligence.  So what artificial general intelligence is are algorithms that  first they teach themselves what Go is.  Oh, dear. They teach themselves that Go is.  First, I have to know what a pixel is.  Then I have to know what a computer is.  Then I have to know that Go is a game.  Go is a game humans play.  Go is a game that I need to first figure out the rules.  OK, I figured out these rules.  Now let me apply those things.  Do you see it's layers and layers and layers?  The artificial general intelligence.  And if it can learn what Go is, it can learn what I am.  And it can learn this is called recursive artificial intelligence,  intelligence that looks at itself and its own failures and improves on that.  The challenge with Go, of course, is that there are a few rules that define Go.  Very few rules.  This is a 19 by 19 grid.  You play black and white stone.  There's only two, one kind of piece.  Go is Weichi.  It means to surround. Right.  Very simple.  But the nuance of Go is that, I mean, the legend is that it was developed  by a Chinese emperor to teach his son how to wisely rule his kingdom when he was gone.  So Go is full of proverbs.  The first proverb of Go is a one stone jump is never bad, meaning no matter what,  do not overextend yourself, but do not under extend yourself.  Push past your limitations as far as you are able. Right.  And so when you you take proverbs, right, there's another proverb,  Hane, at the end of two stones, which means if you see two white stones together  and you're playing black, Hane, play at the end of those two stones  because it will increase your likelihood of victory.  So these proverbs, you extrapolate those to government,  to politics, to interpersonal relationships.  Go is a game that is designed to teach you how to rule,  how to run and how to to be a better person.

Transcript:  So in other words, a computer learning how to play this is significant.  You're exactly right, Leo.  It's light years beyond learning chess.  Chess is calculable. Right.  Chess, you can you can you can teach a computer to look 40 moves ahead,  which is plenty to win any game.  Go, you can't do that. Right.

Start time: 3002.16
End time: 3023.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are nuances to to your humanity and there are nuances to Go.  So when we have artificial general intelligence,  it is beyond just machine learning or natural language processing.  Which are narrow AI.  When you get to the when when this happens, I start to go.  I'm going to West County. I'm going to be AGI.

Start time: 3023.88
End time: 3042.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a picture of the end of the match,  the video of the end of the match.  A couple of things to note, first of all, could you as the player  on the left is the world champion.  He's got 30. They started with three hours each.  He's got 32 minutes left.  AlphaGo has nearly two hours left because, frankly, AlphaGo's got plenty of time.  Yeah, it actually moved every minute just because.

Start time: 3042.36
End time: 3049.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is also didn't want to embarrass the human component of AGI  that that it is speed as well as just ability.

Start time: 3049.70
End time: 3069.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing I found interesting is AlphaGo doesn't try to humans  try to win, like win decisively, like crush you.  I don't know how it is in Go, but in chess, Bobby Fisher always said,  I'm here to crush my opponent physically, mentally, emotionally, crush him.  And that's how he was such a good player.  I'm sure Go's you said in Go, you're supposed to learn from your defeat.

Start time: 3069.62
End time: 3073.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 3105.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Well, we do do that in chess at the end of the game.  The players will will analyze the game.  So what if you had done this and that kind of thing?  So there is that collegial feeling.  But I have to say that what's interesting about AlphaGo is it does.  It's designed merely to win.  In fact, it won the first game by the slimmest possible margin, half a point.  Yeah, because that's as good as winning by a thousand point.  It doesn't matter here is so so digress.  No, this is great.  Could you look at all the food he's got?  On the right, the guy who's just making the most of the computers get nothing.  He doesn't need food.  He's the computers doing all the work.

Start time: 3113.00
End time: 3136.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And watch this, though, watch this, because this is the end of the match.  Could jazz making his final moves.  And what you really also see is a picture of of exhaustion and frankly, dejection.  You could you could feel the human player.  They're actually, I think, analyzing now.  Yeah, just just like, oh, oh, you know, another nuance of Go

Start time: 3137.02
End time: 3161.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that the game isn't over until it is not like chess where there is checkmate done.  Right. Right. In Go, the game isn't over until both players concede.  So you could be losing and you kind of have to agree that you've lost.  It's called pass.  So if I don't pass, I don't I don't end the game,  which also means that the human player has to accept defeat internally and say,  I have won. Right.

Start time: 3162.68
End time: 3185.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or I have lost. Right.  You see that other Google story this week, the Washington Post one about.  And sorry, you know, no, I'm just curious.  I mean, it's fascinating.  But talk about that machine learning and what Google knows about us,  what Google's trying to understand about the world.  And when we buy stuff at a brick and mortar store,  that Google is able to now understand that it started with one of their ads.

Start time: 3185.88
End time: 3215.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fascinating, too.  This is called Google attribution.  And it's a way it's something that we can't do here.  You guys can't do on Fox and Friends, which is telling an advertiser,  you know, Coca-Cola buys an ad on Fox and Friends.  You can't really connect that to sales directly.  Google, because they have all the data can say, yeah, you know, that credit card  purchase, that's because of that ad on that banner ad on that website.  We can connect the two because it's the same person.  They say they can anonymize it.  I hope they can. Right.

Start time: 3216.62
End time: 3219.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Is there really anything anonymized data at all?

Start time: 3220.10
End time: 3234.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've seen in the past that that's, you know, that's kind of a  a myth that people anonymize data all the time.  And we've always been able to figure out, you know, given enough data,  if you if you give me 10 searches, I can probably narrow it down to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing Google's doing, which I think is interesting,  is these tensor processing units.  One of the things Google did is they gave away TensorFlow, which is their AI engine.  So anybody can use it on the Google compute cloud.  And now they have hardware.  This is remarkable hardware.  Each each of these TPU units is a quad core that could do 180 teraflops.  And they put them together in big wraps, racks that can do 11 petaflops.  That's 11.  What is a peta?  I don't even know.  Eleven billion, billion floating point operations per second.  Somebody pointed out that one of the problems with this is this.  Yeah, you can use it  cheaply and you can use their software for free,  but it's a proprietary in the sense that anything you do, all the data  that you generate with these TPU clusters, it's it's in Google's cloud.  You can't then use Amazon's AI or Apple's AI.

Start time: 3307.50
End time: 3311.22

End time: 3320.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3336.18
End time: 3361.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, remember when Facebook wouldn't allow allow itself to show up in Google search?  That great battle, that great Wired magazine article,  most of the eight years ago and that incredible battle where Facebook was keeping  all of that data because that was the holy grail for Google, the more personalized data,  the moods, the vacations, the the information that you can't get from a simple Google search.  I think Google can get that data.

Start time: 3361.98
End time: 3376.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google gets it peripherally. Yeah, they tried with Google Plus.  I think that's why they stopped caring about Google Plus.  They like, oh, you know, the value proposition here isn't as strong as we thought it was.  I could be wrong, but they wanted to get Facebook stuff.  But I think I think that's a good point.

Start time: 3377.02
End time: 3465.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said, oh, we don't need that.  Yeah, we get it anyway.  Right. Just because if you just use all Google for all your searches and you use Google devices  and even if using an iPhone, you may be using Google Assistant.  You may be using probably using Google Search.  They're getting so email. You're getting so many signals.  And really, it's I don't think I don't think it's a question of how much data you have at this point.  It's how much intelligence you can apply to the data you have to make the data available.  To the data you have to make the connections.  And I feel like Facebook would is certainly, you know, data rich.  But but but I feel like computer scientists at Google, maybe a little bit.  I don't know. That's a really interesting question.  Did you see this?  Facebook.  According to an Australian news website, which has seen internal research,  saw that Facebook was classifying the emotions of teenagers,  stressed, anxious, nervous or otherwise, and then offering it to advertisers  who could use it to hone in on teenagers when they're most vulnerable.  According to USA Today, this information was shared with an advertiser.  Facebook says, no, we have a process in place to review the type of research we perform.  And in this case, oh, well, maybe we did it.  We didn't follow the process. That's right.  I would love to know how that works.  We have a process. We didn't follow it, but we have a process.

Start time: 3465.82
End time: 3482.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, how would that work? I mean, it seems odd to me.  I mean, I guess unless it's a high level advertiser  that's spending tens of millions of dollars on, you know, in their ad in their ads manager,  because there is a process in place.  There are only certain campaigns that you can run.  There's only access to certain data.

Start time: 3482.98

Start time: 3486.82

Start time: 3489.64
End time: 3569.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  And then you can tell us what's true.  This this comes to the Trump campaign.  Jared Kushner was charged.  He started a unit in San Antonio to use data from a company in Britain called Cambridge Analytica,  which, among other things, it was alleged that they did Facebook quizzes  to gather information about Facebook users and that the Trump campaign then bought  very targeted ads based not merely on whether somebody was likely or unlikely to vote for Trump.  That was useful because you could discourage a likely voter for Hillary Clinton not to vote  and you could encourage a likely voter for Trump to vote.  But also even using sentiment analysis to things like, well, we know that, you know,  there's a group, there's a group X, there's a large set of group people who will vote for support.  The Second Amendment will vote for gun rights.  But more than that, we can then subdivide that group by emotion analysis as to why they care about gun rights.  Some are hunters. Some are worried about safety and security.  Some are libertarians who believe no government interference and then target an ad specifically.  And these are dark ads because no one sees it except that person.  Target an ad towards those interests.  So that was the that was what was alleged.

Start time: 3571.89
End time: 3592.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry for jumping.  I don't mean to cut you guys off.  Is it true? Well, because we see reports now go back and forth.  The way you characterized it.  Yes, this this is the definition of data analysis on this previous campaign used many of those tactics.  But you have to to separate Cambridge Analytica from this.

Start time: 3592.90
End time: 3595.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They claim some say claim more than they really.

Start time: 3595.22
End time: 3656.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have all this reporting in Tech Republic.  I had I know the CEO of Cambridge very well.  They got in hot water because, yes, they do quizzes.  Cambridge made up a lot of their data.  This this micro targeting.  They use quizzes. This Mike alleged that this micro targeting is precisely the real company that there are a number of real companies that do this.  One is L2 political.  If you buy data from L2 political, you can log in.  We could log in right now and I could show you all of those things about every single.  I can find you and see your Social Security number, how much money you make, where you live.  I can you're all of these things that you say.  So everything you just said, Leo, is absolutely correct.  Whether Cambridge did it or not.  Follow Garrett Lansing on Twitter.  I'll leave that right there.  But but during the campaign, this was precisely what we covered at Tech Republic was the data and the data analytics.  We didn't cover the horse race because the politics are less interesting.

Start time: 3656.82
End time: 3664.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as it turned out, you covered the right thing, because this, in my opinion, this was the most significant development.  We were finding bots.

Start time: 3664.50
End time: 3688.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can find this on Tech Republic.  Find stories from January 2016.  We were finding bots buried in the Twitter.  You can look at the spikes in Trump and Clinton's Twitter followers and correlate them.  Yes, these things happen.  And the micro targeting every single political campaign, every smart political campaign is buying and from now on, if you're not, you're going to lose.

Transcript:  And being able to go to these towns, I mean, the real story was, yeah, I mean, the targeting, the ads was was huge.  But also, then being able to use that data for speeches.  So they they knew down to a granularity that it was almost like the speeches themselves were crowdsourced crews.  So you could go into trouble.

Start time: 3709.02
End time: 3718.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very good. I mean, this was obvious if you watched him at reading the crowd and feeding them stuff that made them more excited.  I mean, there was a direct fee.  He didn't have to use any analytics.  It was a direct feedback loop.

Start time: 3719.14
End time: 3805.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is. And in fact, that was the lesson of the campaign.  Also follow Chris Wilson on Twitter.  Chris was Ted Cruz's data analytics guy.  Ted Cruz really pioneered this.  And it was one reason he rose so high.  Clayton, what you said is precisely accurate.  The it is less about the the GTV to get out the vote.  And it's more about targeting the right language that we know will elicit a response.  And Garrett's an interesting.  Garrett Lansing. Yeah, that's Garrett.  He's he was the White House.  He was in charge of tech at the White House for about three weeks under Obama or under Trump under Trump.  Garrett's a real good guy.  And I'm not saying all I know from Garrett is that he did analytics.  So Garrett is not my source.  And I won't get him into trouble.  I won't reveal who my sources were.  But Garrett is somebody who you could turn to for accurate information about data analytics.  He understands what's going on.  So is Chris Wilson.  And and there is no fud with those guys.  Again, I really like the humans at Cambridge Analytica.  And I don't they're going to hate me.  They're going to send some emails after the show.  But what what they did is not what they claimed to have done.  They sent emails the day after the campaign.  I was at Hillary Clinton's HQ through the campaign.  As soon as the tide started to turn, Cambridge took credit for Trump's win.  OK, that night.

Start time: 3825.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3828.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3836.62
End time: 3845.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's my question, because I mean, I do a lot of Facebook stuff  and for my company, and it's important that I do it.  And without it, you know, I'd be I don't know why anybody buys ads.

Start time: 3845.10

Start time: 3854.66
End time: 3869.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I mean, yeah.  Like I said before, I mean, think about it.  If you're like a pet shop owner in a small town in Massachusetts  or just take that as an example. Right.  You could. Why?  Why would you put up a billboard or why would you put out  take an ad out in the local board?

Start time: 3870.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3873.52
End time: 3899.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So why wouldn't you then just target pet owners in the three zip codes  that your pet shop would service in the little downtown area  and run a little coupon on a Sunday for a new pay?  We're new in town. We just opened our store.  Pet owners come to our store.  You're going to get a free, you know, free doggy toy on this particular day.  You're only targeting pet owners through the Facebook ad platform.  And web companies do it all the time. Yeah. Right.  And between 30 and 50 years old. Right.  Maybe you're not going to.

Start time: 3899.90
End time: 3920.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing that saves us, by the way, is that at least people,  when they buy ads on Twitter, they know you're getting geeks.  I mean, you're getting a tech enthusiast.  So just by virtue of the content, we are somewhat narrow niche.  But, boy, I would really worry if I were network television,  a newspaper, a clear channel selling ads on billboards.  You can't compete.

Start time: 3921.28
End time: 3931.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we. But my question is, how are they getting this data?  How are they getting the depressed teenager data?  I mean, because if you go through the ads manager as a normal company,

Start time: 3948.52

Start time: 3950.60

Start time: 3962.94
End time: 3980.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I if I create quizzes, let's say what what Game of Thrones character are you?  And I create a quiz and those things spread  virally on Facebook, like wildfire, I get the data from that quiz.  Right. I mean, Facebook gets it, but I also get it.  Right. Is that one way to do this?

Start time: 3981.72
End time: 3985.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How would you do it?  I'm just trying to think through the ads manager platform.  I don't know how that would work.

Start time: 3986.18
End time: 3992.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't understand. I'm not saying through the ads manager.  I'm saying you create content on Facebook.  The cure. Exactly.

Start time: 3993.00
End time: 4004.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And oh, and then you're retargeting.  So that's how you're getting it.  So then you're able to see if the hundred thousand people  that answered your quiz on your Facebook page, the Donald Trump Facebook page,  answered it, that they are sad.

Start time: 4005.54
End time: 4019.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And part of the reason this works is Facebook's very lax privacy policies,  which allow you, for instance, if somebody answers a quiz  to get not only information about that person, but about their friends. And.

Start time: 4020.44
End time: 4075.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yes.  And and we as individuals, we as individual buyers  are not an enterprise company or a highly influential.  So it's not getting the good.  So there are there are not.  But, you know, Clayton, you and I and everybody in the media,  if if I want traffic, I can arbitrage it, I can buy it off of Facebook.  And I don't necessarily need to get very granular about that  until I have my own analytics systems on top of that.  So if you think about political campaigns who don't only rely on Facebook,  but sometimes rely on Facebook and you have your own analytics process,  excuse me, processes and really smart data scientists  who all want to be influential inside an administration or go to jobs  in the private sector.  It's not just Facebook data.  Facebook data is part of the bigger picture.  Again, check out L2 political if you want to see how this works.

Start time: 4075.38
End time: 4079.28

Transcript:  Are political campaigns the most sophisticated users of this data at this point?

Start time: 4079.76
End time: 4099.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's why I'm saying geeks are because like Clayton,  what you're describing is stuff that like a lot of those tactics  we kind of know or if you're a small business or even,  you know, larger SMB and enterprise company, you might know some of these tactics.  But a political campaign, look, I know political campaigns.  And they're not that sophisticated.

End time: 4155.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's reassuring, by the way.  I'm very glad to hear that.  Because whether you buy Tide or not is less important  than who gets elected president.  So it's nice to know that.  But I have I do have to say that  there are people who do know this.  Yeah, they are going to, you know, survival of the fittest.  They are going to become more and more successful, more and more powerful.  Eventually, this will become the province of election campaigns.  How how does how does this change?  What we're really seeing is we and we've we've seen this for years.  Big data, right?  More and more big data, better, better ways to process big data.  And then there are some companies and maybe Google's the one.  But there are some companies who have a head start, such a lead in this,  that they will only make them stronger and stronger.  Their lead will magnify as a result.  Is that fair to say?

Transcript:  and, you know, but but Google is everywhere you go on the Internet is Google.  Yeah, not not Cox, not Comcast.  And in fact, what do you think Google's been pushing?  HTTPS everywhere, right?  This is Google's pushing this very hard.  Your Google searches, for instance, are encrypted.  Your your ISP does not see those searches.  All they know is that you're using Google.  And and Google wants this for every website.  In fact, they've even already said we will rank you higher if you're a secure website.  We made Twitter secure not because there's anything on Twitter.  There's no we don't know anything about you.  There's no account. You don't create an account on Twitter.  But we made it secure because it helps our ranking.  Yes. Google.

And he said, you know, the the real trouble right now for ISP's is that when you come home,  most people aren't switching to Wi-Fi and really they're using their carrier.  LTE because LTE is, you know, just fast enough.  It's fine. And most people kind of forget to jump to Wi-Fi.  I know my mom, you know, parents get come home.  They don't jump over to Wi-Fi because they're home.  We do it kind of instinctually.  But now there's this real fight, you know,  fight, you know, Verizon doesn't want to build any more fiber to the home.  And now they're really targeting these.  That's interesting.

I don't want to conjure any particular image in your mind.  Smells like victory.  Our show today brought you by the nicest sheets I've ever slept on.  These sheets are amazing. Bowl and branch.  Now, you may say, why are you talking about sheets, Leo?  But I got to tell you, I think we've learned that a healthy sleep,  a good night's sleep is key to your overall well-being,  not just your mental state, but your physical state.  We know that, you know, cortisol, the stress hormone can keep you from sleeping.  But getting a good sleep habit and a comfortable bed,  we've talked about mattresses.  Let me talk about the bedding on the mattress.  That can make a huge difference.  Bowl and branch sheets are made from 100% organic cotton.  Now, you can talk about cotton, you can talk about thread count and all that stuff.  But I can tell you this, I've made the mistake of buying thousand dollar  sheets that were not comfortable because they were too crisp.  Bowl and branch, it's the softest cotton you've ever,  and they get softer as you use them. They're so beautiful.  And they don't sell at the department stores. So there's not that crazy markup.  They only sell online.  You're getting about twice the quality for literally half the price.  They say this and I've never questioned it more.  Three former US presidents sleep on bowl and branch.  I don't know, you pick the three. I don't know who it is.  Countless celebrities. I sleep on bowl and branch and I love it.  Feel good about your sheets.  Not only knowing that they're organic cotton produced responsibly,  but also ethically made sheets,  but also the most comfortable sheets you've ever slept on.  And of course you could try them for 30 nights and see for yourself.  If you're not impressed, return them. You get every penny back.  Forget lugging around a bed in a bag in a busy department store.  Go to bowlandbranch.com. It's easy to order. In fact,  if you use the promo code TWIT right now,  you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets and free shipping.  B-O-L-L like the cotton bowl, right? B-O-L-L and not the cotton bowl.  Football game, the cotton bowl, the bowl of cotton, the ball of the bowl of the,  nevermind B-O-L-L and branch like the branch of the cotton.com.  Use the promo code TWIT for $50 off free shipping at bowl and branch,  the softest bedding in the world.  So I'm following two new people on Twitter now. I got Chris Wilson.  He's Wilson WPA.

It's a public feed pin board.in slash you colon Leo Laporte,  but I've decided to link it using if this and that or Zappi or one of those  tools to my Twitter feed. So now if I bookmark a story, we're going to cover,  I might modify the title for a little commentary.  And then it goes on my Twitter feed. And actually that's,  I think the most useful thing I can do on Twitter,  which is post articles that I'm going to talk about that I think are interesting  with the slightest bit of commentary.

Somebody in the chat room said that this, the Google ad conference,  everybody paid attention to Google IO,  but the Google ad conference was really the, the,  the, the event that people should have been paying attention to.  They call it their marketing next conference.  And this is where they announced that tool for,  for measuring brick and mortar sales after an ad campaign.  He said in the chat room, he said, you should watch the videos.  A lot of these videos have been put out here and advertisers actually are very  excited.  Advertisers would love to know more about our behavior and what we do and whether  their ads work. That was always the saying. I know that half my ads work.  The problem is I don't know which half, you know,

Start time: 5096.82
End time: 5146.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you want to be cynical,  you could look at a lot of the stuff that came out of Google IO.  That was really exciting. You know,  the idea of 3d mapping within the building without having to have location  building beacons within the building. Well,  now you can find your way to the captain crunch,  but now you know,  captain crunch can know how long you stood there standing in the serial aisle,  looking at that stuff too. So even Google automotive, for example, you know,  there's been a lot of resistance among automotive manufacturers to put Android  auto in the car because Google needs to take some information out of that.  Effectively didn't know where you are and where you're going.  That too could be looked at as a skeptical, as a, you know,  a little bit of a tin oil tin foil hat way of saying, you know,  this technology is cool and it does give you benefit,  but ultimately it just makes Google better at serving you ads and learning more  about you. So you can look at this stuff in a lot of cynical ways.  And ultimately I think it does make Google very, very, very powerful.

Transcript:  Right now, if your car has Android auto,  basically your phone is effectively working as a terminal.  It's providing an interface is effectively doing a video out of signal and taking  over a part of the dashboard of the car.  If you do run Android within the dashboard,  as we saw some demonstrations from Volvo and from Audi,  that actually is Android running natively in the car. And in that case,  if there is a native infotainment system there from, for example,  Volvo census system or the Audi MMI system,  that I should be running on top of Android.  So it's kind of like turning things upside down,  whereas you now have entered out of running on top of the infotainment system.  You then have the infotainment system running on top of Android,  but the net result is the same basic interface, the same basic apps,  but you no longer would have to have your phone connected to the car.  You'd have Spotify running right there in your car now and you'd have your  playlist right there.  You'd have the active data connection in your car serving up that data.

Transcript:  Ron Amadio at ours,  Technica was on a twig on Wednesday and these are the pictures he took at the,  at the event.  So this is to compete with a QNX and other car operating systems,  Microsoft's auto.

Start time: 5226.88
End time: 5237.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a big player in basically providing the low level operating systems that,  that then these infotainment systems like sync three are built on top of,  there's Linux in the car as well, which is making a big play to be.

Transcript:  Our Teslas are running on Linux.

Start time: 5241.08
End time: 5307.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And the look,  there's a big push to make that a lot more sophisticated than it has been in the  past, but this is a huge moneymaker for QNX right now. And,  and ultimately Android wants to be in there as well to have more power down low  basically. So that really would mean the foundation of those operating systems  would be Android based, which is again, a Linux based operating system,  but that would give you also data for Google, right?  Absolutely. And they're getting, you know,  you got to figure Google's getting a lot of that information anyway,  if you're taking your phone with you.  But ultimately having that in your car means that they know your destination in  theory, they could know your rate of speed. You know,  it remains to be seen exactly what Google would be able to take out the car.  But ultimately if they're tied within, within the canvas of the car,  they could in theory get access to anything that they wanted to,  even whether your turn signals on or whether a traction control activated,  which might mean that they could use that data to then serve ways.  If you slip on a patch of ice in your car,  maybe there's an automatic ways notification that's posted that would then alert  drivers behind you. You know, again, there's a,  a case for positives out of this, but if you are concerned about privacy,  there's some negative implications too.

Start time: 5307.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course some of what they did to the government perhaps. And you know,  I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying to be cynical. I'm trying to be positive.  They maybe could use that information to improve infrastructure and roads that  in a way that they couldn't before the way that self driving vehicles, right?

Start time: 5320.38
End time: 5342.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If one of the problems self driving vehicles faces,  humans driving other cars in the same environment, that's a mess.  But maybe if you were driving a car with Android auto or Google automotive  underneath, at least it can communicate with the self driving car and say, look,  my humans about to do something really stupid.  So you might want to just hold back a little bit, that kind of thing.

Start time: 5343.28
End time: 5378.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a lot of this is way down the road. You know, right now these,  this Google system isn't really powerful enough to power all the systems within  the car.  But definitely building it inside of the dashboard means that it does have  easier access to a lot of that data. And that means that it then, you know,  down the road could certainly have a lot more power and a lot more  communications. And Google has basically always said, you know,  we don't need this standardized vehicle to vehicle communication system that  the national highway and traffic safety administration has been pushing for  decades now. We don't need any of that stuff.  Just give our cars an active data connection and we'll kind of take care of  the rest. And this, this is another step in that direction.

Transcript:  This is another ours Technica article from Ron Amatio,  the state of the car computer, forget horsepower. We want megahertz.  I don't think he's speaking for the car companies. One of the,  one of the things he pointed out is the car companies have a five year  development cycle.  So many of the car companies that are running Android are running  gingerbread KitKat, really old versions of Android.  So that's another, that's another problem for Google.

Start time: 5409.38
End time: 5448.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honda is one of the few manufacturers that has Android in the car right now.  And yeah, it is, it is quite old. That,  that five year life cycle is getting better. Ford, for example,  did the Ford GT in under two years anyway. So that's,  there are signs for improvement. But ultimately, you know,  the goal is with a system like Android in the dashboard that at that point,  you could basically do over there updates relatively trivially. But of course,  that that's a whole new thing for automotive manufacturers. You know,  they're used to writing software once in the shipment,  getting having it be supported for 10 years as is.  So the notion that you would need a software update for security reasons in  your car, that's kind of a whole new world for, for a lot of manufacturers,  something they're just kind of still getting their hands around.

Transcript:  Right. My wife has the new Volvo. What is it? The XC something, the SUV.  Yeah. And you know,  recently there was some software glitches and they had it, you know,  you have to drop it off for a day while they take care of it and update the  software decidedly inconvenient. Whereas a Tesla can overnight,  you could set your download time, you know,  when you want the software update to go and I want it at 11 o'clock at night and  it'll be done by 1am and then you wake up the next morning and it shows you what  was in the update, you know, right on your screen.  These are the things we updated. And you know,  so you have these manufacturers that need you to drop off your car to do a  software.

The maps just went more and more out of date, but my Tesla,  what we would get updates like every few months now, it's very, it's comes,  happens all the time. And by the way,  Tesla puts an Easter egg in there. So funny. The latest one before,  when you, so you normally tap, if you have autopilot,  you tap the stem twice to turn on autopilot.  If you tap it four times now, it does the super Mario rainbow road.  And for a while it was playing a, I think a song from Mario,  but now it plays I want more cowbell from Saturday night live. And the,  it's like, I don't even see,  you just wonder what else is in this thing. A Christmas, did you do on my model?  X the door is open and played a Mannheim steamroller Christmas song.

So it's interesting. Cause when,  when for instance, Microsoft did Microsoft car,  they just wanted another market for windows. It was a windows CE.  Now you gotta feel Google is fighting for more than effect.  That they're probably giving it away. Like they give away Android.  Cause they want the data. Yeah.

I mean, and I probably,  I'm starting to regret the way I went,  but you can either be paranoid and careful and tape over.  And I see lots of people taping over their cameras,  forgetting that of course you have a camera conveniently in your pocket with a  microphone and a GPS that's always connected to the internet.

So it identifies hot dogs or not hot dogs.  You take a picture of something.  So HBO in all their brilliance has developed a hot dog app that does exactly  that. You can download and I encourage you all to do so the brand new HBO hot  dog, not hot dog app. I don't want to mention what it ended up being used for,  but let's put it this way.  Periscope bought the company because it could be useful at identifying things  that are hot dog like, but not hot dogs.

He's been tweeting secret tweets.  Can anyone guess what my colleague Wei is working on for now? Look at that.  It's obviously if you look at it, whoops, obviously 3D camera, right?  He says, if you can, I'll give you a signed copy of our first product.  And then he tweeted this silhouette. Well, it's obvious.  Of the new phone.  Would any why would anybody buy a new smartphone?

And I'm not terribly bright to wrap my brain around.  What more do I need from a smartphone right now? Right.

We're going to put an AIPU or something, some sort of artificial intelligence chip.  I don't I don't feel like that's the problem is missing processing power.  The problem is, it's just these.  They're made up. They're just dumb.

Transcript:  And the majority that's happening in the cloud, I mean, that was the biggest step  forward when phones started to really be able to understand what you're talking about  is when they stopped doing it on the phone to begin with.  You know, and that was back before data networks were anywhere near as good as they are today.  So now that we have all that cloud processing at our disposal and a lot more bandwidth than we did  when Siri first came around.  Yeah, I'm a little bit skeptical that having something like that on the phone is actually  going to make this that much better.  So, you know, maybe 360 photography is that next big thing that will push the smartphone  forward and make this, you know, the phone that everybody has to have.  But yeah, I'm a little bit skeptical that that's going to be the thing.  But I'm you know, I think the fact that they're thinking about that,  you know, it's interesting.  They're trying something different.  We've certainly seen third party dongles that will do that for other phones before.  There's two, at least on the iPhone, that work exactly like that.

Transcript:  Well, Google Tango, that was the idea of Tango and it up to now has required giant phones that  would map the space you're in.  I don't, I never got that one either.  We've already seen the face recognition on Samsung's Galaxy S8 phone cracked, actually  was cracked at the event when one of the publications took a picture of himself  on his existing phone and showed it to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and it unlocked.  Now it turns out the Iris recognition system is also hackable.  The Chaos Computer Club in Germany, kind of one of the classic hacker clubs.  Yeah, the CCC say, it's really simple.  We just take a picture and we don't, it doesn't even have to be a very good picture  of your Iris with a camera.  Here, I'll mute the sound.  So you can see he's about 16 feet away, but he has a zoom lens on his point and shoot.  Doesn't have to get, look how big the face isn't even that big.  Well, he's not even a killer DSLR or anything like that.  No, no, it's just a crappy little point and shoot.  He's got a picture.  They now print out the picture of the eyeball.  They blow it up and print it out.  Then in order to trick the Samsung Galaxy S8, they have to make it look spherical.  So they print it out at life size and then they put a contact lens on top of it  to make it look like an eyeball.  The contact lens distorts the picture to make it round.  You'll see it in just a second.  So he's got his Iris now registered into that phone and now he's going to unlock it.  Using it, just proving that he can do it.  Now he takes a contact lens, puts it, I love the chaos.  I just love these guys, the chaos computer club puts it on top of the picture  and then uses the picture, holds it up and boom, the phone's unlocked.  That was easy.  So just a word of warning.  If you're depending on Iris, I thought we were told Iris recognition was the best of the bunch,  better than fingerprint, better than face.  No.  WannaCry is probably not the end of the line.  Excellent article in the Atlantic today from Bruce Schneier, one of my favorite security guys.  The Schneier blog is really great.  He talks in this article about the shadow brokers.  This is the hacker group that embarrassed the NSA by dumping a lot of exploits onto the internet.  That's where WannaCry's magic capability of spreading over your local area net came from.  It came from the NSA and came from this shadow brokers dump.  The shadow brokers now say, oh, we're not done yet.  In fact, we're thinking of doing a dump of the month club  because apparently they have quite a few more exploits from the NSA.  They don't seem to care much about publicizing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, hacking tools are one thing, but stockpiling...  We have a story that kind of picks apart the real nuance reasons why coming out on June 1st.  The basics are easy to understand and that is if there are zero day exploits within a system,  hacking tools are something different.  You have to give Microsoft and other companies the ability to patch these holes.  If you stockpile them, this will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing devil's apple.  Yeah, please bring it.  If the NSA and their hackers are working hard and they find, oh, this is great,  we can use SMB1 to spread...  By the way, they wouldn't do it with encryption ransomware.  They would use it to spread an eavesdropping tool onto all of the computers in the Russian embassy.  Yes.  Wouldn't they want to hold on to that?  Why?  If they tell Microsoft, they can't use it.

Transcript:  And there is solid evidence.  We are six years now, seven years past Stuxnet,  but there's solid evidence that Stuxnet put the Iranian nuclear program back by at least three  years, which is what we needed to finish the negotiation.  That was a hack that ruined their centrifuges so they couldn't enrich uranium,

Start time: 6630.02
End time: 6631.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6631.99
End time: 6654.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that helped us negotiate with them.  And it targeted Siemens Industrial Control Systems.  SCADAs.  Yes, SCADAs.  Yeah, right.  And so I understand that argument and I really empathize with people within the agency and  within the NSA.  However, I don't think any of that excuses stockpiling vulnerabilities that allow  massive attacks like this to occur.

Start time: 6656.15
End time: 6806.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys agree?  Yeah.  It's a tough one because I think, look, we all want to, we want the intelligence agencies to do  their job.  We want them to protect us from terrorism.  We want them to do espionage as needed to protect us from foreign powers who are, by the way,  without any trepidation, stockpiling and spiling on us.  I don't think the FSB in Russia is having any debate at all about whether they should  reveal these vulnerabilities.  Not a bit.  So don't we?  Now, there was, under Obama, back in 2008, something created called the  Vulnerabilities Equity Process.  And the theory was all the stakeholders come to the table and they actually had,  it was actually quite interesting, a series of questions that they needed to ask about  vulnerability to determine whether the NSA should be allowed to keep it or the CIA or the FBI,  or should be required to turn it over.  Let me see if I can find the questions that they ask.  This is from epic.org, the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  They have a lot of information about this VEP.  It's been around, as I said, since 2008.  The questions seem completely reasonable.  For instance, how much is the vulnerable system, in this case, it would have been Windows,  used in the core Internet infrastructure, in other critical infrastructure systems,  in the US economy, or in national security systems?  In other words, what's the danger?  Does the vulnerability, if left unpatched, impose significant risk?  How much harm could an adversary nation do with, or a criminal group, do with knowledge  of this vulnerability?  How likely is it we would know if someone else was exploiting it?  How badly do we need the intelligence?  This is a really important one, the one the NSA is going to argue.  How badly do we need the intelligence we think we can get from exploiting the vulnerability?  This is a cost-benefit analysis.  The benefit would be, well, what do we get?  And this is good, too.  Are there other ways we can get it?  Could we, let's say, utilize the vulnerability for a short period and then disclose it?  How likely is it somebody else will discover it?  Can it be patched or mitigated?  In other words, if we tell Microsoft, can they fix it?  The problem is, this process, although it exists, doesn't seem to have been used much.

Start time: 6807.58
End time: 6850.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there is liability that now affects people at tremendous scale.  So when you have the agency working 10 years ago, 15 years ago,  the vulnerability of intelligence leaks,  you can mitigate the damage.  If we look at what's happening with IoT and what we expect to see in the next five to 10 years,  plus all of these really kind of poorly made firmware that's on all these IoT devices,  so the scale of damage.  Look at the Mirai bot.  Yeah, precisely.  And because this, if you go to a pedestrian, a normal person on the street, and you say,  hey, tell me about the zero days.  I go, what?  What are you talking about?

Start time: 6851.20
End time: 6918.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a point, because the Mirai bot probably wouldn't,  it was useful in creating a distributed denial of service botnet,  but probably would not have been useful in targeted intelligence gathering,  which is what the NSA is up to.  So if they had discovered Mirai, that one under the vulnerability equities process  would have been revealed and fixed.  But they might keep something that allows them to say, hack your smart TV,  because we can get Ambassador Kislyov, we can see what he's up to  by spying on him through his Samsung.  I don't, you know, so I'm torn on this one.  By the way, there's a move in Congress to make this law.  This was just merely an interagency agreement.  There's a move in Congress to actually enshrine this in law.  That seems like a good step forward.  At least you need a process.  You have those questions.  Now, we talked about this on Tuesday on Security Now,  Steve Gibson poo-pooed the idea of a law.  He says, this is never, it's not going to make it,  NSA is going to come to the table every time saying, no, we need it.  Okay, thanks, bye.  Right.

We know because Donald Trump told the Russians in the Oval Office,  oh yeah, we're worried because we got Israeli intelligence that there's  people are putting bombs in laptops or planning on that.  Yeah, the Israelis love that.  Yeah, by the way, they must have really thrilled the Israelis when he did that.  That would make sense.  In fact, I kind of assumed that after all this travel, talking about these bans on laptops,  that must be what they got some intelligence that said there's a plan afoot.

I'm not making this up, but he was like,  I'm so poor, I'm going to either make bombs for ISIS or sell my kidney.  And so I'm sitting there with my morants interviewing him,  and we vetted him through the UN.  His story checks out.  He was kidnapped when he was young in Sudan and taught how to make bombs  and taught how to make very small, very effective bombs  that will fit inside electronic devices.  Like C3?

Transcript:  Brilliant.  All right, well, we're going to wrap this up in a minute.  Got a bunch more stories I want to talk to you guys about.  But first, a word from Blue Apron.  I made Blue Apron last night.  It was the best thing.  It was so good.  And my mouth waters when I do these ads.  It makes me so hungry.  Blue Apron, it delivers you...  It's the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.  They deliver incredible seasonal recipes with fresh high quality ingredients  to make amazing home cooked meals.  Tonight, we're doing blackened pork.  I can't wait.  Last night, we made a...  It's from Nashville.  A spicy chicken, kind of fried chicken.  I made mashed potatoes.  And I always...  In mashed potatoes, I used to use cream and butter.  And they did it with fromage blanc and butter.  And it was so good.  And then the green beans, I sauteed the green beans up,  chopped up a shallot.  And then I put...  They had a little bottle.  It comes with a little bottle of vinegar.  Put a little vinegar in there.  Sauteed the green beans, put them in the shallot vinegar mixture.  They...  Oh, my God.  It was...  Your mouth...  The house smells so good in your mouth.  And it took me half an hour.  And it's this gourmet meal.  And here's the best part.  I didn't have to buy one thing.  Everything I needed, including a half a cup of milk in this little box.  Everything I needed to make this amazing recipe.  Now, we have blue apron for two.  Although, you know, partly that's because our son doesn't like fancy food.  And he just wants plain pasta, you know, or rice.  But the truth is, there's enough in this meal that we can give him some.  And he actually really enjoys it.  It's a great way to introduce your kids to new flavors, new tastes.  And they have a family plan, which has more kid-friendly ingredients.  Look at that.  What is that?  Chicken schnitzel.  Oh, that looks good.  With fingerling potatoes.  Oh, what is that?  Roll back up.  I want to see the recipe.  And marinated Napa cabbage.  That's like coleslaw.  Oh, my God.  You can make this.  And the thing is, once you've done it,  they don't repeat recipes more than once a year.  So you're not going to get that recipe choice.  And you do get to choose.  It's all online.  You choose what you want in the box.  You choose when you want delivery.  It's not subscription.  So you get it whenever you feel like it.  You see exactly the right ingredients.  Everything's fresh.  Even the meat, the fish, never frozen.  It's a refrigerated box.  And once you've made it, you now know how to make it.  And you can go to the store and you can buy the ingredients.  And so it's like a cooking school in a box.  In fact, I think that's why they call it Blue Apron.  Because if you go to the Cordon Bleu in Paris,  the apprentice chefs wear little blue aprons.  And I think that's where they got the name.  The box has a blue apron on it and everything like that.  Look at the recipes.  Baked spinach and egg flatbread with sauteed asparagus and lemon aioli.  See, that's vegetarian.  They have vegetarian meals.  They can suit your needs.  You never get anything you didn't order.  So you totally customize it.  There's no weekly commitment.  Their freshness guarantee promises every ingredient in your delivery  arrives ready to cook or they'll make it right.  And if you don't like a recipe, they'll send you another one.  Look, go there right now.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Check out this week's menu and get three meals free  with your first purchase and free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  I love it when we get home and the blue apron box is on the doorstep.  Like I said, black and pork tonight.  You're all invited.  Although I only have enough for two.  So you have to like fight over it.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  Did you see this article, Tim?  Tesla analyst split.  There's a bet.  I guess some people think Tesla is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  And some people think it's over.  The stock is over.  Jimmy, you've never been...  Let me stop Bloomberg right here.

But yeah, I think from a tech perspective,  it's pretty easy to overlook a lot of the complexities of developing a car.  Just like, you know, I think Tesla and Elon Musk would admit they did exactly that when  they were launching their first cars.  You know, it took a long time to bring the Model S to market.  Took a long time to bring the Model X to market.  They're learning.  They're getting better.  But the real question right now in my eye is can Tesla continue to be quicker at innovating  than a company like Volkswagen, like Porsche, like Audi?  Can they beat those guys consistently?

And they've ramped up and they're producing the Model 3 and it looks like they're going  to get to whatever their goal is per year.  What was it?  80,000 vehicles a year.  But you're saying, OK, fine.  Now here come the big boys.

Transcript:  Right.  Exactly.  And Porsche is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into battery facilities, into  basically the groundwork that they need to make a killer EV.  And, you know, that's going to be a really good car when that comes out.  And if they can make a car that's better than the Model S, that costs less than the Model S  and from a brand like Porsche, I mean, are people really going to continue to support  Tesla?  Right now, Tesla's got a unique proposition.  They make a really fast, really nice looking EV.  When everybody has a really nice, really fast looking EV and you can buy one at any dealership  just down the road and have a warranty that you trust and all the other things that come  along with buying from a major manufacturer that you're familiar with, will Tesla continue  to have this position?  And that's, you know, that I think is the big question.  And ultimately, I don't think anybody really knows the answer to that right now.

And Tim, you can speak way more intelligently on this than I can, but the sort of Apple  approach to upgrades and fixes and sort of the wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Hey, if you have a problem with this, we just swap everything out.  There's a problem with the battery four years from now.  We just yank it out of the floorboards and put a brand new one in there for you.  There's not a lot of moving parts.  If we have any problems, we check it once a year.  We fix anything.  I know.

Transcript:  That's one of the hidden things, one of the hidden values of owning an EV is the lack  of maintenance.  There's really nothing that you do about it.  Instead, replace the washer fluid every now and again, rotate your tires, and you're  pretty much good to go.  That's about it.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Patreon, what a success story.  And now they say...  Now, I think this is probably because they're going to go for either more investment or  maybe even an IPO.  I don't know.  But they say, they put out the word, they now have a million paying patrons,  one million.  That's doubled in a year.  The number of active creators on Patreon, 50,000.  This is the site where...  And I actually support a number of podcasts and my Linux distribution that I like.  I actually give the guy five bucks a month.  It really is a great way for creators to get kind of patronized, subsidized by patrons.  They are on track to pay out unbelievably $150 million to creators this year.  That's just amazing.  Now, that doesn't mean they're amazingly profitable because they take a 5% cut.  So, a little math will tell you that's $7.5 million in revenue for Patreon.  So, they're kind of a small company.  But some congratulations, I think, in order for Patreon and the success of Patreon.  It's really kind of impressive.

Transcript:  And the success they enabled.  I think this is also one of the blown opportunities of Medium.  Everybody thought for a while Medium recently launched their subscription program for getting  Yog's Law.  Which way does money flow in publishing?  Towards the creator.  Medium wants you to pay them to curate stories that other people have created.  There are bloggers on Patreon, aren't there?  Patreon takes a percentage of revenue generated by creators.  So, this is a huge missed opportunity by Medium.  It's Yog's Law.  All money in publishing should always flow towards a creator.  Your agent takes a cut and the publisher takes a cut.  But in Medium's case, they wanted us to pay them instead of paying the creator.  I'm way more loyal to a writer, to somebody who creates software for a living.  I'm way more loyal to those things than I am to some startup that's already well-funded.

Right now, they don't do much except salute and answer questions.  But could it be Robocop Dubai says that they want 25% of their police force to be robotic  by the year 2030.  Is this just a gimmick?  Hello, citizen.

Transcript:  You can definitely see some limited security roles being easily done by then.  If it's just someone on patrol taking a report, monitoring suspects, that kind of thing.  That I think is easy enough to do.  And that's probably a pretty substantial part of a day-to-day workforce of a security officer.  So that kind of thing, I think, sounds realistic.  But ultimately, the idea of a District 9-style digital soldier walking down the street with a  gun on their hip, I think we might be able to further down the road in 2025.  Go ahead, Clayton.

That's all.  And we'll wrap up with a farewell to the Dean of Tech Journalism.  Walt Mossberg's last column appeared in Recode on May 25th.  He's been doing this longer than anybody except me.  He started in 1991, right about when I started doing a Tech Talk radio.  Although I'd been writing about tech since the late 70s.  Long time to be writing.  First in the Wall Street Journal.  Then he left the journal and started Recode.  Here's his first column.  And you know you could probably say the same thing again.  Personal computers, he wrote, are just too hard to use.  And it isn't your fault.  The computer industry boasts its products can help everyone be more productive.  Maybe so.  But many people can't afford the time and money needed to get the most out of PCs.  So Walt, well done.  I hope I can retire someday too.  But meantime, we'll stick around and fill the gap left by Walt Mossberg.  Hey, you guys are great.  Thank you so much for being here.  Dan Patterson, you can find more of him at Tech Republic.  I think we should just get you on and talk about all the things you learned  covering the campaign, the tech angles in the campaign.  And we'll look for your writing in Tech Republic about that too.
