Transcript:  Writer, editor at Bloomberg Business Week, which is a fine magazine.  Thank you, Leo.  Fine. Well, I was just thinking I should subscribe to this actually.  It's good to have you back, Mark.  Mark, we first met Mark when he was at the LA Times and CNN and now he's lighted.  And you have at Bloomberg Business Week, and you have an article in here  about the CEO of... What was the name of the company?  The CEO of Shopkick.

Start time: 166.34
End time: 193.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's Shopkick?  It's a mobile rewards program.  And there's some interesting technology behind it.  He created a modem using modem technology.  It's a speaker at a store's entrance that the human ear cannot hear, but the smartphone can hear it.  And so it knows which store you're in.  Wow.  GPS not enough. GPS not enough.  If you're in a mall, how does it know if you're in the Gap or the Old Navy two stores down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also here, John C. Dvorak from ChannelDvorak.com.  I'm going to have you back, John.  Hello.  And sitting in the chair where Jodie O'Dell would be perched, the I-CEO.

Start time: 207.05
End time: 210.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I was thinking because we might have an ad...  This is the one that was banned, wasn't it?

Start time: 210.30
End time: 268.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this is from Throwboy, but it may have been banned because he doesn't have any more.  So there's some question about whether he...  There's also the action figure. I think that was the one that was banned.  That was the one that was banned.  This does look a little like Steve Jobs, but it could be anybody wearing a black turtleneck jeans and...  Which is half the max owners in the world.  Yeah, yeah. It could be Johnny Ive.  Anyway, Jolie is running late, but we'll get her in the studio soon.  Actually, that is one of the top stories. It's going to be a crazy week.  We've got coming up on September 5th, Nokia is going to make some announcements.  Motorola, Google are going to make some announcements.  Presumably both of those will be new phones, although Nokia might do a Windows 8 tablet or Windows RT tablet.  Then Amazon the next day, September 6th, has a New York City announcement, presumed to be the new Kindles.  Or is that a guess or do we know? Have they said? They haven't said.  They haven't said, but it seems...  Everybody's taking a page from Apple's book.

Start time: 269.40
End time: 270.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a busy couple of weeks coming up.

Start time: 271.20
End time: 286.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But nobody's received an invite yet to the Apple event, am I right?  Correct.  But the rumors are very strong that it's September 12th. That's about right.  That means Monday or Tuesday, maybe Wednesday we'll get invitations.  Not me. A week before.  Some will get an invitation.  I'm going to get one.  You'll get an invitation. Mark will get an invitation. He'll tell us.

Start time: 286.22
End time: 289.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because he hasn't angered the gods of Apple.

Start time: 289.44
End time: 327.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He hasn't done anything to anger the ICEO yet.  And that's presumably a phone, although the pundits who seem best connected to Apple,  that would be John Gruber of Daring Fireball. He started it.  Followed by John Pachowski at All Things D and confirmed by the legendary Jim Dalrymple of The Loop.  Yep.  Yep. Mr. Yep.  You know, this has emerged without my knowledge. This has happened.  Apparently this guy, Jim Dalrymple, is so well connected that he doesn't repeat rumors.  He confirms them. But he's not really with Apple. He's never been an Apple employee.  But apparently just if...

Start time: 328.38
End time: 332.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was the editor of Macworld magazine.  He was there for a long time. He's pretty well sourced. He's very well sourced.

Start time: 333.28
End time: 350.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Gruber writes an article saying, I've been thinking...  Which I find hard to believe. It seems more like I got a phone call.  But anyway, I've been thinking. Apple probably wouldn't announce a new iPad mini at the same time as they announce a new iPhone,  because that would steal the iPhone's thunder. They'll have two events.

Start time: 350.20
End time: 353.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Dalrymple the guy with the Taliban beard?  Yeah.  Okay.

Start time: 354.46
End time: 357.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He looks easy. He's either ZZ Top or Taliban.

Start time: 357.81
End time: 362.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he does look a lot like ZZ Top.  Yeah.  He's got big...  He needs big sunglasses. That would do it.

Start time: 362.46
End time: 375.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The picture of him is the most popular picture of him. I think it's his Twitter picture.  And I think it's the slash. Or is it just slash?  Slash or the slash?  Wait, is it like the guitar guy?

Start time: 376.87
End time: 378.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No the.  I think it's slash.

Start time: 378.20
End time: 405.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No the. Okay. Glad we cleared that up.  He looks like Leon Russell.  I've completely lost my train of thought.  Oh yeah, John Gruber says, I've been thinking they're not going to have one event. They're going to have two, because why steal the thunder?  The next they'll announce an iPad mini, 7.85 inch iPad in October.  And Jim Dalrymple's response is, Gruber's a pretty smart guy.  And then John Pachowski in all things D says, yep.  Oh God.

Start time: 407.81
End time: 409.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? I didn't follow all this.

Start time: 409.62
End time: 428.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's hard to follow. I make a profession out of it.  Anyway, a lot of announcements. We'll probably cover some of those live.  You know, I have Brian Hogg is making me a Tim Cook puppet.  Puppet? With a hand?  Yeah, because I thought, you know, Apple no longer streams those events.  Oh, we can just do the thing with a bunch of puppeteers.

Start time: 429.24
End time: 430.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to do a reenactment.

Start time: 430.40
End time: 436.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea.  We've got the ICEO. We could just get a puppet of Tim Cook and we'd really be set. Don't you think?

Start time: 437.32
End time: 443.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the way to go.  Yeah, and we'll just.  It's probably a lot more entertaining too.  A mini stage with little curtains.

Start time: 444.66
End time: 460.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and one of them will hold a stick.  What I'll do is I'll get, you know, because the Virgin and Gadget and everybody does live blogs and they put pictures up,  I'll just have a rear projection and we can put the pictures up as they come.  We can actually do a pretty decent re- I want to put some energy into this.  Yeah, it sounds like it.  We can do a pretty good recreation.

Start time: 461.50
End time: 466.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you hit the home run with this.  And then one more show. It'd be good.

Start time: 467.22
End time: 470.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to make sure he's carrying around a Samsung phone.  Mini Steve Jobs.

Start time: 470.75
End time: 519.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little mini Samsung phone.  Oh, and that's speaking of which, Samsung's back in court.  Now, as you know, last time we spoke, Samsung won a $1.05 billion judgment against- I'm sorry, Apple won a $1.05 billion judgment against Samsung and 24 of its phones.  Samsung came back to court- I wonder if that's Jolie.  Samsung came back to court on Friday and said, oh, by the way, we'd like to add some more phones to the complaint.  Originally, Samsung had included the Galaxy S3 and some other more modern phones in the lawsuit Apple had.  You mean Apple?  Do you understand why I'm confused?  It's ludicrous.  They're really the same, Apple and Samsung.

Start time: 519.30
End time: 559.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I wrote a column about this for PC Magazine that discussed what I think was the big mistake that Apple's- and the continuing mistake they're making, which is making the phones equivalent.  Because now we're creating the psychological effect on the public at large that these two phones are the same indeed.  So why buy the expensive?  Why buy the expensive Apple phone instead buy the cheap-  I don't know.  Exactly the same Galaxy phone and save all this money.  And meanwhile, it costs that what?  So I don't even think they're ever going to pay the billion or whatever it is because there's all kinds of other things that are going on.  And we have to remember that half of the guts of the iPhone are made by Samsung, including the CPU.  So this is a joke, this whole thing.

Start time: 559.48
End time: 575.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So apparently Apple has filed an amended complaint.  This is a separate case from the Apple Samsung case with the U.S. District Court for Northern California.  They had already asked for patent infringement against the phone you're carrying, John, the Nexus.  In fact, asked for-

Start time: 575.32
End time: 577.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it look anything like an iPhone to you?

Start time: 577.82
End time: 592.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is- well, okay, let me- I'll set this up and then I'll say where my issues are.  And they've added to that complaint the Galaxy S3, which I carry, and the Galaxy Note, which I used to carry, which is 5.3 inches.  It's ginormous.

Start time: 593.70
End time: 600.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And besides that, to really look like an Apple phone, this should be scratched to crap.  So it should be all scratched up.

Start time: 600.22
End time: 643.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are the more recent phones.  Now, they had originally added at least some of those phones to the trial, and Judge Lucy Coe- that they just concluded.  And Lucy Coe said, you can't do all of those. It's too much.  So they took the more recent phones out.  I was not too upset with the verdict because I thought the jury rightly concluded that Samsung copied Apple intentionally.  They looked at the iPhone early on, and their early Samsung Android phones looked very much like the iPhone.  And there was the smoking gun emails from the Samsung executives that said, we have a crisis of design.  We've got to respond to the iPhone.  I've just seen it, and it's heaven versus the hell of our phones.  And I think the jury rightly concluded, yeah, Samsung said, we're going to copy.

Start time: 643.84
End time: 648.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they did with the white iconic against the black, green background.  It was an exact ripoff.

Start time: 649.64
End time: 664.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was then. Now, this is five years later, and I think Samsung's really innovated.  I think the Note is a good example.  To me, it seems for Apple to include these, to have a new suit against these new phones is not nearly so clear cut.  It's not as strong of an argument.

Start time: 664.22
End time: 668.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the damage is, I think, related mostly to the-  Confusion.  Yeah.

Start time: 670.13
End time: 734.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's no confusion, right?  Or you're not confused.  Nobody's confused.  We know what this phone is.  Apparently, Susan Carr.  Susan Carr.  But that was looking at earlier phones, not these current phones.  Now, the patents that Apple is going after Samsung now, these are the new ones.  There's 647, the data detectors patent, 721, slide to unlock, 172, word completion, and 604, universal search.  These were not-  Word completion?  Yeah.  Huh.  Like T9. Isn't that prior art?  Yeah, it's old.  So they're trying to get a sales ban against these products.  21 new smartphones, media players, and tablets that Samsung began releasing in August of last year through August of this year.  The Galaxy S3, the Galaxy Note, the Galaxy S2, the Epic 4G Touch Galaxy S2, that's on Sprint, the Illusion, the Captivate Glide, these names.  Terrible names.

Start time: 735.50
End time: 744.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stratosphere, Transform, Ultra.  The latter ones are named by the carriers, though.  Oh, are they?  The carriers have the worst naming conventions.  Admire, Conquer, the Dart.  Have you seen the-  The Dart.

Start time: 746.23
End time: 748.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to throw it at somebody.  It's made by Dodge.

Start time: 748.26
End time: 755.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Android phones versus condom names.  Yes.  They do seem a little bit-  The Excites.  It's confusing, yeah.

Start time: 756.23
End time: 790.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Captivate, the Fascinate, the Excite.  The media players, too.  The Galaxy Tab, which both the 10.1 Note and the Tab 7 Plus and the 8.9 inch Tab, all of which the jury in the last case said, no, the tablets don't infringe.  So Apple's not giving up.  And I think at this point it's going a little far.  I think it was not so bad that Apple won that case.  I think they'll settle.  They can move forward.  But if Apple continues to put Samsung phones in jeopardy, I'm not going to be happy because I like them.

Start time: 791.59
End time: 797.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want them.  Winning that case may have vindicated Apple and maybe now they'll go on a tear thinking that they have an argument.

Start time: 798.50
End time: 807.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you've got to remember Apple's been a litigative company since the Apple II days, since the pain Apple computer came out.  Since Windows.

Start time: 808.20
End time: 808.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, back further.

Start time: 810.22
End time: 822.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1979 we're talking.  I don't know what you're talking about.  He was born.  But that's when they started suing people left and right.  Franklin Computer was damned near put out.  I think it was essentially by suit.

Start time: 823.37
End time: 873.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good article in TechCrunch.  Let me see if I can find this.  I should have bookmarked it.  That I think does a good job of kind of breaking this down and acknowledges that Apple's been wandering.  Here it is.  It's from John Evans.  Apple's patent win is bad for all of us.  He says, I can see why people who were Apple users during the dark days have a messianic zeal.  Their ultimate triumph after such long suffering at the brutal hands of inferiors like Microsoft might seem to them more than remarkable.  It might seem, and this is a good word, righteous.  Add that to one of the weirdest and most unexpected things about the 21st century.  The extent to which so many people defensively identify with the operating system on their phone.

Start time: 874.29
End time: 877.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before that on the computer.  Right.  I'm a Mac person.

Start time: 878.25
End time: 911.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a Windows person.  And Apple must seem like a living testament to the ultimate victory of truth, justice, and the American way.  That's great writing, by the way.  But I think that that's a good point.  You don't like it?  It's corny.  It's corny, but I like it.  So what he's saying is that Apple, it's understandable that people who have lived through the dark days of Apple teetering on the brink might have kind of a messianic zeal, a righteous indignation about what Samsung's doing that isn't really justified.

Start time: 911.34
End time: 939.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you know anybody that's righteously indignant about this personally?  No.  I don't either.  But I live in a bubble.  Well, you run into a lot of people.  You go to the Macworld conference.  I've never run into anybody that's upset about it.  In fact, when I take one of these Nexus phones, and they're always going on and on about the fact that it never gets scratched ever, and they say, yeah, it's fine.  Nobody cares.

Start time: 940.13
End time: 957.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was standing around with a bunch of teenagers last time.  My son had his 18th birthday party.  Okay.  I was standing at the front door guarding it, trying to keep people out and keep the drunks from driving home.  And I was standing with a gaggle of teenagers, and one of the girls had her iPhone and dropped it.  You know, it's slippery.

Start time: 959.20
End time: 962.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's people dropping and breaking.  And she went, oh, I cracked it.

Start time: 963.36
End time: 971.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are my parents going to say?  And then every one of them said, oh, yeah, and they all pulled out their cracked iPhones.  Yeah.  Every one of them.  That was pretty good.

Start time: 980.20
End time: 985.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was the thing.  She didn't have a case.  I thought, well, if you have an iPhone, shouldn't you have it in some sort of bulletproof?

You know, every time you can.  My buddy Steve.  My buddy Steve told me.  He said Apple, the problem with the iPhone is they took a great phone and they made it.  Then they made it out of glass and slippery.

Start time: 1019.66

Transcript:  The rumor is that they're going back to metal on the back, right?  Right.

Start time: 1023.46
End time: 1028.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which will, by the way, break the NFC.  So now the rumor is.  What do you think I, CEO?

Start time: 1031.57
End time: 1039.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the way I see it, we've got plenty of things to do.  The other thing to worry about besides these little petty grievances.  Doing impression of you.  Get back to work.

Start time: 1040.20
End time: 1044.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds just like him.  Back to work.  Get back to work.

Start time: 1048.14
End time: 1127.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other rumor was that Apple will not be doing NFC, which is kind of disappointing to me because you wouldn't make the back metal if you were going to do NFC.  Doesn't work through metal.  This has NFC.  But it's a, you know, as well, all with Samsung phones, it's got that cheesy plastic back.  So this phone has NFC.  And you know where they put the NFC?  And this is clever.  They put it in the battery so you can't use some cheapy third party battery.  Was that right?  Yeah.  There's probably other good reasons.  NFC is a.  I doubt it.  Well, it's a passive technology, but they have to have power in the.  They use inductive power to get the passive chip to read.  So they need quite a bit of power.  So maybe it makes sense to put it in the battery.  Do you use Google Wallet?  Google Wallet does not work on my phone as it does not work on many Android phones.  Because let's say Verizon?  No, it's an unlocked European Galaxy S3.  And it says wallet is not available.  And so I thought, no, that's an S3 issue.  But then somebody emailed me and said, no, my T-Mobile S3 it works on.  So it may be carrier.  And Sprint.  That one's on AT&T.  Supports wallet.  Maybe it's Sprint.  Maybe it was Sprint, he said.  Yeah.  Wallet's a great idea because Google has now allowed you to add all your credit cards, right?  It took a little while, but now you do.  But that's just recently.  So now if I get somewhere with an NFC chip, of which there are very few.

Transcript:  I saw an interesting.  Now you just talked about Shopkick.  I saw a new chat room.  Do you remember we were talking about it during the radio show?  A new product, Android product for shoppers that you tap instead of tapping to pay, you tap to get a receipt.  And your phone is copying information about stuff you buy as you walk around.  That sounds right.  I think that's a very I don't know.  Would that be compelling?  Also offers, which of course I'm sure Shopkick wants to do offers.  That's where the money is, right?  You walk into a store.  Yeah, you walk into a store and you hear that magic tone.  Was it Proximiant?  You got 32 gigabytes on this little, bitty card.  Isn't that amazing?  So let me show you this app, Proximiant Touch and Go Digital Receipts.  So this is another way you could use NFC that's kind of.  This is all a scam.

Transcript:  What?  This is the worst thing we should be doing is any of this NFC stuff, especially if you go through the phone.  For security reasons?  No, because this is going to be the phone company in charge of our personal debts.  And so in the olden days, you might have some charge or something with American especially.  We don't want to pay it.  OK, well, it's up for grabs.

Transcript:  That's fine.  But if ISIS takes off, it'll be on your phone bill.  But that's not going to take off because neither Google nor Apple wants that.

So this Proximion lets you get receipts beamed to your smartphone without having to share your personal information with the store.  You can manage your spending when you have a return.  You've got a barcode on the phone for that receipt.  So you don't need to bring your receipt with you to scan it.  They collate the information.  And they have, and this is of course the key, rewards.  Cute girl in the demo video.  And a cute girl in the demo video. Thank you Mark for saying that.  So I didn't have to.

Start time: 1383.42
End time: 1407.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's what's a surprise to me,  because it would make a huge difference if Apple did.  I think it would give it critical mass.  But no merchant.  See, this is the power of the iPhone.  I'm looking here.  We're in Main Street, USA right here.  Pretty much.  You go down to Kentucky Street,  and unless those merchants all have NFC terminals of some kind,  nobody's going to do it.  Now, if Apple did it,  and everybody walking around with an iPhone had that capability,  that could change it, right?

Start time: 1407.20
End time: 1421.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the way it works.  Some guy from out of town will come in here, some slicker.  Carpet bagger.  City slicker.  And he's going to be going from store to store to store,  showing these people why they should have this.  And then he's going to be walking away with a bunch of money,  a big handful of money.

Start time: 1422.20

End time: 1441.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it says.  If I go to Pete's Coffee right now, it says Google Wallet.  That's the one store in town I think I can use it.  Now, then there's the other one.  There's geo-fencing, which Pay with Square uses.  Which kills the battery.

Start time: 1442.22
End time: 1456.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, does it?  Yeah.  What is this?  So it's a feature in Pay with Square,  where you can turn it on for select merchants.  It's turned on for select merchants.  If you go nearby, it automatically checks your phone.  It's kind of embarrassing because I did have that turned on,

Start time: 1457.32
End time: 1462.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and there's a coffee store just like a couple of blocks here,  and it's always on because I'm always here.  So I had to turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it does geo-fencing, but the problem is if you're nearby, you know,  I think this sound, this tone is an interesting response to that Shopkick.  Yeah, it's cool.  It's just the problem is you've got to get critical mass for anything to work.  Right?  Because no merchant's going to put Google Wallet, Proximiant,  and Shopkick in their store.  Or are they?

Start time: 1495.20
End time: 1503.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think NFC being a standard, it's already started to take off.  I go to, you know, 7-Eleven, McDonald's.  I kind of agree with that.

Start time: 1503.22
End time: 1521.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think you need to put all of them.  I think it's almost like going to the ATM.  You've got the star network, all these different networks that read your card.  It says it on the back of your card which ones they go for.  And I think there'll just be a bunch of these networks that consolidate the pipe,  but they still compete with each other.

Not like species like Darwin's origin of species.  No, no, that's species.  It's SP.  I think it's S-P-C-I-E-S.  And it means?  Dollar bill.  It means a bill.

I'll look it up while we're doing the show.  But anyway, the thing is I like printed money.  I think it's a good thing.  And you can control the economy a little bit.

That's only in San Francisco, then.  No, the bank.  Yeah, the bank's only in the Bay Area.  But I can use a card in France.  And it says, oh, you now have to pay 15 euros to use it.

It's exactly what it's used for.  For money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to start calling...  I used to call money cabbage.  I'm going to start calling it broccoli.  You can do that.  We're going to take a break.  I'm going to make some cabbage.  Thank God.  Where's Jolie O'Dell?  I'm telling you, she never confirmed it.  The guy ran off to Australia.  We need somebody to break this up.  Yeah, she'd do it.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.  We love Citrix and we really love GoToAssist.  If you're on the IT business and you do support, you're going to love GoToAssist.  I was talking to Russell because he uses a very much more expensive product.  There's something similar.  And he's ready.  He says, I'm ready to go.  This thing is so much better and it's so much less expensive.  So what is it?  Well, it's remote support.  You know that already.  I've talked about GoToAssist before.  In fact, it's the number one market leader in remote support.  It gives you unattended access to your customer's computer so you can get in there and fix it.  It's so much easier than being on the phone and saying, OK, click the Start menu.  There's no Start menu.  It's Windows 8.  OK, click the Windows button.  OK.  No, much better.  Just go in there and fix it.  Mac or PC.  It's very fast, very easy to use.  And now they've added something brand new that I think makes this a full support package.  They've got remote monitoring.  So I want you to try it and see how the monitoring works for you.  So the whole idea is you'll run the GoToAssist crawler on your client network.  So Russell ran it on our network here.  Made a list of everything running on the network.  All the hardware, all the software, every program on the system, everything.  Now he's got this database and now he can set up a dashboard that tracks the performance of everything.  Whether the toner cartridge is running low, the hard drive is running out of space, the network performance has gone down, servers are down.  Anything that happens, he'll get it.  He can set the thresholds and he'll get an instant message or a text or an email.  When something's going wrong, he can get in there and fix it.  Now there's some kinds of support guys who like it when things go wrong.  And then they come in and fix it because it makes them look like a big man.  If you're not that kind of person, the person, if you really, if you're a good support person, your goal is to make it transparent.  That's what Russell is.  I mean, nothing ever goes wrong around here.  It's always working because he's proactive.  And that's what GoToAssist will do for you.  If you want to get in the managed support business, if you're already in the managed support business and you want to know more, visit gotoassist.com.  There's a try it free button there.  Click that and use the promo code TWIT.  Right there, what says promo code.  There's a link.  Just open it up and type in TWIT and 30 days free, both the remote monitoring and the remote support.

So we've seen, I don't know whether, you know, it's interesting when you don't when you when you do the Apple thing where you have these announcements, but you don't tell anybody ahead of time what the announcement is going to be.  You end up getting this Apple thing, which is the rumors.  And the verge has this picture.  The verge.  I like the verge.  Do you not like the name or you're mocking the name or the company?  They just appeared out of the blue, it seems to me.  They did.  And they're doing to me.  They're doing the best work out there.  Their coverage of the Samsung Apple trial was amazing.  Don't you think?  Yeah, I'm not saying they're crap.  It's like where they come from.  You got Neil I.  You got Neil I.  You got Joshua Topolski, got Neil I.  Patel.  You got a really good team.  And you know who it is?  Is this is this SB Nation people Vox.  Oh, Vox.  Do you know about them?  Yeah, kind of.

They said we got something good.  Something good's coming.  Wasn't this is was it?  This is my next.  Remember that where they did that for a while and then the verge appears and it was like, wow, this is like full blown out of the mouth of Zeus.  Yeah, slick is the word.  Very slick.

You could get this now in this Nexus seven, which is not by any means junky.  Same price.  200 bucks is not in no sense.  Does it feel junky?  Right.  So I think and I could tell you what if Apple's doing a mini and I bet you here's my prediction.  I'll be the first to say this.  Apple's going to sell it for 200 bucks.  They're not going to do the normal.  Well, it might be 240.  My prediction.  But I bet you it starts at 200.  With gutless.  Yeah, the one you want will be 249.  That could be.

No, they got rid of them.  Remember this is the key whole thing with ice cream sandwich was that the buttons.  And I don't like that because it means the menu could be up there.

This was always the disappointment of the Kindle.  It wasn't really high contrast.  I kind of have a gray green background.  It's not bad the current one.  It's okay.  But wouldn't it be nice to have like paper?  Oh yeah.  White.  That's what the goal is.  With black text.  Just like this.  That's blue.  That's what I want.  No, I want to look like a book.

And he's been very happy with it.  He says that, and my son agrees with this because he's done some research, that Kindle's  accounting for about 85 to 90% of all book sales with 5 to 10% Nook and then the rest  scattered around of these things.  You mean people aren't buying paper at all?  Well, no, I'm talking about all e-books.  So in other words, the iPad and all the rest of them is just less than 10%.

Start time: 2617.28

And Gazelle is the best place to go now to get a quote on your iPhone.  And I'll tell you why.  You may look at the new iPhone when it comes out in a couple of weeks and say,  I don't really want it.  But the problem is by then the price for your old iPhone will have plummeted.  So the quotes at Gazelle are good for 30 days.  So my suggestion is just go to gazelle.com right now.  Get a quote on your iPhone 4S.  Which one do you have, John?  iPhone?  Let's say he had the 32 gigabyte.  Look, it's worth $257 in good condition.  If we're in flawless condition, $269.  Now here's the deal.  You throw that in the box.  Go through the rest of your closet.  You've got to have tons of… you especially, John.  See what the old Star Tech phone is worth.  I don't think they take Star… they do buy broken iPhones, by the way.  If you've got a cracked iPhone, there is… I guess they fix it and then they sell it.  They've got MacBooks.  Let's see.  What are the… you know, you can sell a rim, a Blackberry rim.  You could sell an HTC, an LG, a Motorola.  I don't think they have flip phones, though.  Let's see.  I've got a Verizon, Motorola.  Yeah, they get some of the older droids, stuff like that.  What do you think… I see the Droid Bionic was terrible.  That can't be worth very much.  It's in great shape here.  No water damage.  Yes, free of water damage.  Of course it is.  What's that worth?  Hey, that's not bad.  No, that's a good deal.  I'd actually take that.  Let me find it.  I must have one lying around.  So you throw those all in your box and then they pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  And then they send you a check.  Their data experts will wipe the data.  Let's say you're ready for the new iPad Mini.  That's effectively an iPad 2, you know.  I think that's what everybody's agreeing.  Let's say you have the 32 gigabyte, your Gazelle off for 270 bucks.  That's great.  They'll probably pay for the new iPad Mini and leave you 20 bucks for a couple of apps.

Transcript:  When the radio first became the next greatest thing to ever happen, it was going to change  society as we know it.  You know, they're talking about it.  It did?  Well, I guess so.  But it evolved into this thing now.  Look at this.  In 1933, here's Hitler at it with Goebbels.  There's also a picture of a...  There's also a famous Einstein picture.  He was opened at once, one year.  Wow.

Yeah, that was Goebbels, not Hitler.  So this year, Samsung had a big event in which they announced a ton of stuff.  You know, it was ridiculous.  Well, it was almost like they wanted to say, hey, we're not dead yet, right?  They're kind of like, look...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of Windows 8 stuff.  Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 2.  That was their Android sofa.  But then I think a lot of the thunder was stolen by the Ative S,  which is their Windows 8 phone.  Now, here's the thing.  Maybe, John, you can decipher this.  Because Samsung is not saying Windows Phone 8.  Remember, Windows Phone was Windows Phone 7.  Right.  They are now saying, and I think...  I don't know if this is Microsoft's doing or Samsung's doing.  They're calling it a Windows 8 phone.  Mm-hmm.  It's my opinion.  We talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly with Paul and Mary Jo on Thursday.  It's my opinion that this is intentional on Microsoft's part.  Because if you look at the Windows Phone, the Windows RT tablet, and Windows 8, the desktop...  And the Windows 8 tablet, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Essentially, what they're saying is, these are all Windows 8.  Yeah.  But it's not true, because apps that are designed for the desktop do not run on the tablet, do not run on the phone.  Or the phone. Right.  So I think that there's a little potential problem here for Microsoft that people are...  It sounds like they're intentionally trying to confuse people.  That these are all part of the Windows 8 line, but they're not.  Okay.

Start time: 3263.77
End time: 3273.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a thought.  No, I think you're right.  I don't think it's intentional.  I think it's a mistake, too.  But it's not like they're intentionally trying to confuse people.  Let's see if we can confuse them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I was so impressed about how many different form factors are coming out with Windows 8.  I mean, it's almost like the OEMs got together and said, let's do everything possible.  There's Microsoft's case with the keyboard built in.  The Surface.  And then you can pull out the screen from the keyboard and some devices you can swivel it up, down, every which way.

Transcript:  That's the HP has a strange swiveling mechanism.  Yeah, gee.  We haven't seen that before 15 years ago.  There's the Lenovo Yoga.  The Yoga is very odd.  Yeah.  Do you think that might reflect more confusion on the OEMs part about what Windows 8...  They don't know what's going to stick.  So let's try everything.  Yeah, let's try everything.

Wait till the Windows 8 PCs come out because touch is going to be a huge part.  Actually, it's not the HPs that does that swivel thing.  This is HP's Windows 8 Ultrabook.  But they all have touch, don't they?  They have few, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is an Ultrabook.  And see, well, it is detachable.  That's going to further confuse things because...

This is the tech geek badge you put on your Facebook or your Twitter.  You get...  I mean, there's more than that.  They also have a lot of really good articles on a variety of subjects.  If you look in the technologies section, you'll see an article that I wrote about an interview  I had with Jim Buczkowski, who is a technology... technologist at Ford.  Because I'm really curious about a couple of things.  One is what's going on with sync, because I have sync in my Mustang.  But also new technologies.  I think autonomous vehicles.  I think we're edging in that direction.  So I talked a little bit with him about that.  What did he say?  Well, he said what Ford has told me all along, which is we're not going to make 100% autonomous  vehicle yet, but what we're doing is driver assist.  The idea is that you got to have a human in there, just as you do on an airplane.  What you do is you give the human more and more information so they're safer and safer  drivers.  So, for instance, you drift out of the lane, pretensions the seat belts gives you a warning.  And actually, this isn't in the car yet, but it will steer you back into the lane.  There's all sorts of stuff that they're doing.  It's really interesting.  So, we're this close.  Do you like autonomous vehicles or no?

This was a more serious article that said, you know, according to the terms of service,  when you die, your digital, your books, your music, they don't go with you.  You know, if you had a 300 book library, you can give it to your heirs.  You can't do it with your Kindle.  So Bruce Willis wants to leave his huge digital music collection to his daughters.  Rumor Scout and Tallulah.  But under iTunes current terms and conditions, customers borrow the tracks.  You don't own them.  Willis has asked his advisors to set up a trust that holds his downloads, including  the Beatles, Led Zeppelin.  There was a great $99 complete thing, everything Led Zeppelin ever recorded.  They don't offer it anymore, but I bought it.  I'd love to hand that down to my children.

I think it's an interesting question, but I don't know what the answer is.  You're saying violate the terms of service and the law and just keep the damn thing.  According to Amazon, you do not acquire any ownership rights in the software or music content.  Apple limits the use of digital files to Apple devices used by the account holder.  Just make a hard drive and just give it to them.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to do that.  Who found that article?  That's a Bruce Willis article.

That's like 25 years ago.  It's a long time to starve rhesus monkeys.  The sad fact is that the calorie-restricted skinny monkeys did not live any longer than monkeys who got to eat normal amounts of food.  There you go.  It's really upsetting to a lot of people who for 25 years have believed that this calorie restriction was going to be the key to longevity.  Some researchers basically tossed the result out.  The director of the Nutritional Obesity Research Center at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana said,  I wouldn't discard the whole thing on the basis of one study.  I'd still bet on an extension of life. I think that really maybe it's time to think of something else.  Pirate Bay co-founder caught and arrested in Cambodia.  This kind of breaks my heart.

Transcript:  So really interesting article in the New York Times this morning, the Sunday Times, about elections, in which he says that journalists are missing the boat in their election coverage.  That wouldn't surprise me.  Because, he says, the journalists basically are like, he uses a chess analogy, like level three chess players compared to the campaigns that are like level eight.  They are at such a higher strategic level.  And the reason is campaigns are now using big data and know so much about what they're doing.  And journalists are still back here thinking, oh, it's like they're going after Hispanic voters.  That is not it at all.  They're going after Jim Beam drinking Northern California.  They've got it down to a science.  Bloomberg Businessweek subscribing people who drink martinis three times a week and are likely to vote.  I mean, they know this much.  And this is what you're talking about with the cash.  They know so much about these people that they are highly targeting exactly to this audience.  And it started with George W. Bush and Karl Rove.  And it has been highly refined.  You don't think it goes back further than that?  Well, you know, I was thinking about Nixon was the first to use an ad agency in his campaign.  Remember, that was like a big thing.  Always he's using an ad agency.  All of Nixon's campaign staff came from advertising, came from Madison Avenue.  Now it's the geeks.

Yeah, it's on twice a week.  What's the URL for that one?  NoAgendaShow.com.  It's on Thursdays.  Live. We stream live, by the way.  We got that idea from you.  Really?  Yeah. And then we stream live on Sunday mornings and at nine o'clock Pacific time.  And we talk about these sorts of things.  So Paul Ryan apparently came out, you know, the big Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he said something about Obama coming to our little assembly plant and he promised it would never close.  And he says, and now the place is closed and they've never reopened it.  And so everyone jumps on him for saying that, well, yeah, it closed, but it closed during the Bush administration.  Well, okay, so now you have to know. So that's the fact check.  The fact check veneer comes out and says, that, that...  See, caught you.  But it wasn't a lie. It was, Obama did come out and promise it was always going to be open, whether or not Bush would close during Bush or not.  So it was like this...  Well, how could he promise it was always going to be open if it had already closed?  No, it would close shortly after he left.  Ah, I see.  But it's beside the point. This is kind of, this is a veneer of, kind of looks like fact checking, but it's true.

Start time: 5976.56
End time: 5988.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and then there's also the kind of a gotcha thing. For instance, Ryan said he ran a two minute, two hour, 50 minute marathon.  And in fact, it wasn't that, that would be very fast.  But that's an error. He ran it in 1992.

Start time: 5989.04

Start time: 5992.52
End time: 5997.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Well, I don't know about the how long... that he was reading from a script when he said he ran that marathon in X numbers.  Well, that was in an interview.  Okay. Well, so that's different. The other thing I think was, it was, I could say you could argue it was misleading, but it wasn't inaccurate.  So there's no fact checking involved.
