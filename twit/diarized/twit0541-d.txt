Start time: 429.38
End time: 499.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to it. It is good. I think you're gonna have a great time.  Thank you. And we thank you for your work here. Oh absolutely. We're promoting a guy  into your position who's been around for a while. We found him in the chat room.  He was effing Dunn and it still is effing Dunn in the chat room is Jason  Klanthus. He is moving into the role that you have which is my regular producer  and technical director. So welcome Jason Klanthus. It's gonna be easy for me.  Yeah. I called Eileen Elaine for about a year so we've decided now that we should  only have people with the same name running the board. Jason's forever moving  forward. That's the only thing the only thing that can happen. So bad old  Congress they snuck CISA into the appropriations bill and passed it and  you know what? It's gonna become law regardless. So this was a bill that many  of us tried to fight against. I thought it was a bad idea. The Electronic  Frontier Foundation thought it was a bad idea. It's the Cybersecurity Information  Sharing Act of 2015 and I think a lot of tech companies had mixed feelings about

Start time: 500.22
End time: 524.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it. Mixed it to bad I think was the general gist. I mean there's a lot of  privacy concerns. There's too much legal indemnity for a company that share  information with the government and there were amendments made to CISA  throughout the year. It didn't pass and a lot of those amendments by the way that  would protect our privacy have been eliminated. So this is a worse version of the  bill that's now been pushed through as part of a budget. It's kind of a  disgrace actually. This is for those of you not in the US. This is how the

Start time: 526.22
End time: 539.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  American political system works. It's very common for little writers and things  to sneak into bigger bills. Earmarks things like that and this is not at all  unusual. The problem is without this appropriations bill the government would

End time: 545.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  shut down. You can't not pass it therefore it's gonna be in there soon  now we're all sunk. All that work we did was moot. And there is no in the United

Start time: 546.00
End time: 575.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  States ability to line item veto individual parts of a bill. You approve  it or you disapprove it the president will undoubtedly sign it. It's his bill  basically. It's a compromise bill so along with the Paul Ryan. So I think  we're getting CISA. Now the reason I say that tech companies might have had a  mixed opinion about this. Facebook, Apple, Google also know it's a terrible idea  but apparently Facebook behind the scenes was lobbying to pass it because  it gets them off the hook. They are no longer they can no longer be sued for

Start time: 575.84
End time: 584.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  giving up your private information. I find that to be too much wiggle room for  the corporations. I think it's too broad. There is no liability if and by

Start time: 587.80
End time: 604.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the way there doesn't have to be a warrant. They can just say hey you know  this guy Alex Wilhelm he's been pain in the butt so would you go arrest him and  they can. And even if they arrested you and it was false pretenses and and you  sued the government and you can't sue the government you can't sue this

Start time: 604.32
End time: 628.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  company. Well that would have been true before but not could ensue Facebook as part of the  bargain. I just find it really sad that we worked on this in Congress and in the  media public sphere for a couple years now. Instead of that all that stuff we  did to try to make it better and have our privacy protections capacity in this  really really disgraceful way. I mean this is Congress at its worst which is  saying a lot I know it's a big statement so they're usually pretty far down the  tree already but this is really sad. So what do you think that means for the

Start time: 628.32
End time: 642.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  average American learning about this bill possibly for the first time? How does  this affecting their interaction with privacy because obviously everyone here  knows what's going on what is that what how is that gonna affect them but what  is the average person how's it gonna affect their daily life? What do you tell

Start time: 643.04
End time: 700.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  mom about Facebook? I mean day to day it's not I mean people are going to  still be using Facebook and all of these right different social media  organizations the way that they've always done. The platform isn't gonna  change people aren't gonna suddenly decide to not do it because it affects  their privacy. Only people who really care about it are really going to jump  ship and it's also important I think now looking forward to see how this is  going to affect how platforms report on warrants for police searching for  surveillance because obviously as part of transparency measures they do release  yearly reports and I mean the US has always been far and away the country  with the most warrants for search on these sorts of platforms especially on  Facebook it's like far and away always the US has the most so I think that  what we're gonna see here is you know I think that it's gonna mean that there  are going to be more opportunities for the local law enforcement for the  government to tap into these sorts of stores of information. This isn't about

Start time: 700.12
End time: 705.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  local law enforcement this is about broader cybersecurity right this is a  much different kind of bill than bills used to bring local law enforcement

Start time: 705.52
End time: 714.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  information about us. Well yes and no right so you still have to have local  you still have to have a law enforcement body enacted for assisted to be enforced.

Start time: 714.34
End time: 718.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Certainly but not local. Yes local. Your police department is going to work on your cybersecurity?

Start time: 718.32
End time: 771.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not just local. Oh Joe Evans come on. No because it's yeah because that's the thing it says it's  cybersecurity but it's really data sharing so it means that any law any  government organization not even necessarily law enforcement can go to  Facebook and say we'd like some information about this the thing is  Facebook could still resist but there's no legal incentive for them to resist  they're no longer liable if they hand it over and this is my fear is that they  just gonna say fine you know maybe not because we're people who are paying  attention that's why they do these transparency reports now it's because  people were paying attention. Apple maybe will continue to fight that fight  Twitter's been very good about fighting that fight but I also feel like there's  let they don't have the the stick they have the carrot but not the stick to  make them fight for our privacy. I think that I think to answer your question  Liberty it's really people should just it just reinforces what we've said all  along if you put it on the internet it's public. Exactly do they have the

Start time: 772.06
End time: 779.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  opportunity to say hey we can make your information private and are they who  was gonna uphold them to that they don't they don't have it out there it's kind

Start time: 780.02
End time: 824.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  of public right so even if you know Facebook says well no this is your  private and they're are kind of it's in there if I'm gonna be fair we should  mention that the San Bernardino shooters posted in private direct messages  private Facebook messages their intent or at least their allegiance to ISIS but  that wasn't something the government could see in fact people who the New  York Times wrote an article saying it's a shocking thing that our intelligence  didn't know this when in fact in fact they've their own internal ombudsman  spanked them over this Margaret Sullivan said that no that's that's shameful that  was bad reporting because there was no way the government could have seen these  private messages well guess what now they can I don't know well to a certain

Start time: 824.84
End time: 857.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  extent I don't want to over blow how much information sharing is gonna happen  as part of CISA but I may not you're saying well it's gonna be a lot but it's  not gonna be I think center around individual communications I think to  be more dumps regarding to cyber intrusion cyber attacks that sort of  thing so it's not just gonna be like prison on steroids going back to the NSA  program but instead more of a way just to get more data into the government  without legal safe protections for us because we can't sue right that's the  scary part it's one facet of a larger broken not security position that we're  in it makes me sad it's not this you know panopticon they're bringing down  upon our social media profiles in the short term I think it definitely sets a

Transcript:  at cat gifts on Facebook I worry but you said the word data dump and that worries  me because that means that law enforcement might Facebook can't get in  trouble for doing this whether they do it or not I don't know but they could  say well you know we noticed the word Islam used in 10,000 posts here they are  and giving that to the federal government with with no risk for them  that could happen I don't know if Facebook would do that but that could

End time: 913.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the lesson everybody should learn every time we hear about data breaches and now  CISA is if you're putting it on the internet you might assume that others  might see this including law enforcement I think that's the takeaway yeah

Transcript:  FAA finally admits that the names and home addresses of drone owners will be  publicly available that's nice so the FAA has decided that if you get a new  drone above a certain weight it's not a very I don't have to look up the weight  but you have to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration that  kind of makes sense because that way if there's a renegade drone they can track

Start time: 1806.30
End time: 1832.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it back to the owner there's the story of the the drunk drone pilot in DC who  flew his drone onto the White House lawn and passed out woke up went I did what  yeah so that's pretty important yeah I think making people register drones in  this mean in this way means people just won't do it and it'll make a lot of  criminals by accident and so I wonder why the FAA thought this was the best way to  approach policy in this area because they've been really lagging on the  policy front on drones for some time over the last year and a half so I'm

Start time: 1832.04
End time: 1881.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  very impressed by this the it took a little work but John Goliath who writes  for Forbes tracked down basic and ultimately finally got the FAA to say  until the drone registry system is modified the FAA will not release the  names and addresses but when it is modified to permit public searches of  registration numbers names and addresses will be revealed through those searches  that's true if you're a ham I'm at your radio operator you're in the FCC database  and your information is there publicly searchable by name is that good or is  that just well I worry about privacy it's kind of the way government read  government because in the past it wasn't an easy thing to do I think you didn't  have harassment wasn't as big an issue I don't know what it is but I feel like  nowadays because of our concerns about privacy this is something we don't want

Start time: 1881.84
End time: 1885.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1885.80

Start time: 1891.14
End time: 1913.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  no I just trust more than one no I think what you're seeing here is that  obviously when it comes to having a publicly searchable drone database you  can see why they did this which is that there are at some point going to be  regulations surrounding women where you can fly your drone yes and you have to  have a searchable database and people should I think they should be able to  know who in their neighborhood has a drone well and the FBI has no police

Start time: 1913.54
End time: 1916.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  force so it's got to be searchable because the FAA can't enforce it local

Start time: 1916.90
End time: 1938.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  police has to enforce it exactly and it's what and I mean it could in  essentially be you know if they wanted to it could be in communication with law  enforcement and they could have you know a database that's only accessible via  whatever police searchable database but at the end of the day there are going to  be regulations on drones people are going to not be able to fly their drone  certain do we need those private properties or we need some rules you

Start time: 1942.80
End time: 2002.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but we need the regs right overall any any unmanned aircraft weighing more than  250 grams that's about half a pound or less than 55 pounds will have to be  registered there'll be a website where you'll go you'll register probably when  you buy a drone there'll be a card in there that says here's the address go  register this certainly there have been examples of drones getting in the way in  Los Angeles there's a famous case of firefighters being unable to fight a  wildfire with helicopters and planes because there were drones buzzing around  and they didn't dare risk the pilots health or life or safety by flying in  there and that allowed the fire the wildfire to burn unchecked for 20  additional minutes that's a problem people are very worried the FAA is very  worried although it hasn't happened yet about drones interfering with commercial  air traffic yes and if you did and it's true I think if a jet airplane ingested  a drone through its jets it could cause havoc now within the engine I presume be

Start time: 2175.06
End time: 2212.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  think that it also comes down to the fact that drones are more likely to have  cameras attached to them privacy and other if recording devices and again it's a  privacy issue it's if you are an average person you are allowed to have a certain  amount of personal privacy and you know if you have a drone you can sort of step  out of those bounds because you're physically not on a property but your  drone can be on a property and and that comes with it it's only go  ramifications but I think that it's a complicated issue that will transcend  you just a registry and transcend just regulations it's gonna be a combination  of them in order to make drones safe for people who don't fly drones and also

Start time: 3515.40
End time: 3603.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this is why I think it's not a good thing to be in the streaming music industry these days Pandora  as you know picked up the assets of RDO when RDO went as belly up and hopes to do streaming music  but the amount of money that one of these companies pays in royalties is set by a thing  called the copyright tribunal which in and of itself sounds almost you know dystopian dystopian  well the copyright tribunal has decided that Pandora by the way wanted a to lower its rates  Pandora currently pays 14 cents per 100 songs played so it's very low it's point zero zero one  four cent dollars per song but they are now raised to 17 cents per 100 songs play which is a 20%  increase doesn't sound like a lot but but remember that Pandora is hovering on the verge of I think  of bankruptcy as it is they pay more than a billion dollars a year they wanted to get down  to 11 cents per 100 songs and by the way the music industry which uses sound exchange to enforce its  copyrights wanted a bigger increase they wanted 25 cents per 100 songs that would have killed  Pandora I think yeah it's very close and it just shows you the companies like Spotify and Pandora  like Ardeo are really exist only because the music industry lets them at this point right

Transcript:  they the glorious common room says that the OPEC of music which I really enjoy is like that  analogy but Pandora stock following the announcement actually shot up about 13% I think people were  enthused that it was in a high as bad as it could have been right so it's priced in are to the share  price so the good news was good news of a sort not great news given the cost increase but I think  Pandora will persist and stay on so that's really what I care about it's long-term viability of

Start time: 5885.50
End time: 5958.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  too though yes so the reason that uh uber and lift have been sidestepping the mandatory fingerprint  background check instead doing their own proprietary background check through a private company  is that they contend that the fingerprint system is not helpful in catching or  identifying potential criminals in the system which is funny because of course city regulators  want them to do these fingerprint background checks because it's actually something that is  auditable by the city and actually by make sure that they're actually doing something in other  ways yes well it's also it means that they're actually using a database that is public rather  than a database or a system that is private so there's a lot of push-pull between you know  what kind of information uber and lift want to give out about their drivers and how they're  actually vetting the process and if it is a public system um how does that uh what does that mean for  a liability if for some reason uh somebody does pass a background check and then all of a sudden  uh they are criminal and they go on they do something you know at what point is uber  or lift at what point are they liable for you know that failure uber and lift both have said  we'll leave austin yes because they don't want to do it because it's easier for them to conduct all

Start time: 6102.36
End time: 6115.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and they don't have a protocol for jerks but they do have a rating system and that's the other thing  i think that works well with uber and lift and other systems like this is the rating system is  strong incentive for the driver isn't it that's why they always have little candies yes and no so

Start time: 6115.78
End time: 6147.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the rating system is really strong for a driver that has just started i mean we're talking about  someone who's maybe only had a dozen or so rides because every vote counts every vote counts more  so and then it's also the same thing for if you take rides at volume and you have a rider rating  however the the difference is that it is up to the driver's discretion to take a rider with a  low rating if you have a low rating as a driver you can get fired right and that's it so it really  it depends on how you want to look at it so if you they could use those ratings ballistically

Start time: 6169.30
End time: 6194.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  some of some of this is um kind of a mistrust of the company right that mostly this comes from a  mistrust partly because of some of the jerky things that travis kalanick and others have said  so that we just don't trust uber as a company whereas the cab what is the cab company i mean  did you ride an a1 yellow cab who did you check her who did you ride and you don't know the company

Transcript:  uh our show that's cute our show today brought to you by gazelle this is a very good time of  year to go know about gazelle for two reasons of course you could bring your old gadgets there  and get cash for them i know you got something special waiting for you under the tree maybe  you got something for hanukkah and it's time to not just throw that old gadget in the drawer but  to but to get the money for you wouldn't throw a hundred dollar bill in a drawer to gather dust  what are you doing with that old galaxy or iphone or ipad go to gazelle.com you get a 30-day quote  guaranteed for 30 days it gives you time to get the new device transfer the data over make sure  everything's working and then sell it for top dollar to gazelle they're really they're really  good at this and they will by the way if you forget to or can't wipe your data they the reason  i say can't because they buy broken iphone and ipads uh yeah they'll buy broken ones so uh that  way if you can't wipe the data they can do that they also uh will often and this is a weird thing  but they do it i know because they've done it to me twice give you more money than they quoted if  they get your device and say you know this is in better shape than you said we'll give you more  money they've upped my offer several but twice now for considerable amount of money they also  sell so this is kind of cool so they'll buy used gadgets remember them for that but it's also a  good place to go if you lose your phone or you break your phone your kids lose their phones you  don't want to buy a brand new phone but you can get a phone that's in the same condition as the  one you lost certified pre-owned in fact maybe better because gazelle runs them through a very  rigorous inspection to make sure everything's fully functional they know scratches on the screen  that that kind of thing and they're backed by a 30-day return policy so you're never at risk this  is a good time to buy because the new iphone is out the new ipad is out and so there'll be a lot  of iphones and ipads on the gazelle marketplace for you to get a good deal iphone 4s through 6  plus ipads the standard the air the mini models and android phones samsung galaxy phones all for  sale guaranteed by gazelle you can save more money the variety of conditions they don't there's no  carrier contract but they do you could choose ones that'll work with whatever carrier you choose  i love it it's a really great idea to buy or to sell g-a-z-e-l-l-e give new life to used electronics  traded in for cash or by certified pre-owned at gazelle gazelle.com today  samsung speaking of samsung going to the supreme the supremes they paid almost half a billion dollars  to apple wrote a very big check uh 540 million it's actually more than half a billion 548 million  dollar check but they say they don't feel they got fairly treated in court because design patents  are hard and juries can't be expected to understand the ins and outs of design patents and a judge  can't be expected to instruct them properly so they are going to the supreme court in a statement  they said samsung is escalating this case because it believes the way the laws were interpreted is  not in line with modern times if the current legal precedent stands it could diminish innovation  stifle competition pave the way for design patent control litigation and negatively impact the  economy and consumers it's an interesting point of view because on the one hand you know they lost  and it's pretty obvious that from day one samsung attempted to copy the iphone right out of the box  and yet on the other hand is it fair to say well we own rounded rectangles you know and uh and uh  you know a 548 million dollars is not an insignificant amount of money to pay they  want they were going to pay almost a billion but that got reduced is this something the supreme

End time: 7817.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  wrong but i mean what would apple do with that money they couldn't already do now so i just  kind of stifle samsung's ability to actually copy their products maybe but i mean how do you actually  i'm not gonna be a hater at all but i'm curious how you really patent some of the things they have

Start time: 7818.10
End time: 7846.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  i think that's why i like this right i think this should be resolved in the supreme court  definitely without a doubt and yet somebody pointed out it's true for instance the galaxy s7 we think  will have something very similar to force touch on your iphone 6s 6s uh it's some sort of pressure  3d touch kind of thing and uh somebody pointed out yes samsung knows they're copying everybody  knows they're copying but the way the legal system works the length of time it takes to get that  resolved samsung will make so much more money than they will lose in an adverse decision

Start time: 7847.26
End time: 7851.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that it's worth just copy oh for sure financially makes a lot of sense from that angle yeah and

Start time: 7852.04
End time: 7871.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that makes apple mad well it makes a lot of sense right so you have a situation where you want to  create like a proprietary phone but as we know when it comes to technology patents and the people  who hold them that probably if you've thought about it before i mean computers are patented  the electronic communication systems are patented uh photo distribution systems but

Transcript:  design patents are a little different design patents are not the same as invention patents

Start time: 7876.84
End time: 7923.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  yes and yes and no but they work in the same in the same manner right so you have a situation  where if somebody claims ownership whether that's a hardware or software or a feature or trademark  whatever it is they claim ownership of it and they sue them right so what you have is the situation  where apple is trying to put some distance between them and samsung and say like oh well in in the  u.s. the way that we do things here is that you are going to get dinged for every time you try to  copy us and samsung may or may not care but it's just that ability for apple to be put on the on  essentially the right side of this argument to sort of say like we have a right to keep it's not  about the money no of course it's not about the money it's not about the money and the other thing  is that you know samsung is a korean company and korea does patents and inventions come in a

Start time: 7923.72
End time: 7959.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  completely different way and they might not even use to be that the patent system you had to bring  a model like you invented the steam engine you have to bring to the patent inspector a model  of a working steam engine say see this is what i invented they keep that on file but then what  happened in it fairly recently was patents got extended beyond that to software patents and  design patents and that's a little bit harder to evaluate and prove and i think samsung's point  is well taken a jury shouldn't be expected to understand the subtle nuances of a design patent

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  being technologists they're not making it i think that in the long run that they're not going to be  asked to do is make that decision on that particular design patent okay but on the notion that a design

Transcript:  is they open you open a a branch in ireland where the corporate tax rate is low and it's very  favorable zero zero and you transfer the patents and the intellectual property to this irish  subsidiary and then the money and then license it back from them so then in order to make your  iphone you have to pay the irish subsidiary its license fees there thereby offshoring profits  to a zero tax country and then there is something going on with the indonesia around to holland and

Transcript:  them for trying to make more money it's legal right exactly it's legal apple actually borrows  money in the u.s to pay dividends and buyback shares because it's cheaper to borrow money here  like two percent than to repatriate cash at 35 percent 40 40 so in fact he got cooked to say

Start time: 8164.44
End time: 8182.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that the reason that 181 billion dollars is parked overseas is because apple that's the  largest amount of any u.s company so it's appropriate to focus on apple even google  and facebook do it too apple doesn't want to pay and cook admitted this 40 percent in the taxes  it would cost to repatriate it surprise who thought he did i mean who was like oh he really
