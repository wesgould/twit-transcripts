Transcript:  Oh, there he is.  Hey, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and finally took John Cory Doctorow on the line with us and hey, John.  Hey, and Steve Stecklow from the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, greetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a former geek cruiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that.  He was there for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. It was an assignment.  So, Cory, do you not want me to mention that you have a baby on the way?  Is that a private?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead. Mention it.  I've put it in my podcast and people have put two and two together with all the more  baby stuff I've been blogging.  So I'm like getting feeds for like baby gadget and geek dad and all the baby sites.  There's a lot of babies happening.  It's a little weird.  Well, so, you know, like Finland, the last time Finland's population didn't decline,  it was nine months after a TV strike that happened over winter.  So I'm convinced that nine months ago, like the Internet got slower.  And now we're now we're seeing this bumper crop emerge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If nothing else to do, I guess we could conceive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not? That's right.  It's like the nine nine months after the New York blackouts.  There's a little baby boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Alex has had Alex and Carlito have had theirs.  Patrick's had his Merlin's had his.  Merlin really dropped off the face of the map.  I guess you're going to kind of do that, Cory, a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to I'm going to go dark. Yeah.  Well, not entirely dark, but but pretty dark.  I'm going to know we're traveling for a while, which is like a huge thing for me.  This period I finished last Sunday, and I'm not traveling between now and February  28th. And that's the longest period I've had without getting on an airplane since 1995.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lord. And you've and so you were in L.A.  the last time we talked that that fellowship and or you just decided to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I was on a one year full break.  So that's over. I'm actually in the process of getting U.S.  visa again so I can start traveling to come and do speeches and stuff.  And that's like 10000 bucks to get that visa.  Yeah. America is the only Western country in the world.  That requires you to have a visa to show up and like give a talk at a conference or,  you know, do a day's consulting work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually hurt us.  I know there are a lot of open source guys who will not come to the states.  And they don't have a lot of the Linux conferences here anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The World Science Fiction Convention is like, you know, six years or five years out of six  is being held abroad, which is like completely unheard of.  It's in Denver next year, but it was in like Japan and Glasgow and just like anywhere.  You don't have to be fingerprinted by the DHS.  Hey, we should be rolling tape on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like more interesting than our typical Mac chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, don't you think I'm rolling tape on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like that.  They didn't let Kat Stevenson, you know, claiming he was a terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You said he is. Have you ever heard his music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good. He runs a runs an Islamic school in London.  I think he's pretty kosher.  Well, that's not I hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear that they've got a like they've got a whole classroom full of like light  brights and those those kids are learning to improvise little light bright designs all day.  The whole city of Boston is at risk for so long as Kat Stevens is running his training camp in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell everybody who's on the phone with us before we get going.  John C.  Dvorak dot org slash blog is here.  And I've been I've been going to Dvorak dot org slash blog and looking all the people  are posting a lot of videos these days, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, you know, I got to apologize.  Well, I'll apologize after you introduce everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, you want to apologize for them or your blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to the blog.  The blog's fantastic.  Of course it is.  No, I'm going to apologize for what happened to West Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, dear.  Well, also here, Mr.  Steve Stecklow from The Wall Street Journal.  Steve has been on to it before.  Last time was on a boat.  That's right. We got him on dry land today.  That's right. Steve, it's good to have you.  Steve, just last weekend, wrote a very interesting piece on the O.L.P.C.  has been making the rounds, media rounds, talking about Nick Negroponte's  project to put cheap laptops in the hands of a developing world.  We'll talk about that because there's it's a constantly developing story.  It's become a huge story,  particularly how Intel and Microsoft kind of started to horn in on the whole thing.  From London, England, the world's newest daddy blogger, Corey, Corey Doctorow.  Hi, Corey. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, how are you going?  Boing, boing. Two boings, one blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two boings, one blog. I like it.  Is Boing Boing going to start having some kid stuff on it, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we got some more of them.  You know, we've had more in the last year or two.  You know, David Peskovitz had a kid a little while ago and Mark's got two little kids.  So we do have a fair bit of it, but I've started to blog more baby stuff.  I'm reading the baby gadget sites.  Babygadget.com is a pretty good site  and and picking up some good stuff there.  And my my partner, as they say in Australia,  my fiance has also been picking up a lot of good stuff that I've been picking up from her.  You got to go to Parenhacks, too.  That's Parenhacks. Absolutely.  Asha Dornfeld. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, her.  She's she's awesome. She's a pal of mine.  I stay with her in rail whenever I'm in Portland.  Yeah. Yeah. Guests of Portland stay with rail and Asha Dornfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can put a little billboard at the end of every show.  I think that's a good idea.  We do a we've we started a few weeks ago,  a few months ago, I guess, now a parenting podcast on on Twitter.  And I think it's because there's so many people in the tech industry now  who are hitting their 30s and starting to have kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep saying it was that big Internet outage nine months ago to the baby boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was no outage on Thanksgiving Day.  It turns out online experts are saying the busiest day of the year,  not Black Friday, not Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving Day itself.  That's when everybody goes online to buy.  That's surprising. I guess doesn't surprise me.  Everybody has high speed Internet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you got to do something once the family really starts to get to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quick run to the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the best the best Thanksgiving thing I ever saw was that year  that the Mozilla Foundation ran a little campaign that was like,  go home and install Firefox on your parents computer this weekend.  And I think that you know how you like change the batteries in your fire alarm  on, you know, on leap forward and fall back day.  I think like Thanksgiving Day should be the day you go home and like formally  like a little pack of like update your parents virus definitions,  give them Firefox, update their open office, put the new Miro on,  install, install the new Ubuntu Telemats Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And be awesome. I think it's a very good.  Let's let's start that right now. A new initiative.  Well, we've got a year to prepare for it.  Online sites, Walmart, Best Buy and Circuit City,  biggest share of online traffic. Thanksgiving.  Amazon was busiest on Monday.  I don't know if that says something about Walmart, Best Buy,  Circuit City and Amazon seems to.  Seems to say something. I don't know what exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says that the smart money  waits till Monday on Monday. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, let's talk about Steve's article, because I think this is a really big story  and very interesting story.  The OLPC, the article was in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.  Last Nick Negropati has kind of responded to it as well.  Steve, what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually was on the radio with him on, I guess it was Thursday.  And he in that interview with NPR, he said that he didn't he didn't view Intel  where Microsoft is competition, which I thought was kind of interesting,  given that in my story, it disclosed that he had asked the the CEO of Intel  to stop selling their laptop overseas, the classmate.  But but basically what's going on is this story started out as essentially  a follow up to one I did two years ago,  which was not long after he first announced the hundred dollar laptop  at the World Economic Forum in Ndava, Switzerland.  And it quite soon it got a lot of attention and a lot of big players  soon signed up, including AMD and  News Corp and eventually eBay and Google and and a whole lot of them.  And, you know, for a while it looked like, you know, he was,  you know, greatly respected by everyone and all as, you know,  it was a great philanthropic idea, which I think it is.  But but but there were some there were some companies, most notably  Intel and Microsoft, who were quite openly hostile to this.  And Craig Barrett, the chairman of of Intel, started attacking  the machine, Nagropani's idea of a machine as a gadget, a hundred dollar gadget.  And Bill Gates later made sort of similar remarks about it.  And and what happened was, is Intel in mid  2006 introduced a laptop computer called the classmate.  Now, Intel is, you know, is a chip maker and they don't  they don't normally sell computers at all.  But, you know, they they introduced this machine.  It's only sold in developing countries.  It's currently going for about two hundred and thirty to three hundred dollars.  And Mr. Negropani's machine, which was supposed to cost a hundred dollars,  that was the goal, ends up costing a lot more because he did not achieve  the economies of scale that were required.  His his strategy was to find six countries  and sell them each a minimum of one million machines.  And he flew around the world meeting with leaders of many countries,  including Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, for example.  And he got essentially handshake promises  from a number of these countries to buy a million.  But the problem was, is it took quite a while to sort of design  and produce this machine, which only went into mass production just last month.  And by the time he did that, the, for example, the leader of Thailand,  who he had to deal with, was no longer in office  because he'd been overthrown in a military coup.  The president of Thailand was no longer the president of Thailand.  And a lot of the deals began to unravel.  And the biggest problem, I think, for him is that as the price went up  and it's now up to about one hundred and eighty eight dollars,  that sort of brought him into the realm of windows,  traditional laptop machines that run windows that have come down in price.  Now, part of the reason they've come down in price is because he  he really created an incentive.  You know, when he first announced this in early 05, the laptops cost  six hundred dollars and up.  And, you know, now suddenly you're seeing machines for four hundred dollars  and below that, and you're beginning to see machines offered  in the developing world for as little as two hundred dollars,  which which suddenly puts them in direct competition with his machine.  Now, Intel has really been very aggressive  in going after Negropony and OPC in country after country  that he was counting on.  They've been marketing very heavily, doing direct head to head  comparisons with his machine, declaring that the classmates better.  And a lot of these countries, you know, they look at the two machines  and they see one that's made by a giant corporation  with thirty five billion dollars in annual revenue  versus a little nonprofit out of MIT with 20 people.  And a budget of about nine and a half million dollars.  And, you know, they say, well, you know, who's going to which  which one's going to provide us with after sales support?  You know, which one's going to, you know, be there if something breaks.  And, you know, so by and large, they're going they're going towards Intel,  which actually seems sensible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what does happen if you break an OPC?  You're not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, hey, wait a minute.  What would it would it change anything if they sold the machine  with a garbage can that came with it?  So when when something happened to it, they could throw it out.  Is that what you're saying?  Oh, yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're no fan of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that if, you know, if the OPC was like well and truly rolled out,  that this question of what you do with it when it breaks would be you fix it.  And actually, what this would do is create a national industry  around the world of people who fixed it.  And and, you know, the problem with the head to head comparisons,  the OPCs and the Intel's is that they don't really  the OPC supposed to be a process and not a product. Right.  It's it's meant to have all these like affordances and design elements  that that make it a learning tool.  So one of those is that it's supposed to be easily taken apart and repaired  and put back together again by the people who use it.  You know, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, his plan all along was to train the kids and not the teachers  and have the children be able to fix them and that they would, you know,  supply them with spare parts or whatever.  And, you know, I think that's possible.  But, you know, it's clear that there was some naivety involved on his part.  One of his big problems, I think, was this top down approach  of going after the the leaders of the country and pretty much ignoring  the the bureaucrats, like in the ministries of education,  who actually make the budgetary decisions as to whether to buy these machines.  And, you know, many of them, you know, they're familiar  with the traditional windows machines.  And when push came to shove, they seem to be siding with those machines.  So I think that, you know, it's in theory what he's saying makes a lot of sense.  But, you know, when you're in a bidding process and one company says, well,  we're going to, you know, like Intel, we're going to train  one hundred and fifty thousand teachers in Nigeria.  And Mr. Negropony's group is saying, well, we don't need to train teachers at all  because the kids will teach the teachers.  You know, I don't think it's all that surprising that like Nigeria  just recently signed a big contract to buy Intel machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft's like a three dollar version of Windows, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, that's the other thing.  You know, Bill Gates, who had made fun of the O.L.P.C.  machine even before it came out, announced in Beijing in April  that they were going to start selling Windows for three dollars.  It's not just Windows.  It's Microsoft Office with Windows and some other programs.  I mean, you're talking hundreds of dollars with the programs  that are only available in developing countries.  And, you know, Negropony said at a meeting in April that, you know,  this was a direct response to him.  Now, I interviewed someone at Microsoft who claimed it wasn't.  But, you know, the fact of the matter is, is it is hurting him.  I mean, he's had a very sort of odd relationship with Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says he's been showing this to every day.  He says he knows Bill Gates.  He's been keeping Microsoft up to date on what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the I mean, unfortunately, there's been a lot of sort of  misreporting in the press, I think, about this.  It came out earlier this year.  Microsoft said yes.  Well, first of all, Negropony has claimed the thing runs Windows.  But but then when if you ask, well, how well does it run Windows?  You know, he doesn't they don't really tell you.  And I spoke with Microsoft and they said, yes, we're trying to put Windows on it.  But, you know, we don't know when that's going to happen.  And and and then when I talked to O.L.P.C., those guys, by and large, hate Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wants to put Windows on it anyway?  It seems like counter to the whole idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the head of their very big open source people at O.L.P.C.  and Walter Bender, who runs the software shop there,  told me he would resign if they replaced Linux as the core operating system  with Windows and Negropony told me that 80 percent of his people would quit.  So they're not really pushing it to run Windows.  The claims that it does runs Windows is sort of bogus.  And when I talked to Microsoft that despite a report recently  from a news agency that the thing was imminently going to run Windows,  they told me they have no idea when it's going to run or even if it can run it.  And Walter Bender told me that there were big licensing problems  that Microsoft confirmed with me between the open source design of the machine  and and Microsoft software.  So the current version of the machine that just came out that they're selling now,  it's very unlikely, I think, that it's that it's ever going to run Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me play devil's advocate here.  Maybe maybe this is all he's he's done what he wanted to do,  which was to get the biggies to come up with cheap computers.  So now laptops are available.  There's choice available. Why does it have to be O.L.P.C. court?  Does it have to be open source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, this isn't the first time that Microsoft tried to  has has sold very low cost or tried to sell very low cost  or free versions of their products in the developing world.  And they tried it in Brazil, where a very good guy named Sergio Amadeo  is in the culture ministry there and is the guy who set up the telecentros,  which are the the open source computer labs in the slums and the favela  and the favelas.  He he rejected the offer of free Microsoft software  and opted for really free software, software that's free as in speech  and free as in beer, Linux and so on.  And when Microsoft did the smear campaign against him, you know, like  idiot bureaucrat refuses free valuable software from the from the rich north.  He said, well, there's a reason I refused it.  It's because Microsoft has a drug dealer business model.  The first taste is free.  And they they sued him for corporate libel.  And he said, OK, let's go to court.  I want to hear you in a Brazilian court.  Defend the principle that you are not engaged in a drug dealer business model.  And Microsoft dropped the suit. Wow.  So I think that, you know, it is great if these products are available  at lower cost in the developing world.  I think that the the biggest miscalculation  maybe that Negroponte made around Intel was to imagine that Intel  would not be so shameless as to go up against a nonprofit public  spirited project just because it used their competitors chips.  You know, when I was at the UN,  the World Blind Union helped launch a treaty at the World Intellectual  Property Organization to protect the rights of blind people  to access books and other material.  And they did this partly on the grounds that they knew that, like, you would  you would sound like such a total jerk if you said, no, I object to the treaty  for giving blind people access to books.  And yet, like the and it was amazing to watch, like the  the World Publishers Association stand up and say,  although we support the objectives of this treaty, we have grave doubts  that it and like trying not to sound like, screw the blind, you know.  And I think that's like he misunderestimated.  He misunderestimated.  I think he underestimated Intel's Intel's willingness to like go out and say,  ah, screw this, screw that developing nations nonprofit project.  We're here to turn a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting with the Intel thing, which I haven't mentioned, is  they have this big sort of verbal public spat that went on for  close to a year and a half.  Then it culminated with an appearance Negropony made on 60 Minutes, where he  where they again, they he lashed out at Intel.  And Leslie Stahl confronts Craig Barrett with some marketing documentation  from Nigeria, in which they compared the machines head to head.  And, you know, she pulls this out and sort of embarrasses him.  And two months later, Intel, in effect, jumps into bed with Negropony  by joining a LPC's board and giving a multimillion dollar donation to the  nonprofit. And suddenly there were stories that this was a great victory for Negropony.  The problem and the one thing our story reported was that they also signed a  nondisclosure, a nondisparagement agreement so that they both agreed not to  attack one another publicly again.  That's convenient.  So the problem was, is it there was nothing in there and nothing in the agreement  that said that Intel would stop marketing.  Its laptop, the classmate, and it's continued to do so, I mean, extremely aggressively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's been a no.  I have to say, though, in some ways, this has been a successful project.  The LPC project has been successful.  They're selling, they say, two million dollars worth of laptops a day to the public.  This buy one, get one, buy one, give one program has been, it sounds like, fairly successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they sold half the machines were sold the first day.  I mean, it's it's declined since then.  You know, the numbers, I, you know, they've been saying two million a day for  for a long time, but that's really all happened at the beginning.  And they did. And they did extended it.  You know, it was only supposed to be for two weeks.  And on Thanksgiving Day, they extended it till the end of the year.  So, I mean, and the bottom line is that the numbers, even if they've sold  two million a day, he was predicting that he would sell a hundred to one hundred  and fifty million total by 2008, by 2008.  And then by 2007, right now, he would have sold over three million.  He sold like a tenth of that, even with with these numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because people have pulled out of deals.  Now, Hiawatha Bray writes in The Globe yesterday  that the orders are surging and they have made some deals.  The government of Peru's purchased two hundred sixty thousand machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our story had mentioned that that he was on the verge of doing a deal with Peru.  But again, if you add the numbers up,  you know, you're only talking about the low a few hundred thousand.  Not millions.  Millions that he that he needs to bring the cost down to a hundred dollars.  He can't do that without selling.  He has said this many times.  He needs to sell like five or six or eight million to to get to be able to pressure  the suppliers to lower the parts prices.  There's something like 600 different parts to this thing.  And he can't get it down.  And as long as he can't get it down, he's going to have trouble, I think.  Now, I have to say that I think he does deserve a huge amount of credit for,  you know, creating a marketplace in the developing world for these machines  and getting the big companies to think about it, which they hadn't really before.  So I think that, you know, I asked him, how would you feel if if in, you know,  if all these countries end up buying from Intel?  And he said he would still consider it a success.  But having said that, you know, it's hard to believe that he spent  after spending several years developing a unique machine that by virtually  all accounts is very innovative, that that that was all for naught.  I mean, so I I definitely sense that there's disappointment.  And if and if Nagrapani really doesn't view Intel as a competitor,  but is sort of welcoming them, why did he ask Adelini, the CEO of Intel,  just in this month, this past month in November, to stop selling the classmate?  I mean, he literally demanded that and Intel refused.  And now the deal is, is they've reached some new agreement  where they're supposedly working on a new machine that they want to  introduced by the Consumer Electronics Show in January.  And this is an Intel powered  OLPC machine, which obviously AMD is not going to be very happy about,  given that they've been in this thing since the beginning.  So that creates a whole other sort of dynamic to this,  which I think will make the story to be interesting, you know, for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've got two free piece of advice for OLPC if they want to stay in the game.  The first would be to like redesign the machine  so that it can be gracefully decomposed into parts that can be folded back  into them, into the manufacturing stream, because right now  e-waste is mostly processed by children who are largely killed by dealing with it.  Right. So like the thing, the sad truth is that the classmate and the OLPC,  its end of life is to end up in these Chinese decomposition cities  where eight year olds toil over vats of acid until they die, taking apart e-waste.  And so like redesign this thing so that it's so that it's easy  to fold back in the manufacturing stream.  And then without disparaging Intel, just run a lot of footage  of like children dying, decomposing machines.  And say, and ours doesn't do this, you know, you don't have to say anything  about the classmate, just just make that one of the checkboxes. Right.  Does your machine kill children by the children, by the thousands,  when it is at its end of life?  And none of the other ones will be able to say yes.  And the other one is to sell the OLPC outside of outside of the US on their buy  one, give one, you know, I can't buy one. I live in London.  And I just think it's crazy that a global project is only selling in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to move to Canada. You can buy one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I'm from Canada.  I can have a trip to my parents or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go home to Toronto and pick one up.  I'd love to I actually love to get one.  I think they look very cool.  I was surprised to I listen to the interview that you and Negroponte  did on NPR. I'm surprised to hear that it still comes with a crank.  I thought they'd abandoned the crank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I was really upset about that.  And I didn't I was very diplomatic and I didn't go after him.  But what the story said was that the early prototype of Kofi Annan  showed in Tunisia in the fall of 2005 had a hand crank that was attached  to the side to the screen.  And that not only was that scrap, but Negroponte at a meeting  I went to and heard him say this, he he called the attaching that crank  to the side of the screen utterly absurd.  So they got rid of it.  It was completely impractical to get rid of it right after.  But the problem was, is that that image of the machine, the hand  stuck with the public and it became like an icon.  Now, what he said, what he said on NPR was, you know, well,  it still works with a hand crank, but it's not the same hand crank.  And it doesn't come with the machine.  And, you know, I thought that was really  not very accurate.  And what I saw in April was what powers the thing is is a type of a device  with a pull string on it, like almost like a lawnmower that you pull and pull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that, you know, those actually work better and more efficiently than cranks  because they use a flywheel to do that.  I've actually seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was surprised to hear him say that it still runs right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've I've actually like held and fondled and played with an XO as well.  And which is like the model name of those machines.  And they're they've got that feel of like a genuinely awesome  new piece of technology that, you know, I felt the first time  someone handed me a caperow, right?  You know, and I was like, wow,  having used Apple two pluses for several years and then seeing a machine  that however unwieldy you could pick it up and carry it around.  I was like, this is the beginning of a totally different way of using computers.  And I felt that way when I played with the XO.  And, you know, one of the most deepest hackers I know is John Gilmore.  You like, you know, co-wrote GCC and and and, you know,  EMAX and a whole bunch of other really important stuff and co-founded EFF  and wrote Solaris and all that stuff or wrote parts of Solaris.  He's been using an XO, I think, exclusively now for months.  And he swears by it. Yeah.  So it's not just a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He must have very small hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's very nimble as our John. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I bought an Asus EEE PC.  I mean, I like this idea of a small form factor light PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that how it's pronounced? I thought it was pronounced EEE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  EEE. Actually, I think it's pronounced EEE, but but nobody knows  what you're talking about when you say the EEE PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I called it Tripoli and Microsoft, who's working with them,  corrected me and said it's just the EEE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it runs Linux and it's at a nice little computer.  Of course, my dog ate my power adapter, so I haven't used it in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It runs Windows 2, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could put Windows XP on it. Absolutely.  I think we should call it the EEE.  So the question is, is it competitive?  Is the XO competitive with it?  XO is running Linux and then a squeak E toy interface on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's another another competitor that's come along.  You know, Microsoft told me they have a big deal in Russia  to to sell hundreds of thousands of E machines with Windows on it.  Now, the E machine that's that you have, Leo, that sold in the States for,  I think, it's three hundred ninety nine dollars.  That Sustek is talking about having a kind of a cheaper version  for the developing world that will be as low as two hundred dollars.  And that one is aimed squarely at the O.L.P.C. machine.  And they're beginning to enter some of the markets that that Negroponte  is competing in. Right. Right.  But that's a much more traditional machine, right? Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cheap. It's got Wi-Fi.  It doesn't have a crank, doesn't have a pull string.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think what Corey is talking about,  one thing that's great about the O.L.P.C. machine is the screen.  It's amazing. Like I saw it in direct sunlight.  We held it by a window and you can read it perfectly clearly.  I mean, they really did a great job with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not backlit, or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it backlit? I think it has a backlit mode, doesn't it?  It can go either. It's like it's going to go either monochrome or color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but at the same time, it somehow it's got a reflective technology  that, you know, the sunlight seems to have no effect.  It's very, very bright in sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you still get one. You can get one to the end of the year.  It's it's $3.99.  You get one and a child gets one.  I guess the ones that this program generates are going to countries like Rwanda  and Haiti, where there's no money at all, no government money to buy these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Well, no government in the case of Rwanda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or no government at all. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I I've seen these like rolled out at places like  TourCon, the Hacker Conference in San Diego.  And just like everybody who who just who touches one,  just lets at this kind of little nerdgasm side, you know, like they just  it is a really sweet piece of hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would it be would that be a way to jumpstart it, to keep the program going?  If everybody, you know, said, let's buy them, let's give them, let's get it going.  Is that is that enough, I guess, to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it might be enough to like capture the public imagination.  I think part of the problem is that until you've held one  and seen kids play with them, actually, I think a huge thing.  My initial suggestion to them for the for the Christmas campaign  was to sell each each rich person, three of them. Right.  So you'd pay for three. Yep.  One would go to you.  One would go to a to a poor kid in your state.  And one would go to a poor kid overseas. Great idea.  And I thought that that would be like an amazing way to make this matter at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that we need to admit that there's poverty in the U.S.  And I don't know if. Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, but, you know, they have another program now called Give Many.  You guys are talking about as the give one get one.  But we also have one called Give Many, where you actually can  go out from them and do a direct purchase of something like 100.  You know, 10,000 even. Yeah.  In fact, to get the price low, you got to buy a huge quantity  because if you do anything under 100, I think it's three hundred dollars a unit.  But you can use these and then an outfit, you know, a school with them.  So there's a school in Alabama that supposedly is going to be buying  29 or 30,000 of these through this other program.  So they won't stop you right now from buying a large quantity  and giving it to kids in the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think that getting that work, let me give a plug for it.  Just so people know, they can go to laptop giving and dot org  and find out more about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think that getting them used by kids right around,  you know, right around where you live is a great way to make it matter to you,  as opposed to like something that happens in some distant land.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, people just got to touch it.  The color TV, the way that was brought to Britain is this guy Ludlum.  He he imported 50,000 of them and knocked on people's doors and said,  I will give you this color TV free, but I'll come back in a week.  And if you still want it, you have to pay me for it.  Otherwise, I'm taking it away again.  And like he he introduced color TV to Britain.  Once you've got one in your living room, it becomes a lot less theoretical.  And incidentally, his kids, the Ludlum brothers,  the guys who started Promise TV, which is this PBR that'll store six months  worth of everything on the air.  They're all like giant TV hackers. Yeah, yeah.  It's they'd store the whole Freeview multiplex is one big role.  And they've got the whole role from July 7th, from the day of the bombings in London.  And you can roll all 30 channels forward and sync and you can go up and down  the dial and watch all of TV respond in real time.  Like, you know, the channel that just shows, you know, reruns of Doctor Who  suddenly breaks into a newscast, you know, and then like,  and here's the BBC's coverage.  And as the BBC was saying this, what was Channel Four saying?  It's an amazing piece of technology. Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How big a hard drive is in that thing? That's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a whole whack of hard drives.  They the six month one they built for the BBC experimentally.  And they've got like a two week one that they're that they're  planning to market commercially. What a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just make sure you pay your licensing fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You're 120 pounds a year and you get you get the whole  free to free to air multiplex.  PVRs here are in some ways way cooler than in the States because the in the US,  the directory information, the electronic programming guide is expensive and  proprietary. And here it's actually in band.  There's there's a digital electronic programming guide that's transmitted over  the air that your device can get.  So you don't need like a subscription to TiVo and anyone can build a PVR  without having to worry about getting the PG data.  And there's 30 free digital terrestrial channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do you come down on the BBC iPlayer issue, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like it very much.  I've said a lot about this in public and in private to the Beeb.  And I think it's well, I heard last week from an incredibly reliable source  that they've got around or fewer than 10,000 people using it.  So having spent millions of pounds on it, they failed completely to actually  do anything with it. I think that, you know, Mac at all, right?  It doesn't run. It runs as a streamer on Macs and it'll run as a streamer on Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what it does, that's only because they were forced to do that.  They weren't right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and so what I mean, it's a really complex story,  because what happened is the trust to govern the BBC and govern it  very poorly these days, told them that they weren't allowed  to play hardball with the rights holders and say, you have to give us programs  on terms that allow us to allow people to download them and keep them  the way that they can record them with a VCR or get them with a PC  capture card and keep them.  And so the rights holders got together and they said, yeah, you can only keep  your your digital TV shows for seven days.  And that means that like you can't bank, you know, a whole bunch  of your kids favorite cartoons for them to watch, you know, on New Year's morning,  you know, when you when you when you sleeping in and hung over  and you hope that they'll entertain themselves the way that you could  with a regular PVR or with with with with a VCR.  And the real tragedy of this is that millions of Britons,  unlike the 10000 people who use the iPlayer, millions of Britons  are getting their TV from like UK, Nova and the Pirate Bay  and all these download sites and risking like legal sanction  and and all kinds of terrible, you know, they could be bankrupted  or jailed or whatever in order to watch television and to watch television.  They're required by law to fund the production of. Right.  So like the government will will will find you an enormous sum of money  if you don't pay money to the BBC to commission these programs.  But when you try to watch these programs with your computer on your own terms,  you will also get in trouble. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so I think that the iPlayer doesn't work outside the UK, though. Right.  And it doesn't work outside the UK. Right.  Is that ever going to change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  So this is the thing is there's a division of the BBC called BBC Worldwide  that accounts for about five percent of what the BBC makes.  And its mission is basically to turn the BBC into blockbuster for Americans.  So it it figures out how to market all that stuff to BBC America.  And and, you know, it's how you get your Doctor Who reruns in the States  and how the stores are full of BBC DVDs.  And that's a fine little mission for them to make a little money on the side.  But BBC Worldwide is now kind of driving the bus.  And they're saying like, well, you know, if we had an iPlayer  that didn't have strong geofencing, it would undermine BBC  America's ability to sell the iPlayer to Americans.  And so we need to have all these other restrictions  so that it's easier to sell the iPlayer to Americans.  And, you know, what that means is that  the future of British television is being driven by  what Americans need.  And that's really silly because Americans are licensed payers.  You know, the other thing about the iPlayer is that the DRM that they've put on it  at the request of the rights holders, they keep saying, well, we need to do this  to stop the show from showing up on peer to peer.  But the fact is that the BBC spends millions of pounds  blanketing the entire country with clear text digital copies  of every show they air on the air. Right.  They have digital free, you know, open broadcasts of it at the speed of light.  They have a satellite that transmits it in the clear. Right.  So like this is like saying, well, you know, if we if we don't add  another inch of steel to the front door of this safe,  the rest of which is made out of toilet paper, people will break into the safe.  But the rest of the safe is still made out of lural.  I mean, it's the same argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the door is the same argument about music copy protection.  You're giving away CDs with no protection or selling CDs with no protection.  But let's let's I want to wake John up.  So I'm going to see if I can find a story that is going to intrigue him.  John, are you still there? Macintosh, Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's passed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just wanted to see how long you guys would go with  with kind of who gives a crap stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you care that Google has officially said on Friday  that it will be buying into the auction?  Here's my question.  Is Google really going to make a serious bid for the 700 megahertz spectrum?  Or are they just going to make the token four point six million dollar bid  and walk away?  How serious are they about actually acquiring the spectrum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it seems to me that I don't think I care about that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're probably right.  What do you care?  You know, I have a friend who's a who's a very distinguished  old science fiction writer, and someone said he's so urbane.  He never did anything for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John never did anything for the first time.  Do you care about Michelle Malkin's blog outing many of the YouTube  videos in the CNN debates, many of these many of these questioners?  It's actually an interesting story or plants,  you know, supporters of other public supporters of other candidates and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, everybody was had to be expecting that.  But you think CNN would do a little bit better job of it.  I mean, she just blows it open here on the blog.  It's a fiasco. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but is the problem that the debate had people show up to watch it  who disagreed with the people who were saying stuff on the stage.  And that like part and parcel of a debate. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  True. I mean, I guess they didn't ask questions, but that that that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but there's no debate here.  I mean, they weren't debating anyway.  There were just a bunch of crazy questions,  many of them asked by snowmen and avatars and Krusty the Clown lookalikes.  That's mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what mainstream media thinks the Internet is.  And I just don't understand why there's no and then there is no debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it's over controlled.  I don't even know why these guys put up with it.  They should have walked from that thing and said,  let's go across the street here and just sit amongst ourselves.  Let somebody camcord it and we'll just argue with each other.  And it would be a lot better a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but the whole the whole question of like, oh, my gosh,  YouTube had people on it asking questions, the Republicans  who disagreed with Republicans.  I don't know why that's a scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not the scandal. The scandal is they're insincere.  It's a sincerity issue.  It's got nothing to do with the fact that the questions were there.  If you have some phony baloney, this is like George Bush and the fact  that they screen people that go in there so they can cheer for him  when they won't and they have no protest or protest zones now that are fenced off.  This is all a level of insincerity that is that's unconscionable.  I just don't see how anybody could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These guys pretended to be Republican snowmen.  Is that the process and crusties and so on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to avoid what they're trying to avoid is what happens in Britain.  I was there for the last the last election with Tony Blair.  And, you know, they actually allow real people ask him real questions.  Our television audience is and it's, you know, they're really tough questions.  And I remember, you know, they, you know, they'd say to him, like, at one point,  one person says to him, Mr.  Mr. Vice President.  And like he looks at puzzled and it's like an insult  because they consider him George Bush's poodle.  And calling him Mr.  Vice President is like an incredible insult.  And they were able to get away with that.  And, you know, in addition to that, you know, the questioners  who are often from the BBC ask really tough questions.  You just don't see that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, so this to do a great job with this is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  They had a show called This Hour is 22 Minutes that was all still on.  It's a great show.  Yeah. Yeah. There's this woman, Mark Delahunty.  I don't know if she still does the shtick.  She used to come to parliament.  She's a very astute political thinker.  She would come to parliament dressed like Xena Warrior Princess  and a leather barbarian and this kind of, you know, thick waisted,  but attractive middle aged woman from Nova Scotia in a in a leather bikini  with a broadsword.  And she would walk straight up to the MPs as they were walking out of session  and ask them the most biting and incisive political questions  as they stood there gawping at her.  And they were she was so disarming that she got them to say stuff  that they would have never said on camera with a regular CBC crew.  And at one point, the heads of the three major parties in Canada were all women.  And she convinced them all to come over to her place for a pajama party  and then ask them like incredibly hard political questions  while they did each other's hair.  It was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, if we're going to go in that direction,  why don't we just get with this next CNN debate, just get stuttering  John to come back and have him run the whole damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a bad idea.  I don't think he's had a lot of work lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is he? No, he's actually he gets a lot of work because he doesn't stutter anymore.  He's the guy who does Jay Leno's show. He's the announcer.  You're kidding. Yeah.  No, you didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got a job as an announcer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he doesn't stutter anymore.  And now he's a formal announcer. He does voiceover.  He's Jay Leno's announcer.  That's the biggest turnaround in show business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't been so shocked since I discovered that Tony the Tiger  and the Haunted Mansion guy were the same guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are no windows, but there are cornflakes.  They're great. They're great.  There are no windows and no doors.  And they're great.  It is time to take a little break.  And so you may go back to your respective corners and mention audible.com,  our sponsor of the show today.  You don't have to talk about it, Corey, because I know you're not a DRM fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I bought several thousand dollars worth of audible books.  And then when I changed platforms, it took me an entire month  running three computers in serial and parallel to get all the  the DRM off of my audiobook so I could listen to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can't blame audible because I mean, it's just like iTunes.  I think this is what the publishers require.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, everyone points a finger at someone else.  You know, well, don't the publishers actually.  I will tell you why I blame audible because my agent and I went to them  with my next book because my publisher wanted to do an audio edition.  They wanted to sell it through audible.  And they said we will do it, but only without DRM.  And audible said, I'm sorry, we will only sell books with DRM,  even though they have a DRM free distribute product, which is their  their like podcasts and stuff. Right.  And and even though they are the exclusive supplier of audiobooks to iTunes,  so no one else is allowed to sell audiobooks on iTunes.  And even though Steve Jobs says, oh, we want a DRM free product in iTunes,  audible will not sell material without without DRM, even if the author demands it.  So we're not doing it with with audible.  We're not doing it right. That's really to Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have you just lost your sponsor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, plug away, plug away.  I need sponsors, you know, I mean, I never make much money on this anyway.  If you don't mind a little DRM and frankly,  you know, I don't think your only choice other choices, cassettes,  you might want to check out audible.com.  Ripping CDs.  You could rip CDs.  The problem with that is when you get one big file and or a thousand little ones.  Yeah. And it's not an easy it's kind of hard to play them, to be honest with you.  I don't know. I live with the DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all you could.  You could. I know this is shocking, but you could read a book, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to get a Kindle so I don't have to ever touch paper again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of DRM, I do both cuts.  I I'm a huge audiobook, dude.  I mean, it's my whole life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know Kindle, by the way, is selling on eBay for because Amazon said  it's not going to be available shipping license until after Christmas.  It's going for like six hundred to a thousand dollars now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Literally just ridiculous.  It is. What did we do before eBay was around to pump up these markets for?  I mean, I imagine a Nintendo Wii is probably going for more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going for more than the way, like much more double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Kindle is going for more than the Wii double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We got to find out who these idiots are.  We'll buy these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting my Kindle in two days.  I'm going to turn around and sell it on eBay. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I got to throw a plug out there since we're doing this. Yes.  I want to thank Tom Mullins of the Charleston Department Store  for sending me a West Virginia hoodie.  I put everybody I put everybody else off, say, wait until after the championship  game, so they go out and lose to this lousy team pit.  And so they're not going to go to the championship now.  So those those hoodies I was hoping for.  Nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this like a table tennis team or something that you're?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a big table tennis team.  They're really good, too.  Loves his way back.  And then they slash at the ball and it goes straight.  And then it drops like a rocket.  It's the damnedest thing you've ever seen. Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to mention audible duck right now.  They sponsor of the show for the last time.  And we want to thank them so much for being here for as long as they did.  It was only a matter of time.  Audible dot com slash twit.  If you'd like to get a coupon, a credit toward a free book, I will recommend  Neil Gaiman book because I love Neil Gaiman.  I know you do. I'm sure you must, Corey.  He's oh, hell yeah.  He's the greatest.  And a number of his books are on here,  including Nancy Boyce and American Gods, which I just loved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God, Lenny Henry's reading of a Nancy Boyce is like nothing short of brilliant.  And you can buy the MP3 CD on Amazon.  See, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go. All right.  I knew we could find something that Corey would like Lenny Henry reading  Nancy Boyce, one of many, many 45000 plus books on audible dot com.  And they do do things like put the debates on unprotected and things like that.  They've been pretty good about their pro bono stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A U D I not if authors ask for DRM free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what? I'm going to go right.  I'm going to go there and I'm going to talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to make a fuss, Leo. I'm going to make a fuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want Corey Doctorow on audible.  I think they can have it, man, just as long as it's DRM free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not like it stops people from copying stuff.  I have a whole computer full of DDRM to audible books to prove it.  But, you know, it's it does.  What did you have to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did you have to do to take one book and and and and rip it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play it out in real time through audio hijack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Analog hole, baby.  Yeah, you can never stop the analog hole.  That's like nine hours a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop a second.  So you're telling me that the DRM is so easily defeatable  because it's got an analog signal, obviously, or you couldn't hear it  in the first place.  So what's the point of the DRM in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point is that it stops people from competing with with audible.  So only audible can authorize playback devices.  And so audible gets this like sort of super copyright where normal copyright  lets you control who can copy your works.  DRM copyright lets you control who can make a device that can play your work.  And that's never been the principle.  You know, making a record never gave you a veto over the design of the record  player. Audible gets that by adding DRM because of the DMCA.  It's against the law to break the DRM.  Canada is getting a DMCA.  Switzerland's getting a DMCA.  Britain has so far rejected it, but they're going to get one.  I mean, what are we going to do about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to kick ass.  I mean, it's going to be a big issue in the next Canadian election.  There's a huge gear up happening for the new Canadian DMCA  that's coming down in January.  The last two members of parliament who tried to bring the DMCA down in Canada  lost their jobs.  We can do it again.  Switzerland, they need 50,000 signatures to reverse the law.  They've just put up the petition.  I blogged it five minutes before we started talking.  You can put it in the show notes, Leo.  It's it's on boing boing right now.  50,000 is not a big number.  You know, there's there's that many geeks in Switzerland who care about it,  and they'll just knock the law out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very difficult because I think most people just aren't galvanized about that.  They don't care that much about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting there, though.  Sony Rootkit was the best gift people like us ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think the fact that EMA, AMI and others are starting to offer  unprotected music gives people at least a notion of what it might be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the work of DVD, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank God for DVD, John.  Good old John.  What's his latest thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, I've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I wrote a long, long profile about him a couple of years ago,  and the last I heard from him, he was going to get married.  Yeah, there goes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he did.  I remember he did some iPhone D stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. He's living in San Francisco now. I do know that.  And when he first came over, he was working for some guy who the guy  who founded the MP3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's out here in San Francisco.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to get him on Cranky Geeks.  Yeah. Oh, he's the nicest guy.  You can probably find him.  He's the nicest guy with him. Maybe it won't work out.  Somebody more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Lech Johansson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's started something called Double Twist Ventures, I think.  And he was trying to sell some Apple defeating technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a really funny one.  It was that they would take they would put your DRM on an Apple song.  So they would underem Apple and then put your DRM on it  so that you could then put it on your device.  It was just it was that's why it was called Double Twist.  It was it was very funny.  It was while my class was in session last year at USC and we we had a great day  talking about it.  He's he's a funny he's he's a master practitioner of, you know, DRM judo.  He certainly is. How old is he now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he like in his early 20s? He can't be very old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, he's probably about 26 or so. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. His date of birth is 1983, according to Wikipedia.  So that would make him twenty twenty four. Twenty four. Twenty five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only about three or four years left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of a yeah, then it's over.  Then he's going to be a pundit on Twitter.  Mobile phone subscriptions hit three point three billion worldwide.  It's a lot of people with cell phones.  Fifty nine countries have mobile penetration.  I don't understand this over 100 percent.  More than one mobile phone per person.  Finland. I have two phones, but I thought that was kind of odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, in Europe, it's pretty common. Really?  I once read that penetration in Finland of like seven to ten year olds  was something like over 70 percent. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you own more than one because it's because you have a work phone  and a home and personal phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also a lot of people that have a voice phone and then a messaging phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Or I have Blackberry.  I have a Blackberry for the email.  But it also does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Corey, how's the iPhone doing in Britain?  There have been kind of mixed reports in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I see them in like Carphone Warehouse and I see the posters,  but I haven't seen anyone carrying one.  I you know, the data plans here are so bonkers.  They, you know, they they they do such violence to the term unlimited here  when it comes to unlimited data plans.  They make Verizon look, you know, like honest, upstanding sit.  So I just got a T-Mobile 3G fob.  And I noticed when I read the fine print that it says it's unlimited,  but like something like the good neighbor policy applies.  It makes no sense at all.  And that's the right that's the language Verizon's got to use. I like that.  Oh, it's so bizarre.  And so you get N bits per per month.  But the thing is that that doesn't really speak to.  Well, there's a couple of problems.  One is that no human being ever was able to guesstimate how many bits they were consuming.  Right. And especially how many bits you might consume when you click a link.  So it's a terrible thing to build you on because you have no control over it,  no way of measuring it, no way of knowing how you're performing with it.  And then and then the other problem is that you can imagine that you could totally blow  through your limit if you had like a low trickle of data like 10k per second around the clock  sitting there in your in your home with no one else in the same cell as you.  And you wouldn't ever do anything bad to their capacity.  On the other hand, you could you could not exceed your limit,  but do a lot of heavy streaming in a place where there's a lot of other people hanging around  and really, really cause a lot of contention.  So capping the number of bits per month doesn't really have anything to do  with balancing out their load so that everyone gets a fair share,  because if there's a million people around you all downloading their limit  in the space of an hour, no one's going to get anything.  And if there's one person around you and you're both very nice about your bandwidth,  but use it around the clock, then you're both going to end up going over your limit.  And so it's it's not a great way to build this stuff, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what are they doing about roaming charges?  Because that was a big issue here.  If you bought what and I brought it to Europe, you know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thousands of dollars.  I don't know. I know this.  The 3G stuff doesn't roam.  My 3G modem won't roam.  I was in Germany and Austria last week, the week before, and I couldn't turn it on.  But I think the GPRS roams.  I don't know what the iPhone data roaming plans are like.  You can get a pretty good roaming package for voice here.  I tend to pay about 20 cents a minute for roaming when I'm when I'm overseas  and when I'm making overseas calls, which is a lot better than like T-Mobile.  T-Mobile, it was like I called my fiance when she was in Germany on her T-Mobile phone.  And just for her to get a call, this was T-Mobile USA to get the call.  Picking up the phone was a buck.  And then it went up from there.  And so it was like Mexico, right?  You know, she could she could practically see America from where she was. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think? I know this probably doesn't concern you much, Corey,  but Verizon, for reasons unknown, has announced it's going to open up its network.  Verizon Wireless announced it will this is a quote, provide customers the option  to use on its nationwide wireless network, wireless devices,  software and applications not offered by the company.  Wireless plans, Verizon Wireless plans to have this new choice  available to customers throughout the country by the end of 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they're coming.  They're they're embracing what's called in telco circles, the Carter phone doctrine,  which comes from the big lawsuit AT&T had over whether or not you should be allowed  to plug stuff into their network.  And when AT&T lost that, it actually ended up making them more money  because all of a sudden people who weren't AT&T could think of things  to use AT&T's networks for, and that drove demand for AT&T's network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just have to rent from Western Electric to get a phone  and had to pay a couple of bucks a month, but they wouldn't  want to put anything else on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first of these lawsuits was over something called Hush-a-Phone,  which was like a giant cup that went around the receiver of your phone  so that people couldn't hear what you were saying.  And AT&T argued that it might damage their network to have these big plastic  cups fitted over the ends of receivers.  So this all comes from the work of an amazing scholar, a guy named Tim Wu,  who is now in D.C., I think, but he was at Columbia, got tenure at Columbia  and then abruptly left and went to D.C. to work on the Hill.  And Tim is he's a great scholar on telecoms, lawyer, and he's great on copyright.  He's a lessing protege.  And the weird thing is that we went to elementary school together in Toronto.  And I lost touch with him for like 20 years.  And I met him when a girl I was dating went to D.C.  to see the Eldred case, the Supreme Court case on copyright extension,  and ran into Tim on the steps.  And she's like, he's like, I'm from Toronto.  And she said, oh, yeah, I'm dating a guy from Toronto.  And what's his name?  I've known him since I was eight.  That's funny.  So now Tim and I are pals again.  It's great. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this means, I think, in theory that you could that Nokia could make a CDMA  phone that would work on the wireless network, sell it to you direct  and Verizon would allow you to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you could use it by the iPhone and how much bad press  and by Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the threat, Google poses at the with the with Android,  its own operating system and the 700 megahertz auctions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Well, but I also think that just all this  the fact that that that Apple and AT&T  caught tons of bad press over lock in, probably made Verizon think,  well, if we didn't have lock in, maybe we'd get the inverse of that  and craploads of good press.  You know, no one no language in the world contains the phrase  as palatable as a phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't think Google's recent announcement about getting,  you know, their software onto mobile phones has something to do  with what Verizon's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure it influenced it.  A lot of them. And this is the the trend.  I guess the real question is how much is Verizon going to charge?  You know, what plans they're going to offer for this?  If you if I try to buy a use a Wi-Fi phone on their network,  how are they going to feel about that?  A Skype phone on their network, how are they going to feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they actually specifically mentioned that use case and said,  we plan on doing that.  We plan on letting you do that.  Wow. I seem to recall seeing that in there in their press materials on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple could do an iPhone for Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you saw what happened, I think it was T-Mobile in Germany.  You know, they they were 999 euro unlocked iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. What a deal. Such a deal.  Well, but then didn't aren't the French  I unlocked iPhones now competing with the German unlocked iPhones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's the common market.  I don't think they can stop you from importing them. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so do we believe Verizon?  I mean, is this is this a new  a new and kinder gentler Verizon wireless or is this  oh, Malik seems to think, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, remember, this is the company that spent like millions of dollars  fighting recording industry subpoenas and won the principle that they have to  actually or a recording industry, non subpoenas where they went.  The record industry would go to them and say the John Doe subpoenas.  Yeah. Well, they would go like, we're the no.  Oh, this before the John Doe's, they would just show up and they'd say like,  we hear some IP addresses, tell us who these people are and where they live.  And and Verizon said, go prove to a court that these people have done something wrong.  Get the court to order us to turn it over and we'll do it.  But you guys don't get to like just come in and go through our filing cabinets.  And they won, you know, this it was millions of dollars they spent.  And they won.  So, you know, Verizon isn't like unmitigated evil, but they're they're mitigated evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and on the other hand, they are the ones who shut down  or tried to shut down Pennsylvania's open Wi-Fi.  Yeah, yeah. They're mitigated evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mitigated. Not unmitigated.  They're mitigated.  I know the Kindle, the Kindle sucks, but Amazon isn't isn't the worst company in the world.  They do lots of great stuff like, you know, they just fought the federal government  to keep tens of thousands of their customer records out of out of the NSA's hands.  You know, so like, yeah, they launched the Kindle. It's terrible.  I think it's a really dumb thing.  I think Amazon, you know, is like the world's greatest hard goods  vendor and the world's dumbest digital goods vendor between this and their stupid Amazon unbox  and the bad terms of service on their MP3 store.  You know, it's like, why is it that the best company on the Web is the worst company on the Web  when they're selling digital stuff?  But they're they're pretty damn good when it comes to protecting user privacy from from phishing expeditions.  So got to give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your objection to the Kindle, the DRM?  Yeah, and the terms of use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the terms of use?  The terms of use, so you can't loan it, sell it or give it away. Right.  And this is the company when the Authors Guild threatened to sue them for helping people to sell used books.  Jeff Bezos, who I think of as a friend and who I think is an amazing guy, made this public statement  where he said, buying a book gives you the right to sell it and give it away.  Everybody knows this. Yeah. Right.  Not an e-book, I guess. But not an e-book.  And it's like, well, what is it about the you know, is it is it?  Why is it that you can sell me a book and no one thinks that putting a shrink wrap license  on the cover of that book that says, you know, you can only read this if you're a Republican  and you can't give it to your friends to read and you have to read it on one leg  and we're allowed to come over to your house and take the book away if we think you're misusing it.  People go, that's crazy. It's my book.  But as soon as that book is represented as zeros and ones, it's like you can have terms of service  like the Kindle has where if they think you're violating their terms, they can take your books away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, isn't it because it's possible to make infinite, perfect digital copies?  Isn't that the issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but why not make that the thing that you're not allowed to do? Right.  It's not that that that doesn't have any nexus with like loaning a book to a friend or giving it away or selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying if I buy a Kindle, I use it for a minute, I can't give it to you or sell it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not without violating the terms of service, not the books anyways.  I don't know what the terms of service and the Kindle are,  but the books terms of service say that you're not allowed to lend them, sell them or give them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So like, you know, you're careful selling your Kindle because, you know, it's linked to your Amazon account.  Yeah, it's tied to your account. You'd have to delete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your kids, your kids school library is filled with books that people gave, donated to the library.  Right. What's the future look like if digital books can't be given away or loaned?  And what does it say about like the way that we conduct culture if loaning becomes illegal and giving stuff away, donating?  But there is a fundamental difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a one physical copy of that book.  If I loan it, I'm by definition depriving myself of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but no one shut down used CD stores just because people can rip CDs.  Well, I think they'd like to.  Well, they would, but they haven't managed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's you know, now you're getting now you're verging.  But when it's a completely digital copy, I can keep a copy, give you a copy, loan another guy a copy.  And we've made three copies now and paid for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, you can you can do that with a CD today.  And no one would seriously say that the law should step in and ban the practice of loaning or giving away CDs.  In fact, you know, like anyone who tried to get libraries to stop stocking CDs  would be in deep trouble with everyone who cares about access to information.  And yeah, you know, everyone who listens to CDs these days has a computer and could rip it and make a copy.  But, you know, one of the principles of law in a democracy is you don't punish the innocent to get at the guilty.  Right. We have the presumption of innocence and you don't confiscate the.  And let's actually let's take it back one step.  Will a user agreement stop dishonest people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, of course not.  Nor does the ERM stop dishonest people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this only works on honest people.  Right. This only works on people who aren't doing unreasonable, terrible things.  So I just think that, you know, here's a company that stands up for consumer rights almost always,  except when they're selling digital goods and then they throw stuff in the user agreement like we can delete arbitrary files off your hard drive.  Right. You know, and it's just it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I could say I could also point out that most honest people don't even read user agreements  and probably aren't aware of what they're agreeing to in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. But, you know, like Amazon, if you buy an actual DVD from Amazon,  and then you call them up and you say the DVD never arrived, they'll put another one in the mail to you.  Oh, interesting.  Without needing any proof at all.  But if you download a DVD from Amazon and you call them up and you say the file didn't work, they say, tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. A couple of stories we can wrap up here.  Very interesting conversation, obviously a lot to talk about.  I don't know if I want to talk too much about the Jeff Gerstmann GameSpot issue, because I don't think we've heard the whole story.  But it's I should mention that I'm aware of the story and we'll probably follow it next week.  GameSpot fired a 10 year editor, Jeff Gerstmann, apparently for being a negative in a review of an EDOS game.  But we haven't heard from GameSpot. There may have been.  Who knows? Maybe he was drunk when he wrote it. I don't know.  But I just want to mention we do know of the story.  And if you want to hear more coverage of it, when we hear more more information, we'll let you know.  Also, big story. Last night,  Jimmy Wales at a Wikipedia party announced that Wikipedia is going to be CC.  It'll be Creative Commons.  BYSA. So what's that attribution?  Non-commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By share alike.  By share alike.  It means you have to attribute it and you have to allow anyone else to use anything you you make with it on the same terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big deal. It's like a GPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I teach a graduate level course in reporting and I ban my students from footnoting or using Wikipedia.  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny. I taught a graduate course, but one of my assignments to my students was you have to improve Wikipedia entries.  Oh, that's good. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little different. Why did you ban it?  Why did you ban it?  Well, because of accuracy issues.  I mean, you know, anyone can come on there pretty much and, you know, change things.  So there's a credibility issue.  But, you know, the best Wikipedia entries are those I think that are footnoted and show what the source is and all that.  But just like I tell them never to use Google as a spell checker.  Really? Is it bad?  Oh, yeah. I mean, if Laporte, I'm sure if I put in Laporte spelled L-A-P-O-R-T, it would get lots of hits.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it does say, do you mean Laporte with an E?  Oh, does it? Wow. You're such a celebrity.  I'm highly ranked. How about Stucklow? What happens when you type Stucklow wrong?  Right. Anyway, I type Stucklow and it says, do you mean Stuck-low?  Yeah. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My alter ego. I know. I do think that, you know, kids today, you know, my son's sports team,  just starting in high school. I mean, you know, I had to change Google because there is a way to do it so that the Wikipedia doesn't come up first when you're doing research.  Oh, interesting.  You can actually go into Google and tell it, for example, to have Encyclopedia Britannica show up first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, you know what I love about Wikipedia is and, you know, full disclosure, Jimmy and I are writing a book together.  He's actually in London. We're having meetings all this week about the book.  But one of the things I love about Wikipedia is that it fails so gracefully compared to, you know, the Britannica or a newspaper in that when there's a mistake,  it's a lot easier to fix it in Wikipedia than it is in the New York Times.  And, you know, Wikipedia is also if you become Wikipedia literate, it becomes a lot easier to figure out when Wikipedia issues are contentious.  Right. I've never seen an article in the Times that had a little banner at the top of it that said,  note, six out of 14 people in the newsroom thought that this article was complete garbage.  Right. The Times publishes plenty of articles that meet those criteria, but you never find out about it.  And Wikipedia, if you know how to look, makes that transparent.  I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if there is an error in a New York Times story that they acknowledge in a correction,  it will appear in the database from then on at the top of the story as this story was corrected.  And here's what the mistake was.  But if Wikipedia has a mistake, it gets corrected.  Those people who used it beforehand when there was mistakes will never know. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's also true.  The New York Times, unless you happen to go look it up in the database.  But, you know, the point is that the preferred form of accessing Wikipedia is in the database.  Right. It's online. So it's not like there ever is an edition of Wikipedia that you don't look to.  I mean, I agree that that, you know, both of them fail.  I guess it's a question of which one fails fails better.  And I feel like Wikipedia fails pretty good.  You know, we can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pretty well. Let's get this right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. English does not have a formally correct grammar.  It's one of the things that makes it so successful is that it has no formal grammar.  It has only usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it OK to say pretty good now?  It's colloquial. There are lots of people who say it.  It is only a podcast after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying. I correct my daughter on this one all the time.  And when I make that mistake, she corrects me.  Are we on the AP style book here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we are not. No, we are not.  Is it ALA?  You should come up with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you want to defend that usage, Cory, it's fine with me.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about my kids are always saying me and my buddy went somewhere.  And it drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Chaucer uses quadruple negatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I don't even know what that would come out to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like you will not know. No, no, no, no, no.  You will not neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other big stories, I don't know if we want to say anything about it.  Blizzard Activision emerges with Blizzard for 18.8 billion dollars.  And then Vivendi, like the next minute, comes along and takes a majority stake  in Activision. I don't know what that all means.  Games are getting bigger, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's our hero. That's what it means.  Our hero. Yeah. Guitar Hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Guitar Hero. Of course. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Activision game. Oh, interesting.  Definitely the hottest selling Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how long before we're able to play Guitar Hero in World of Warcraft,  I guess, would be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's a Guitar Hero club that meets in the building  across the street from our bedroom, and we see them at night really rocking out.  It's one of those things where all the lights are out on the street  and their light is glowing.  And you can just see these guys just like totally rocking out  and getting plowed and rocking out to the Guitar Hero.  And in the summer, when the windows are open, it's really loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the Wall Street Journal did a story a couple of years ago  when the game first came out about real rock stars who really play it  like the show. Really?  And then often the guy who wrote the song, who's the guitar player,  who does it, loses out to the drummer.  Wow. That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the idea that rock musicians relax by playing rock rock  Guitar Hero is great.  I love it. Like Tiger Woods playing golf games on his way to the golf game.  Awesome. We golf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will you will you do you let your kids play Guitar Hero, Steve?  And will you will you let your kid play Guitar Hero or whatever  the derivative is of it in the few years that Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, my fiance is an ex professional Quake player  and we have six consoles under the TV.  I guess I know what the answer is.  She used to run video games for the BBC and now she's she's doing video  game stuff for Channel 4. So, yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without ruining Hanukkah and Christmas here, I'm not going to answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I guess we got our answer.  See, I don't want my I want my kid to play a real guitar.  I figure the hours he'd put in a Guitar Hero, he could actually learn an instrument.  But I guess I'm in the minority here. Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what would he do with an instrument that he couldn't do with Guitar Hero?  Man, he could get his three initials up there at the top of the leaderboard for weeks.  Learn an instrument.  I know what I'm learning. It's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So 20th century.  All right, kids, it's time to wrap this up.  I really want to thank you all.  Corey Doctorow is online at Crap Hound dot com and of course, on Boing Boing dot net.  Anything else you want to you've got books and are you busy guy?  I don't know what to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I guess I can plug.  It's kind of early.  But my my next novel is coming out in May.  Little Brother about hacker kids who fight the Department of Homeland Security  and win back the Bill of Rights.  Yes. Yes.  And every chapter has like make style how to's for building real technology  to like, you know, defeat CCTV cameras, get out of your school, sense proxy.  And so it's like Wikipedia Brown or, you know, Neuromancer.  That's fantastic.  Where are you getting the designs?  That Instructables is going to do a whole line of designs for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's going to be it's going to be great.  This is your first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, right? I mean, you've never done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My first.  Yeah, it's not my first act of my first juvenile act, but it is my first juvenile book.  It's true. I look forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like I'll get that for my son immediately.  I can't wait.  Steve Steclo writes for the is a feature.  What I can never a senior writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New title now, Deputy Bureau Chief Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hell, that's good.  That's good. I like that.  Steve Steclo is the deputy bureau chief, Boston for the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Confused with the sheriff of the bureau chief in Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He shot the ship, but not the deputy.  Is that what you're saying?  John, thank you, Steve, for being here.  I really appreciate it. Great to talk to you.  And John C.  Dvorak, of course, Dvorak dot org slash blog and also Cranky Geeks.  Look for Jan Lekval.  I want to say like Valencia young young like Johansson on a Cranky Geeks episode soon.  John, are you still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Barely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But John has never been so bored, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, I didn't just obviously I didn't have as much coffee as these two guys.  It's almost midnight here. It's after midnight here.  Well, I don't know what you do. You need to drink more wine.  So anyway, the yeah, yeah.  And yeah, yeah, that would be cool to get the DVD, John on Cranky Geeks  and see what he has to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like fun. John, if you're listening.  Jan, Jan, Jan, if you're listening, Cranky Geeks dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
