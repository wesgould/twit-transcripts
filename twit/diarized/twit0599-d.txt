Transcript:  You know on our on our side if you're watching the video, we're gonna call Michael Goose today on the show  I don't know why I don't know why  So, I mean, I guess we have to talk about and you know, you know  We I have mixed feelings about talking about politics  We try to keep to politics only where the it intersects with technology. But in fact, there's a pretty big intersection  this is of course the  concluding of president Trump's first week in office a lot of executive orders and one yesterday that  Seemed to have really triggered a reaction from Silicon Valley  I shouldn't even say that from all of the tech community and that's his ban on  Immigrants visitors from seven nations that are predominantly Muslim  But more than that even green card holders legal residents of the United States were blocked at the border  There was some question of whether that was the intent  Apparently the border control called the White House and said now do you want us to stop green car holders, too?  And they said you bet and a number of people were detained the techs a tech community's reaction to this was a  Varying strengths Mark Zuckerberg one of the first to respond with a somewhat  tepid response on  Facebook  Saying he didn't think it was a good idea, but not really calling it out on the other hand Sergey Brin  One of the founders of Google immediately went to San Francisco International Airport to join the protests there  And then there's Sergey he of course is also an immigrant from the Soviet Union Phil. I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah  So  Why why is Silicon Valley upset about this?

Start time: 376.82
End time: 396.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, to be honest with you. I'm not sure that a  The tech community has been is doing much good on this issue  They may have to be causing more problems. Yeah, or even kind of in the election in general  I think we are a little bit tone-deaf about  Exactly who cares about what we think and who doesn't well there's becoming like Hollywood in this it's yeah good point

Start time: 396.98
End time: 432.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's reasonable for Google for instance that has nearly 200 employees that are blocked by this order of course people were trying  You know if they were overseas would not be able to come back to Google sure many Google employees  Said since the our colleagues can't travel we are not going to travel anymore  Google issued a statement saying we're concerned about the impact of this order in any proposals that could impose restrictions on  Googlers and their families or that could create barriers to bring in great talent to the US  We continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere  It does sound like they're not condemning the order they're more just saying hey this impacts our business  So we're not happy about yeah

Start time: 432.80
End time: 453.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and of course every company has a responsibility to its to its employees and to make sure that that everyone's okay, and that business doesn't get  interrupted and  The much larger questions. I think we do have some some moral responsibilities to to refugees to immigrants  But I do think the discussion on both sides here has been pretty poor and not helpful

Start time: 453.62
End time: 499.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's very few reasonable voices here when the tech leaders include and Tim Cook by the ways in Washington right now the CEO of Apple  He had dinner with Yvonne Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner  Trump's advisor on Thursday has been going around making the rounds cook issued a statement said I've heard from any of you who are deeply concerned  About the executive order issued yesterday  Restricting immigration from seven Muslim majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy  We support that it was probably the strongest  Kind of statement of from all the CEOs  But Tim Cook went and sat down along with Elon Musk in fact Musk's now met twice  He met again this week with President Trump. Do you agree having been in a position like this?  Do you agree with them that it's important to meet with the incoming president? Yeah, absolutely. I don't I don't see why wouldn't you?

Start time: 499.90
End time: 525.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see what's to be gained by  Kind of shouting about everything right? I think it's just gonna make the world worse  So there there there should be reasonable people on both sides  It's sometimes hard to do that. There's a lot of pressure to  To to to take a strong position. There's a lot of pressure to be very vocal  It's good that a lot of people are doing that  But I think we also need people who are actually trying to be reasonable and move the world forward right?

Transcript:  But when you're when you're championing yourself as a as a beacon of hope and and light and basically, you know  Constantly claiming that you're guiding the United States to this  To this, you know new frontier of greatness through technology  I think that you owe it to the the people that you've promised both American citizens  but also your employees to take a stand against some of this stuff because I mean  You know, I won't say that every single thing that Donald Trump is doing is wrong  But there are certainly some measures that can be  just described accurately as xenophobic and and problematic when it comes to sourcing talent from other countries and basically  Creating this, you know this new and open world that all of these Silicon Valley companies are constantly talking about so I was actually  really disappointed by  the the the number of leaders that were willing to speak out and  The amount of time that it took them to actually say something, you know  There are people like Sheryl Sandberg who have who have spent years  talking about progressive ideals and  And then when push comes to shove have have actually been, you know, pretty quiet about these things

Start time: 597.32
End time: 627.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  she did finally issue a statement about  not about the immigration thing but about  The women's more no, I think Planned Parenthood the women's March. She said that's right. Yeah. Yeah  So but you're right she hasn't said a lot and I think as a  as a  Sea level executive at a publicly held company. There is some responsibility  To not get pulled to not be political not to be to become a Meryl Streep  But to in fact to be more judicious, is that right?

Start time: 627.48
End time: 672.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So look I have I have personal opinions and all this stuff and I'm actually totally happy talking about them  Yeah, but that's separate all totally happy talking about them  Yeah, what I'm what I also trying to be mindful of is what's actually going to be the most effective way for the world to  Move in the direction that I would like it to move right and very often that's not  Telling people from a position of assumed authority what they should think and how they should think how would you go about it?  Well, for example, it's not clear to me that Sheryl Sandberg like being louder and faster about her position  I actually helps convince the people that need to be convinced to change the position, right?  It maybe makes people feel better. Maybe makes for better demonstrations  I'm not sure that it actually makes the world  It pushes the world further in the direction that Cheryl would want it to be pushed. There's also a significant risk. I think

Transcript:  Silicon at some point people realizing that the problem isn't so much  immigration the problem is more created by  Silicon Valley and automation and that in fact the tech community could quickly become the enemy here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are pretty tone-deaf as an industry I think I think we were like we we really  We got used to being treated as heroes  And kind of the people that are making the world for the past decade or so  And I think that's on the verge of changing. I think we're kind of tone-deaf about how we talk about it  I think like yeah, it's tripped over that line a while ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I've learned over the past week is that Silicon Valley continues to exist in a bubble that is essentially  Unrelatable for for a large majority of Americans, right? You know, there is a  there's been a  diversity problem in Silicon Valley for years that that is basically under reported and and under discussed and I think  You know when you know, I'm not I don't want to put all of the blame on on Sheryl Sandberg  but I think you know she in particular is an easy target because she wants to be or she  you know positions herself to be considered a leader for  For you know for the feminist movement and and and you know, and I wrote the book lean in right?  And so I think when there is such divisive  Rhetoric, you know that that is that is just constantly coming from from Washington. I think that  You kind of have to choose  You kind of have to choose one way or another either  You're purely a capitalist and and that's totally fine and you can refrain from saying anything  but then you can't go on to  to  you know to  Expect to be treated as as you know as an authoritative leader on any progressive movement

Start time: 800.22
End time: 817.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think you know, I think Phil you're saying they shouldn't be a leader in the progressive movement  Stick to their knitting and do their job all the way I can understand why Sergey Brin who it you know went to that protest  But I think as a private citizen, I don't think he said I'm bearing the banner of Google  But I as a private citizen, I feel strongly about this because I'm a I was a refugee

Start time: 817.92
End time: 858.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you got three different issues here that are being conflated  One is the issue of like what should people how publicly should people state their views and they sure that is as publicly as they want  Yeah, everyone can make that decision and state them as publicly as they want. Right. Second issue is  Is  What is the proper role of someone speaking for a company? That's a different matter entirely  It's a different matter entirely and then there's a third issue, which is what's most effective, right?  and it's that most effective issue where we are about to go over a cliff as an industry where we're about to take everything that we  in general think is important and  significantly hold those things back  By being perceived as hectoring and lecturing and being tone-deaf and being out of touch  We will make the situation worse if we keep doing so tonight

Start time: 858.66
End time: 862.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I can I say something I've been real quiet because I'm trying not to do the yelling thing

Start time: 862.56
End time: 869.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but you say I feel like I feel like we are on the edge right now on the precipice of a  patented Oh doctor rant

Start time: 870.68
End time: 959.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so as a person who doesn't live in the bubble, I think that you're  generally wrong when you say that  The tech community is tone-deaf and that Hollywood is tone-deaf the country in a majority  Voted an opposite direction of what we currently have as a regime the popular number of people  So that the way the people are speaking and when they speak out  it's not tone-deaf in general as you live in the middle of the country and you've seen your  Job creation go away as opposed to and Silicon Valley where things become an automated  we're not talking about what  educations people need to be having and what we should do for education for people to have these new future jobs because  Until we get the robots to build themselves build the wall pay the taxes for it  We've got to do some other things and fix these issues  So yes  it's important for a CEO of a major company who has  immigrants working for them mostly as engineers or whatever they have because you never would see them on a higher echelon of  Work and jobs. Well, I'm in such in the Della  Sundar I said in general and don't talk to me like that because he just made the statement of the fact the way that  Racially the way Silicon Valley is you know how it is in general. I said in general  I didn't say every I said generally. Okay. So again, let me finish  I'm just saying I'm just saying they're not tone-deaf and maybe if we did a little bit better  Educating the people in the middle of the country about what's about to happen to them  But we don't have to fall off a cliff or push ourselves off a cliff or rappel off a cliff  I agree with you on that the gator about it

Start time: 959.92
End time: 981.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a leadership role Silicon Valley could take which is look the change is coming. We understand this change  You might want to get ready for this. This is the educational  I mean you push stem, but this is these are things you've got to do as a country  We've got to do to prepare ourselves and it's not patients. It's not building a wall because that's not gonna solve the problem  That's not where the problems coming from. That's a mistake

Start time: 983.22
End time: 994.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best thing I saw for that was instead of building a wall  Why don't we build a solar panel wall out there in the desert and get some free energy?  I'm sitting like like it's the little things like that  Like a like a 12 year old said it you like that'd be amazing

Start time: 995.16
End time: 1074.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's difficult because Silicon Valley has a lot to get from this new president. They have repatriation of funds  They have investment. There's a lot Elon Musk was meeting with President Trump this week along with other auto manufacturers and industrialists  Trying to bring industry back to this country. Elon Musk is a shining example. They the tax break  They well, they got tax breaks. Although I think they paid they paid back the loans  I'm at more tax risk more tax breaks. In fact, though  They all in their government contracts  Do you don't forget about but they're in the caught in the middle here because they also have a lot of people  working for them who are at  Being put at disadvantage during this time musk tweeted to yesterday the blanket entry ban on citizens from certain  Primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges  I think Elon's speaking to that agree with that. Yeah, many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US  They've done right not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected and then he's actually asking people to read the immigration order  He's gonna seek advisory council consensus and present it to the president  So this is an example of a tech leader saying look I've got a seat at the table. I'm in the room where it happens  Let's  Let's do what is gonna make a difference here  Yeah

Start time: 1074.92
End time: 1106.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that that people have to go and talk to president whenever somebody jumps on  Elon or you know black leaders or like how could he meet with this guy if you're not talking to the people  How do you know what's going on for real?  You're only hearing one side of it  They you have to have people leaders of an industry or a section talk to this man  Because there is a lot of hyperbole and what goes on what happens?  I mean we see what the executive orders was coming down the pipe  But before that stuff happens  He's got to talk to people if nobody shows up to talk to him  Then who's he gonna get his information from and so he needs to talk to people in a way

Start time: 1106.50
End time: 1122.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's likely to actually convince him not a way  That's likely to like don't talk at them and don't patronize them and talk down to them, right?  We should we need to talk to we need to convince the people we disagree with  Yeah  Not make the people that we agree with just louder and shoutier that don't won't move the world so the only concern of that

Start time: 1122.68
End time: 1274.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. Go ahead Mike. Well, I think you know, I think that's true  But there's also you know, you run the risk of running of building a false equivalence here  You know, there is a moral obligation to speak out against  Against humanitarian wrongdoings and and basically the targeting of minority groups  And I think whether it's as a private citizen or as a corporation  The these these tech leaders need to be doing this at it to a greater extent  you know, it's not unheard of to have a a fortune 500 company take a stand politically  Against or for an issue, you know, there have chick-fil-a for instance or or you know, there are plenty of other  There are plenty of other instances where companies have you know in that case that was the wrong side of history  but I think there are plenty of instances where companies have taken a stand and  And and have decided that they do have a moral obligation to one defend their employees  But to to defend those that don't have a voice and and so, you know today  I'm wearing a for those that aren't watching the video feed. I'm wearing a make America raging and hat  Just in solidarity with the people that don't have a voice  there are you know thousands of minorities that have been affected by the policies issued over the past week and  This is just one simple thing that I can do to show solidarity as as an individual, right?  I'm not speaking on behalf of gizmodo  I am just an employee of gizmodo speaking as an individual and I think that it is a moral obligation to do that  I don't understand how people can justify remaining silent when  When you know thousands of people's lives are being put at risk another example is lift donating a million dollars to the ACLU  Yes, I mean I bucks to the ACLU well because you know, I think that you know for me it's it's a I mean  I'm the son of an illegal immigrant and and so that's you know, the the the political is personal right now and and and  For some tech leaders, you know, they've made that clear  I think Sergey Brin showing up in person to a protest at the San Francisco Airport is  You know is something that he certainly doesn't have to do as a as a billionaire, right?  I mean he could probably hire a hundred people to go do that for him  but he showed up because he  apparently felt a moral obligation to do that and  And I would you know, I've just been disappointed by how few have have have shown that  That that level of what of just of bravery basically, you know, I think they're there's

Start time: 1275.52
End time: 1323.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me ask Phil something because I think your position  Which is you want you want to make sure that you are heard and that you do what's effective  Kind of presupposes that we're in the same kind of position  Since World War two where there are  Opposing points of view and reasonable people can discuss them and reach consensus and negotiate  I think there is a sense in this country that we are no longer in that situation that we're in a  unprecedented situation  Where I think people fear that we have a new administration that isn't interested in consensus building  That is in fact not doesn't matter what you say you're not gonna be effective with them  You don't think we've reached that point yet

Start time: 1323.46
End time: 1340.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I hope not and and maybe this is just me being an optimist  But I don't think we have and I hope that we haven't and I think  regardless of what any individual in the administration or not kind of wants to do or doesn't want to do the process of governing is  still about  Getting consensus and making yeah

Start time: 1340.74
End time: 1366.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least it has been and it well you say that and so we get executive orders  Then we got to go fight through court to get people freed and the president the the leader of the free world is not  talking like a rational person at  60% of the clip like he's just rambling off and complaining about things and talking off-topic like it'd be totally different if I just  Didn't like the guy and he was a B student

Start time: 1367.22
End time: 1400.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a lot of a lot different a lot of Republicans think that this dissent is coming from  This kind of unreasonable position that's coming and and so I think they dismiss it. They don't like it  It's ineffective. It's it and so as a result it's ineffective on the other hand  I think a lot of people on the left feel like we've reached this really  unfortunate yeah  Logjam where neither side is hearing the other side. There's this there's a philosophy here in general, right?

Start time: 1400.64
End time: 1430.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think like for just about any position  There is a naive argument in favor of it and a naive argument opposed to it, right and they're both wrong  And then there's a there's a deeper argument in favor of it and a deeper argument opposed to it  And in some sense, they're both right at least they both have like if marriage of each has merit  He has merit and  What we do when we hold a position we tell ourselves the deep version of the of that argument and we surround ourselves in our  media bubbles with people who only talk about but Phil don't you think that

Start time: 1431.18
End time: 1448.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Owen as an African American  Michael as the son of an illegal immigrant  can are gonna have a somewhat different point of view about all this because  There are potentially victims of this they have been victims of this worse. And so they're it's very personal

Start time: 1448.92
End time: 1503.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally understand that and I think that I think that almost everyone  Certainly everyone in this panel holds that the actual deep meaningful version of their position  But when we argue with the other side we tend to we tend to throw the shallow version of their argument back around  We don't make an attempt to actually understand what's actually motivating people to believe in the other way, right?  And real progress I think is made when you get the deep version of the argument in favor and the deep version of the argument  Against and you knock them against each other and you kind of move the world forward that way  So I very much want us to be to accept more refugees. I am a refugee myself  Not even my family like me directly. I think we need to be much more compassionate  I want to see I would like personally to see much more immigration both skilled and unskilled like I have personal opinions  Which I'm happy to discuss with anyone that is actually pretty much, you know in line with more refugees more immigration more of everything  I just want to talk about in a way that's actually may make that possible

Transcript:  But what about the attacks on science and fact-based?  You know, I think I think that there's something greater going on greater going on that that we're not discussing here  you know, there are it's okay to have different political views, but there's also a  You know a  disinformation war that that were  Participating as members of the media and I think that we have to be vigilant  I think that it's you know, it's unfair to say that Trump deserves a  you know to to to say his piece or speak his mind if he's referring to  Alternative facts and and if he's and if he's blatantly lying every time that he he or his administration  Makes a public comment. So, you know, I think that the thing that concerns me about  about Phil's point of view is that if you treat it as  As if you treat some of these ideas as equal then you are essentially accepting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alternative facts you're accepting I'm not on scientific like I'm not treating these ideas as equal  I have ideas that I think are right that I prefer  Significantly, I think you're being pragmatic. I'm being pragmatic. I'm saying this is how the world changes  This is how we move forward

We're going back to the other side  Now these national security letters come with a gag order  This is these are part of the Patriot Act  But the FBI has as told Twitter they can now talk about it  So that's one of the things has changed these gag orders used to be open-ended you can never say anything to the people we're  Asking for information from you can never say anything publicly. So asinine. Yeah, and I think courts not the FISA courts  But but real courts with judges who have names have said, you know, you really there is gonna  There's got to be a end date on this stuff  So Twitter is says we were encouraged by the lifting of these two gag orders and those recently disclosed by CloudFlare by Google by the internet  Archive and Yahoo, we are still unsatisfied with the restriction on our right to speak more freely about these requests and  They want to push for the legal ability to speak more openly on this topic. They have a lawsuit against the US government  It's actually against Loretta Lynch the former Attorney General under Obama  But that the of course the suit  Continues next hearing they say is February 14th. So all they really were able to say is  there were two  Letters they were accompanied by gag orders when they were served  And we couldn't notify the account holder, but apparently now they have those continue then I don't think you know, I think  This is this is on Congress to stop doing this to stop, you know, this these NSL's I think I read that

They said well you can't stop what we do in our spare time  They did delete those official tweets, however  So what are the alt accounts tweeting pretty much kind of the same thing although more and more they're tweeting support for a resistance  Movement support for protests  Whether it's true or not nice. I suspect it's not true the rogue POTUS account is  Fascinating reading because whoever's writing it has enough insight into the realities rogue POTUS staff at rogue POTUS staff and  It if it's not true  It's it's it's great fiction  It's very it's very interesting and it does sound like it's coming from somebody who's not going for the joke not going for the  Traditional fake.

End time: 3665.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think it would be great  for people to have  some sort of  Widget that would give them additional information about the stuff. They're reading however  I think that the risk with talking about fake news is a first of all  Immediately was turned against  People and now Trump is talking about fake news  Be it is condescending people choose fake news because they choose to believe or or even not that they believe it  But it aligns with their beliefs in some unique way and that's not you can't tell somebody not to do that  Oh, I mean important though that people in general who are just wandering down the street assaulted with  Misinformation should have a tool  Snopes is a start but even better tools to judge whether it's real information

Transcript:  I just need a general good reason of why Twitter specifically is a problem with propaganda  There was a book in grade school in Texas that said that slaves were indentured servants and loved their job  I love it, and then and then somebody came out like what are you doing?  You're teaching kids in the fifth grade that this is history and then obviously the books got retracted  But talk about propaganda little black kids in the school talk about my mom's crazy they had jobs  They love their job mom. It says it right here in this book and that's the history that they're taught  So really propaganda Twitter is not the leader of probably and is false  Making into textbooks. I agree with you on that. I'm just I'm just saying like we we call out everything  We can't just say Twitter's you because Facebook is I just Twitter. That's all I'm saying

Transcript:  It's and right now it's a pretty isolating experience to write their social VR hasn't really taken off and  And I think the limitation of VR in the long run is that it's primarily an entertainment tool  So, you know if you want to play games or you know be in a fantasy world or you know  Take that to a more extreme place  Then it's great for that. But when it comes to business and making money  Augmented reality is going to be the productivity tool that might replace the desktop in your office or something like that  so I think  You know at least from what I've tried augmented reality seems a lot farther away than VR because you know  At least VR with you know, let's say project alloy for instance that they have self-contained headsets and  The resolution is there and you know, they're solving some of the biggest problems  So like the screen door effect and stuff like that  I think with AR the resolution isn't there the computing power is not there  You know, there's what one dev kit the HoloLens and and you know  I haven't tried magic leap and most people haven't but you know, it's it's it's still  You know, I'm not sure if we can actually call that we can all agree that we are in the Atari

We have another 30 contract employees  There's no way we could build what we have now without ads and I think it's better for me  Anyway, and I think ad supported media is a good thing for now  You think that we'll be able to get off of that at some point?

So I you know as a journalist you take that number and you can begin to cross-reference that  at other companies that are doing similar things either with advertising or with

He resigned. He went on to Facebook where he works now  and the smoking gun is that's when he learned that  Not only was there a breach but that not his team the security team  But another team of engineers had written what was effectively  you know a Trojan on the Yahoo mail server at the request of the federal government and  he did his team discovered it said we've been hacked and  The other teams are no no, that's us and  It's I would say almost certain at this point that not only did Marissa Meyer know but must have made  Come on.

Yep from Google and they've not only they not only fixed the healthcare websites the insurance exchanges  But they've done the same for the Veterans Administration and digital immigration college scorecard. They've really done a great job  I  Would I would hope  This was under the Obama administration, I would hope the Trump administration would keep this going  There's no indication that they will will watch with interest  Matt cuts is currently interim director because the director is an appointed  Political position.

Transcript:  Next time you're out here, we're gonna play game of geeks with you. I want to play with you  I think you done deal our show today brought to you by the euro. You're thinking of getting these  This is the revolution in Wi-Fi right now. People have been settling for so long for  Wi-Fi that buffers has dead zones  You know you ever you know you walk around and then hey the Wi-Fi is down. I gotta go over here  I gotta stand over here finally Wi-Fi that works and I have to say I  Use euro and it changed my life. I non-stop complaints  For my wife and my kid saying the air that's down here. It's the internet's not down  It's just the Wi-Fi and I tried everything at power line networking. I got a expansion unit  Nothing worked till I got the euro. Here's how it works. You get the first euro  You can buy an individual euro or you buy and I would recommend this by all three  They say each euro is good for about 1,500 square feet you pair the first euro you becomes your router  So you plug it into your cable modem or your DSL modem and now this is doing your routing  Then you fire up the euro app on your phone and you place the other euros our house is so big  I ended up having five euros, but what's nice is my house is bathed in Wi-Fi no more dead zones  No more buffering everything super fast  Euro also brings a lot of advantages  It the euros are automatically updated. In fact, they just pushed out their new 2.0 version of true mesh  This is the next generation of wireless mesh technology increased speed increased performance increased riot reliability  The euro automatically does things like quality of service. It sees you're watching TV. It shapes the connectivity  It's dual band and has 2.4 and 5 gigahertz, but you don't have to know about that  It'll automatically pick the best channel and the best frequency you see each device that's on your arrow in the app  You can assign it to a person and my favorite thing is I can tell my echo  Pause Michaels Wi-Fi when it's 10 o'clock at night  I want him to go to bed say pause Michaels Wi-Fi and his devices are no longer online mine work fine  But his are no longer online  Online you can also ask your echo to find your phone  It knows which of the euro base stations your phone is paired to it says well the last time I saw your phone  It was in the living room. That's great  You can also turn off the euro LED if you want you could say hey echo dim the LED  The phone app is great. The software is great. They're always updates all the time  And so the other thing I did is I set up euro on my mom's house. I was out for Christmas  She's in Rhode Island and she was having trouble with her Wi-Fi  Which I knew because every time I facetimed her would pause and freeze and stutter  So I can actually see her euros from here  So I fire up the account and I can see which euro network I can say  Oh, let me see his and I can see which of the euros is up for her  She was never able to get Wi-Fi out in her studio. She likes to weave and do textiles and painting  She has a studio out back. She says yeah, I stopped going out in the studio because I can't I can't get my the internet out  There I can't use my iPad out there now. She can go anywhere anywhere at all and and it just works great  I love the euro. We've got a deal for you. Of course we do we got free overnight shipping  So if you're in a hurry to get good Wi-Fi go to e er o dot com  Select overnight shipping at the checkout and use the offer code tweet and boom it goes away. The price goes away. It's free  overnight shipping from e er o  dot  com  Very impressed with what euro has done the next generation of  Wi-Fi and I've tried them all really and this is the this is the one to get Phil  You will be very happy with it. I'm sold your support. Yeah, it's it's it's it's  Thank goodness, you know because this is Wi-Fi has been getting worse and worse  I think it's cuz everybody in the neighborhood has Wi-Fi to right

This this kind of came up  because  People owned John Deere tractors were not allowed to access the software because John Deere was afraid they would steal it  And of course companies like Apple really don't want third-party repair companies to do well  But in Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts and Kansas  the state legislators are working to legalize repair of devices from any manufacturer including Apple and  And  This may be necessary because I find this hard to believe but according to TechCrunch Homeland Security  raids repair shops  because  Companies like Apple say oh, oh, they're using counterfeit repair  Part information or they're they're repairing stuff. They're not allowed to and they're getting raided

End time: 7496.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I'm gonna take a contrary view to this and say I'm not really sure that that this is a good idea  First like I think this kind of cheapens the idea of what rights are  So probably should not throw around the word right when we're talking about, you know  Our gadgets and getting screens fixed and things like that. There's like other rights that that are a little bit more  Fundamental but more importantly like how exactly is this gonna be implemented?  Like the only way that this could actually play itself out is government restrictions about how products are made  Such that they support third-party repair services  That could be a very significant barrier to just  Innovation right like if Apple has a manufacturing process that like nobody else can repair  Are they gonna be prohibited from using it because their devices have to be repairable  Well, I would hope it wouldn't go that far  But how else could you enforce it? Well, you don't have to enforce it

Start time: 7496.04

It's so funny and they obviously aren't repairable  So like would you say I fix it so gave them a zero on the repair? Yeah, so like repair

Oh those look good  Or how about spicy shrimp and Korean rice cakes with cabbage and furikake hoisin chicken steamed buns  See you would never you look we all I love steamed buns  But you would never say I can't make that at home  You'd never make it at home  You can hoisin chicken steamed buns with broccoli and marinated carrots and once you make that you can make it again and again  You know how now?  I'm telling you what you gotta try it now. You may say that's got to be expensive  It's actually less than buying the same ingredients at the grocery store grocery stores about 60% more expensive  Because they got more overhead and you and so this is this is a win all around  If you spend a lot of time eating out or high-end groceries change, you're gonna save money  With blue apron under $10 per person for healthy home-cooked meals  Smell the house smells great.

Just go to blue apron comm slash twit blue apron  comm  slash  Twit join the blue apron family our family's a blue apron family. I love it. I tell you it's a lot of fun blue apron comm slash  Twit one more story. I want to it's almost I want to issue a  Correction I talked on the radio show. I had seen a story from our local Channel 5 news about a young couple  in Berkeley  Who according to the news?  Were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning caused by their laser cutter  In fact, it's a very sad story 35 year old Roger Morash is a game developer  He was working on a game called shard his wife Valerie. Morash  Was a postdoc  They're too she they and their two cats were found dead Monday in their apartment  According to police sources they were using a late now the police sources got it wrong  I think because they were saying they were using a laser 3d printer  According to other sources there was a small 3d printer and a laser cutter that would make more sense a laser cutter does generate smoke  The problem is there's no toxicology reports and they don't know what caused it and  In fact when the hazardous materials team showed up, they couldn't find any evidence of carbon monoxide, but nor was there a gas leak  So it's really it's a mystery and the information blamed the laser cutter because they didn't understand what it was  I think so although neighbors had apparently complained about a bad burning plastic smell coming from the apartment in the past twice  In any event a very sad story. Wow, they were both MIT graduates, you know, they were one of us  So I'm very sad to hear about the more ashes  But I apologize for repeating what might have been actually fake news  That that the car was carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the laser cutter. We just don't know yet  And  But that it but it is also a word of warning and that's the main reason I wanted to bring it up see  Carbon monoxide is odorless tasteless. You can't tell it can get near it comes from  Incomplete combustion. So your furnace your water heater can happen. You should get a carbon monoxide detector  It's the only way of knowing had they if that's what caused the their deaths had they had one they wouldn't have  suffered this it's a  mysterious death at this point and and so  I'm just gonna reserve that idea that was CEO however  Very dangerous and if you had I think there I think Roger was well known as a kind of a maker  He would have known better than venting a laser cutter into the house. So that seems unlikely  Anyway, I just wanted to that that story now is is kind of suspicious  We're not sure exactly what happened toxicology takes a couple of weeks and that at that point perhaps  Well, no sad story I don't want to end with that  Is there a happy story we could end with what do you think Oh and JJ Stone something to celebrate this week
