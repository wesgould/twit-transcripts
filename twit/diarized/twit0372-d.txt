Transcript:  So we worked with GoPro and their stunt team actually set up the logistics for us and jumped alongside of us  We were recreating that HTC 1x commercial where you know  he jumps out of the plane to  test the camera and try to do a fashion shoot in midair and and I think apparently the whole stunt community is way into  jumping out of helicopters because you can be more precise with your landing zones and they like that you can sort of climb out onto the  struts like

Transcript:  I'm gonna put a coffee on my head  Alright, so I guess the iPhone 5 came out this week what?  Huh, did you get yours probably should have covered that I got a couple here. Yeah now I  Thought it was kind of interesting because the verge did not get a review unit

Start time: 484.46
End time: 497.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah gadget get a review unit no  But we tend to aggregate the reviews from everybody else and so you didn't need a review  We didn't really need the review unit and we went through and had our team pulling in  I think we have about 19 20 different sites that we've pulled in the news from so it's kind of the meta

Start time: 498.04
End time: 534.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's actually what I wanted anyway. Yeah, I like that but Mac world did I didn't get one either  I got well, I got one Friday morning.

Siebler got one  Yep, the meat kind of bloggers and I have to say I mean, excuse me  But the impression I got was the friendly bloggers seemed to get some in fact  I was told any Anacca told me that Gruber was like kind of  very visibly at the demo brought into the middle to be given his phone and  I think that that's a little message from Apple. Yeah, I don't know I

Start time: 535.32
End time: 554.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I  I've given up on trying to understand why Apple does what it does and I don't I don't feel entitled. It was nice  I've I got I don't feel entitled either. I'm happy when I get advanced access  And if I don't then I'm just gonna go ahead and I'm writing my review is open on my laptop right now  I'm halfway through it is yeah, you're gonna write it while you do the show. I it's possible

Start time: 555.14
End time: 575.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you on deadline? It depends on how the show goes  So you and I both brought show and tell in but what I brought which I thought would be kind of an interesting thing  To do is to show the original iPhone now, there's no question in 2007 when this came out. This was the Jesus phone  That's what we called it and there and there was nothing like it, right?  I know it's a little sacrilegious, but it but it was the phone right?

Start time: 576.52
End time: 581.58

End time: 593.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what's interesting because and by the way, I also brought it unfortunately  I don't have the charger for but this is the first Google phone first Android phone G1 G1  From HTC which came out a couple about a year later. I think 2008

Start time: 594.80
End time: 596.35

End time: 612.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 613.28
End time: 643.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know this phone was in production in pre-production for a really long time because Google wanted to get  Everything really sorted with Android before they put the first phone out and so right off the bat  I mean for when I talked to HTC and Google they said the future phones are gonna be much better than this  They knew and in fact they did they got better  They had to lock the hardware down much earlier than normally would I think of the hard was locked down a year before release?  Yeah  So that's you know, that is unusual. It is unusual  It was just because it was the first Android phone and Android got better very fast

Start time: 643.70
End time: 705.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's interesting if I why don't you give me can I have your s3 because we could we could do with this kind  Of comparison so this is the first Google phone  Compared to the latest many agree the best Google phone the s3. This is the first iPhone  compared to the latest iPhone 5 and  I have to admit. Oh, there's my Google authenticator  No, it's useless 30 seconds later it's something else I  Have to admit this these two look a lot more alike  Yeah, then the first Google phone and the top-of-the-line Google phone and now compare the the s3 to the  iPhone 5 is it okay if I open this up? I don't want to show any person. There we go  a lot bigger screen  even this tall iPhone 5 screen is shorter than the  Screen and it's a lot narrower of the galaxy s3. Yeah  I  Not sure what this comparison is showing us except that perhaps Apple has not evolved very rapidly

Start time: 706.36
End time: 737.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple you know Apple's about dropping a big product and then iterating on it year by year and  Apple only makes one phone right they make the iPhone and they make a new one every year is the fifth one  This is like the 500 right Android when Samsung makes more than one Android phone right they make they make a bunch and and so  There's variety from other manufacturers and Apple isn't playing that game at least not yet, right?  They're taking one shot that they think will appeal to the broadest  Audience and and they also want the iPhone to be recognizably an iPhone, but it is that's they're playing a different game almost

Start time: 742.30
End time: 775.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Far along in the iPhone thing it's making it  You know this is the iPhone 5, but it's really more like the iPhone 10 or something right so it's getting  Increasingly underwhelming I think to get it's only the six the laws of physics mean  That there's only so much better you can make it it's still ultimately is a rectangular touchscreen so far  And it's when you upgrade it still is an iPhone which is kind of nice because you know exactly what you're doing  But it's also if you're kind of you have kind of the gadget fever. It's a little bit like oh  It's kind of still an iPhone. Yeah, I mean that's taking photos

Start time: 775.18
End time: 779.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the game they're playing you know, but you're absolutely right. I think Apple does that intentionally, but I think you're right

Start time: 780.06
End time: 828.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think there's just a reality that the smartphone market  I mean we're now many years into the market five years into the iPhone  And we're now the first smartphones really hit you know over a decade ago when you look back the Nokia's the Nokia's and the you know  the trail the trios and things like that and  You know I think that we're reaching a place where the market is I don't say it's mature  But we are greater than 50% penetration of the market in the US and a lot of the early  hurdles and innovations have have you know have happened already we've gotten over some of those hurdles, and I think  The idea that we're gonna have dramatic  Transformation of what smartphones look like or do it's not necessarily realistic  I mean it's kind of like where we were 20 years ago with PCs where  Once we got into the form factors and got to windows and everything there wasn't necessarily dramatic changes that were gonna happen

Start time: 828.58
End time: 853.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my other takeaway from this that the iPhone when it first came out was singular one and only right this is now one of  Many phone choices and I think I think the good news for users is we have very credible  Choices on every carrier from not only from Apple and Samsung but from a bunch of other companies the new  Ht and when here comes Windows phone and we talked about the 8x and the 8s the 8x is a pretty sweet phone

Start time: 854.12
End time: 888.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've it is in terms of the hardware just if you talk just talking about the hardware in terms of that's the problem and  Well  Well, let's well, let's I mean we can talk about Windows phone in a sec  But I think if you just talk about the hardware and the design and the thoughtfulness that's went into the 8x  I mean they are getting to I would say Apple esque levels of quality fit and finish  thoughtfulness of the design and and the  The qualities that they're they're trying to imbue into the device to make it a delightful experience  I think that you know setting aside how you feel about Windows phone just that the HTC is actually producing some of the best

Start time: 890.30
End time: 915.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  phone hardware around I thought that Lumia 920 was gonna be the Windows 8 phone I wanted and and I've been convinced by  Yeah, Paul Thurot and Mary Jo Foley agree looks much better. This is the phone now  Nobody really played with it yet because Microsoft's not letting were you able to touch icons?  I've played with the 8x. Yeah, you have all right you so somebody has Mary  Jo Foley was not allowed to to she was allowed to hold it but not to actually touch an icon

Transcript:  One of the things Mike is told its manufacturers is we're not ready to show all the features of Windows Phone 8 yet  So they haven't released an SDK and which is a problem  I think but we can get to that later and they haven't really let people really play with it, but good  I'm glad you did so tell us about it. I mean it's the screen is amazing

Start time: 935.50
End time: 956.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you know I wasn't able to spend that much time with Windows Phone 8 to really you know get into a lot of the  You know the new stuff that's available to it, but the hardware you like was great  I mean the camera is really nice on the 8x. This may be the best camera better than the Lumia  I definitely better than Lumia  Yeah, and it's and the phone itself is thinner and the screen is really just really pops and the other thing is like they're offering

Start time: 956.24
End time: 963.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These you know really bright colors. I mean I some sort of lime green fire engine green it looks like I mean I couldn't care

Start time: 963.34
End time: 1003.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but really I did you know I'm not I'm not I did I love the yellow  I love the lime green phone. I mean I think these are the windows has such a  Hill to climb in terms of marketing and getting attention that frankly  It's not a bad idea to pull out every single stop including lime green phones  Because there's no reason that these phones can't be serious competitors to Android serious competitors to the I would say that Windows  8 phones to me are the one-to-one competition for iPhone in terms of market segment in terms of people who want sort of a simple  Experience that is consistent that crosses devices  It's not to make that sell for people, but here's the problem

Start time: 1003.48
End time: 1008.64

Start time: 1017.44
End time: 1050.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's a problem. It's coming out in two months. Yeah, it's getting better  But they I think that Microsoft is I mean the biggest challenge that they have is that they need to go back two years in time  Right I mean they just wasted too much time with Windows mobile  And they pulled the trigger to do Windows phone just way later than than they needed to and that's  whether or not that's a deficit that they can overcome with  You know by improving Windows phone and having great hardware partners is an open question  It may be it's possible that there's nothing they can do to make up that time it reminds me of the 49ers Vikings

Transcript:  Well, it's funny because Apple made a big deal at the announcement about how they take a picture of the back and then match it  With a very precisely matched for you know  I mean they want it to come across as as if this is made like a Swiss watch  But if it sounds like the better they are making eight million in two months or something right?

Start time: 1281.48
End time: 1311.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not I mean it's not much thinner or lighter than an s3. I mean let's face it  It's it's it's in the ballpark. This is what phones are gonna be like Apple does claim the thinnest phone  I don't know if it actually I don't think it is I think there are thinner phones out there  But but what it is according to a non-tech and PC magazine by a long shot is the fastest phone out there  Now I don't know if you'd notice that to be honest  My quad core s3 is slower, but in benchmarks it absolutely it's a lot slower

Yeah, exactly and they did manage to make it  Whatever 20% lighter despite the enhanced battery  Which means all the other components got lighter and the glass got thinner and lighter and that they didn't do the iPad

Start time: 1352.14
End time: 1391.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not noticing enhanced battery. That was the one thing where I would have take I would have definitely accepted a heavier phone  I was surprised that to me was a big surprise that they didn't somehow double down on battery because they've done such a good job of  Battery life with the iPad with the MacBook Air  There are so many products in their line lineup that have phenomenal battery life  I was kind of surprised to see that they didn't  Make that a big part of their kind of technical development because that to me as a consumer  That's a huge jump if you double down on technology around battery life all of a sudden you are definitely speaking my language  I don't think they can I mean are you hearing about any technologies battery technologies still so you can make them bigger, right?

Transcript:  I mean Apple could have chosen to make this phone the same weight as the four and they would have gotten more battery life  Out of it  but Apple seems to have this profile of the the the amount of battery life that they want which is about eight hours and  They that seems to be what they're shooting for for a phone and they'd rather trade off more battery life for for weight

Transcript:  You know I have I'm reviewing a razor max HD, which is the new droid and it I  To X's  It goes a long way, but it's a smaller phone. It's a heavier  I mean there but if you want battery life that thing goes four or five days on standby  I have I have pictures I could prove it so you can get better battery life  I think you're right in a phone where you can't replace the battery that becomes an issue. I don't care my s3  I just have three batteries. Yeah, and I could just swap in this you can just pop off that case and swap it out

End time: 1509.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is that's that's the winner for so my my take  I'd love to hear what you think but what I've been saying what I said on the radio show today is if you have a 4s  Their own I don't think the larger screen is enough to reason to spend a lot of money out of contract money  To upgrade but if you're in an LTE area, you might consider it if you have an older phone  It's probably worth the upgrade but this screen is only one icon row 176 pixels higher. It's not no

Start time: 1511.80
End time: 1523.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not sure Apple has ever made an iPhone upgrade that was worth upgrading from last year's model  That's always their goal. I think it's more like two years because the contract most places is gonna be two years  Maybe the retina

Start time: 1528.14
End time: 1543.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've done they've done that but a lot of it is incremental and then after two years you've kind of collected enough  So if I had a friend with a 4s, I would probably say unless they desperately need LTE, right, you know  So you agree that's about what I said. Yeah, but with a four  I think it's a lot easier to make that call if it's 200 bucks. That's worth it. Yeah

Start time: 1544.40
End time: 1552.90

It makes me feel good about switching from AT&T, which is what I did here  It is a nano SIM card cutter just for the iPhone 5  So maybe you want to bring this with you. It looks like they're cutting off some of the metal. That's not  That can't be good. You don't need this part. They just put it in that was just extra apparently so you don't need that

You're okay  We'll have more in just a moment. But first a word from Citrix  You know if you're if you're in business  You know that it's very hard to have face-to-face meetings with everybody you work with everybody's out traveling  They're around going out places or you know their vacation time  This is why I love go to meeting with HD faces from Citrix meeting is believing  Well, I talked about last week. I talked about this amazing Cornell University study where they  They took they they actually were able to find four traits  That people use to trust other people and they did it over I am and they did it in person and it did not work  Unless you saw the person you cannot judge whether to trust somebody  According to this study unless you can see them it was like leaning forward versus leaning back arms folded versus open  There were four traits. They even did it with robots and it worked. So it's this  Physical movement that people use to trust somebody else was a very interesting study  New York Times wrote it up a couple of weeks ago if you are interested  but it proves my point that when you're meeting with a client especially and and and you want to develop a  Relationship with them a perspective client for them to see you and for you to see them really is a big part of that meeting  That's why people want to meet face-to-face. It's just not always easy go to meeting makes that possible with their new HD faces  It's really fantastic. It's crystal clear video  That you can you can start a meeting from a Mac or a PC  But they can join a meeting from their iPad using the iPad camera  Which is super cool and the mic and the built-in headphones  So the literally you can join a meeting on an iPad anywhere you are  Very easy to use you also get free teleconferencing if you choose to use it. I love go to me  I want you to try it free  $49 a month when you buy it for as many meetings as you want as long as you want compare that to the big  You know teleconferencing  Room that the you know companies built for tens of thousands of dollars. This is better  Try it free click the try it free button right now at go to meeting comm  Use the promo code twit right here where it says promo code  Twit and we'll get credit for 30 days. There it is. Let me scroll up 30 days  Free meeting is believing when you see face to face with go to meeting with HD  faces  So we got a great panel. We're not gonna just talk about the iPhone, but it is a big story  It only happens once a year right it only happens once a year folks  Like miss yeah, or Columbus it is for Apple. They sold like crazy  You know one of the issues Apple had is their quarter ends at the end of this month  they only had a few weeks and  The iPhone 5 was not likely to to impact the quarter unless they sold a lot somebody wrote  I don't remember who it is that the real story of the success of iPhone 5 is not how many they sold in the US  But that they were able to get into 30 countries before the end of the quarter  That's that's that's a testament to Tim Cook to the operations by chain the supply chain guy  And that's the kind of stuff that's not you know doesn't make great headlines in in the newspapers the blogs  But really does make a difference yeah there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's from a Reuters we all get excited about the products right and business reporters are more excited about this other stuff  But it is a secret to Apple's success  and why they can price the phones the way they do in all their products is the supply chain the volumes of parts that they buy and  Expanding this international rollout because when you look at the iPhones growth curve over the last few years  There's so much of it happening  Internationally you know outside the US the iPhone is still growing tremendously fast especially in places like China  So it's a big deal for them to get this rollout  I mean the first iPhone or two the rollout was really slow and now it's

Transcript:  It's a requirement for Apple  I mean it's something that they have needed to do they need I mean they've needed to the fact that they have improved  fulfillment overall over the last decade is fantastic for consumers, but it also it an  International rollout at this point in the market share game is crucial for them because they are  The minority it to Android Android has a global a much bigger global base  And so being global for the iPhone is really the only thing that will keep it competitive against Android over time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one of the things I compare it with is the  Amazon the Kindle fire HD rollout yeah, which was basically us only only and while that's great  And I think what somebody said is well Amazon doesn't care because really the fire is designed to be  For only for people who use Amazon a lot. That's who the market is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know the theory that I have is that one of the advantages for them or one of the reasons why they are so aggressive  And selling the Kindle fire so cheaply is not just because they want everyone to buy  You know Kindle Amazon tablets because they recognize it for a lot of people  They're gonna have more than one tablet in the house and that maybe the first tablet will be the iPad  But the second one will be a Kindle fire  Which is cheaper more affordable and if you are using what you're gonna  Do is you're gonna kind of for the that when you're gonna talk about ebooks and television and music and things like that  You're gonna pick the lowest common denominator  Service the one that works across both of your tablets and so you use the Amazon one you use the Kindle app on the iPad

Transcript:  Amazon  Selling tablets that people consume their services on it's actually about making it  Making people more inclined to use Amazon services on other devices that makes sense  They just released for the iPad and Amazon streaming movie absolutely and they're gonna keep doing stuff like that because they want people to have  It's almost kind of like a loss leader to get people sucked into your ecosystem  And if that's how it works, I mean that's why you know at some point  I mean that's where they're pricing the Kindle ebook reader so aggressively because once you start buying all your ebooks on the Kindle  Even if you're gonna read them on your iPhone on your iPad also  You know, you're not gonna buy iBooks right because you can't use it on your ebook reader. I already do that  Yeah, I buy them exactly how I am

Start time: 2190.82
End time: 2233.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the most the most interesting thing in this whole ecosystem  Discussion over the past few years is that Amazon is is maybe the only one who is not trying to create a proprietary  ecosystem of  Interlocking devices they are they are going for that kind of just like Peter said I'm just gonna say it again  But it's slightly different way they they have a more global model  They have a model that can somehow make sure that they're actually wherever you are, which in the long run might be more effective  I don't think consumers want to be locked in  I don't think you know  I think that people do want to mix and match an iPad and an Android phone or an iPhone and an Android tablet and a Samsung TV  As opposed to buying everything from Samsung Apple or Google, but I bet you Molly you have an iPad and a Kindle

My kids will never be your age. No, Mike  Let's hope  when my kids  Were your kids age we went to Legoland and then you could buy bricks, you know  Just and bit milled something you wanted now.

Start time: 2640.94
End time: 2681.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's got to be a little bit scary because when you have that much of your company at this point riding on this thing  I mean, they're selling max like gangbusters don't get me wrong  But it's not big part of the so much of the success of the company rides on this phone and this ecosystem  And I really do think that we are at a point now where the smartphone market is maybe not as mature as it's going to  Get but mature enough that consumers have a lot of really good choices  I know a lot of people who aren't going to buy an iPhone who are not geeks who are like  Not wanting to upgrade all their accessories who are interested in Windows phone because of corporate reasons who think that Android is cheaper  You know, I mean, I think it's a it's a slightly scary position to be in when you're that when all your eggs are in

Well, but it's also I think it's a little bit accurate

Start time: 2743.76
End time: 2758.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I actually do think that there's there is increasingly cache and having a phone that does something else  That's cool, whether it's have a giant screen or up until now have 4g  I mean I do I think that there's a move away from it and iPhone is becoming the easy option

Start time: 2758.40
End time: 2782.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's right  I mean this is goes to what Matt Honen easy big phone what Matt Honen wrote about it being great and boring and there's some  Truth to that is that it's it's been so successful  It is so broadly considered sort of the default smartphone in some ways  And then everything else becomes an alternative and that's not a bad position to be in on one level  But I think you're right that it's not you know, the rebel alliance or anything like it. It's the Death Star

Start time: 2783.04
End time: 2881.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To me the biggest, you know to me the biggest challenge or is not necessarily whether it's you know  iPhone versus everybody else but it's really you know, Samsung and Apple kind of carving up the mobile industry for themselves and leaving everybody else  You know, that wouldn't be good. You do want competition. You absolutely want competition  What you have is two companies which have mastered the supply chain and and realize that you know  The the scale that you need to have to be successful and competitive in the space is making it really difficult for everybody else to compete  I mean HTC, you know is creating great phones  But they just don't have the scale and the supply chain of Samsung and Apple to be able to produce the phones as cheaply  And so it really hurts them, you know in terms of profits. I think they're  The only other mobile phone maker which is profitable right now  I mean and they're much smaller than than Samsung and Apple but for everybody else  I mean if the story to me is not, you know, is Apple walking away with it  But it's really you know, is it gonna be Apple and Samsung that walk away and then what happens to Motorola?  What happens to HTC what happens to Nokia? Yeah, and you know, I mean if you think about it the industry changes very quickly  I mean five years ago  We had completely different set of incumbents that were dominating the industry and you know five years from now  We may be in a similar situation or we may see that the smartphone market has reached maturity and that all the real growth  Happens someplace else in the technology industry happens in wearables or happens in some other, you know part of the industry  And that's where Apple really faces a challenge is not, you know, does someone else start?  You know taking away smartphone share from them  But that is all the growth in the technology industry come from some other segment of the market that Apple is not able to compete in

Start time: 2882.20
End time: 2896.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like TVs like TV or some other I mean real devices a good example  I mean imagine back when the iPod was was the thing, right?  I mean if Apple had just sort of said we're just doing the iPod  We're good here and hadn't been developing the iPhone or exactly good. I've had where would they be they'd be

Start time: 2897.18
End time: 2916.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dominating a segment that's just fading away. Yep. I mean that's and we all I mean you go back, you know seven eight years ago  We all like what will ever displace the iPod and it's not to be smartphones  Yeah  and Apple was was smart enough to realize that if they didn't cannibalize themselves that somebody else would and  So, you know the big question is gonna be what is gonna end up kind of cannibalizing that share at some point

Start time: 2916.10
End time: 2918.74

Start time: 2919.74
End time: 2946.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Transcending it. Yeah, and you know, I mean, I'll be honest like I don't really spend a lot of time worrying about Apple  No  Yeah, but it is funny like how sometimes you will see, you know  I won't say names, but you do see like, you know Apple partisans who are so defensive of the company  Like, you know what?  It's not 15 years ago when the company was on the verge of bankruptcy and need to be protected like I don't worry about

Start time: 2948.28
End time: 2981.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  1997 thing reminds me of my dad grew up during the Great Depression and it's like the permanent scarring  Oh, yeah, you never let go right and and with with a lot of Apple people  It's like that and the reality is Apple is so profitable if you don't even look at the market share numbers and say there are more  Android phones being sold than than iPhones if if Apple ends up with what?  30% of the smartphone market is stable 40% and is doing the profits that they're doing now  They're gonna be fine. Yeah, right. But what is the shape of that overall market is the big question?  Yeah, is it just a couple of phone makers? I mean, it's it's certainly possible

Start time: 2981.56
End time: 3026.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The market seems to be coalescing and that and again  It's such a huge industry that if you're not able to get to a massive scale  You're not gonna be able to compete and you'll see the Huawei's and ZTE's of the world kind of taking on the low end of  Market and then you know Samsung and Apple dominating the high end and and you know in Western Europe should consumers care about that  Does that matter? I'm not sure consumers should really care  I mean they should buy a phone that makes them happy right and I think we're getting to a place where you know most consumers  It's a it's gonna be like the PC market where you know you walk in and you kind of have a sense of what you're gonna  Get and like you might not care that much about the specific brand if you're just looking for a set of experiences  Or you know Apple has such a great brand that people feel safe buying it and and there's a comfort level  That's gonna be hard to overcome ultimately though

Start time: 3026.26
End time: 3052.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What makes this powerful is it's going to become a platform in the same way that Windows the PC industry wouldn't have happened if  Microsoft hadn't come along and made a stable  Platform that people could develop software for and all the all the growth happened  Subsequent to that with people developing software. Maybe we're in that kind of maturity now with these phones where you've got two dominant  Stable, let's hope platforms iOS and Android now innovation happens in software. Is that possible?

Start time: 3053.62
End time: 3078.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Certainly location and mobile are huge. Sure. Yeah, I think I mean I think you know  It doesn't remind me a lot about where we got with the PC market in the mid 90s where it was stagnant  It was boring  But all but the fact that the fact that we had a platform that everyone agreed  We would build on top of with Windows is what really unleashed the PC revolution  I mean that that's the long and short of that consistency and I think we may you know be getting to a similar place like  That with phones, I think

Start time: 3080.30
End time: 3120.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To go back to the the point that you made about the next the next platform  I mean, I think we are getting to stable platforms. I would not count out windows yet  I actually do think that they have a chance to be a value valuable third platform there  But I start to wonder if at some point smartphones won't they will be displaced by something else in the chat room has pointed out  that wearables  That if the innovation starts to happen in software  It seems to be around sharing and that as sharing becomes the more important  The or rather the the most the thing that people want to do the most with their devices that  Wearables and things like Google glasses actually do become potentially threatening and smartphones could get dumber. That's an interesting

Start time: 3120.94
End time: 3132.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  No  I think we might see an unbundling of the smartphone into a bunch of different devices and so I wrote something the other day that  Kind of pet theory that the reason why they changed the design of the Nano was to make it less watch

Start time: 3132.38
End time: 3145.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like we read that article last week because I thought that was very interesting people thought that Apple had missed a bet  That there's this huge market for wearable Nanos and they change the nano  So it's no longer a wristband, but you had a great insight

Start time: 3145.28
End time: 3167.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, Apple doesn't make a mistake like that and they make mistakes, but they didn't that's not a mistake. That was brilliant  Tell people what you said well  So my theory is that you know they had that they the last nano the was it the sixth generation nano?  I think I'm looking to you. Yeah. Yeah, you should know this cold. It's the fifth or sixth. There's so many Nanos  Okay, anyway, so the last one had this watch like yeah, you could put it on a watch band  It was kind of had there were all these kickstarter

Transcript:  Wasn't even about it being a wearable. It was a disconnected wearable. It was a little weird  But there were a lot of people that is not connected it has to be an always on device  It has to be connected somehow it has to be involved sharing  So there's the pebble

Start time: 3187.16
End time: 3191.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People thought that this was maybe a direction and then Apple would evolve it and instead they backed away

Start time: 3191.40
End time: 3249.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They cut the they went like this and said we're gonna have the nano that you clearly cannot wear on your wrist and so  And so my theory is that they did that to make room for a wearable device because it would be a little confusing to have  The nano which is kind of something you can wear on your wrist and then this other wearable device and I would think that this  This wearable device would wouldn't be necessarily about playing music more about controlling right, you know your phone  Notification center stuff a pebble a pebble from a pebble like device and it would be cheaper integrated deeply with the iOS  I don't have like Bluetooth 4.0 and and it would be something that like  Allowed you to extend that that iPhone experience into another device and if you kind of extrapolate from that even if Apple doesn't have doing  But like you could see us getting to a place where we have this whole network of devices that we carry and maybe we have  Like a tiny my fi like device that we carry in our pocket, which is where all the connectivity the WAN connectivity happens  Maybe that's the brain, you know a little process a little processor and then everything is distributed out, you know over Bluetooth  You know 10.0.

Start time: 3264.21
End time: 3270.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 3295.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know rejecting calls text messages. Yeah, I don't think it's not it's not a watch thing at all  It's much more in the fuel band camp or somewhere. It's something that'll have a fitness component to it  Right. I mean the point is the connectivity the point is the sharing the point is the social aspect and and then it's from there  And I'm excited about this. It's just a short hop to implants  Connected implants. Are you gonna have to like I want the Google in my eyeballs. I want the connectivity

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean we're definitely heading in that direction and I'd be really surprised if Google wasn't also working on something and the thing  I find fascinating about the wearable spaces  Okay  If you take a step back like what was interesting about tablets is that like everyone who made a smartphone and everyone who made  A PC was like that's my domain, right?  I should make a tablet so you had tons of people making tablets with wearables  It's like you have the universe of company Tommy Hilfiger  It's like Nike is like well, this is really our our wheelhouse  You know, and and so you can see like it's you're gonna start to see companies in this  That aren't traditionally, you know in that space and and if you think about it  I mean, you know Apple wasn't really an electronics, you know entertainment electronics company until it did the iPod and then  And and they certainly computer computer company and so you could see like, you know people moving laterally into the space having a huge impact  I mean Nike could end up becoming a technology company, right more than a shoe company

Transcript:  In time 400 years and start they have a map. They say they have a 400 year advantage. So good luck Apple  I don't know how they're doing that  But it is pretty clear from people who are complaining about the maps the new maps app on iOS 6  For those who don't know I'm sure there's not many of you  Apple replaced the Google Maps on iOS 6 which it wrote the app was written by Apple

Start time: 3868.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I don't think that's a big deal, but what it does point up is  you know, there's a lot to making a maps app and  you it's it's not gonna be something that they're gonna be able to come out of the box and and  Immediately do a great job with right? I mean, why is that too much to ask?

Start time: 3907.84
End time: 3910.98

Transcript:  I think it's reasonable to expect that the maps app would be really good

Start time: 3911.14
End time: 3961.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is also reason maps is a discipline that has now been well accomplished in the smartphone  Marketplace and elsewhere and it actually is I mean every time I see one of these headlines that says, you know Apple's responses  Well bear with us we're learning and I'm thinking really what what more learning do you have to do who?  From whom do you have to learn mapping is?  Everywhere there are there are tons of blog posts from people who are in the GIS and mapping industry saying you could you know  You could have called any of us by all accounts. Apple did not reach out to anyone  They did this in there in what?  When Apple stumbles it is always for the same same reason  It's because they built it in a bubble in a crazy little apple hubris bubble and they didn't talk to anybody and they didn't  Use the solution on the market. It's the same reason Siri sucks because it's not Google

Start time: 3962.50

Transcript:  Tom-tom was which provided much of the data was quick to point out that they don't have the same problem  Their Tom-tom app is fine. Thank you very much. It's not our fault their own Apple under the bus  Well Apple kind of I mean people were throwing at Tom-tom under the bus so I guess it's a defensive measure

Start time: 3978.44
End time: 3987.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the thing is it's not it's not like Google like pieced out and was like we're taking our app off of you know  Off of why did so this is Apple knew I mean it was Apple's timetable

Start time: 3988.02
End time: 4009.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had a question what and and I think a reasonable point  Anil Dash made the point. Look, this is a normally you'd think Apple protects the consumer  It does what's right for the consumer here. It clearly didn't do what was right for the consumer. It was right from Apple  Yeah, right now many businesses do that that I do what's right for Twitter. I don't care about you guys, but no, I'm kidding  I'm just kidding. It's a joke, but  People are walking out

Start time: 4012.08
End time: 4067.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But really why I mean that's the big problem here, right?  Why do they do this it iOS 6?  I mean when I when I saw the betas I was like, oh geez, you know Apple is making a business decision  Right, which is Google's a competitor. They don't want to be reliant. Nobody  Apple's biggest thing is we don't want to be reliant  So reliant on a on a competitor because if they screw up it hurts us and they have control over us and Apple hates that  Right, so they say we're gonna we're gonna do our own mapping solution  Well, that's fine except from a customer standpoint from all the user standpoint. This is a feature regression, right?  I mean, it's like the transit is gone. The maps aren't as accurate  You know, they're free driving directions now, which for an iPhone user is a big thing. Although that's been on Android before  So, you know from a user standpoint the users don't care that Apple and Google are locked in some sort of death struggle  They just want their phone to work  And if you had an iPhone 4 and you upgrade it to iOS 6 suddenly your maps are different and maybe not good  And that's not friendly to if you lose key functionality

Start time: 4067.04
End time: 4071.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna play devil's advocate. It's just not you can there are a  Dozen great mapping apps you could download and put on your iPhone, right?  It's not like you no longer have turn-by-turn directions ways is free and is amazing  So ways never works for me. Well, alright, so  Motion X GPS

Start time: 4102.96
End time: 4107.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We never really had real Google Maps on iOS because they never had turn-by-turn it in that if you're Apple

Start time: 4107.74
End time: 4134.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you gonna do? I mean it's true. Google has the best maps, right?  So if you're Apple your choices are go with Google even though  Seemingly for it's unclear to me what the reasons are their access is limited is Google withholding access to turn-by-turn  For for Apple phones, it's it's unknowable didn't allow it. Yeah, or so the question is do you go with Google?  Which is what they used to do or do you say there's got to be an alternative and what they chose to do is build their  Own and that might have been the mistake. But I mean I have a hard time saying well

Start time: 4135.46
End time: 4174.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does not have to have been a mistake to build your own though  I mean I don't it probably won't help the industry to fall into the fallacy that only Google will ever know how to do this  If any company had the resources to do it, right? It probably was Apple. They have the money  They clearly had the time because they've been in no freaking rush to give people turn-by-turn directions  Yeah, so take about the first mapping company three years ago, right?  So talk to your mapping people talk to data analysts talk to GIS professionals reach outside of the bubble  Maybe it will mean that somebody finds out that you're gonna put turn-by-turn into the into iOS 6  But you know what? It's not like Apple has any secrets left. Anyway, do it the right way

Transcript:  Here's what Horace did you said in his critical path? He's a great analyst, by the way  I read his smart smart smart. His blog is very right on he does a podcast for five by five call critical path  He says quote and I'm sure he did it in a French accent. I haven't does he have a French? No, no  No, he's not. No, no, he's Romanian and lives in Finland  So he sounds like this so not doing its own map. So would be a far bigger mistake  The mistake was not he says Apple  Should have done its maps sooner. The mistake was not getting involved in maps sooner, which was not on job  Which was on jobs watch Nokia?  He says saw the writing on the wall five years ago spent eight billion dollars to get in front of the problem  They bought what navtec or telena?  And our Erickson bought telena right both both of the big mobile companies at the time  Said oh my god locals gonna be huge. We better get maps by the way Nokia maps are excellent  That's what Amazon is gonna start using it's what Nokia is putting as being is using it's on all the windows phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are two things that Apple just did not see coming and still doesn't seem to understand and one of them is  Definitely the importance of maps and the other is social  I think that if there is any massive glaring weakness in the Apple lineup right now, it's sharing and it's social

Start time: 4265.18
End time: 4283.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got hang wait a minute  Well, they're unraveling ping-pong is thing is most motivated by many of the same things Molly mentioned about Apple's approach to maps  Which is Apple said okay other people are doing social we should do it too. Let's just do it ourselves  Let's not go it alone. Yeah instead of I think they wanted I think they wanted Facebook

Start time: 4283.94
End time: 4288.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, they announced that Facebook would work with ping and then Facebook turned their back on it or Apple

Start time: 4289.70
End time: 4329.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way as a corollary to that  I am amazed at what Facebook has managed to extract from Apple in terms of access  Now that Facebook is integrated throughout it's everywhere phone and the iOS 6 experience  Facebook is all up in your business like it has never been on iOS asking for access to contacts when you enable it  Here it  Defaults to access to your contacts and your calendar you have to go and turn that off after the fact that Facebook now has  unprecedented access  I think to iOS 6 users the way it never did before just so that you can have that little icon when you want to share  A photo I think that's sort of a little untold story right now and it imports both

Start time: 4329.76
End time: 4344.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  IOS X and mountain lion import Facebook contacts into your contacts list and I keep finding myself  Composing emails to friends and by accident selecting their Facebook  Address which is like no no no no no I don't want that but that's what happens when you link them up

Start time: 4344.88
End time: 4396.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well wasn't the story and maybe it's false  But the rumor was that and this happened during the ping time that Steve Jobs in fact  I think it's in the Isaacson book turned down Facebook because he they said onerous their demands were owners  But what it came out was that Facebook wanted access to?  Apple's customer information and Apple was not willing to give them that  But maybe times have changed and or where Apple just feels a squeeze and they said alright  I guess we got to do it now now Molly you got me going into my settings here  And I'm gonna I'm gonna turn off whatever Facebook's wanting yeah  Does Twitter get the same thing settings?  Yeah, calendar context and face. Yeah, yeah  Settings, let's see it'll vibrate  Privacy settings yeah under Facebook or on the phone on the phone there's privacy settings on the phone

Start time: 4396.40
End time: 4398.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so when you install the new Facebook app

Start time: 4399.18
End time: 4414.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at that there you go general and then privacy maybe okay, so it's gonna generate a list here actually  I like the way Apple did this  This is something. I think new in iOS 6  It's it says applications have requested access to your Facebook account will appear in a list here that they have it

Start time: 4415.16
End time: 4420.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter probably has and if you go to contacts  You'll see all the apps that are accessing your contacts, and you can go in and actually turn

Start time: 4421.10
End time: 4433.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the kind of granularity that frankly Android could really use this is great to have that ability to say well  Here's what's accessing my contacts today. Oh, I don't want Skype to get in there and to be able to turn that off

Start time: 4433.54
End time: 4438.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4438.36
End time: 4445.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The way there's an app for that way Android does it is that it asks you about all that stuff up front and unfortunately  An awful lot of stuff well

Start time: 4445.14
End time: 4470.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's also harder for people to think about the context and so you know when you when you  Actually are using the app and you start to think about you know I was using you know path the other day on the iPad  And I couldn't pull in my location  And I remember that I had actually set up to turn it off  I turned off location sharing for that app and so I had to go in and you know fix it  But and so I think sometimes it's only within the context of using the app that you start to think about well

Start time: 4470.84
End time: 4475.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What kind of access which is the flaw with Android system where they show you everything before you even install

Start time: 4475.90
End time: 4478.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I'm glad that they do that because they should do that  Yeah, you can do that

Start time: 4478.86
End time: 4511.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not like having to go and change my Facebook settings after I had installed it and then enabled it like I actually  Prefer to get all that information up front the big difference. I think is that Apple gives you all of those settings in that granularity as  Apple settings whereas on Android each individual app has those to go out. Yeah, you can do it. Yeah, it's just and and it's  it's just a  Different way to use it  I guess like I sometimes get frustrated when I open up an iOS app and I'm trying to make  Privacy settings that are just in the global privacy settings menu. It's just a different implementation, but it's all there

Start time: 4512.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to a contractor who worked on Google Maps  He says many of my co-workers at Google Maps eventually left when their contracts ended or on their own accord  They were doing other GIS work. They'd heard rumors that Apple was going to develop its own in-house mapping program  And Apple hired him. He's paid handsomely as a GIS analyst  But it's you know, I think what Apple probably is fine  I think you hit the nail on the head Molly when you said Apple was a little arrogant about this assumed  Hey, we're great  We could do it and it turned out to be just a little more than they realized a little harder to do  I mean

Start time: 4565.36
End time: 4574.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have no doubt now that it's out there that they will hire lots of people and spend a lot of money and that the  Maps will get better  But it's a you know, it's a black eye for Apple that probably didn't need to happen

Why does William Gibson write about the cube? Yeah, it's in the first  It's in the first pattern recognition and the one that ends with pattern recognition  That's the one before that pattern recognition is the first one. Yeah.

Yeah, no kidding  One thing one last story then we're gonna get off the iPhone 5 but  Anontech and PC mag have both done  performance previews benchmarks  It seems to be this is a not only the fastest  iPhone ever process probably the fastest phone on the market today because Apple now  Here's where Apple put some big bucks in maybe this is because they have their heritage as a computer company  They have they bought PA risk they put billions of dollars into better chip design

Start time: 4694.17
End time: 4709.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  They've invested a lot in that and I think that um, you know  they realized that if they were gonna be able to move really quickly with these devices and do the kinds of  optimizations around battery life and  Things like that that it was really important for them to develop their own chips  They were an original investor in arm. Yeah, and they made a ton of money

Start time: 4710.62
End time: 4727.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from arm, yeah  So this is something they kind of knew all along that there was gonna be ironically  This is how fast the industry moves that was a good investment ten years ago  They bought PA risk. They got a lot of engineers now  They design their own system on a chip based on the AV 7s arm architecture

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why I asked this thing out there. This is why it's so hard when we when we say we need new companies coming in  It's like, you know Apple feels like it's necessary for them to make their own chips to build their own maps  Google bought Motorola because they wanted their own phone company and and that's the problem with these giant companies is are we in an era?  Where you just have to have billions of dollars and you have to buy all this stuff and do it yourself and it can somebody  Small break through if that's the case

Start time: 4753.66

But technology is absolutely going to I think it it's unstoppable  It is going to continue to disrupt education and within it may however take a couple of decades or even a generation because as someone  In the chat room put it brilliantly which is as long as the people who are doing the hiring had to go to college  You're probably yeah

That's what I'm saying  That's why my point earlier  Which is when you when you have when you have jobs where it's less about having a credential and more about having specific skill sets  Right, then you can see that that you know online education free online education have a really transformative impact, right?  Like in computer programming, but like I was saying like if you want to you know, become a lawyer or a doctor or university professor  you know or whatever it's a little tougher because  you know, there is still a system in which having a credential from a  top university  Does have a meaningful impact in your ability to get a good job in that industry

Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a little bit of a I mean he did  It's a little bit of a gray area. I mean he did break some sort of a law  I mean, I think that it should not be something that you could face a million dollar fine and years in prison for whatever he did  Well, this is certainly might be a chance for us to review, you know  It definitely is a broader interpretation of he's being charged with 13 felonies for breaking terms of service

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what's so remarkable  Whether or not we are all in fact entitled to free access to these papers  The fact that he's being charged with 13 felonies over terms of service is a little upsetting

Transcript:  So the government is using the computer fraud and abuse act it was passed in 84  To enhance the government's ability to prosecute hackers stealing information. However lately  The government has been interpreting the anti hacking provisions to include activities such as and I'm reading from wired threat level blog  violating a website's term of service or a company's computer usage policy

Start time: 6340.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He didn't just go in and like cut and paste a few things. He actually he scraped it  He set up like a server in the closet. Yeah a computer in the closet and like started scraping the data  Yeah, and he spoofed Mac addresses  Well, and I mean they they charge it  I think it's a metered its metered access to the database and I think that you know  They didn't want him to copying the entire database and putting it out there for free because they do charge for access to it  I think the question is like you said, I mean, this is is this data that should be out there for free

Start time: 6367.80
End time: 6378.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's his position. That's the that's the one political argument  And then there's the other question of the feds be using these anti hacking laws to prosecute people who essentially violate terms of service

Start time: 6383.54
End time: 6401.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true it's it may be a violation of terms of service  But the actions were unquestionably the actions of a hacker like bringing in unauthorized hardware and setting up Mac servers to or  spoofing Mac addresses to set up servers to scrape data  Terms of service is just the name of the law that they're using in this case, I think right I

Start time: 6402.62
End time: 6416.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mean, you know you can I mean if anything he's maybe should be charged with copyright violation or something that for copying the data  And you know threatening to redistribute it  But I don't think this is hacking in the sense that we would normally think of hacking

Start time: 6430.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a really smart person and he's chosen to fall on his sword over it  So if anything, I feel like I'm reading this thinking. Okay, what am I missing? It reminds me a little of WikiLeaks

Start time: 6444.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my question is at what point does the the fact that he used a computer and did and committed a crime?  Let's say he committed a crime at what point is that no longer relevant as an intensifier  a lot of these hacking laws came in came into effect because  Computers were new and the laws hadn't caught up good point  Yeah, and and now I've seen multiple instances  Where people who were doing something that was probably not illegal or if it was it was barely illegal  But it was on a computer computer and they got charged with felonies and and had just their lives not necessarily ruined  But severely harmed and it's a little like saying well a gun was used in commission of a crime  It's just a computer  It's not good to go to jail at some point what you did on the computer should be what you should be charged with and not  The fact that a computer was you that's I'm saying seems like more like a copyright

End time: 6558.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean certainly people you know the part that's good about I'm falling on a sword on about this is it is  Important for people to realize that the government has what you know in its infinite wisdom these heavy computers  chosen to interpret anti hacking provisions in such a broad way so that almost anybody and there was the  again in this threat level blog  Millions of unsuspecting individuals could find that they're engaging in criminal contact because  You can be charged to such an extreme degree  When as you say you should have been charged with stealing right or copyright infringement or something like that  But the fact that all of those  Eulah's and combined to be such a serious crime is is pretty disturbing because it is the kind of thing people could do without  realizing

Transcript:  Kickstarter is changing its rules a little bit  I've been the only one in the world who's been bugged by Kickstarter only because I feel like it's  It looks like it's a marketplace like you're an investor and really you're just giving somebody money, and you're hoping it works out  Well Kickstarter is banning product renderings and is now requiring project owners to be more open  About the risk which I think is appropriate  They require creators to disclose any risks and challenges a project may face  The problem is I think people think like for instance the Pebble watch you feel like well, I'm giving them money to buy a watch  You're missing everything that goes in between the drawing of a watch and the actual distribution of a watch  Yeah

Start time: 6602.42
End time: 6693.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People want to I mean people like finding stuff on Kickstarter and Indiegogo and the other sites because they feel like they're being part of a  moment a cultural moment and they're you know  Participating in something in a way that goes beyond just buying something they're actually kind of helping something make happen make an interesting  Make happen right right right right and a sophisticated person understands that yeah  And I think that I think the problem is that you know as Kickstarter gets you know more and more  Awareness grows and people are using it more and more and realizing that it's not just a way to like get your product  Funded it's a way to like build awareness of it and launch your product  I mean I'm seeing people that are using who don't need to use Kickstarter don't need the money rising it just to get publicity  It's a marketing tool  And I think you know in some respects those are the people who are best able to fill you know because  If they have the resources already built it once right right, but I think it's a real challenge for for Kickstarter because I mean  I know the founders and I guess disclosure. I guess we share investors with them, so I'm not sure that really  They didn't necessarily start Kickstarter to fund hardware projects they really you know they  Maybe that it Kickstarter it's hard for Kickstarter to encompass all these different kinds of  products or services and arts and but it was supposed to be for the arts for the arts  Yeah  I think that like it may be that that Kickstarter can't be all things to all people when it comes to  Crowdfunding projects and maybe there needs to be a Kickstarter for hardware that has you know that vets the projects the products in a different way  That Kickstarter is never going to be able to because they don't want to do that  Yeah

Start time: 6693.22
End time: 6725.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because if you're funding a novel or a play or a movie you know I kind of understand what you're getting into  But if you're funding a product it might feel like you're buying a product  And that's what I think this is exactly what they should have said is what they said  Kickstarter is not a store. Yeah, and I think that there's a lot of new people okay when you pebble watch raises ten million dollars  Mostly for people who are buying pebble watches that I think people think oh, I'm getting an early on a product  Yeah, but this is a product that doesn't exist the uya raised eight million dollars it may never exist

Start time: 6725.42
End time: 6748.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. It's a I think there's a big risk involved  And I think that you know a growing risk is more and more people try to you know fund their products on Kickstarter and think it's  A little bit of a shortcut and don't realize I think what happens is people don't realize that  Hardware is it's getting easier to make hardware  I think we you know you could do a whole podcast about that it is exciting  But it's still hard you still have to know what you're doing

Start time: 6749.16
End time: 6757.74

Transcript:  So that's one of the things they're doing the other thing that's gotten easier  It's gotten really easy to make 3d videos that look like they're real so they're saying look you can't post a product simulation  You can't simulate things the product might do if it doesn't do it now  You can't put a picture on that is not of actual the actual prototype as it currently exists in other words

Transcript:  Or well they I mean they're I think that they will deliver just based on the people that I know they are all with it  But you know you do see people that put products out there  And it's clear that they have no expertise to be able to deliver what they're what they're talking about and the thing is  It's a little bit like the Dunning Kruger effect like they are not even like aware that they are not able to do this right  You know like they think they want to do it's not like they're trying to read not dishonest  Yeah, they like fully intend to do this and then they they raise the money, and then they start working  They're like oh you you know I don't know anything about circuit boards

Transcript:  It's it there's no recourse and actually I think  Kickstarter has been somewhat clear about this  But they might want to be a little more explicit and saying look there's a good chance you're gonna lose all your money here

Start time: 6873.87
End time: 6910.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They definitely need to be more explicit about that  I think it's it's highly unclear whether you will get your money back if the product doesn't ship and and it's to their own  Benefit to do that really I mean I think what happened is kickstarter got super cool  And then everyone went out looking for a kickstarter to be part of and and so it became  Sort of a self-fulfilling hype machine and all of a sudden people were just like I don't know what throw money at that thing  And and is to it would it will be who've kickstarter. I think to be very straightforward about what it means and to  Position it strongly as an investment  you know a risky a highly highly risky investment as opposed to
