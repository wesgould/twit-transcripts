Start time: 235.32
End time: 251.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had fun, but I think a lot of the other people didn't.  I was very disappointed in parts of that event because I don't know that Ford really had  that much to do with it.  Really?  I've got the distinct...  I would like to talk to a Ford executive and clue him in on what actually happened.  Huh.  A PR guy.

Start time: 252.18
End time: 255.08

Start time: 262.56
End time: 267.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You may not take it to Toledo.  What was the point?  I didn't get that.  John's a scofflaw.  Well, it wasn't a law thing.

Start time: 267.36
End time: 299.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad you did.  In fact, we got a great video of Toledo.  Yeah.  That video.  Ohio?  Toledo, Ohio.  Toledo, Ohio.  It's how she pronounced Toledo.  It's a big drive, Joshua.  It's a long...  Yeah, from Europe.  That'd be huge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Long haul.  Hey, this just in, the internet is down again in Libya, according to Google Tool.  8 a.m. GMT, which was late last night Pacific time.  The Google monitoring tool shows the internet shut off.  I'll tell you, isn't it interesting?  This is what dictators do now.

Start time: 300.52
End time: 314.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's disturbing.  They could save a lot of trouble just by having everything run by AT&T.  They hate the internet.  They just lose all their connections.  That's what they should have done.  Use AT&T.  Yeah, they just hire AT&T to run their internet and then they don't have to run around pulling  up holes.

Start time: 315.31

Transcript:  Wow.

Start time: 316.06

Start time: 317.04
End time: 326.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dictators, dictators hate the internet.  They do.  They really feel like that's going to slow things down, right?  They cut off their internet.  Like the rest of the internet isn't working.

Start time: 326.88
End time: 333.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the first thing in the old days, the first thing that you would do if you were  going to do a coup is you would seize the television stations.  And the radio stations.

Start time: 333.50
End time: 337.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you start, you kill a bunch of people.  So now you shut down the internet.

Start time: 337.08
End time: 340.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They still kill people, but the shutting down of the internet seems to be the new kind of  ritual.

Start time: 341.50
End time: 351.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it does anything.  I mean, I think that everybody's as connected as we are in California, it seems to me.  Yeah.  I think so.  Twitterers, they're Twittering.  Let's stop the internet because it's going to cause a revolution.

Start time: 352.06
End time: 401.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with John.  I mean, this is a question I was talking about with some of the editors at Engadget and my  wife who's also an editor.  But we were talking about, you know, is it our perception of these revolutions that we're  seeing it all happen on Twitter and Facebook and that's where it's happening?  Or is it just that we're seeing it like that?  I think in a way it is that like most of the people taking to the streets are probably  not tweeting about it.  You know, they're probably don't even have a phone that it can tweet.  I mean, you know, maybe I'm making a generalization here, but I think that some part of this is  just perception, right?  The government wants you to perceive that they're like locking things down.  And then I think it's also from us, we're getting the idea that it's all happening online  when this stuff is actually happening in the streets, it's happening in their houses of  parliament or they don't have houses of parliament there though.  I guess they're houses of dictatorship.

Start time: 404.62
End time: 407.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The left bathroom and the right bathroom of Muammar Gaddafi's palace.

Start time: 408.40
End time: 415.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this stuff is really happening like, you know, there are people dying right now.  They're not people aren't like tweeting, hey, I just got killed.  You know, they're not trying to...

Start time: 415.28
End time: 428.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does diminish it a little bit to say it's a Twitter revolution.  And the other thing that kind of...  But on the other hand, obviously, Gaddafi feels like it's important to shut off the  internet as did Hosni Mubarak in Egypt because it's being used, what, to organize?

Start time: 428.24
End time: 451.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they might be used to organize some groups, but I think it's on the other hand,  they don't know what's going on and they just shut down everything.  That's all they can do.  But I'll tell you something else that bothers me just to interrupt for a second.  They show these videos that people are taking with these camera phones and I'm not seeing  anything but a lot of blurring motion.  They got the video cameras waving all around and it's like you can't see anything and people  are supposedly being shot and run down and gunned down and shot by airplanes.

Start time: 451.40
End time: 456.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's the fault of the cell phone makers.  They need to get better, more stable cameras on their phones.

Start time: 456.40
End time: 460.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, maybe they could hold it still for one second.  They're getting shot at.

Start time: 461.06
End time: 471.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Josh makes an excellent point.  Hide.  And there are countries where people don't know what the internet is.  You go to North Korea, they've never permitted internet access to any other citizens and  nobody even knows what it is.

Start time: 472.12
End time: 473.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all really well read.

Start time: 473.80
End time: 489.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have a scale on this Google monitoring tool.  I don't know if these are megabytes, terabytes, gigabytes, petabytes.  Forty.  It says forty.  Forty, thirty, twenty.  I'm going to think that's gigabits.  No, I doubt it.

Start time: 489.74
End time: 494.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a football field to me.  I don't know.

Start time: 494.90
End time: 533.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it does drop off quite completely.  I know this is kind of sounds kind of silly, but I have to assume that the dictators know  their job.  And if they're shutting off the internet, it's because they if I'm sure they're also  shutting down cell phones so people can't text one another.  But it's got to be because there is some threat to them from the internet, don't you think?  You know what?  It is really also about it's not just it's not just inbound or it's not just I think  it's people keeping people off.  It's not just people not seeing Facebook and Twitter.  It's keeping people from posting videos, from letting the world know.  I mean, a lot of the way reading the news.

Start time: 533.44
End time: 540.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, don't you think that's something you're trying to stop people reading the  New York Times going, hey, look at this.  I know we're making waves.

Start time: 541.16
End time: 565.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was some complaint early on in Libya from the protesters that the Western world  wasn't watching in the same way that they were watching Tunisia or Egypt.  And without the pressure of the Western world on Gaddafi, he doesn't know if he if he were  operating alone inside his own borders without anybody paying any attention, he could do  whatever he wants.  I mean, that's what isn't that what happened in Cambodia?

Start time: 565.46
End time: 576.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what happened in Cambodia, which he said, I mean, in the old days, they  just shut down the newspapers and they could operate with free reign.  Yeah, that's it. That's what they've done.  And it's a work.

Start time: 576.22
End time: 576.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it working?

Start time: 577.82
End time: 580.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we don't know. I mean, it's not it's a nasty scene in Libya right now.

Start time: 581.68
End time: 583.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very sad.  Doesn't seem to be working.

Start time: 583.66
End time: 600.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's weird that we went from Gaddafi was a kind of funny a few months ago.  Yeah, not so funny.  He showed up at the UN and now he doesn't seem that funny.  He actually seems like a pretty terrible person, which is kind of has always been the thing  with him. Right. I mean, he's been terrible for a while.

Start time: 601.56
End time: 602.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terrible and a little crazy.

Start time: 602.88
End time: 627.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, some of this comes from our own our own U.S.  And for those of you listening outside the U.S., you know, well, it's our own federal  government, which confuses us as U.S.  citizens because we have some interest in Egypt.  We have some interest in Libya.  You know, we let Gaddafi off the hook for the KAL bombing.

Start time: 627.72
End time: 630.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mean the Scotland Lockerbie?  Lockerbie.  You mean Pan Am?

Start time: 630.64
End time: 644.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pan Am, I'm sorry. Lockerbie.  Not KAL Lockerbie because we wanted to treat with him, even though he's a nut bag.  And so some of this confusion, I think, comes from the fact that the U.S.  government doesn't seem to know who's good and who's bad.

Start time: 644.84
End time: 649.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is your chat going crazy right now?  Because I'm not watching it, but this is we're getting really political.

Start time: 649.90
End time: 653.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, this sounds like no agenda.  All right. Let's change.  Let's change channels.

Start time: 653.68
End time: 655.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't mind. Let's talk about it.  I think it's interesting.

Start time: 655.72
End time: 662.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  America must be stopped.  We got to stop the U.S. from being lazy about dictators.

Start time: 662.36
End time: 677.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, geopolitics is tricky.  For instance, Egypt, you keep on their good side to protect Israel, right?  We give them more than two billion dollars a year.  They're the number two recipient of U.S.  foreign aid because it's a payoff.  Basically, that's insane.

Start time: 678.08
End time: 690.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's insane, isn't it?  It's a payoff.  That sounds crazy.  We're paying them off to protect Israel.  Yes. That whole situation sounds crazy.  Like, like if we don't give them the money, they'll just go ballistic.

Start time: 690.68
End time: 693.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Let them dig a hole.  I'll just watch.

Start time: 694.52
End time: 703.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, really, we should leave this in the hands of the experts.  John C.  Dvorak, John C.  Dvorak and Adam Curry.  From now on, listen to no.  You want politics? Listen to No Agenda.

Start time: 703.30
End time: 711.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't really do politics on No Agenda.  We just do deconstruction of news stories to prove that public relations  companies are behind most of the news.  Which is pretty.

Start time: 711.48
End time: 712.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that. I got to listen.

Start time: 713.00
End time: 716.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to watch. Yeah, it's a good show.  No Agenda. No Agenda show.  No Agenda show.

Start time: 718.22
End time: 719.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm endorsing that based on the idea.

Start time: 719.94
End time: 735.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds great. Yeah, that's all you need.  In fact, you don't have to listen to the show at all, Josh.  You pretty much. That's it.  Yeah, you got it.  Oh, well, you know, it's kind of a drawback.  The details. It's all in the details.  Let's talk about iPad 2.  Gina, were you at the Apple event?

Start time: 735.50
End time: 745.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was I was live blogging it from my desk.  How were you live blogging it?  Was you have a camera going?  If Fritz Nelson was there with a Skype feed and you're kidding.

Start time: 745.60
End time: 747.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is illegal. I guess you won't be going back.

Start time: 748.78
End time: 753.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo got thrown out.  Do you know? I did not get thrown out.  But you have not been invited back.

Start time: 753.92
End time: 754.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never again.

Start time: 754.86
End time: 757.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple and I have both.  That's the same as being thrown out, Leo.

Start time: 757.80
End time: 760.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's post facto being thrown out.

Start time: 761.62
End time: 762.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've been disinvited.

Start time: 763.34
End time: 776.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, in fact, no one has ever contacted me from Apple  or asked me about it.  No one at the time told me to stop.  There was nowhere on the badge.  It said you may not stream.  Did you try?  Were all these cameras in the room.  I thought, well, everybody else is broadcasting.

Start time: 776.60

Start time: 827.62
End time: 853.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really handled it.  It's a little bit lighter.  It's really thin.  It's so thin.  It's thinner than an iPhone 4.  I expected we knew what it was going to look like.  We had a few leaks and we had some pretty good, a pretty good idea  of what the thing was going to look like.  And I expected it to look how it looked.  But when you hold it, it really feels nice.  It gets so, so thin.  I was more impressed by the way it felt than I thought I would be.

Start time: 853.98
End time: 860.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it thin enough so that it has almost a knife edge like quality  so you can actually literally cut butter?  Can you chop someone's head off with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you could get I think you could get through the just the very  first layer of skin.  I don't know how deep you could get with it.  Now, it's not sharp.  It's not that sharp.  No. If you were to sharpen it, you might be able to.  I think that'd be cool.  The head chopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. Now, I have to say that they did at the minimum, did they not?  I mean, there were things that they could have included.  Thunderbolt, USB, SD card, higher resolution.  Thunderbolt wasn't on it. Thunderbolt.  These are all things not on it.  All right. I'm sorry.  It seems it seemed to me they did the minimum they could do  to make the old one look obsolete.

End time: 1024.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they did the minimum they needed to do to be competitive.  I think they made a point about saying we are not.  This is not a space race.  I actually wrote an editorial about this, but this is in a space race.  We're going to do what we think is necessary for the product.  And our experience is it's experience overall.  And yeah, they didn't do a lot from a technical standpoint.  They didn't need to. They added cameras.  Well, it's when you dominate the market, when you own and define the market,  how much do you need to do? It's like saying, I can't even think of a parallel.  Oh, Google. It's like Google.  It's like Google changing their search algorithm.  Remember, they just say, hey, we're going to we're going to try to cut down on spam.  It's like they didn't need to.  It's probably the bare minimum.  They're probably doing the bare minimum to cut down on spam.  If you own the market and there is no other name, really,  how much do you need to do to stay competitive?  Well, you don't need to do anything, really.  But just a little bit is enough.  And they did just enough now to say, oh, we've got that.  You know, we've got a dual core. We've got cameras.  But at the end of the day, what's going to make people walk away with these things  and what my experience was playing around with it, some of the new stuff,  the garage band that they've done for the iPad, I move, they've added for  some of the photo booth stuff, which is just like if you play with it in a store,  you're going to want to leave with it because it just is fun.  It's just like something that's weird and fun and you can't do on anything else.  It's funny because photo booth is such a throwaway program.

Start time: 1024.60
End time: 1038.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been on the Mac for such a long time.  But everybody who has a Mac loves photo booth.  Anytime you want to show off a Mac, you use photo booth.  And I think never Apple never gave it much love.  And now I think you're right.  They realized this could sell. This could sell.  Yeah. It's like, what's the what's the experience of somebody

Start time: 1038.24
End time: 1068.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who didn't know they wanted one of these?  They go into the store, they say, oh, I heard about the iPad.  And they start playing around with these really touchy feelings.  Very graphic, intense, weird, cool, new programs.  I mean, I think that they are just their whole thing where they were saying,  we love to do apps and here's a couple of new apps.  We want to challenge other developers and the apps.  You know, I played with the garage band on the demo units they had there.  It's really cool.  I mean, it's and I've made I used to make music professionally.  I think it's I think it's really, really an interesting piece of software

Start time: 1068.16
End time: 1070.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that is for musicians or for non-musicians.

Start time: 1070.62
End time: 1101.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think for both. That's the thing.  You can use it. If you're a real musician,  you can totally write on it.  You can record on it if you're a beginner or a track recording.  Yeah, it's a record.  And they have these crazy things called smart instruments  where it'll give you like a guitar.  It'll give you the neck of a guitar.  You can strum it and it gives you your set of your standard chords.  So it's like you're playing the guitar.  You can create a song that's completely original,  but you don't have to actually learn how to play the guitar, which is, wow,  pretty fascinating, fascinating idea.

Start time: 1102.18
End time: 1105.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, some cool apps.  The device is thinner.  It's lighter.

Start time: 1105.96
End time: 1114.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you would you would you shoot?  Hey, Joshua, maybe, you know, because Apple was really unclear on this.  Did they did you ask them what what is the resolution of that back camera?

Start time: 1115.72
End time: 1120.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't said they haven't said we don't know the number.  Yeah, it's that odd that we have.

Start time: 1121.10
End time: 1136.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So funny because they say we're in the post PC era.  You don't care how much RAM we have.  But then they say, but we do have a dual core processor running at one point  or three gigahertz. It's like they decide, you know, this is  announced the good.  So the numbers we like sounds good.  So it makes me nervous that they haven't revealed the resolution of that camera.

Start time: 1136.72
End time: 1148.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like it's what's the back of the touch.  It's probably the same.  I mean, that's crap.  Yeah, it is.  It's not a great camera.  But but I think it does HD video recording.  It's not going to look as good as it'll be upscaled HD.

Start time: 1148.26
End time: 1151.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It won't be true 720p if it's the iPod touch back.

Start time: 1151.50
End time: 1157.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then I think it is going to be true 720p.  So maybe it's higher res than the I might be wrong.

Start time: 1157.56
End time: 1162.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the touch does.  I know they claim 720, but like the flip cam, it's a it's a upscaled 720.

Start time: 1163.18
End time: 1168.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. I don't think they would.  I mean, maybe they're upscaling.  I don't know. I mean, on the on the iPad.  Well, Steve would never lie.

Start time: 1169.04
End time: 1171.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure if Steve says, well, let's go over that little issue.

Start time: 1171.82
End time: 1175.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had you said you have.  We'll talk about that in a second.  We're going to get to the.

Start time: 1176.30
End time: 1186.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the iPod touch, let me just look at the specs in the year.  See if they say on the video now.  So they don't. Oh, they do.  They just say 960 by 720.  So it is 720p on the touch.

Start time: 1186.44
End time: 1194.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I know 960 by 720 is not true.  Seven, no, it's not wide enough.  It's not 1280 by 720.  At least 720 lines top to bottom.

Start time: 1194.96
End time: 1195.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're right, it wouldn't be 16.

Start time: 1196.00
End time: 1199.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's actually kind of phony, which is annoying.  So it probably is the same camera.

Start time: 1200.16
End time: 1201.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not the iPhone 4 camera.

Start time: 1202.44
End time: 1210.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely not.  And that would cost. Why not?  I think I'm trying to keep it cheap.  Priced down.  That's a much better camera.  It's a really nice.

Start time: 1210.94
End time: 1216.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish to hell they'd say.  I think it's a little funny that they say the specs that they want to say

Start time: 1216.40
End time: 1220.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot of disingenuous things going on where they said,  we're in a post PC world.

Start time: 1220.86
End time: 1223.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that we have one point of three gigahertz processors.

Start time: 1223.28
End time: 1231.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And then they announced this case as if it's, you know,  the newest things, the star, revolutionary case.  Blackberries have. But wait a minute, it is a cool case.  For 10 years. Yeah, the magnet.

Start time: 1232.08
End time: 1233.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cool case. But I mean,

Start time: 1234.06
End time: 1240.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the fact they had a video for the case, I thought was a little over the top.  I mean, it's cute, but it's just a case.  I mean, it's a case. It covers the front of it.

Start time: 1241.74
End time: 1258.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. That's that's the.  That's not a case. It's just a.  That's the Apple.  I would have fun because first of all, none of the existing cases  will work with the camera.  Apple is going to sell every single person who buys an iPad  to will buy that case at 30 bucks.  How much can that piece of rubber and a magnet cost to make come with it?

Start time: 1259.14
End time: 1262.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's $38 extra.  Just they're endangering the user.

Start time: 1262.76
End time: 1265.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's all profit because it's just a freaking piece of rubber.

Start time: 1265.98
End time: 1269.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're getting it for $2 from Shenzhen.  Probably a buddy. Exactly.

Start time: 1276.74
End time: 1280.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the Blackberries had this for the magnet.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 1280.78
End time: 1286.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I like that was actually a nice feature.  The Blackberry, you'd holster it.  It would know it would be in the holster.  I think the magnets are cool.

Start time: 1286.54
End time: 1288.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This as if it was, you know, he also said.

Start time: 1289.12
End time: 1295.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Joshua, you can maybe clarify on this.  He said this is we are the first dual core processor tablet  to be shipping in volume. Is that accurate?

Start time: 1296.58
End time: 1311.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's it's a little bit of wordplay, right?  Ship in volume. Well, you have to ask what volume means to 15 million.  Obviously, I mean, Zoom has dual core.  It's shipping in the atrix has the atrix.  Well, it's not a tablet, but I mean, it's it's.

Start time: 1311.90
End time: 1316.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dell put out a dual core streak.  Yeah. Months ago.

Start time: 1316.52
End time: 1317.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Tegra is not in volume.

Start time: 1318.26
End time: 1322.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, what is volume?  Dell's only sold three of those things.  Well, that may be true.

Start time: 1322.34
End time: 1371.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's actually more like 300.  So so I guess volume is whatever Steve Jobs decides.  It's shipping.  It's like they're not selling a lot of them.  I think that it's shipping.  And Apple is selling a lot of iPads, right?  So they get to and this is the whole thing is the whole  all this post PC and shipping and volume.  And we only talk about the specs we want.  They're basically, you know, they're it's carte blanche now.  Whatever we want to do, because they when you go to a store,  you're not looking for a tablet.  You're looking for looking for a tablet.  You're looking for an eye. You want the iPad.  And the other guys have to now say we offer something  that the iPad doesn't offer.  That's a feature that you just have to must have.  And Apple is is basically going they don't have it.  There aren't any features that they could boast about specs.  But that doesn't matter.  He was saying he I have to say Steve was kind of a little cocky.

Start time: 1371.20
End time: 1375.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, he was crowing. He's like, they can't.  They don't even they're not even close.

Start time: 1375.60
End time: 1391.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's they went way beyond expectations on sales.  I'm by the way, I know that I'm sure people are like, what a fanboy.  And I wrote this editorial and it was all about how it's Apple's post PC world.  And they're sort of selling this idea of the post PC.  And it was about really how they're trying to market themselves  and how they're trying to market. It doesn't mean you like it.

Start time: 1391.64
End time: 1394.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just means it's an observation. This is what they're doing.

Start time: 1394.38
End time: 1401.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the reality. They said as much.  You know, they said we don't speeds and feeds.  We don't. That's the PC model.  Well, we do speeds and feeds.  But it benefits us.

Start time: 1402.06
End time: 1404.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you want to know about the camera, well, we don't do speeds.

Start time: 1404.60
End time: 1407.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Josh, I read your editorial. I thought it was dead on. Yeah.

Start time: 1408.10
End time: 1430.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that and I think that the speeds and feeds is right  when they want to talk about something.  But I also think, you know, look at it from their perspective.  They probably said, all right, what's the next version?  We need a faster processor.  People want cameras.  We want to be able to do FaceTime on here.  I don't think I think they looked at this from a fairly holistic,  you know, a fairly holistic way and said also, you know, version three is coming.  So you have to add some version.  That's an interesting question.

Start time: 1430.58
End time: 1435.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Version three this fall or you think we wait till April for March  next year for version three?

Start time: 1435.64
End time: 1460.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't make sense to me.  I talked to John Gruber about this.  We had a conversation at the event.  That's sort of his theory.  I think is that there'll be a version in the fall, which is a higher  resolution display and some other stuff.  But they're already cannibalizing iPad one here.  I mean, so much so that they're saying if you bought one recently,  right, you're 100 back.  Last two weeks.  How how would it make sense?  What's the tell me what the premise is?  Well, I'll tell you why.

Start time: 1461.12
End time: 1487.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In six months, here's the only reason I can think of it is that shipping  an iPad in April or March is a bad time to ship an iPad.  It kills your Christmas sales because everybody knows, well, wait three months.  So what you'd like to do is ship into September.  So I think what they're going to do is a one time only.  They'll take a little hit one time only.  We're going to yeah, we're going to cannibalize iPad two.  But we're going to we're going to get it out in September for the buying season.  It will be every September from then on.  Does that doesn't that make sense, Joshua?

Start time: 1488.32
End time: 1491.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1491.86
End time: 1496.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's true. They could have waited, couldn't they?  I mean, maybe they felt like I think they were threatened a little bit by

Start time: 1496.34
End time: 1510.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my role in Playbook and I think they were trying to steal some of the thunder  from Motorola by announcing this kind of limited iterative version  of the iPad and the current iPad.  It has no way in and no way out.  It's like the hotel. It's not supposed to have a way in or out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't it seem crazy, though, that they would be threatened by the zoom when  they're almost in two.  There's two different categories.  The zoom's cost, you know, minimum is you're going to pay  700, you know, $800 or something.  Six. I think there's there's a Wi-Fi version they've been talking about  that's going to be $5.99 or something, but isn't available yet.  And, you know, the price point is way off.  There's, you know, they're trying to sell them with a carrier commitment.  And there's no software.  I mean, there's literally and I just reviewed the zoom.  There was there were like six apps and some of them that Google had to give to us.  They were like, here, these aren't out yet.  It's a really weird thing where you've got this almost like a beta product.  The zoom is very good on a text on the tech side.  It's great battery life.  I think the new Android honeycomb UI is very interesting.  But there is no competition right now between these two products.  I mean, there are no apps available for the zoom that are compelling, really,  that are going to make you say, hey, there's something happening here that isn't.  The only thing that's happening.  It's different as it's running Android, really.

Start time: 1592.38
End time: 1610.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think they sense that it's very clear when they released the iPad initially,  they had to do a very competitive, aggressive price because it was a new category.  And nobody's going to even look at something that they don't even know they need  unless it's affordable enough.  They sure killed netbooks with the iPad.  Yeah. But that put that market to bed.

Start time: 1610.72

But this this quote that Steve Jobs used on Wednesday was debunked and fixed by  everybody, including Engage it in the Wall Street Journal weeks ago.  She said, as you heard, Arselin, we're talking about the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Arselin was quite aggressive.  That means John Selin means sales to the vent, the dealers, right?  Channel, channel sales, not to end users.  So as she said, Arselin was quite aggressive around two million in terms of  sell out, that is sales from the dealers to customers.  She said, we believe it was quite smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  So I think it's not unreasonable to think that he may be when he said, uh, we're  the only dual processor tablet to ship in volume.  He was, he said, I think at the end of that, so maybe that was just a,  no, that could have been an ad lib too.  So we'll give that one.  We'll give him that one.  Eh, in this case, maybe it was just bad fact checking, you know, we can  give him that one, it's just, it's not a lie.  It's just bad fact checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's like, uh, well, no, they're saying, well, okay.  So Samsung sold 2 million into the channel.  Apple sold 14.8 million into the channel, but that's not a 90%.  You'd have to sell a 17, uh, actually 18.  So that wasn't correct.  So that's not right.  All right.  Well, this is probably, he's not good at math.

Start time: 2077.91

Start time: 2584.97
End time: 2596.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  So I guess it started on Thursday.  We had an extremely large denial, distributed denial of a service attack  that ended up taking WordPress.com down, as many of you guys reported.

Start time: 2597.14
End time: 2598.76

Start time: 2604.38
End time: 2610.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  That's a significant amount.  I guess you could with a large botnet, you could probably throw that much bandwidth at...

Start time: 2611.76
End time: 2625.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It actually wasn't the largest one we've seen in terms of bandwidth.  But it was pretty intense in a packets per second point of view,  which ended up overloading some of the routers upstream from us,  which is what ultimately took us down.

Start time: 2625.96
End time: 2626.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you get out of it?

Start time: 2628.06
End time: 2642.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you get out of it?  Well, at that level, we don't have a lot of options by the time it gets to us.  Really, we work with our excellent upstream providers,  Pier One, and later technologies, and those guys, and they were able to block it  before it even gets to our data center.

Start time: 2642.66
End time: 2648.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they throw more bandwidth at it?  Because I presume that the originating IP addresses are rotating.

Start time: 2649.88
End time: 2665.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, we ended up blocking about millions and millions of IP addresses, two Class 8s,  coming from... just to make it stop.  So we ended up blocking a lot of IP addresses as a temporary measure.  And then they did some more sophisticated filtering of the traffic, as far as I know.

Start time: 2666.38
End time: 2672.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, TechCrunch speculates that most of this traffic came from China.

Start time: 2675.00
End time: 2683.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2690.48
End time: 2708.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, was it from China?  It is a fact that the majority of the traffic was coming from China.  However, now that we've dug a bit more into the blog,  it appears to be that the attack might have been business motivated.  The website...  Really?  Some sort of gaming website.  You're kidding.  That appears to have no political aspect at all.

Start time: 2742.00

Start time: 2746.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you know it was that blog that they're attacking?

Start time: 2749.88
End time: 2756.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, the first set of attacks we didn't know.  It was just basically a TCP attack at port 80.  So, there was no target information.

Start time: 2756.94
End time: 2759.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, they were just throwing it all at WordPress.com?

Start time: 2760.72
End time: 2773.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Just at RIP addresses.  Later, there were, I think, six total waves of the attacks.  And one of the later ones was trying to do a resource overload,  which included HTTP headers,  which made it very easy to see what they were targeting at.

Start time: 2774.72
End time: 2779.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, that one was more targeted at a particular WordPress.com hosted blog.  Yep.

Start time: 2780.23
End time: 2801.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I originally thought it was politically motivated  because we've had a number of...  We get DDOS' all the time.  So, this happens a lot.  Yeah. Sometimes a few times a week.  Most of them are so small we don't even notice.  Wow.  Just because.  But there was one, another larger one a few weeks ago  against some Vietnamese political sites.  So, I thought it might be related to that somehow.

Start time: 2802.32
End time: 2818.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You say, you told TechCrunch,  98% of the attacks originated in China  with a small percentage coming from Japan and Korea.  Do you believe still that to be the case?  Yeah. That's what we checked in the IP.  Doesn't mean, I guess, that the originator is in China.  Could be Russian because the Russians have a lot of...  Yeah.

Start time: 2818.80
End time: 2841.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Russians have a lot of Chinese botnets that they...  It could be anybody redirected to China.  Apparently, in China, one of the issues they have  because most of the software there is bootlegged.  So, there's apparently versions of Windows that have built-in Trojans  and there just must be millions of them that they can be turned on by...  That makes sense, actually.  Because everything is a copy.  Yeah.  It's an interesting fact about China.

Start time: 2844.28
End time: 2871.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Chinese thing also makes it seem like there's some sort of global  political conspiracy, but that's actually not the case.  Based on what you're saying, at first glance, it's like,  oh, they originated from China.  Well, this has got to be...  And then like Leo said, was it targeted at a political site?  It's interesting to hear that it really is not China  coming at some political site.  It's a group of or some gaming people coming at a gaming site.  Some geeks in Shenzhen.

Start time: 2873.04
End time: 2874.03

Transcript:  It sounds so much more right.

Start time: 2875.64

Transcript:  That's it. It was definitely a professional attack.

Start time: 2877.84
End time: 2888.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The size of the attack would have been very, very expensive to mount.  So, I mean, based on that, it was nontrivial.  We don't have any further details about why or...

Start time: 2889.16
End time: 2891.07

And that's difficult for a gadget blogger, I have to say.  But you look at TechCrunch, and they're selling, or were selling,  I don't know what they're doing now under Arianna,  but they were selling off editorial, like literally selling.  Oh yeah.

Because if you're going to be at their show, you're going to cover them.  Yeah.  So why don't you give me $5,000, Leo, and then, oh hey, by the way, we'll give you some-  So it's kind of indirect.

We're ad-driven, right?  We're ad-supported.  Sony advertises on the site.  They're giving AOL money, which in turn is giving end-gadget money.

Start time: 4197.20
End time: 4203.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say beyond zero input from our ad team on anything we do on the site.  That was the way it was at TechTv.

Start time: 4203.38
End time: 4241.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's fine because we do that at PC Magazine too and MarketWatch is the same way.  Nobody.  But the fact of the matter is, and I've said this before as a writer who's been doing this  as long as anybody in the room, the fact of the matter is if you are working for a publication  and the largest advertiser you have, let's say it is Sony, and they're contributing maybe 50%  of the income of the entire operation, you're never told to ever say anything bad against Sony,  but you just decide on your own as a writer that you're probably better off in terms of  your career future not to go slamming Sony because they're like keeping the company in business.  It has a chilling effect.  And there is no question in my mind that this happens at every publication.

Start time: 4243.20
End time: 4252.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't happen with us. I can tell you that. We've slammed plenty of companies that pay a lot  of money to advertise on our pages. It's just our attitude that we are whining at a lot of pictures.

End time: 4261.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4304.90
End time: 4323.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'll say this. TechCrunch does something that we don't do and that I see other sites do.  Giz does it, Business Insider, a few other people. And it's just something we don't do,  which I've never fully understood, which is this sort of guest writer thing.  And the syndication and guest writer, those are ones that I have a lot of trouble with.  Me too.  Just on a personal level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know how you vet the... I don't know how edited those are. I don't know how much  the people who are writing them are vetted. Maybe they're vetted really hard. So it's like  these guys are writing straight up from the heart and it's not something that is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I used to do something when I was the editor at InfoWorld years and years ago.  I used to pull this trick because our page count would vary so radically that the editors at the  end of the day or the copy editors and the people who are managing it would say,  we need 40 more pages. And I always had a bunch of stuff under my desk that was actually written  by vendors. And what I would do is I'd solicit a vendor like, let's say, a hard disc company,  Micropolis, let's say. They're out of business. And I'd say, I need an article on everything you  know about hard disc and why they were operating everything. I want all the technology. I need like  a 20 page or 15 page or five pages on a hard disc. And they would write these articles or the public  relations company would. And they'd be a bunch of promotions in there for Micropolis. We would have  the editors or I would take all the references to Micropolis, all of them, without exception,  out of the piece and then run it. And of course, then they would come in and they would complain.

Start time: 4417.32
End time: 4418.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4419.20
End time: 4445.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's not the way it works. Here's the trick for you editors. So we'd have... I usually have  a speakerphone. I bring a bunch of people in for one of these meetings to show them how it's done.  The person would come on and complain bitterly. We wrote all this and we spent all this money to  promote this thing. And you took all the references to our company out. And I would say,  oh, you know, this is we didn't mean to do it. If you give us another piece,  one more time, then we'll take, you know, we'll try it. This time we'll do it right.

Start time: 4445.42
End time: 4447.44

And even if you're like an experienced writer and you come on, we still go through this sort  of end gadget program. Like we have a, you know, certain ways you source things, certain ways you,  you know, places that you look when you're trying to investigate something,  ways that you describe certain things. And so I can't imagine just letting some person,  anybody write for end gadget that wasn't trained by the editors of end gadget.  Exactly.

Start time: 4504.60
End time: 4510.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  So it's, oh right. Well, that's what we train. That's the training is that we have a style,  you know, we have a guide, we've got, this is, you know, there's ways of doing it,  ways of not doing it. So everybody's supposed to be trained in that way.  The ideas, that's why they're all editors. I mean, I actually believe in the idea of  calling these people editors because they edit.  All your writers are editors?  That's interesting.  Everybody who writes is an editor because they can edit themselves and they can edit someone else.  And they do both of those things.

Start time: 4554.18

I'm in the process of looking for  freelancers and for columnists and I'm trying to find people who are good enough to where they  don't need a ton of editing.  That's not that easy.

Does this make sense?  I think everybody on our team, at least the input of everybody is really valuable.  So it's kind of a all... It's not editing by a committee, but once I've got something or  somebody else has something that's nearly finished or ready to go out, we all take a look at it and  sort of pick it apart a little bit.

They're late on streaming services.  They're late on syncing and backup and all that stuff in the cloud.  I think that it's not unrealistic at all to imagine a future where they offer a service like  RDO or Spotify or one of these things.  Well, they bought LaLa. That's exactly what LaLa did.  That's right. Well, and also they've introduced streaming with the Apple TV.  They've shown, hey, look, we can do streaming.  So they're headed somewhere with this.  They're changing their mobile me service in some way from the looks of things.  So I think that it's not crazy to imagine a future where Apple is giving you a couple of options.  They're saying you can buy records. You can get a streaming, this all the cart.  You have to remember when it comes to streaming, if Apple controls the pipes  and they control the software and they control the hardware,  music companies have nothing to fear.  I mean, really, this is Apple, right?  They've already started making them tons of money in music.  They've already lost.

This is facts that the largest music retailer in the world, they're selling tons of music.  If they decide that there is an option that's good for them and good for their bottom line  and maybe good for consumers as an aside, they'll probably go for it.  I think it's streaming stuff is definitely happening.  I think that's where this industry is headed.  There's no doubt that it's happening.

Transcript:  Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.  Hosting and software that is second to none.  In fact, their amazing Java virtual server technology means you will never get DDoS.  You will never go down because anytime they need more bandwidth,  it's the simplest thing in the world to throw it at any site.  It's a really remarkable system.  But don't have to worry about that because really this is a service that anybody can use  to create a website.  All you have to do right now is go to Squarespace.com slash twit.  Click that green button that says try it free.  This is how simple.  You don't need a credit card.  You don't even need to be an American citizen.  All you need is a site name, a password, an email address, a retinal scan, a fingerprint.  No, no.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is all you need.  The name of the site, the password, the email address.  They do a little capture to make sure you're not a robot.  And that's it.  Now for two weeks, you've got all of the features.  This isn't some limited feature.  This is everything.  And this is a great way to, let's say you have friends who should have a site because  everybody ought to have their own website, right?  But they just never got around to it.  Quickly go to Squarespace.com, set up a site, say here's your site.  You got it free for two weeks.  Check it out.  Alex Lindsay did this.  He was at a restaurant.  He said, how could you not have a website?  How could you be a business without a website?  And before he left the restaurant, before he'd finished lunch, he had a Squarespace site  and said here, it's yours.  Do whatever you want.  How could he do it that fast?  Well, just take a look.  First of all, 60 plus designer templates.  You don't have to get into the CSS.  You can, but you don't have to.  You just pick the template and it's really easy to make it unique with the sliders, the  color picker, content width, all Ajax.  Very simple to do.  You can add CSS and JavaScript if you want, but you don't need to.  Then you've got a unique site.  And if you look at the examples, you see that every Squarespace site looks different.  And I like that.  I don't want it to be a cookie cutter thing, but no, these templates are gorgeous and  totally customizable.  So whether you're a business, a restaurant, a photographer, an artist, you can get a site  that speaks for you.  Everybody ought to have their own website.  You can have a Facebook page, a Twitter account, but if you don't have your own website, you're  not controlling your name on the net.  You need to do that and you can do it right now for Squarespace for free.  Two weeks.  If you decide you want to buy as little as $12 a month, that's hosting and software,  everything you need, including all the bandwidth you'll need.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Try it today.

Transcript:  Here's what Twitter should do.  If they want to advertise, that's fine.  Give me an option to get the Twitter app for 99 cents that doesn't have the bar in it.  I'll pay 99 cents for that.  You can make a little money too.  You can finally find a revenue model.

Transcript:  Actually, what they did is kind of weird.  They took a guy who was doing an independent guy doing Tweety,  what I consider to be one of the best clients.  It was a great old version.  The non-Twitter version from my desktop and they bought it.  I think it's weird now that they're competing against  the people who were making clients like Seasmic and stuff.  It seems like one of the weirdest strategies to me ever  that they want to own not just the pipes, right?  They want to be the pipe, but they also want to be the front end as well.  For a company the size of Twitter and doing what they do,  I think it's sort of a dangerous play because you lose a lot of…  I mean, if you start to kind of eliminate the people who are supporting your product,  I think it could be somewhat hazardous.

He says, no one else, not even Oprah or Obama or Bieber,  has gotten so many Twitter followers so quickly.  I talked with one of the guys involved.  Barry Schuler told me his partner, Brad Wyman,  is the one who convinced Sheen to tweet.  That's Adley, right?  AD.LY.  And convinced him to break all the rules and get rid of the press and PR,  directly to his fans, which is probably the right thing to do.

Start time: 5994.52
End time: 6037.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  He'd not-  Right. The thesis is that YouTube, by focusing on big content companies and not offering its  streams as Ustream does to normal people or to anybody who comes in off the street,  is missing the boat.  It says Ustream, who should be counting their lucky stars,  because the competition's ready.  Amazon's going to go do live streaming and jump in and complete with Netflix.  Netflix can do it, obviously, but he says Google should be, he said this is one huge lever Google  has, this is actually, I'd agree with this, to get us interested in owning a Google TV box,  which they've not been able to sell.  No.  And getting us onto Android.

We started streaming and it took off so fast that we had to stop because it was starting to  cost real money. And Roku is actually, I think, going to be for us very important  as a video content creator, even though we're not a big player.  I think it's good for everybody, frankly.  Yeah.
