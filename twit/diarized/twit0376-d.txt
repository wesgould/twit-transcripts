Transcript:  Okay, so big story. I don't know where to begin.  Apple sent out invitations this week. Tuesday.  Apple's going to have yet another event.  We don't know what it is, but we believe, of course, it's the iPad Mini.  The Nexus 7.

Start time: 356.04
End time: 360.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, 7.85.  Oh, okay.  Slightly bigger.  Ah, showing off.

Start time: 362.96
End time: 380.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The rumors will be that it's basically an iPad 2, 1024 by 768 in a smaller case.  Dwight, you got any leads on this? Anything you know about it?  This is all rumor at this point, but I think that everybody seems to agree.

Start time: 380.38
End time: 439.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all rumor. It's all vapor. I think they have to get into the space.  What's interesting is more than the specs.  I mean, everybody expects it to be a smaller, less powerful iPad,  but I think what's most interesting is the pricing.  John Gruber had an interesting discussion this week on Daring Fireball  about the idea of whether or not it matters if you take this smaller iPad  and price it anywhere near the new iPod Touch that's come out,  because, well, it starts at $299, I think.  And there's been some discussion about the iPad Mini being at $249,  and today's rumor from 9 to 5 Mac is $329.  I think Apple has to price it at $249 in order to be competitive  with the Android tablets and the Nexus 7 that have come out.  I don't think they can price it at $329 and expect to have a lot of sales.  But I may be wrong. It's Apple. People pay that.

Start time: 440.63
End time: 440.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $329 too high, John?

Start time: 442.20
End time: 453.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so, but if it has some specifically great feature  that takes it out of the fray, I think it would be fine.  What kind of thing would it be?  Well, that's it. I don't think there is one.

Start time: 454.34
End time: 484.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say this is going to be an education iPad,  that they're going to really focus on iBook Author, iBook 3.  But I presume that the $329 iPad will be 8 gigs,  which is enough for one textbook.  These books are huge. They're 4 or 5 gigs each.  So it's not going to be the one.  Not only is that price too high, nobody's going to buy that one.  You're going to have to buy the 16.  Actually, the rumor is it will be an 8, 32, 64.  There will be no 16.  8, 32, 64.

Start time: 486.10
End time: 523.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if you end up having this at too high of a price,  you've got Amazon coming in with its new tablets, which are very nice.  I think the obvious trajectory for pricing is $250 and below  for these 7-inch tablets.  I don't see how Apple could do it like that.  Unless it's incredibly thin, as thin as the iPod Touch,  that would be really interesting if they did it something  that was just so remarkably thin that that was the big draw,  that it was very sexy, easy to handle.

Start time: 524.00
End time: 525.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry, I know you're an iPad user. I know you love the iPad.

Start time: 528.00
End time: 542.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, for what it's worth, it's very good.  Of course, I've got the old one with no camera.  I was about to buy a new one,  and now I guess I'll wait to see what this looks like,  but I think I'll get the latest full iPad.

Start time: 543.40
End time: 554.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat room a couple of days ago suggested  what that killer feature might be,  and maybe, John and Jerry, this will resonate with you.  What if they put a really good camera in it?  What if it had an excellent camera in it?  That would do it, I think.

Start time: 556.14
End time: 556.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wouldn't do it for me,

Start time: 557.06
End time: 569.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because I think walking around with a big clunker like that...  But it's not a big clunker.  Oh, you're talking about the little one.  Yeah, still.  Get a camera. There's real things.  And these phones are fine.  They don't get in the way.  Now we're holding some big clunker.  No, but it's not that big. It's smaller.

Start time: 571.06
End time: 572.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I now use the iPhone as a camera.

Start time: 575.02
End time: 575.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, so do I.

Start time: 576.38
End time: 577.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I carried cameras for years.

Start time: 579.81
End time: 593.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In addition to my phone, I had a camera.  It had a good pocket Kodak,  you know, 10-10 to 1 mechanical zooms and things.  I now find the iPhone 4 is as good a camera as I need.

Start time: 600.27
End time: 637.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My friend Hans Peter Braunbaugh, who works for Nokia,  is teaching a class and giving lectures  on a new form of photography,  which is focused on the software.  And the Leitro might be an example of this,  where it's no longer the physical lens and the physical pickup.  It's what you do with it after the fact.  And what better than to take a fairly powerful piece of computer,  an iPad Mini, and put a decent camera on there?  I want it to be more powerful than with the phone.  I mean, the phones are pretty powerful.  Well, no, you're right.  It's in fact not any more powerful, if the rumors are.  It's just an iPad 2. It's an A6.

Start time: 638.34
End time: 644.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is more convenient. It goes in the pockets.  You know, you're not going to carry a phone and a thing.  But I'll tell you why I like the iPad.

Start time: 645.10
End time: 652.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I even shoot pictures with the iPad.  It's great for video or pictures because you're seeing a big screen.  You're seeing what the picture looks like.

Start time: 652.00
End time: 659.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even though you look like a total nerd dwarf.  You look like a doofus.  But at least, yeah, you're right. I agree with that.  It looks pretty cool.  There's something to be said for that.

Start time: 659.46
End time: 668.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what if you had really powerful software on the other end,  and now it's a computer camera.  It's a digital photography.  Is that compelling to you?

Start time: 669.47
End time: 680.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. What if you bundled it with, say, the iPhone 5 camera?  What if the iPhone 5 camera is just great?  8 megapixels. Great camera.  And then you say you put, as a gimme on this, iPhoto.

Start time: 682.47
End time: 697.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the $5 iPhoto.  Yeah. I'm trying to think of what might be, John, that killer feature.  And I think that's a good one.  I'll give you an example.  I went to see Madonna on Thursday.  What?  What?  The Material Girl. Like a virgin.

Start time: 698.02
End time: 705.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you go out to dinner with her?  No, no, I went to a concert in Denver.  You went to Denver?  I went to Denver.  This is decadent.

Start time: 706.00
End time: 727.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do not allow you to...  I know, I got the weirdest email, which I'll share with you later.  From Madonna?  No, from somebody who said, how decadent.  But they don't let you bring a nice camera in there.  So I only had an iPhone. In fact, that's all anybody had.  But I was able to get decent pictures.  Even, I mean, this is not an ideal...  I'm looking at it now.  Is that what you call a decent picture?  Or that?

Start time: 728.08
End time: 729.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not perfect.  Or that?

Start time: 730.00
End time: 753.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have loved to have a DSLR.  Look at where your seats are.  You're in the third row.  That's what I said. I had dinner with Madonna.  So, but see, everybody's got cameras.  And by the way, one of the most...  I mean, camera phones.  One of the most annoying things.  This guy right in front of me, the whole show, he's like,  I gotta have a video of this show.  He's holding up his phone the whole time.  That's annoying.  I was hitting him in the head.  It's very annoying.  So, Leo...  Didn't seem to help.

Start time: 754.12
End time: 755.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He obviously didn't hit him hard enough.

Start time: 756.06
End time: 756.73

Transcript:  Apparently not.

Start time: 757.04
End time: 791.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Leo, David Byrne played here in Houston last week.  And one of the things that he did during...  before the show, he came over to the PA and he said,  you know, you can take pictures, you can take video,  you can do whatever you want during the show,  which was pretty cool, I thought.  But then he said, but please don't use an iPad  to take pictures or video because...  Yes, yes.  ...in a concert setting, you have this big block in front of you,  you know, so people can't see behind you.  And he specifically said,  be thoughtful of the people behind you.  Don't use an iPad.  Look at this picture.  There's one, two, three, four camera phones in this picture

Start time: 794.06
End time: 799.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 835.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they have good security.  No, it was really...  No, they can't stop a flying phone.  By the way, I gotta tell you,  the technology in concerts now...  I don't know if you've noticed this, Dwight.  I don't think these guys go to concerts now.  I went to that brick thing, the wall, whatever it was.  The wall!  You went to the wall.  The projectors, the CGI, the lights, this is huge advances now.  These things are amazing.  You go to an installation like Cirque du Soleil in Vegas  where they're there permanently.  Have you seen love in Vegas?  Unbelievable.  Yeah, there's a lot of love on the street,  especially when it's not at Las Vegas Boulevard.  They all look like Elvis.

Start time: 840.51

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's nuts.  I agree.  I have to say, I'm impressed that David Byrne said no iPads  because I totally agree with him.

Start time: 846.02
End time: 856.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's such a bright, big light.  That's the last thing you want to say.  Yeah, but could you bring in a Panasonic real...  It would be less annoying.  Yeah, I would think so.

Start time: 857.04
End time: 864.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'd get better pictures.  And how does that hurt in any way?  It's promotional.  But I understand artists these days are not as good as artists.

Start time: 864.04
End time: 872.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not as good as artists.  They're not as good as artists.  I agree.  I understand artists these days are very nervous.  I'll tell you what makes me upset.  They can put a gun in one of those real cameras.

End time: 927.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is the show any good?  Yeah, it's a great show.  It better be.  You know, it was very controversial because it's in Denver, right?

Start time: 928.30
End time: 958.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, the Aurora shooting is nearby.  And there's a whole segment of the show where she is shooting people right and left.  In fact, she first appears on the show with a machine gun.  There's a lot of gun stuff in the show.  She's a gun nut.  And it was very controversial.  I don't know how you take that out of the show because it's, you know,  this show is very...  Broomsticks.  Yeah, broomsticks.  Anyway, let's ask the questions John Gruber asked.  Of the new iPad.  First of all, Ken, how can the new iPad not have a Retina display?  How can it?

Start time: 959.00
End time: 962.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How can it not have?  The rumor is, of course, that it does have a 1024 by 768.

Start time: 965.36
End time: 975.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, you know, Google is having an announcement on the 29th in which the rumor is  they will announce a very high res 300 plus DPI 10 inch tablet.

Start time: 976.00
End time: 978.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Samsung tablet.  Yeah.

Start time: 979.90
End time: 1002.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Running the new key lime pie version of Android 4.2.  So I thought it was kind of interesting.  So Apple's got their announcement on Tuesday.  Microsoft has the Windows 8 launch party on Thursday and the pop-up stores open Friday.  The Windows...  I've got my Windows RT tablet will arrive Friday.  They sold those out, by the way.

Start time: 1003.00
End time: 1029.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They sold them out.  But a lot of people think because they're getting a Windows tablet that they'll be able  to run their Windows applications on it.  I don't think the message about Windows RT being not able to run legacy Windows apps,  except for the ones that are pre-installed on it, is getting through to people.  I think you're going to have a lot of people who are really upset when they get it and  can't put their favorite Windows apps there.

Start time: 1029.30
End time: 1051.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's done something very interesting.  In fact, if you look at the ads, they've got Windows 8 phones, Windows RT tablets,  and Windows 8 desktops all with the same Metro start page.  And the implication is it's the same operating system across the board.  And I think you're right.  I think people are going to be very upset when they get a Windows Phone 8 and it doesn't  run anything but Windows Phone software.  RT tablet, which only runs RT software.

Start time: 1052.78
End time: 1067.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People were leaving comments in my blog about how excited they were to get hold of the Surface.  They had already ordered it.  And they were looking forward to being able to use a Windows tablet.  And it was very clear that they didn't understand what they were getting.

Start time: 1067.08
End time: 1071.88

Transcript:  And that's the only one that interests me, actually.  You know, remember the old Windows tablets, the one that...  Horrible.  I loved mine.  Yeah, because they designed the handwriting recognition with your handwriting.  Of course, yes.  Of course you loved it.  It was the most useful thing I ever had.  I still got it right over back over there.  But the problem is, it's pretty old now.

Transcript:  In fact, I was kind of...  I bought this tablet because I was sitting next to a salesman on a plane,  and he showed me how he used the touch interface with PowerPoint to do presentations,  and he could annotate, and it kind of wowed me.  Yeah.  But then I got it home, and it's kind of...  I think it really is better to not have touch added to an existing operating system  but designed from the ground up.  I think that's really why Windows 8 is going to be important,  whether it succeeds is another matter,  but at least it's touched from the ground up, right?  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, it's actually a phone I.O. moved up one notch and then moved up another notch.  It's ridiculous.  I mean, Microsoft is like schizoid.  They started off in the olden days.  They would take a desktop, and then they'd shrink it and shrink it  until they had the Windows for phone, the original one,  was actually Windows on the phone with a stylus,  and there was like a little version of Windows.  And now they've said, well, that didn't work,  so let's go the other way and design a phone operating system  and try to put it on a desktop.  I mean, I don't understand why there has to be the same interface for every type of device.  It doesn't take a genius to use an iPad and a Windows 7 for one minute  and go to the other in the next minute.  You don't have to have everything so it's exactly the same  because you're an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that is happening here is Microsoft is trying to do with this  what it wanted to do with Windows CE long ago  and Windows Mobile where it looked like Windows.  And so they're saying, oh, instead of starting with the desktop Windows  and making a miniature version of it for these devices,  let's start with what worked on touch and move it over to the desktop.  And in addition, there's a little bit of Apple copying going on,  although not in the interface but in the concept,  that if you keep it simple and make hard choices about what you don't have,  you'll come up with a better operating system.  The problem is with Windows 8 is that they have grafted these two ideas together.  And I think for people who buy like a tablet,  like if you buy one of these little Samsung tablets  or you buy a Windows RT tablet or the Surface tablet,  I think you'll have a pretty good experience.  It's the people who go, who buy a traditional desktop  or who buy a traditional notebook computer with this on it  that are going to be really frustrated  because jumping back and forth remains fairly jarring.

Transcript:  Also, there was a study done by the Nielsen Norman Group.  They do usability testing.  And they noted that normal users who are not like us, kind of inquisitive,  when faced with Windows 8 just were kind of baffled  because they weren't willing to kind of click around.  They try, you know, because you get the charms by moving the mouse  in the lower right-hand corner.  Then you get charms.  Then you have to do this to shut the machine down.  You have to get the charms bar to shut up, to start to click the gear.  I mean, it's four steps to turn the machine off.  I actually think.  And people, yes, if you knew that it's Windows key C,  it could do it much faster and so forth.  But people don't know that. They don't read the instructions.  And so the lack of discoverability Nielsen Norman found,  they thought that was going to be a problem with kind of non-sophisticated users.  Did you run some instructions?

Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to do it.  They decided to do it.  And so today I was playing around with it,  and I was playing with it on an older machine I have that has a 19 inch monitor.  And I was trying to make it snap with two, you know, you can put two Metro.  Well, it turns out, and I didn't know this until I saw the movie in the help files,  that you can't snap two Metro apps on the same screen  if it's lower than a certain resolution.  It has to be 1300.  So I couldn't do it on my 19 inch monitor.  And you thought there was something wrong with you?  I thought, well, I thought, oh, yeah, well, you know, why can't I make this work?  And I've done it on the tablet, but I couldn't make it work on this.  But there's no indication you're not told in any way unless you go looking in the help files  and who looks in the help files, right?

So if you want to read it, duringfireball.net, John Gruber's really become an Apple apologist.  So he poses all of the negative questions like how could Apple possibly charge $329?  And he answers that, you know, well, let me explain why.  He almost says why we're doing this.  By the way, the name is a big question.  There's no way they're calling an iPad mini.  No, sounds like a female hygiene product.  I wouldn't think so.  So what do they call it?  He guesses iPad Air.

So go to meeting.com.  Let me tell you a little bit about GoToMeeting.com, then I'll tell you who wins the iPad.  So this is an online meeting service.  We've talked about it before.  It's the number one, I think, online meeting service where you share the screen.  It's very efficient.  The folks who do this, Citrix, invented Remote Desktop.  They know how to do efficient screen sharing.  But now they've added something that makes it super compelling.  They've added video.  So now you can actually see the people you're meeting with.  GoToMeeting has always been the go-to choice when you can't get together for a face-to-face meeting.  Now I don't even know why you'd bother because you're seeing your clients or colleagues.  You're working together.  You're collaborating.  And you can start a meeting on a Mac or a PC, but you can attend meetings on an iPad, an iPhone, an Android tablet.  If you have an iPad, oh, is this sweet.  It will use the camera on the iPad.  In fact, this would be so good with a new iPad.  It uses the camera on the iPad, uses the headphones and the microphone.  You could be out in the garden.  You could be at a hotel.  You could be at an airport.  You could be anywhere and attending a meeting just that easy.  You could share content from ShareFile or Dropbox on the iPad.  I mean, this Illustrate, Highlight, Whiteboard, this is just a fantastic product.  I want you to try GoToMeeting right now.  A 30-day free trial awaits you, including the HD faces, the screen sharing, NAT traversals so you don't have to punch a hole in the firewall.  It's literally the most secure way to do this.  All you got to do is visit gotomeeting.com, click the Try It Free button, and use our offer code TWIT.  Now, you may remember for the last couple of weeks, we've been asking people to tweet where in the world you would want to use GoToMeeting from, who you'd want to meet with and why, using your GoToMeeting on the iPad.  And we took everybody, and we asked you to use the hashtag, remember, TWITFreeiPad.  We took everybody who used that hashtag, and we made a random drawing from all, and we got hundreds of tweets.  The winner is Kokolikius.  Brent, he says, I would use GoToMeeting on an iPad to consult with my research imaging customers while at the lounge in a ski resort.  That sounds good.  Kokolikius is his name, his Twitter handle. Brent, congratulations.  We're going to contact you.  We're going to ask you if you want the iPad autographed, so we will autograph it for you.  I could even get Dvorak to autograph it for you.  I know him.  Holy cow.  Go to meeting.com, click the Try It Free button, use the promo code TWIT.  And congratulations to Brent.  Kokolikius, our winner of that free iPad.  Sorry if you didn't win, folks, and I know most of you didn't because only one of you got to.  OMG, it's Crown Royal, a giant bottle.  There you go.

They'll probably get rid of the Firewire port.  Thunderbolt and USB 3 will be across the board.  And I think the most significant of the announcements will be a Retina MacBook Pro 13-inch to go with the 15-inch Retina, which, by the way, is a great computer, I recommend.  It is.  I really like it.  There will not be a Mac Pro.  Nobody's saying the word Mac Pro.  And that's weird because we need one.  There hasn't been a new one in ages.

Very nice Nexus phone.  It's a quad core 1.5 gigahertz.  The rumor is it'll run 4.2 the next Android, which we think is going to be called KeyLine  Pi.  Actually, in fact, they're going to call it Jelly Bean, but just the next Jelly Bean.  Jelly Bean 2.  Jelly Bean 2, I don't know.  It'll have a 4.7 inch, 1280 by 768 display.  That's a nice I-Res display.  Two gigs of RAM, 16 gig storage, eight megapixel rear, 1.3 megapixel front camera, and a 2100  milliamp battery, which is not a very high power battery.  The more interesting device will be the Samsung 10 inch tablet, which we mentioned earlier,  rumored to have 2560 by 1600 pixels on 10 inches.  That'd be nice.  300 pixels per inch.

No, actually, I have found that using the maps just like day to day, just like to find  places around town, for the most part, they get me where I want to go.  At one point, it took me to a location of a car dealership in Houston that had closed  20 years ago, but otherwise I've had pretty good luck with it.

But the fact is the unions are going to keep trying to hold on to the certification process  because nowadays what's expensive is not an education.  You can get that online for free.  It's getting a certificate that says you have the education that costs you the money.  And that puts you about $30,000 in debt.  Now the notion that you have a middle class, every one of whom starts off with an enormous  lifetime debt is not something that condoms.  I mean that used to be known as being a bondsman and was not considered a very good idea back  in the days of Republican theory.  And I mean Republican in the sense of the old Republic.  Lowercase R.  Yeah.  Not a party.  It's certification that costs money and there will come up a way of giving certification  without costing $30,000.

You know, especially if you use your printer, your computer, you print the mailing label,  you print the stamps, you can even print on the envelope.  In fact, if you use, if you're an Amazon seller, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, if you use QuickBooks,  it'll take it from your address book.  It'll take the address.  It'll take it from the website.  It'll put the stamp on there, put your logo on there, the whole thing.  This is kind of the 21st century post office.  You never have to go to the post office again, not just to buy stamps, but, but literally  any package you mail of any size, the mail carrier will come and pick it up.  You can schedule free pickups or just use as regular rounds.  You get discounts you don't get at the post office up to 21% on express mail, 15% on priority  mail.  If you do international mailing, you know what a pain that is to go to the post office.  You get the special international postage, fill out the forms.  Stamps.com does that all.  You do not go to the post office again.  I just, I am a big fan.  We use it here.  In fact, we, we love the free USB scale.  So we ended up getting two accounts.  Here's the deal.

Thank you, Tony Wang.  And of all, you get $110 bonus, $55 in free postage, a free digital scale.  You just pay shipping and handling, which is five bucks.  You then get a $5 supply kit to make up for that and a four week trial at stamps.com.  This is a great deal.  That USB scale really makes it perfect.  You always exactly the right postage.  You never have to guess stamps.com.  Please do me a favor and do yourself a favor.  Try it free right now, especially if you do a lot of mailing, if you're eBay or Amazon  or a PayPal seller, Etsy.  It does it all automatically.  Stamps.com.  It's terrifying and sickening.  This actually came from Slate.  Ryan Gallagher on Slate.  Let me go to Slate and show you this article.  And I'd like to know, maybe Dwight, if you understand this, new surveillance laws being  proposed in the US and other countries like Australia would force makers of online chat  software to build in back doors for wiretapping because law enforcement doesn't like it that  you can use Skype and similar programs to make phone calls that they can't wiretap.  Skype has historically been a major barrier to law enforcement.  Police in Germany complained in 2007 they couldn't spy on Skype calls.  Recently, however, hackers have alleged Skype has made a change to its architecture.  For lawful interception of calls, Skype said a comment to extreme tech saying no, the  restructure was an upgrade and nothing to do with surveillance.  But Mr. Gallagher says when I repeatedly questioned the company on Wednesday, whether it could  currently facilitate wiretap requests, a clear answer was not forthcoming and non-denial  denial, citing company's policy.

So I guess what we're just presuming that Microsoft, I don't, it's not  that Microsoft's listening in, it's that Microsoft, if they were subpoenaed  would hand the keys over to law enforcement.

Transcript:  Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle, John C.  Dvorak from channel Dvorak and the no agenda show, Jerry pornell from chaos  manner and a Jerry pornell.com.  We're going to continue with Twitter a bit, but first, since we do have a  new device, we believe coming from Apple, I'm going to give you the standard  disclaimer, it's time to get a bid for your old iPad just in case this is not  a commitment just in case you want to sell it and get the new one at gazelle.  Gazelle is great because they give you 30 day quotes.  The quote is guaranteed good for the next 30 days.  And I could promise you when the new iPad comes out, that old iPad becomes  much less valuable right out of the box.  You might as well get the quote now.  That's nice too, because what you could do is wait and see if you like what  Apple is talking about, you can order it, you can get it, you could transfer the  data, you have 30 days to do all of that and then send your iPad in or whatever  device you're selling to gazelle.  And by the way, gazelle is great.  They will give you a check.  They will give you a PayPal.  This is a 32 gig, 300 bucks for my 32 gig, uh, wifi plus 3g iPad too.  That's, that's going to get me real close to the new iPad.  If those numbers are right, you want the iPhone five, no problem.  Let's take your iPhone 4s, AT&T.  Let's I got a 64 giga in good shape.  215 bucks.  Now you throw that in the box.  Anything worth more than a buck.  Gazelle will pay the postage.  Oh, and by the way, they even take broken iPhones.  So if the glass is cracked or even if it just doesn't work, they will take it.  1 million gadgets now have been traded at gazelle.  They have paid over $50 million, almost $50 million to over 300,000 customers.  They will send you a check.  They will send you PayPal or if you get an Amazon gift card, and I kind of like  that, uh, you'll get a 5% bonus on the amount they quoted you.  I guess they're rebating the Amazon, uh, affiliate fee, probably G A Z E L L E.  Look, just, just proactively go to gazelle and get an offer for your stuff.  Cause I could tell you one thing, no matter what it is, whether it's a  galaxy S three, a galaxy note, an iPad is not getting more valuable.  They, they take Blackberrys too.  Just I'm curious what a Blackberry is worth.  These days can't be very much.

And they, um, uh, and what I really liked was that you don't have to send back  the charger or the cable or anything.  You just put the phone in there.  Well, you can, if you have it though.  Right.  Well, you, you can send it back if you want, but you know, you can have  another charger and they don't, they don't dock you for it.  Oh, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They, he does showstoppers.  Yeah.  Well, he was telling me that at one point in Comic-Con just a week ago, uh, the  only telephone connectivity anybody had from the Javits from the Javits center  was, um, LTE from iPhone fives.  They, there was no fours.  Nobody was getting through on anything else.  Uh, just plain iPhone five LTE was getting connectivity and nobody else was.

Actually, this is quite good.  Good.  So my wife joined a family plan with Verizon.  We got a bunch of phones and what couple of phones crapped out.  They wouldn't replace them.  The amount that they bill them every month is totally different and not what was promised.  My wife is actually going to pay the $500 to get out of the contract.  The early termination fee.  She's willing to pay that because of the scam pricing and that, that Verizon does.  I would never subscribe to anything for her.  She wants to go on back to T-Mobile because they got her some pretty good deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no.  No, it's a T-Mobile is what we're going to because we can't afford it.  Really?  Yeah.  Because it's just everything.  Cause well, everyone knows about the AT&T bogative pricing, but the  Verizon is worse apparently.  She's an architect.

Start time: 4531.94
End time: 4566.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that thing for what?  Corrosive.  I want to talk about AT&T, but AT&T has at least allows you if you're  unlimited and you get an LTE phone, you can keep your unlimited plan.  Yeah, they'll throttle you at five, but you could get, keep your unlimited plan.  Verizon won't let you do that.  And AT&T has it done away with its regular tiered plans.  If that's what you prefer, if you don't want to do the shared data.  So I looking at kind of the way AT&T has things structured, I think they actually  are being more fair to their customers than Verizon is.  Although Verizon does have a great network.

Start time: 4567.34
End time: 4582.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Sprint's the last one with unlimited data, right?  Yeah, but it's really, I mean, it's crappy.  So who cares?  I'm disappointed to hear that the 4G is not good.  We're getting Sprint 4G too.  Is it new?  Has it been rolled out or maybe you're just using the pre-released?

Start time: 4583.46
End time: 4589.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's rolled out.  They rolled out.  Houston was one of the cities where they rolled it out on day one.  Why is it bad?

Start time: 4589.48
End time: 4593.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the same thing with ClearWire, their earlier 4G, the WiMAX was terrible.

Start time: 4594.60
End time: 4630.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's spotty in that you can be on one tower that has it.  I mean, downtown Houston is a good example.  You can be on one tower that has it.  You walk a couple of blocks and it's gone or it has dropped dramatically in speed.  You know, the way Verizon and AT&T rolled it out is they got it in most of the center of the town,  most of the center of the large cities, and then they made sure it was working right.  And they lit it up.  But the impression I get from Sprint is that they rushed it and they're getting it up because they're so far behind.  They're just getting something up, anything up, and then they're tuning as they go.

Transcript:  You know, I'm thrilled because what we don't want is what we almost had with AT&T acquiring T-Mobile.  And Sprint would have then gone away and we'd have two phone companies, both of whom are not great.  At least we have some competition.  And you know, these younger, more nimble companies like Boost, they're kind of interesting.

End time: 4748.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if he's getting campaign contributions from them, because I know they're  I would think not.  A ton of money going in there.  Now, Jerry, you brought up two good stories.  Let's start with Huawei, which is the Chinese.  And apparently this Chinese phone company, Chinese electronics company, has ties to the Chinese military.  And a commission that had been studying this for a few months from the Department of Commerce, I think was  Department of Commerce, the U.S.  government anyway, said no Huawei phones for anybody in government.  We could tell you that right now.  But it seemed that they were more concerned about industrial espionage than military espionage.  They were worried about intellectual property being stolen by people using Huawei phones.

Start time: 4749.38
End time: 4754.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't just the phones.  It was mostly the switches, switches and also the 4G network.  Right.

Start time: 4754.80
End time: 4771.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there was there was nothing in any of those things where there was any hard evidence.  It was all there.  They are in ties with the Chinese military.  They have these components in critical infrastructure and X could happen.  But there was no evidence that X had happened.

Start time: 4771.24
End time: 4787.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. But when you listen to the C-SPAN had some of these hearings and when you listen to this stuff, it was  apparent that what they were accusing Huawei of doing was what we can already do.  I mean, you could just tell that they were projecting.  I don't know that we are doing that.

Start time: 4787.48
End time: 4789.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do this so we assume the Chinese are doing it.

Start time: 4789.80
End time: 4805.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I would assume so, too.  And then they did have some hard evidence about some stuff some years ago, not in the United States.  But there was it was just they just don't want switching gear from China.  I guess that makes sense.  In this country.  This was, by the way, a correction.  It is a national security issue.

Start time: 4805.38
End time: 4817.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the House Intelligence Committee.  And that makes more sense.  And they were they were concerned also about ZTE, which is another Chinese company.

Start time: 4818.68
End time: 4831.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, ZTE has actually tried to.  I've never heard of them before these hearings, but they're apparently trying to worm their way out of this  and trying to get into the good graces of the intelligence committee.  Huawei, I don't think has a prayer.

Start time: 4832.00
End time: 4847.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The report says China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for  malicious purposes based on available classified and unclassified information.  Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States.

Start time: 4849.24
End time: 4878.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and the head of Huawei is a secretive guy.  Used to be in the government, used to be in the military, never does interviews.  It's just a bad situation.  That there's that.  Isn't every single phone we use made in China?  That's the irony.  Somebody said, what about the iPhone is made in China?  Everything's made in China.  I mean, I think this is more about the 4G networks and the people that we apparently can trust Ericsson more than we can trust the Chinese.  We're freaked out about it.  So that doesn't bother me.

Start time: 4878.80
End time: 4906.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you presume that the Chinese government are influencing Chinese companies, you might as well presume they're influencing Foxconn and everybody else.  Pegatron is making these all the gear you see in front of you today is made in China.  Now, I presume if there were a listening device in there.  Hello.  Somebody.  Hello.  Somebody.  Hi, listening device.  No, somebody would have noticed.  It could have been reverse engineered quickly.  Yeah, somebody would have noticed.  But why not in the switches?  I mean, can't we tell if it's phoning home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

The Cisco main networking chips are pretty much designed by Cisco, and I don't think that they're and they have the tape outs.  I don't think that the Chinese are throwing back doors into Cisco products.

And they sold it for a dollar.  The interesting story is that Sidney Harmon, who bought them in 2010 for a dollar.  Well, it's more complicated than that.  A dollar, and he assumed $47 million in debt.

I'm curious, I wonder how healthy time in and of itself is.  Not necessarily the company, but is time in the same position that Newsweek was?  They have to be.  I think that going digital is probably the way, the headline on it was right.  You know, it does liberate them.  It allows them to kind of do what they want to do.  Yeah.

It started as a website and it later became an app.  A free website he charged for the app.  And he has a blog that's extremely popular among a certain small group of mostly Mac fans.  It's marco.org.  Marco.org.  He talks about technology, coffee, and Instapaper.  He decided to take articles from his blog and others and make something called The Magazine.  It's an iOS app.  Very simple.  It's not glossy or glitzy.  It's pretty much like Instapaper.  It's clean text.  I think it's four articles twice a month.  Something like that.

And I tell them, the people you got to watch out for is your internet service provider.  They don't need tracking cookies.  They can see everywhere you go, one right after the other.  And Verizon's taking advantage of the fact that when you're on a smartphone,  you're there, you're an internet service provider.  This is true of Comcast, Verizon, AT&T.  They can all do this.  They call it precision market insights.  Verizon says it's legal because we're not revealing anybody's identity.  It's aggregate.  No.  It's data and aggregate.  That's fine.  Also, you can opt out at any time.  Now, we mentioned this before and I encourage you to visit their opt out site.  What is it?  Verizon.com slash MyPrivacy.  Yeah, it's vzw.com slash MyPrivacy.  Right.  And you can opt out.  You should opt out.  There's my phone numbers.  You might just want to cover that up.  Oh, I don't care.  Call me.  I love hearing from you in the middle of the night.

I think what they should call this instead of tracking cookies is add customization cookies.  Because if that's how they're using it, the problem is we don't know that that's the only  way they're using it.  If they're just saying, look, we're going to see what websites you go to, what you like to do,  and we'll give you ads that are more targeted at your interests, I think that's fine.

In fact, the Patriot Act tells the grocery store, the movie store, the library,  they can't reveal to the customer they're even watching this material or giving it to the feds.  What if your insurance company buys information on how often you visit Dunkin' Donuts?

Transcript:  Well, one of the real problems with privacy has got nothing to do with the individuals  because all we all know that we don't do anything wrong is that if they get the goods...  Imagine this, they get the goods on some senator who is a good guy and he's...  Al Franken, for instance.  But let's say he's having an affair and they could figure it out and then they get...  They're essentially going to blackmail the guy to make him vote a certain way,  which is not in the public interest.  And so the guy votes that way and they shut up about it and all of a sudden this guy is  voting in some way that's not in the public interest.  And you do that with one guy, two guys, three guys, you do it with everybody.  I mean, this kind of thing is just basic corruption at the base level, literally,  that cannot be tolerated.  That's why you have to have protections so you don't have this sort of thing.  So it makes it so easy for them.  Especially Verizon, which has...  John, that's been going on a long time.  Yeah, but at least...  Why make it easier?  That's the question on my mind.

Start time: 7046.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not convinced it's making it easier.  Look, back in the 60s when I was running political campaigns,  I got paranoid about one of the offices we had and I had some old friends of mine from  another life come in and sweep the place.  And they then only found about five modern phones.  They found old carbon mics that had been put in there because  this room had been given traditionally to political offices by the real estate company  that owned it.  And everybody in the world had bugged that place.  And I knew that and I know all my staff knew that.  So if I wanted to have a private conference, we'd go outside and flip a coin as to which  direction to go in and find a restaurant, for heaven's sake.

The hardest thing to do is to pick the book you want, but you're going to get to, if you  go to audible.com slash twit to now, let me show you the other free book, which anybody  can get.

It all works audible.com slash Sanderson for that free book Legion.  And then audible.com slash twit two for your platinum account.  We thank audible for their support for many years.  So what is the answer?  I don't, I think that's a tough question.  Why can't iPhones and iPads be manufactured in the U S the, the, uh, the story you've got,

Start time: 7696.32
End time: 7775.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh, goes into the idea of, you know, these, that China has basically built its entire  economy around, uh, these low cost assembly jobs.  And that a lot of the items that are made that the iPhone is comprised of, like processors  and the gorilla glass are actually are made in the U S there was another story.  And I can't remember where I, where I saw this, but they talked about the idea of one  of the reasons that Apple and other companies use, uh, Foxconn, uh, is that they are, have  so many people in one place building these things and they're very agile.  They can switch things quickly because of the heart, large numbers.  I think at the main Foxconn plant, there's like a million people working and that, and  that there are only right.  And that there are only 83 cities in the U S where there's more than 230,000 people in one.  And that's just one city.  So the structure of the Chinese economy and the way people live there is built for this.  And, you know, Obama said at the end of his thing, he said that, you know, a lot of low  wage jobs aren't coming back.  We want, we need research and, and more technical jobs here.  And that's probably the right answer.  He didn't go into as much detail as this is, but, um, you know, essentially you don't want  those jobs back here because they are very low.

Transcript:  It did bring up in this article, which is from all things D, a really interesting paper done  by professors at UC, university of California and Syracuse university, in which they point  out that Chinese workers add about $10 of value to the iPhone, essentially the assembly alone.  American workers add $162 worth of value, things like that gorilla glass and so forth,  because, uh, and, and this is kind of underscores what we were talking about earlier,  uh, Jerry, high tech advanced manufacturing jobs for highly skilled workers.  That's what we do best.  And then the mass numbers required to just assemble those parts.  That's what they do best, uh, lower educated, less expensive workers.  And so that may point to an answer to your question earlier.  What should, or my question earlier, what should Americans be looking for in the future?  And it's those high tech advanced manufacturing.

The pay was 10 X.  Okay. You got the lots of money.  I was a UAW union member and I worked at Ford, talking about Ford.  Hey, good job.  It was a good job in the summer.  And I also worked at Trail Mobile and I was an inspector then.  I learned people skills other than, would you like fries with that?  And it was paid well.

So you'd find these.  In fact, I just saw, in fact, they took a picture of it.  I'll post it on the blog.  I'm coming into Petal Loom.  There's a corner there.

Now I sound a little bit old fashioned,  but I'm more along the lines of the way it was before the tax system was brought into this country  in the early 1900s when most of the government taxes were paid for by tariffs of imported goods.  All for tariffs.  I don't see any reason why we can't have them.  But if we would tariff some of this stuff that comes in from China  that we can't afford to make here to bring it up to the prices that it would cost us to make it  and use that to pay for the government and not tax you, for example, at some point.
