Well in theory you can use the solar one in the dark for two years without ever having to recharge the keyboard  this one is kind of nicer and cooler and thinner and  Uses a smart, but it doesn't I like heard about it  I expect I to be able to fold the keyboard back like this. No when you do that it falls off  Yeah, why would you want to do that so that you can use the tablet like a tablet?  I see you if you want to go into tablet mode you sort of you have to it's not a convertible  That's a big pockets big pockets is I think the solar one may be the one that I settle on

Start time: 4291.52
End time: 4307.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's gonna have the other one. I don't see them buying that opera though because opera is so invested in its own web technologies  And I mean the world is basically a web kit world, especially in mobile  And if you buy opera you're sort of betting against web cat which does not sound like a Facebook kind of thing to do

Start time: 4308.02
End time: 4315.27

End time: 4382.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe if you provided a more secure browser people spent more time in there  There's Facebook buttons and Facebook controls everywhere. They get to watch everything you do  That's the real issue with Facebook is they got to be careful  Because people are getting more and more paranoid about Facebook and the risk is you're pushing people away by being too aggressive in  In trying to own  Everything you do online, right?  Yeah, oh  You're right. It is the cookie law web 994 has a point do not track  Which is now available in every browser except Chrome  And is is supported by the force of law  It means that you could set a setting in Safari or in Internet Explorer that says don't track me  There's a Chrome extension to there's a Chrome extension, but Google has interestingly not put it into Chrome, right?  And what that means is that the chief target of this?  I think is the Facebook like button every time you go to a page of the Facebook like button  Facebook can see what you're doing and what sites you're visiting this do not track would prohibit that  That would be a good reason to buy opera now do you think the buy opera

Start time: 4384.46
End time: 4389.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4397.58
End time: 4414.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and I don't I don't see Facebook doing that Facebook can take over any browser that it that it sets itself up in  And in terms of do not track you have to turn that on you have to say, okay  I want to do that and it's very small minority of people who actually care about most people won't do it because they would they

Transcript:  Well, it's  Facebook mean they are doing great  Yeah, the problem is half of their more than half of their users are using mobile now, right?  Yes, right. They're doing they don't want to do great until they can figure out a way to monetize  So that's the probably one of the reasons for this smartphone rumor again, Nick built into writing into the Sunday Times Today's New York Times  Brings up the rumor again. He's not the first it's not the second. It's the third phone that  Facebook has reportedly been working on in fact  They've hired more than according to Nick half a dozen former Apple software and hardware engineers who worked on the iPhone and one who worked  on the iPad  This is where that stock is so important so you can acquire some of these people  Although I would say I'd rather have Apple stock at this point than Facebook. Maybe Apple stock has already hit the peak  Facebook has nowhere to go but up  The strike price is nice and low  This would be Facebook's third effort building a smartphone according to one person was briefed on the plans and one who was recruited  Nick's doing some good reporting here  Apparently the tech remember tech crunch in 2010 said Facebook's gonna build a phone that project  According to Nick crumbled after the company realized the difficulties involved  All things D reported last year that Facebook and HTC had entered a partnership code named Buffy  Still in the works, but now this is goes beyond those attempts  They've got a team of seasoned hardware engineers  Sounds like the expendables or the a team. I don't know if mr. T is on this team who have built these devices before  Maybe it's the Avengers  The movie you hate  You know, let's not bring that up again.

Now I'm jealous  All right, they're telling me if I do the Google Oracle story with a strong British accent  The jury has come back and  You remember in the first part there are two parts of this Oracle is suing Google over its use of Java in Android  Right and they never gave any credit to Java. They never in fact they wrote their own Java virtual machine  Is we Dalvik assuming that this would get them off the hook? But but Oracle said no, wait a minute  Wait a minute. We copyright the API's we copyright their calls and the crazy that's crazy talk  And fortunately the the well the jury came back with a funny they said though. There was no copyright violation  But it's weird it was very so Oracle may go back and retry the verdict was so confused  They may retry the copyright case, but they did lose on the patent infringement  Case no patent infringement found the ten-person jury big money started with 12 two of them left. They were bored  I think they died aboard him. Yeah, it's the longest the judge said this is the longest simple case. I have ever presided over  Or at least it felt like it  Google did not infringe two Java related patents that Oracle had used to sue the search giant  That means Oracle is unlikely to get anything from the trial other than maybe a tiny amount of  damages for one function a  Range check function. I love the judge we talked about this  I don't know if we talked about this last week the judge William Alsop said hey, I've written range check functions  That's easy. I can go right him in your sleep. I love a judge that says that that's rare. It's rare. It's unheard of yeah  I  You could I could write a range. I could write you a range check right now. It's simple. He's right by the way  So the idea that this somehow is patented is bizarre and absurd  So I guess Google won  There won't be a damages part of the trial at all  Google said we're grateful for the jury's verdict. We are so grateful  and  Oracle said Oracle presented overwhelming evidence a trial that Google knew it would fragment and damage Java  We plan to continue and defend and uphold Java's core right once the real beef here

Yeah tough cookies  But he said I remember when the Oracle guys were doing their due diligence about buying Sun one of the things they were going  They were really excited about it this was the thing that they got they were really excited they bought Sun  Slow-tech says it in our chat room.
