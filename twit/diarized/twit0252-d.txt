Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and BB Live. You still do Brad Bresher's Live? You know we do BB Live show from time to time.  It's very intermittent. Whenever I've got something that's not really a proper  show, I just want to connect with the audience. I'll hop on BBLiveShow.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the only TWiT commentator who both breathes fire and sleeps on nails, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Brian Brushwood from Schwud.com. You had to say both of those because I got you eating fire the very first time I came.  Fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The videos out there on YouTube. And ladies and gentlemen he's back after a  complete  travesty last week which John did not participate in.  He has accepted my  beg, my pleads, my pleading and begging.  He's coming back, John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak.  What did you say that was a terrible show last week? I was kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just kidding. Today's opposite day. This is a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kid, I kid. How you doing? I haven't seen you in ages. Well here I is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to come up today but I felt it was going to be boiling up there. It is. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  ninety something, ninety three something. I was shocked because I guess I was driving through the fog at first.  It was a beautiful seventy three degrees  and then twenty miles later it was ninety three or something. You hit the marine layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah we got the marine layer here. It's only seventy something maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should come up. Don't you like warm weather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No I do. In fact I like it. But when it's a hundred degrees it seems to be a bit much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a premature early heat wave here.  So  we have a lot of tech news to talk about  and we will certainly get to that  in a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  First the Vuvuzelas and go. First the Vuvuzelas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't do this show without  This is our tribute to the World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you guys been watching the World Cup? Did you watch any of the games? I only watched the US vs England  and that was really neat because all of the internet took a break to pretend to care about soccer.  It was adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah it was fantastic. She's spending all that time watching that fantastic game one to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't bear the excitement. This is really the problem soccer has in the US.  It's incomprehensible to Americans. It's dull.  Although with youth soccer I would think that Americans at least know the rules now but it's still dull.  It is no less dull. Why is it that the world finds soccer so exciting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I used to think the exact same thing with hockey because hockey also has low scoring games.  Until I went and saw a hockey game live and I was like well this is exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hockey live is astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we should just see more live soccer.  I think the problem is the field is massive so everything is spread out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw the Olympics in LA. I saw the live soccer game.  I've seen the live soccer game in the big stadium in Rio de Janeiro with a capacity of 350,000.  Any food for zealous?  Wow! That's a big stadium.  The only thing interesting about Brazilian soccer in Brazil is that the game is kind of interesting  about the last five minutes when they actually start to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the faking where the guy just touches you and he goes...  And he falls on the ground and rides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're trying to draw a red card on them or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess in the World Cup you don't really do that.  I would imagine if you're ever going to pull it out it's for the World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what the British are known for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're famous for the flopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's their acting. It's the Shakespearean instinct deep inside them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Alas, poor Yorick!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the thing that stands out for Americans, and I guess it's controversial,  is this buzzing that you hear the entire time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like I want to start confessing state secrets.  I'm so unable to handle this non-stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called, they say, a vuvuzela.  Why is it called that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's also called... What's the other name of it?  Lepetada.  Yeah. It either sounds like a body part or a disease.  Your pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vuvuzela does sound like a little bit like a lady's parts.  Your vuvuzela is hanging out.  It just sounds that way.  I don't know. Maybe it's me.  And lepetada sounds like a condition that you might get if you take something  and you get the lepetada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, I had some wild days in my youth and now I got a little bit of the lepetada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sausage fingers or lepetada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So to make a segue...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the sound.  That's a single.  The sound of...  I think that's a ship out here.  That's one vuvuzela.  Now, the good news is for you folks who have an iPhone,  there is a vuvuzela, many actually, vuvuzela iPhone apps.  Was there really a number of them?  More than one.  And this is virtual vuvuzela.  There is a free version.  I got the pro version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You got the pro version because you don't mess around when it comes to your vuvuzela, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pro version you could pick your country.  So I'm going to pick Cameroon because I've always been a fan of Cameroon.  And then when you play the vuvuzela, see the horn has the Cameroon colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, you would think they would have like different tones for different countries.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is bogus.  You know what this is?  This is totally bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you mean, bogus?  What do they do?  They get the Cameroonians to show up in some stadium and then record?  This is nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not Cameroonian vuvuzela.  And I think it's just the same vuvuzela.  They just have the national flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, for anyone still listening to broadcast, you've passed the test.  Now you get tech news.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the tech news.  So Steve Jobs takes the stage on Monday, which now I don't know why,  but for some reason seems forever ago.  Yeah, you're not kidding.  Does it seem like it was this week that they announced the new iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think part of it, you could blame Tom Merritt because it was as though,  because I tuned in, that's where I got the coverage was live here at Twitter.  Right.  And it's like, I really felt like I was there.  I guess it was only one day after last Sunday,  but you've had a while for it to kind of process and sink in.  You don't seem that jazzed about the iPhone 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're just completely bought into the Nexus One, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you know, well, I have to say I'll probably get an iPhone 4.  I don't know if I'll choose it, but the Nexus One has started to  become a little unresponsive to my fingering.  And that worries me a little bit.  I think it's vuvuzelas on the block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's falling out of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I made the prediction on Sunday night that whatever it is you were hoping for  on the iPhone 4, expect just a little bit less.  And during the announcement, all my friends were sending me tweets.  They were razzing me like, what else do you want, lasers?  What do you say?  But it's like, it's everything you want and less.  And that's what I expected.  And I'd like to think that I nailed this one because it did have everything that we expected  from the Gawker, you know, preview unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we kind of knew because yeah, they had the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I was genuinely surprised that there wasn't a 64 gigabyte option available  because at 32 gigabytes, I'm always running out of room on my current phone.  And I don't know that I want to spend $300 just to continue to have that problem.  I'd love to make that go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, you could almost say that the story of the iPhone is what it didn't have.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's, you know, of course, that's, you know, that's always the easy way to go with any of it.  Let's talk about what it did have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a new screen.  They call it the Retina display.  Although the folks from the head of science at DisplayMate and others, physicists have pointed  out that in fact, it is not a retinal display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that depends also on how far apart, how far from your eyes you're holding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely. So Raymond's so narrow.  So here's the claim.  Apple's claim is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you explain what a retinal display is supposed to be and why this isn't one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's claim is that this the resolution, the dots per inch or pixels per inch of the new iPhone,  which is admittedly very high, 326 pixels per inch, is so high that it's, quote,  higher resolution than the human eye.  Is able to perceive.  So, well, yeah, if it's higher resolution than the eye can see, then you wouldn't see dots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, I am posting a link in the chat room for anybody in the chat room that is a very good  photo that Robert Scoble took of a unit in his hand that really does show how good the display is.  It's amazing looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is very, very good.  It looks like paper.  It looks like you're, you know, holding.  However, Raymond Sinera, who is a display mate, and these guys have done this for years.  You know him, John.  They really are the kind of the kings of display technology.  He's a president.  He says, and by the way, he's also a PhD in physics.  He says that the truth is, and of course, just as you say, Brian, it's how far you are away.  The angular measurement of the retina is six arc minutes per pixel.  See, there you go.  Oh, yeah.  So if you wanted to hold an iPhone 4G 20 inches away, it would have to have 716 pixels per inch.  In other words, that the 326 pixels per inch is only good if you've got it at arm's length.  Right.  Or if you have less than 20-20 vision.  Well, I, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you have less than perfect 20-20 vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as you say, the people who've seen it, say I haven't seen it, but the people who've seen it  say it's very crisp, very clear.  My concern is it just means that type can be smaller.  I mean, look how small the type is in Robert's picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point, Leo.  It's annoying some of these types.  The 2.3 point font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I could zoom in and then it'd be more legible, but I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, this is also from where I'm sitting, I experienced both this launch and the iPad  launch remotely watching the way other people reacted to it.  And this is very, very similar to it in many regards.  One, with the iPad, everyone who was there and touched it loved it.  Everyone who wasn't there didn't understand it.  And it looks like this is very much the same.  Everybody who has seen the display in person says, look, Apple's prone to exaggerate on  a lot of things.  They're not doing that on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm reserving judgment.  Because I think, yeah, and we'll see it all soon.  In two weeks we're going to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But can I also say that the mere fact that we're even having this conversation is evidence to me  that Steve Jobs is the P.T. Barnum of our generation.  The mere fact that he's able to frame it in this over the top language, which is like,  I would love, like, how different is this display from what you got on the Evo?  Is it significantly better?  Yes, it's much higher resolution.  Oh, it is much higher.  Much higher resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, look, this is laser printer resolution.  That's pretty good.  I mean, you know, that's you're looking at, you know, the quality of a piece of paper.  I don't see it.  I don't.  On a laser printer.  I, you know, I can't see these dots and these are, this is 300 dots per inch.  So I, I, I, I can, look, we'll have to see it.  It has that.  It has another thing that I think is completely stupid, which is FaceTime.  And again, P.T. Barnum Jobs or P.T. Jobs, as we call them.  P.T.J. for short.  Doesn't that sound like H.R. Puff and stuff?  Sounds like a cartoon.  P.T. Jobs and stuff.  Anyway, the, he acted as if Skype never existed.  Like, you've never seen a video phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is that moment that I said, whatever you're hoping for, expect less.  I was absolutely hoping that it would be Skype out of the box, that we could,  my family could be on the home computer.  You have to be on Wi-Fi?  You have to be on Wi-Fi.  But having said that, this is the feature that I have looked for in every single release.  The very first iPhone.  Absolutely.  And I liked, you know, it's like, I've got a six-year-old and a two-year-old at home.  This is, and the only part that, you know, and of course the ads show this touching moment  of baby taking first steps and the deaf couple talking through sign language and all these  things.  But the one part that had me screaming was it shows the guy in a hotel,  looking at his kids and I'm like, lies!  No hotel has Wi-Fi that good.  All hotels have terrible, terrible Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be much, much more like the actual demo on the stage Steve Jobs did with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the frozen video.  Which we didn't even get to that part yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How about the meltdown?  He was not too happy.  You know, I found a Page Six item in the San Francisco weekly afterward.  Three hobos were killed randomly shortly after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Someone must die!  I love the keynotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone must die!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So apparently nobody at Apple figured out that all the journalists present would be  using their own Wi-Fi access points, aka MiFi.  And it wasn't the lack of bandwidth.  It was the number of access points.  It was the interference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was just, you couldn't get a clear signal from one side to the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You thought they would learn a little bit because Google had a similar problem with  Bluetooth when they were trying to do their Google TV demo.  You would have thought that somebody at Apple would say, gee, I wonder, you think would,  should we be worried about this Wi-Fi working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and it's tough because how do you simulate that kind of thing?  How do you, you don't know until you get there.  It's like in order to see what kind of interference you'd have, you have to have already,  it's, I guess they could have maybe tested during the iPad launch since that was clearly  exactly the same scenario as they dealt with in this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now here's an interesting supposition.  This comes from Ars Technica, their infinite loop column.  They're so brilliant.  They say that the WWDC keynote Wi-Fi woes may have been due to iPhone 4 drivers.  Really?  Jobs said from the stage and an Apple engineer later confirmed with InfoWorld that over 500  Wi-Fi networks were in the room.  And of course, no journalist, especially those live blogging was going to turn off his Wi-Fi.  I'm sorry.  There's just no way that was going to happen.  But there are, there is a 5,000 people and 500 networks.  However, after examining the video from the event, says ours, and discussing it with two  veteran Wi-Fi gurus, it seems almost certain that the Wi-Fi was only a part of the problem.  A flaw in the pre-release iOS was clearly another element.  Apple's public relations concern confirmed receipt of a request for comment, but none  was forthcoming.  So, so this is great.  Infinite loop.  Glenn Fleischman takes a look at the video in slow motion.  This is worthy of the Zapruder film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The hopes dashing on Steve Jobs's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the replay in slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, six seconds in the iPhone 3GS has mostly loaded the New York Times,  but the iPhone 4 displays just a title bar.  Whoops.  That's not really a good demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Wi-Fi icon in the iPhone 4 status bar is visible at the top.  Yes, you can see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  17 seconds in, Jobs brings the backup set of devices, and the backup iPhone is on 3G.  You can see the 3G indicator clearly.  The iPhone 4 can't acquire a 3G connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The audience laughs.  A wag suggests Jobs try Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that was, that was the moment.  That was the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  47 seconds in.  I'm inspired because Jim Cutler, our voiceover guy, is in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm turning into him.  47 seconds in, the demo screen fades subtly back to the original pair of devices  in which the Wi-Fi icon is shown on iPhone 4, but it still has not retrieved the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Before the episode's over, I want Jim to give a dramatic reading of something.  Jim is great.  I will get him a phone book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I have to say, are people that bored?  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So here's the thing about FaceTime.  FaceTime, yes, it's gimmicky and it sounds over the top.  And, you know, use that rhetoric that's going to change the way you communicate and everything.  But this is what we've all wanted since, since, you know, the Dick Tracy wristwatch, you know,  this ability to get face-to-face communication with other people.  And yes, it's very, very handicapped right now.  And I'm super annoyed by it.  I hate that it's Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi because if I'm in a place-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, that's useless.  Yes, I agree.  I agree.  Because if I have Wi-Fi, I'm going to use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry.  Right. By the way, and let me put this out to the universe because someone out there  can make a mint every time I go into a new hotel.  The very first thing, the very first page I load is speedtest.net.  Really?  And it occurs to me that all I would need-  You have a lot of data because you stay in a lot of hotels.  Oh my gosh, you're not kidding.  You know this.  There's got to be other people like me.  But imagine if they added a feature that you clicked one button and it did geolocation  and it knew which hotel you were at and it had an aggregation of all the hotel's  true bandwidth throughput, not whatever they're advertising.  First of all, every time you call a hotel in advance, you say,  do you have high speed internet?  They say, yes.  You're like, well, how fast is it?  You need to create a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wireless.  Brian, you need to create a website where the travelers can put this-  Actually, I'll join you on this one, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing is you not only need a website for that, but you need a website that discusses  what people charge in various hotels.  We need a generalized database that shows all the hotels in the country,  what they charge, and if you have bad rooms, it should be reported.  Some rooms just can't get a good connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'll go so far as to say I would pay a subscription fee to be part of a secret club of people who  reported who consistently had good bandwidth.  They do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seat Finder does it for airline seats.  I can imagine that somebody would do this Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, please get on it because I'm ready to make that happen right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I play the vuvuzela in your honor, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you.  The other thing that is promising about FaceTime is the fact that they said it would be an open  API.  Is that right?  Which means all kinds of software can be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed the stack of software.  It's H.264.  It's not a standard like H.323 that is a standard for video conferencing.  It's H.264, but it does support-  Somebody who was in our chat room who knew what all of this was about, the VoIP expert,  said it does in fact support all of those stacks of software.  Skype has said, yes, we'd like to support it.  It's unknown how much Apple has revealed about how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and that's so typical for these keynotes where it's like you want it  and it's coming just like tethering last year from AT&T, which brings up the other big bummer  of this week.  I guess it happened before the actual announcement.  No Verizon.  But no Verizon's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I predicted last week on this very show, I theorized that because of the AT&T change in its  pricing and the bandwidth tiering, because AT&T doubled its early termination fee, I thought,  and all of this activated June 7th, I thought for sure that means AT&T is kind of beginning  to wrap up its exclusivity and Verizon or somebody's going to come in.  In fact, Joshua Tobolski from Engadget was on the show last week, said that why stop there?  Why not make it on every carrier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But no.  How about this for an idea as a thought?  I think you mentioned on one of the shows that Apple's got the 27th booked at some place or  other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Supposedly at Moscone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the 24th is when the phone comes out, right?  Right.  So how about this as part of a deal that Apple did with AT&T and Verizon?  You get three days?  You get-  They bring the phone out, they say nothing.  They bring the phone out, everybody gets in line again and they go wrap around the block to grab  this phone as soon as it comes out.  Three days later, they make the Verizon announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is some no agenda talk right here.  I like it.  This is some heavy duty conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Basically, it just shows that we still-  It makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We still have not given up.  The notion that AT&T is the one and only place you can get an iPhone is just not going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So one of the things that really disappointed me was AT&T announced they were doing away with  the unlimited use and they said that you could be grandfathered in, I suppose it's-  If you bought by June 7th, you had to buy by June 7th.  Right.  But I wonder if there's any way, like I'm somebody, I have the unlimited plan right now,  of course, but when I go to buy the iPhone 4, I'm almost certain that they say, well,  if you want the subsidized price, you need to pick a new plan.  Yeah.  And so-  They will.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the quote, generous deal that AT&T is offering that if you're due for an update,  which happens after one year, apparently, if you're due for an update on AT&T anytime in 2010,  you can get it for the update price.  Yeah. Well, I tell you-  But it extends your contract for another two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. There's a big gap because I bought it the day it came out and my wife bought hers like  three weeks later. She's not eligible until February 2011.  Oh.  Yeah. So it's like, but then again, I mean, I've been with AT&T for 11 years now. So I don't know  if I qualified for some other thing on the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that explains your hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Every week I look at my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why? John, you must know, you must at least have a theory. Why?  Clearly it's not in Apple's best interest to stay at AT&T at this point. Why are they still  exclusive to AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's obvious that there is a good under the table deal for Apple. They're making tons  of money on a kickback or something. I mean, that's the only thing I can think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this point, it must be 100% of every penny AT&T makes is going to Apple. I mean, everybody hates  AT&T. Apple, if they sold, they could double the sales by going to Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that would be a cool thing to do when their stock starts to fail. Maybe they'll do it then.  Let me say two things.  I'm still pushing the 27 thing.  You'd think that maybe that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  AT&T, first of all, and it's so, it is a little bit skewed because genuinely the service is  terrible in San Francisco. And for the life of me, I don't know why AT&T just doesn't throw a few,  $100,000 at the problem to make a dent on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not easy because of rights of way. It's very, especially in this town like San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Well, I tell you, I stay down by the airport and no lie, I get like 1.3 megabits down.  The service is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PC Magazine, last week, PC Magazine published a study in which they said AT&T had the fastest  network almost everywhere except for the Pacific Northeast.  Believe it or not, who would you guess, Tim, Jim is the best? Because Jim Cutler and Don  live in the Pacific Northeast. It's T-Mobile. Who would have thought? I would have thought Verizon  because that used to be 9X. Jim says T-Mobile may be getting it next. And that's exactly right.  Steve Wu, I'm sorry, Shaw Wu, an analyst with Kaufman Brothers is saying the iPhone could  come to T-Mobile as early as this fall. He says the iPhone will be available on multiple  carriers in the US by next year. And the first carrier to get the iPhone after AT&T exclusivity  ends is likely to be T-Mobile, which is not going to make anybody happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, remember also that whatever network, any other network, whether it's Verizon, whether it's  anyone, if they had the iPhone exclusivity, they couldn't handle it. There are so many iPhone users.  Well, that's why you put it on every freaking network.  Right. Exactly. But that's just is if you spread it around, maybe you'd be all right. But two things  disappointed me about the change about the AT&T unlimited plan. The first was the reaction everyone  had where they checked their data usage and said, Oh, well, I didn't cross two gigabytes, so I'm sure  it's fine. And it's like, that's right now thinking. And now you have this product that's going to shoot  high definition video. You're going to deal with much larger files. You're going to have a lot more  opportunity with all different device programs. Two gigabytes is not going to be a lot in another

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  year. I'm going to tell you in a second why you're absolutely right. But before we do that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can play the Vuvuzela. I'm going to play the Vuvuzela.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I want to talk about Squarespace.com. Squarespace, of course, is that great place for  you to make a great website. If you go to Squarespace.com slash twit right now, you can set  up your Squarespace site for free for two weeks. You don't even need a credit card.  Just go to Squarespace.com slash twit. Now, why would you do that? It's the secret behind exceptional  websites hosting. Yes, starting at eight dollars a month, but it also includes incredible Squarespace  software that makes it so easy to design a unique and beautiful site and gives you features like  built-in social integration with Facebook, Twitter, Quick, Pandora, all of them. Flickr.  You've got the great iPhone app, which is simply the best blogging app out there.  You can import and export your blog from Google, type WordPress, type pad or blogger. Incredible  stats, photo galleries, intuitive editing, and very, very elegant customization. You don't even  need to know CSS. Of course, if you know CSS, there's no disguise limit. You can put any arbitrary CSS  or JavaScript in there, but even if you don't, you can drag and drop your design and really make  it gorgeous. Go to the Squarespace site and look at the examples for an idea. What are you looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  at, man? Well, no, I'm looking at you because you know the CEO of Squarespace, Dane, right?  Yeah. Dane Atkinson. He came to me with this brilliant idea. We were never able to figure out  a way to make it quite easy, but it's so easy to take your existing HTML from your current website  Oh, yeah, yeah. and put it in the other. He had the, we'll say theoretical idea that on a lark,  it might be funny to copy somebody else's HTML. Like for example, a famous celebrity blogger or,  you know, some kind of that'd be funny. Yeah, exactly. And make your site look exactly the same.  Yeah. So you think you're going to PerezHilton.com and all of a sudden there's a story about you  walking into the Apple store. And because Squarespace is so easy, you open an account instantly.  You don't even need a credit card. You're online within seconds, copy and paste, and you freak your  friends out with it. And then once you see how easy it is, then you will use the code TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Squarespace.com slash twit, $8 a month, but do take a look and do the freebie because you'll  be very impressed by what you can do. Everything from $8 for the basic account, $50 a month gives  you a community account with lots of bandwidth, lots of different editors. This is one of the nice  things you could do with Squarespace, multiple editors, all sorts of interesting features,  the virtual private storage, or surveys rather make it incredible. You never have to worry about  getting slash dot editor Doug. Squarespace.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of  This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I didn't hear that at first. I didn't know what it was saying. I was like, what does that jingle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So easy in a Squarespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love it. Did they give that to you or did you bring that to them?  We made that up.  That's awesome.  In fact, they haven't even said we could do it.  That's in fact, I'm pretty sure after hearing this episode,  Please stop playing that jingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the interesting deal. Hulu, we've heard these rumors for a while, but Hulu is about to  start doing an iPad and an Xbox version. Now you'll pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh dude, I would so pay for Xbox.  How much would you pay?  Well, I don't know. I almost bought, there's a service called PlayOn that sits on your  desktop and that allows you to use your desktop to access Hulu remotely. I used the trial and I loved  it. I remember thinking I would almost buy this, but the fact that it was tied to my desktop seemed  complicated enough that I was worried like, oh, well, if my desktop's off, I got to go turn it on  or whatever. So if it's direct, I'm going to name that price, Leo, 20 bucks a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, a year?  Yeah.  I think they're thinking 10 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay. That's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Okay. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. By the way, Hulu is very profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To access a website that's already free to access?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A hundred million dollars in advertising revenue last year at Hulu.com.  Congratulations.  So it's doing okay. According to this story, which ran in Reuters, they'll continue to offer  newer episodes of shows like Glee or I guess it won't be new episodes of Lost ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or what's the one? Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Love that show.  Hulu is the reason that I got into that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. I would not have known about that show if it weren't for the balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But your friend comes over and he's obsessed. He's like, oh, you got to watch it.  You got to watch eight episodes right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the new shows will be free, which makes sense because that's how you get people watching the  show, right? But they'll charge viewers a monthly fee to see older episodes and other content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't even know if I hate that. That's kind of okay because at that point, if you're going  into the archives and you just want to go back and experience the back catalog, I'd pay a premium  for that. But mainly, Hulu is a weird case because for all of us in new media,  we kind of hate them because they represent old media content, but we also want them to be  crazy successful because that means that there's healthy room for growth in the online space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Xbox and maybe they'll announce this at E3. This might be one of the announcements.  Microsoft's got some big announcements coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they claimed, I don't want to jump ahead, but Microsoft said they have a bigger announcement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  than Natal. Maybe that's in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which by the way, you're getting up at what time to go see Natal tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're doing it. We're going to do, Brian and I are going down to LA right after the show today  because we're going to cover E3 for a couple of days. So day one, Monday, tomorrow is Microsoft  day. That's the Microsoft press conference. We'll broadcast that live at 10 AM. Tom Merritt and  Sarah Lane will be here in studio commentating as we did with the worldwide developers conference on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  last Monday. And I guess during that time, we're using their feed. So we won't be on camera. It'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be the regular feed. But it'll be exactly what we did with the Google thing, which was, it'll be  like mystery science three to 3000. They'll be commenting as Microsoft talks about it. And then  you and I are going to be down there, but we have to get up very early. Becky Worley, who works for  Good Morning America, got an exclusive with Microsoft to be the first to show Natal on GMA  and to reveal the name and pricing and all the information that we're waiting to hear about Natal.  She's going to do that at 4 30 AM. Well, see that's because she's in California at 7 30 East  coast time and there's a morning show. So that's, I guess that's right. Yeah. So, and then, but she  very kindly interceded on our behalf because basically we were standing there with something  in our hands that we didn't want to hold and, and just had nothing. And she said, can Leo and, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Brian come and now I am, I'm not going to be, I will be up that early, but I won't be there with  you because I, the only flight I could get that allow me to do NSFW tonight. I'm going to, I'm  going to be on a plane and then I hit the ground running and then I join you. If at some point  about 3 AM tomorrow night, hello, hello, who is this? Who is this? State your name, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You hear something coming through the phone. I can't believe it. You're not going to be there.  It's, there we go. I have a call for a Brian brush one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't be surprised if I'll be watching you. I'll be listening to you on my tweet. Yeah. So for that,  but then, but then I get there. I arrived at seven o'clock and then I do it fine. So I will be all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  alone with, with the project Natal. We will have it right after ABC does. We'll have that five,  we're going to stream it. Five 30 AM Pacific, but that's eight 30 Eastern. Yeah. That's not bad.  That's not bad. That's that's afternoon. UTC. So you'll be, that's when you're really stretching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're like, you're like where they're playing the world cup. It'll be in the afternoon. Sometimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it'd be middle. Yeah. So in, in, in, in the UK, you'll be able to watch this at 12, 30. That's  right. So we will, we will do that and then we'll come back. We'll cover the press conference. We'll  have that video, but we'll have whatever else they announce. You're right. They may have something

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  appointment. I didn't know. I made it clear that we may or may not make it on time, but the, the  folks from MTV games, I promised them, I wouldn't say what game, but if you read anything about,  you know, video games in the news, you probably have an idea what video game we have the chance  to get hands on with on a stage with colored lights. We'll be, we'll be rocking out. You might say,  12, 30 on Tuesday is what I put us out for. Awesome. Yeah. So we, that's the, so the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  day we're going to stream live from the show floor. That will be part of it. Awesome. Starting  noon, noon to two 30. And that's thanks to, by the way, and this, I would have never thought  I would ever be saying that's thanks to G four. No kidding. Well, when we, when we,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know Jim Cutler's going, what all of a sudden Jim totally hulks out. He turns green and starts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, I know we all got fired, but that was a long time ago and it was different. No,  G four. No, I, I, I buzzed and tweeted that we couldn't cover it because this is weird. I've  never, and maybe John, you've heard of this, but I've never heard of it. This trade show and these  press conferences all have done exclusives with other media outlets. So for instance, we can't be  at the Microsoft event because spike or MTV has an exclusive and we can't, we thought we couldn't  stream from the E floor show, E four, E three show floor because G four has a streaming live  exclusive. So we can't cover this, but they reached out to you on this, right? So I buzzed. I said,  I'm, I'm devastated. We wanted to do E three coverage, but we've been told we can't go in  and because of G four is exclusive and they can't, they called this and we'll know we'll get you in.  So we add, thanks to the G four or the auspices of G four, we're going to be broadcasting live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hopefully it's a case where G four realizes that there are different jobs for different media.  You're not competing. Well, exactly. It's like, I don't, I don't have the coverage. That's up to  the minute, you know, walking around there, they're following characters on the show floor  are not necessarily the same type of people who are tuning in, uh, you know, after three o'clock.  I look like Olivia Mundy. You, yeah, a little bit. Yeah. You wear the wig speedo. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this whole deal sounds like a crock of crap as far as I'm concerned. Generally speaking,  if you're going to have a press conference, right? You don't start throwing the exclusives out to  people. I couldn't figure out John. I thought maybe it's gotta be part of either the, you know,  the only thing I can think of, but this is a, just, I'm just dreaming this up. I have no idea what's  going on, but, but it's possible that they got a better deal at the show. They gave them a discount.  If the show had, you know, there may be some underhanded dealings where there's some, you know,  money changing hands to allow this because in so far as publicity is concerned, there's no advantage  to giving anybody an exclusive. Why would Microsoft? It's a total disadvantage A and B.  Journalists traditionally get very annoyed by this because they get burned by this and they will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  blackball you. Right. And I almost walked away. To be honest, I said, well, all right, you don't  want coverage. I guess you're happy with G4 and Spike, but, uh, if you don't want coverage,  I'm not going to give you coverage because this, I mean, it's called a press conference. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  called a Spike conference. Well, and it's press only. I mean, it's a media only, uh, yeah. So you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can go in, but you just can't stream it. So anyway, anyway, we got it resolved. We're going  to be there. We're going to be, and, and, and thank you G4. What we'll do is we'll go to 230.  Their coverage begins at 230 or actually may even begin at two and they're going to be covering it  live. So, you know, it's actually kind of fun. I'll probably see Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and it'll be kind of fun. Is this anything besides Microsoft pulling this stunt? You said  Microsoft was there? All of them. Yeah. Everybody's doing a deal. This is how they do it. Apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how they do. I think, yeah, Microsoft, uh, ESA, which runs E3 had an exclusive with G4. I think,  I think it's, I don't know. It may be the same with Sony and Nintendo, but, uh, my thought was  it's so hard to get coverage. Like nobody wants to cover it. So they just, the exclusive was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  please cover us. We'll give you an exclusive. Oh, that's interesting. That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That doesn't make sense to me. Like who's going to, well, anyway, well, I'll tell you this much,  like for the last two years, ever since they restructured E3 and they made it less of a public  spectacle. I have set up my computer, watched all of the live streaming things, read all of the  live blogs and enjoyed the news as it came in. And this is, uh, this is very exciting for me to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually be there in person. I'm, I'm, I'm stoked. And, uh, now tell us about Natal. What, what are  you say? There's going to be some big announcements. Uh, well, Microsoft claims they have an

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  announcement bigger than Natal. And what is the Natal may not be so big. Let's be honest, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, Natal is where you go, like you wave around and play the game and you're going like  this, which by the way, if I'm not mistaken, I had on my PS2 with the iCam like 10 years ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  right? That's, that's the thing is they, it's like they watched, they watched the success of  the Nintendo Wii and they're like, wait a minute, people don't like regular controls. They like  herky jerky in their body all around. I know no control, no control in front of your screen.  So whatever you want, balls go flying everywhere and you get money in the bank. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's interesting. Sony is going to announce, uh, basically a Wii mode for the PlayStation 3. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And Sony, uh, what's interesting is to see the way everybody jockeys for position. Yeah. Right.  And, and the way Sony's thing is they're like, Hey man, you can't be precise with no, you really  want to hold nothing, at least hold something. It'll be super precise and you'll look awesome  pretending to shoot buttons. Game controllers. I need green. And that's the way I am too. I don't  understand this. Now the parts that I really do like about Natal, what I've heard about before,  and of course all of this will probably be out of date by the time most people listen to the podcast,  but the, I love the facial recognition, the idea that you walk into the room and it says,  hello, Brian, what game would you like to play? That's the voice I imagine. Oh, that's interesting.  So it'll know it's you. Right. And more importantly, it recognizes your kids. If your kids are in the  room, it'll say, yeah, this is a rated M title. No, no, we don't want to be nanny Xbox. Well,  and I tell you, it's one of those things that we all hate until we have play that Brian, until we  have seven year olds and then we're like, well, I'm sure I'm glad I can turn this off. You don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to play modern warcraft too. You want to do some more racing. You want to play, you want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  play space hearts. Yes. How about a nice game of Lego star wars? Our kids are having the argument  from 2001. They're like, uh, open the rock band three, Hal. I'm sorry, Dave. I'm predicting this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing's going to be a bust. Well, we'll see. We may, you know, we're going to be down there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  we'll see what happens. I think I'm talking about the overall, the market for the, uh, I agree. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  think I don't get it. I'm highly skeptical of Natal as I've seen it demonstrated before, but  Natal has that iPad, iPhone, iPhone effect. Everybody who's seen it live came away drooling  like there's something magical about it. So I don't know. But you saw that dorky video,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica, around. I mean, it did not look good. I mean, and, and if something that Veronica does  does not look good, that's not good. Cause pretty much no matter what she does, that looks good. She  makes everything. She makes everything look good and make everything sound like she can't save Natal.  No one can. So as people turn to the internet to catch movies, tv shows and other content,  e-marketer says that by 2014, 77% of all internet users will watch videos online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't believe it's still that it's, that it would be that low. It seems like it should be higher  now. I mean, I guess the way it's phrased is at all. Like they will watch any online. I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  believe it's only 66.7%. Four years and only 11%, 11% growth. No, it's going to be 100% of video

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  will be online in the year 2014. You heard Leo, it'll be a hundred percent, 20 minutes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the year 2525, if man, if indeed man's still alive, still alive. If woman can survive,  they'll be watching their video on the internet. Video growth overall is slowing, it says, or will

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  slow. Now that, I don't know. It seems like, um, that would be a symptom of maturing. Would it not?  I guess 77% means almost everybody, right? I mean, virtually everything that comes out on  television now is instantly available in some kind of online format, whether it be Hulu, whether it be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh, I guess on demand YouTube. Violent video games are harmless. John, you've said this for years. Now,  according to the review of general psychology, Texas A and M researchers examined 118 teens  and found that violent video games actually are quite safe for most youths to play. The only youths  who shouldn't play violent video games are those who tend to be violent, violent psychopaths,  highly neurotic, less agreeable and less conscientious. Yeah, that makes sense. If you're  not, if you're not sick already, it's not going to make you sick. In fact, this is kind of interesting  as video games have become more popular. Children in the U S and Europe are having fewer behavioral  problems, are less violent. Now this might be false causality. I mean, we don't know why and score  better on standardized tests. Violent video games, at least we know this have not created a generation  of crazed, whacked out youth trying to kill zombies with a mallet. This is a very predictable formula

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that happens year after year. Every decade there's a new form of entertainment that puzzles the older  generation. In my generation, it was Dungeons and Dragons, Dungeons and Dragons are going to make  you crazy. You're going to want to cast spells. By the way, Brian, that did make people crazy.  It made adults crazy. You kids. It made adults lonely is what it made them sitting in their  parents' basement at all. And what happens is the generation gets older and they realize that the  world isn't going to end. And then they're like, oh, well, we'll wait for the next thing. Next it'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be Twitter. We should. And Don Risinger is reporting this on CNET in his column, The Digital Home. He  does say, well, that's one study, a recent study from Iowa, which was actually a survey of 130  different studies on violent video games says, in fact, youths or Utes are negatively affected by  violent video games. Quote, we can now say with utmost confidence that regardless of research method,  that is experimental, correlational or longitudinal, and regardless of the  cultures tested in the study, East versus West, you get the same effect. Exposure to violent video  games increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior in both short and long term. I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  how much of that is self correcting because the type of people who have violent tendencies or  whatever seem like the type of people who are going to want to express them in a video game  environment, which I would say is healthier than expressing them in real life. Are you shuffling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cards? John, what are you up to there? I'm shuffling cards. I work on this deal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  but like, meanwhile, the type of people who aren't, who don't have violent tendencies,  there are video games that are too violent. Like my daughter is six years old and there's this  awesome, awesome game on the adult swim website called robot unicorn attack. Yes. And it's too  violent for my six year old daughter. Robot unicorn attack. It's a robot unicorn that just  jumps. That's all the game is. But when the scare, when you jump wrong, it blows up and,  and that's too violent for my daughter. So it's like, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Vuvuzela attack. Vuvuzela attack. I think you guys are high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Robot unicorn Vuvuzela. Oh baby. Now that's scary. That's a scary ass game. Now somebody in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  chat was pointing out that that Iowa study is by Craig Anderson. And I have to say this underscores  the fact that it also depends who's doing this and who, what, what acts they have to grind.  Correct. Because this guy, you know, thinks all media is bad. Who is the guy? There was a guy that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  recently got disbarred because he called it simulated murder. The chat room will have the  answer for us instantly, but I was listening to the PC gamer podcast and they could barely contain  their joy as they reported the news. That Jack Thompson, the guy who is on this, this outrageous,  with no evidence to support him, Bender saying that video games were simulated murder. Yeah.  Oh my goodness. All right. We're going to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Before you go off to that commercial, let me add something to this conversation.  Certainly. You know,  video games or I mean, most simulations done by the army or if you're going to learn to fly a 747,  for example, you go into a simulator, which is nothing more than a glamorized video game.  And the army tank core uses these sorts of games to improve their skills. So you can actually,  I mean, the video game might not turn you violent, but if you are, you know,  the simulations are real. I mean, you actually do learn things. I've always said that my  sons who like to play grand theft auto wouldn't go steal a car, but if they ever did, they'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  good at it. Absolutely. And that has two sides. First of all, for example, we went and played  paintball for the first time. I had never played paintball ever, but the moment the game started,  there were things I just inherently knew. You knew. Because I get the BFG 9000.  Well, no, but like, like always strafe, always come at them from the side. And more important,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's true. I was, you know what, I was playing a laser tag a couple of weeks ago  and I, I, I camped on the spawn point and that really works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and I tell you, there was a time that I honestly think video games saved my life.  It doesn't work in Mogadishu. I was in an ice skid. There, it doesn't get cold weather very  often. And when it does, nobody knows how to drive on it. And so sure enough, I started a skid and it  was totally automatic without thinking about it. I've been playing a lot of Need for Speed at the  time and I, and I rolled the skid properly. Jim looks like he has something, you had the exact

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  same thing happen. He's not on mic. So somebody said, when somebody in the chat room chimed in  games don't make you a killer. They make you a better killer. The same thing happened to me. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  was coming up here too fast and I said to my wife, I learned from the game blur, not to hit the brakes  in the turn, hit the brakes after the turn. That's right. That's right. So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You accelerate into the turn. You break out of it. So we may be more violent, but we're safer drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You notice though that with, with things are more violent today on the roads because of video games,  because you think road rage is more common. Ten years ago, did you ever see people throwing  bananas out onto the road and having your car spin around? Are you accusing this of being because of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mario Kart? Never would you see that. You would never see that. All right. We're going to celebrate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some anniversaries in just a bit. I should mention, give him credit. Jim Cutler is in the studio.  Jim was for many years, the voice of tech TV. He did a lot of our promo stuff. He's still the voice  of many, many television and radio stations. It's nice to see you. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  here. I say that netcast you love and I hear more people say, Hey, you're on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's on the beginning of every show. He's the guy with netcasts you love. And then it's actually  a friend who says from people you trust. I should get Dawn to do that as well. Can I get you to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  record an intro for NSFW? Sure. Like netcasts you hate from people you don't trust. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, Jim recorded some really funny ones that we've only used a few times. Like,  there was one about Sarah Lane, netcasts you love from people you trust. No, it was, it was when

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sarah had broken up with Kevin. And I said, it was an intro for when Kevin was going to be on it.  I said, Hey, Kevin's, I said, Sarah's my sister. Kevin Rose. I have a few of those still somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that I haven't used them all the gag ones that Jim cut, but maybe you could cut some more. Jim's  the greatest. Jim Cutler, Jim Cutler.com. Yes. Give you a plug. Thank you. We shall return.  And just as I should make Jim a commercial because he's a professional. Is this an audible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You want to do an audible spot? I'd like to participate. Are you an audible listener?  I got into audible because of you. Are you kidding? I back up with carbonite.  All right. I'm into, I'm into audible books. He does it all of audible. He does it all. By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John has put up, I like this. One of those old Indian head test patterns. Where'd you get that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  John? That's awesome. That looks like a physical piece of paper he put in front of the. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it definitely is. Yeah. It is looking, it moves. Yeah, that is a, I have a copy. How you doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have one with my head in it in an Indian. Somebody sent me, somebody sent me one. Yeah.  That's awesome. So let's mention audible audible.com. Long time sponsor of the show. They do great  stuff. It's a D you should do an audio book. Have you or Don ever thought about doing an audio book?  I have, I would love to do an audio book. I don't know if there's much money in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I know you did one. It's a lot. Yeah, I did a short one. It's a lot of work. But I, I got into,  I got into audio. Oh, I did do an audio book. You did in Boston. I got into audible because of you.  And I should do the spotlight. Jason Calacanis does. I should say, I should say me and Robert  Redford were hanging out with Madonna listening to an audio book. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kind of  a kid. I'm a kid. Jason right there. But I got into audio books with John's suggestion. John said,  get economic hit man. Oh yeah. Confessions of an economic rate book. From there I went on to  another tweet suggestion, which was the book about the divers and shadow divers. Awesome.  If you're thinking about an audible account, just start with those two. It will blow you away. I  agree. They are great books. Audible is terrific because actually I need a better account because  I go through a book very quickly. I guess you can get two. There's a gold account, which is one book

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a month. Yeah. And then we have a deal for the platinum account, which is two a month. You have  more, you need more than two. No, I only have one. Oh, you should get the platinum. So you go to  audible.com. This is such a setup. I can't believe you did it. There's go to audible.com slash  twit two. And by the way, because Jim's a voiceover guy, we're not showing his face, just his hands  and the microphone. Go to audible.com slash twit two. And when you sign up for the platinum  account, you get two books. Now I say free and I should explain what that means. It means  your first two books, they don't charge you for, they will charge in the next month unless  you quit and you can cancel at any time. And those books will always be yours to keep. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  it's free in that respect. I have done that a couple of times. I've deleted a book and then  you go back to the site and your books are always there. Unlike iTunes, you can get your book all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the time. Here's that book you recommended Shadow Divers, Two Americans Who Risked Everything to  Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II. This is about true story of deep sea divers who  discover a U-boat. And it is really an amazing story. I'm going to search for, I did for a while  ago for audible, my top 20 books. And I should put this link in the show notes. It's Leo Laporte's  top 20. You can probably just Google Leo Laporte's top 20 and audible.com. And that Shadow Divers is  one of them that I highly, these are all, these are books that are great books, but also great  performances. And that's one of the things about audible. Oh, right there, Born Standing Up. I  read that one last year. And he reads it. And he reads it. So it's his voice, which is awesome.  David McCullough doing John Adams. Unbelievable. Life of Pi. Jan Martel did an amazing job of  bringing that book to life. It was a great book, beautiful, beautiful book. And Jan Martel does a  wonderful job reading it. Neil Gaiman, there's a, it reads a number of his books, but actually  the recommendation I make for Neverware was not read by Neil Gaiman, but is, I don't think he

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  read that one. Yeah. A lot of people think that read by the author is the best way to go. I  disagree. I in general want somebody who's a professional at making books sound awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless the author is John Hodgman reading the areas of my expertise. Now there's an author who

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  can read. Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to do. And I suspect the last thing you  wanted as well. But I think we both knew it was inevitable. Certainly my publisher felt that it  was frequently pointing to my contract and it's damned inevitability clause, which I should never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have agreed to. John Hodgman reading the areas of my expertise. Don't get fooled by the abridged  here. It's only abridged in the, in the strictest sense of the word is actually more material in the  audio book. Audible.com slash Twitter. To be honest with you, the hard thing is going to be to choose  just two books. There's so many great ones, but you know, it's just the beginning of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  lifelong relationship. Once you start, dude, you're going to be doing it a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one that I really liked. I don't know if people know this CS Lewis, who wrote the line,  the witch and the wardrobe was also a famous Christian philosopher. And he wrote a book called  a screw tape letters, which was the devil writing to a demon talking about how to hoodwink mankind.  Now, whether you believe or not, it is one of the best, most funny books ever written. And,  and then actually I've got the wrong one on here. Then the one I like is narrated by John Cleese.  So John Cleese as the devil. So there are apparently there's a number of versions of  this because this is Ralph Kosham reading it and I, oh, maybe they no longer have the John

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Cleese version. Boy, that was incredible. Can I recommend one too? Sure. There's a  wonderful author named Paulo Coelho. Oh, I love this. I have it too. The Alchemist.  One of the, one of my favorite books. Absolutely. Briefly. Apple offered that book for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? But you know what? It's going to be yours for you again. One more time. Just go to audible.com  slash twit to the Alchemist by Paul Coelho. That's got an interesting story because that's,  that book was not selling and Coelho really wanted his publisher to give it away and they  wouldn't. So he went to Russia and he's Brazilian and gave it away in Russia and got word of mouth  going around in Russia and created a whole bunch of interest in this book and literally  propelled the book to bestseller status. It's a fascinating story and really a beautiful book.  A little shepherd boy. It's about following your dreams. That's what it is. And since you and I  both. Dream followers. Where has that gotten us? Oh, wait. Are there any dream followers in this room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, right. That's the other thing I love is the type of people who show up on this program. All  tend to be people who go against the grain. Yeah. By the way, Jeff Jarvis called Paul Coelho the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Googliest author in what would Google do. He's, he's the Googliest author. A fan posted a Russian  translation of one of his novels online. Sales of his book went from 3000 to 1 million in three  years with no additional promotion. It's that good of a book. And so he started putting his books on  Pirate Bay. Wow. Is that a great story? He's a cool guy. Yeah. He just says, come on, download it.  I dare you. I dare you. And go. But now they sell. And this is what Cory Doctorow has always said.  You don't have, you know, you don't have to hold on so tight. People will reward your work if it's  good work. Audible.com slash twit too. We thank them for rewarding our work. Steve Balmer has been  at Microsoft for third. Oh, John, you could take down the, he's gone. The Indian. He's gone.  He's gone. Oh, somebody's saying there's a, I'm back. Hardcover of the Alchemist with Art by  Mobius. Now that would be awesome. Oh, wow. Would that not be awesome? That, oh, incredible.  I'm wondering where, if I can find my, my test pattern. I have an Indian head test. I know I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  not just a copycat. I'm what's on the screen right now. I had it first. Leo, when John was doing  Silicon spin, I wrote a letter to tech TV. I guess it was EDTV at the time. Get that ass off the  air. And by the way, everyone's playing them every once in a while, you have some hipster on here.  And I forget who it is, but they keep calling him Dvorak. Hey, Dvorak. It's Mr. Dvorak. Mr.  Dvorak. He's been around since Mark Twain. Thank you, John. He deserves to be Mr. Dvorak.  He's a mystery. Call me mister. So I wrote a letter to ZDTV saying, hey, leave John alone.  You're obviously making him do the same ad lib at the beginning of Silicon spin. He'd say, all right,  we got these coffee mugs and he'd hold up and soon it's going to be on eBay. And it was the same ad  lib literally every day. And I know what that is. That's a producer saying, come on, you got to be  loose, John. You got to do this ad lib. Somehow I doubt it. I wrote this angry letter and then a  week later I get a call to be the voice of tech. Oh, that's funny. Oh man, I hope nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's my finders fee? You found Jim Cutler in a world where coffee cups are sold on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve Bomber has been, I find this hard to believe it, Microsoft 30 years ago, June 11th was his  anniversary. He was hired on as its first business manager. You want to guess what his salary was  as the 24th employee at Microsoft? $22,000. No, it was a little more than that. It's 50. $50,000.  $50,000. That's high for Microsoft. Yeah, probably. He has served as the head of operating  systems development operations and sales and support. Of course, he's a CEO today.  Is Steve Bomber good for Microsoft, John C. DeMorac? Well, I wrote an entire column on this for

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Market Watch, I think two weeks ago. So marketwatch.com. You might want to read it.  My thinking is that if you take a look at the graph, in fact Horowitz and I talked about this,  too, if you take a look at the graph that's been going around, oh, look at this compared to Apple,  you don't compare anything to Apple. Apple goes up and down and up and down. And the fact is that  the company was in the toilet when Steve Jobs came around. So now they're trying to make Bomber look  like an idiot because all of a sudden Apple looks so good. Microsoft has actually been flat. But if  you look at anybody else's stock from the year 2000, because Microsoft ramped to 2000, essentially  the stock went flat compared to Yahoo's stock, which took the big dip that everybody else took  when the dot com collapse occurred. It never happened to Microsoft. They stabilized at a very  high level and they kind of stayed there. Yeah, the stock hasn't done anything since the year 2000,  but it's beside the point. The company makes a lot of money and I don't see anybody else running the  company except Bomber. And I think they criticize him because he's pretty much of a screwball. And  he's like, you know, he's he doesn't do anything. He's a character, that's for sure. He doesn't  collect cars. He doesn't do yacht racing. He doesn't do all the stuff that Larry Ellison does. That's  kind of interesting. And so he's kind of a dull guy by comparison. But the fact of the matter is  who would replace him? Nobody. Yeah. Who would want to? Well, that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he'll run for governor of California. Why the hell not? Or Washington. He could definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do better than the person that's up there. But the point is, is that Bomber is always being,  you know, slammed. And it's because he's I think it's because he's relatively uninteresting. And  he's also does this crazy, you know, he did the monkey dance and all the rest of it, which is  developers, developers, developers. But he's, unless they come up with a genius that can do  something wild, I think that, you know, the company is fine. I mean, but you know, the stocks in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it doesn't done anything and never will again. Is it because it's a hard act to follow Bill Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How can you follow Bill Gates? Well, you know, Bill Gates was working with Bomber all those years,  and, you know, they've had other CEOs come and go and Gates is a charismatic character and  Bomber is not. That's the difference. Right. Right. Well, Microsoft, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons they succeeded in this decade is because they were in the sweet spot of  technology, which is selling an operating system, of course, being dominating, dominating computer  operating system and software. But we're moving to the cloud. And I don't know if Microsoft can  make that move very effectively. And I don't know if Microsoft has much of a future in a cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  dominated world. Well, you know, I'm not buying into this cloud is everything. I mean, a couple  of collapses, you know, people losing stuff. I mean, the problem I have with the cloud is not  that it doesn't isn't a good idea for certain things like maybe backups. But the fact of the  matter is you're on some system, let's say Google or some other, you know, program that, you know,  Google, for example, wants you to have to make sure that you use the same exact email address  for everything you do there. So you start doing that, you start getting in the cloud, you're  totally involved with the Google cloud, let's say. And then for some reason or other, because of your  account being compromised or something else that maybe your Gmail account, you start sending out  spam, Google says, Oh, this guy, let's cut him off, you get cut off from the cloud, you cut off,  they just slant and you and who do you call what what customer service exists at Google,  you can have all your stuff pretty much tied up for months on end. I was really, really shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My assistant OMG, Chad wanted a particular account on YouTube. And if you know that was  OMG, Chad, the guy had never used it. And and he was is in the process of trademarking the name.  So we tried to call because the the instructions on the website were very Byzantine, very difficult  to figure out what we're supposed to do. I was shocked at how almost belligerently unhelpful you  could tell that there's, you know, I've worked in a call center before. And you could tell  when there's a culture that's been created, that pretty much says, hey, give them the run  around until they hang up. And this was clearly the case. It was just like, they stated over and  over again, read the paper, read the paper. I'm like, I'm reading the exact article you're pointing  to. It does not answer my question. And you don't get anywhere until you say, can I speak to a  supervisor? And they say, why they're going to tell you the same thing I'm going to tell you.  And it wasn't until I said, I'm sorry, are you refusing to escalate my call to a supervisor,  that they actually listened and did something about it. I was shocked at how unhelpful real

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people were when I called Google. Google's not known for support. In fact, I didn't even know  they had a support. You had to do some searching in order to find something. If you're going to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  into the cloud and do all these promised, you know, these promised services, you better be in the  service. You know, they should find the old group that used to do WordPerfect support. That was  notorious for being unbelievably great. I mean, WordPerfect was never a product that I ever liked,  but it was like people like it just because of the support. Yeah. So you're not alone. The Pew

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Institute, the Pew Center of Research, people, folks for the Internet and American Life Project  said in a survey by 2020, internet users say they will keep their data mostly in the cloud.  However, when asked Chief Scientist Craig Partridge at BBN, which who invented the internet,  by the way, said, I think the big issue will be information privacy. How do you really control  access to your valuable data if it's in the cloud? We've seen this with Facebook. You know, once they  got the data, they kind of do what they want with it. How do you retrieve your prize novel or your

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  business records if the cloud fails? I'm much less worried about the cloud failing than I am worried  about my account being compromised. How about this one? In the last six weeks, I've had two people  send me desperate emails that they were stuck in England and needed me to wire them some money.  Call them all the time. Yep. And it's like once that happens to your cloud account, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're going to, you're screwed. Yep. How about this one? People, we will have a huge blowout.  This is Ray Wang, partner at the Altimeter Group. We'll have a huge blowup with terrorism in the  cloud and people will go back to the PC. People will lose confidence. Terrorists will blow up the  cloud. Cyber attacks cripple major systems. The cloud will be there, but we'll be stuck in hybrid  mode for at least the next 40 years as people live with some level of fear. Is there a way on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google Docs for me to back up a hard copy of everything, like with one click, just one giant  file that I could keep on a physical drive in the event that everything becomes compromised?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should go to the Data Liberation Front. Oh, really? Yeah. This is a Google project,  dataliberation.org. Google realized that this was a real concern, I think, for people  that they were storing their stuff. Google created almost this kind of pirate side organization  whose mission statement is users should be able to control the data they store in any of Google's  products. Our team's goal is to make it easier to move data in and out. They're exactly doing  what you want, which is creating a way for people to get the data out. Now I use Backupify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A bunch of people in the chat room are saying Backupify. So that'll work for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Backupify is pretty amazing. But I think what you're going to see is Google themselves realizing  that they're never going to get people adopting the cloud unless they answer these specific issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Chat room is pointing out you can always save the files locally from the cloud,  but I do not want to go through and save individual files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to Google Docs, there's a button that will save everything as a zip.  Backupify does it automatically. That's manual. I think you should do it automatically.  So Backupify will back up your Gmail, will back up your Flickr. One of the things that made it  easy for me to delete my Facebook account was I've been using Backupify. So every picture and  everything, I didn't have to worry if I had duplicates. I did. But just in case, Google  Docs, Google Calendar, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter all backed up. This is a great service. They were  giving it away for free when I started doing it. Talking about duplicates, is there a program out

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there, a good one that can just plow through your hard disk, look at check sums and dates and  everything, and find all... I mean, I have so many duplicates of various files and especially  columns because I'm always fearful that I'm going to... I have this... I keep a thumb drive actually  with all my work in it. It's like two gigabyte thumb drive I keep in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There you go. That's it. Just keep your data in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like the good thing to do because if the house burns to the ground, you're going to have  your backups go with it, right? That's why I keep spare clothes and water in the car.  Well, I actually keep my spare clothes in water.  There you go. They'll never burn.  But anyway, so the point is that is there some good program that goes through your...  plows through your terabyte hard drive and gives you a list of the backups or the ones  you have too many copies of, five copies, you don't need it.  I'm sure there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That is almost certainly... I think that's going to be a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what? I don't know. Dduper.com.  The clone remover.  Do you just make that up? Is there a Dduper?  Oh, there's a lot. There's a thousand Ddupers.  Well, I tell you what...  There's even Super Dduper.  There's Super Dduper, Booper Scooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll look into it. Maybe I'll ask my Twitter followers.  Duplicate cleaner?  Since you are not taking it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm giving you real stuff. This is all from the chat room. Duplicate cleaner.  I know there's Dduper. I've used that.  Clone remover.  Cool.  But the chat room seems to agree that duplicate cleaner is their favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm seeing a lot of Super Dduper.  I just made that up.  Or they're just making fun of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're making fun of me. Duplicate cleaner from Digital Volcano, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think there's a tremendous market for software that interprets all these duplicates.  Whatever happened to... I heard there was an initiative that Microsoft was working on  a couple of years ago where it would look at all of your pictures, figure out, hey,  all these were taken at around the same time. Compositionally, they all look really similar.  This is clearly a trip you went on and put it in a file and organized them together.  Yeah. Whatever happened to that stuff?  I don't know. I'm waiting for it.  More BS from Microsoft.  I got a bunch of duplicate files and I have no idea what came when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting because we've been given the tools to pump out a lot of data  and it really is easy to create a ton of stuff and we're just not given the tools yet to manage it.  It's the same thing with information on the internet.  I think that the next stage of internet will be how to make sense of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. We need aggregators. We need software...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Curators, aggregators, interpreters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just as Google is the Finder app that allows us to find anything on the internet,  we need the MetaGoogle that will allow us to organize and understand our own data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I talked about this on the radio show today because I think that Google is already seeing  that their days are numbered as a search engine because nowadays, search is not what you want.  Search is too blunt of an instrument. You want somebody to tell you,  what's the hot new thing? What's the great video? What's the place to go?  How would you use Google to find the best clone deduper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What I want is to go to Google.  What I want is to go to Google and find an annoying giant high-res random picture  in the background. If only they would do that.  If only they'd do that for about 12 hours and then pull the plug on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't figure out if it's because they were worried Bing would sue them.  Microsoft tweeted the funniest tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, dude. Yes, that was my favorite moment of the whole thing.  It was Microsoft Europe that put out the exact tweet.  I know you're calling it up right now, but for those who missed it,  for about, I guess it was around midnight on Friday night, I logged in and I was shocked  to see what looked like a terrible crappy ripoff of Bing's nice image background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how that got by Marissa Meyer, who's the keeper of the UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is Google who put out a press release about how they were able to shave one word  off of it because we want to be as clean as possible.  And then they do the most obvious hack ripoff of Bing by throwing tacky, annoying,  busy images in the background. This is the quote right here.  This is the one. This is on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MSEurope, we've lost a background image. If found, please return to bing.com.  This is how you should respond instead of that nasty sniping that Apple and Google are doing  where they're just tweet, make a funny tweet. Well, I tell you, apparently enough people

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  all disliked it. And apparently there was a bug. I didn't even see it. I never got to see it.  Oh, dude. Yeah. And there's apparently a bug that when you try to enable just going back to the  white background, it wouldn't work properly. And people were so upset. And especially for a company  that has built its brand around meaning one thing, precise, fast searches with no BS.  It's like you go, it's very simple, very crisp, very fast. And you get exactly what you want  to do something that's so out of character and so obviously an attempt to borrow inspiration from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the competition. I like Bing. I like the, I mean, but this is Bing. It's already done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does anybody think it was a joke? Because Microsoft or Google is always pulling crazy stunts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not in this case. And one of the articles I read-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, by the way, look, so it's popular on Bing right now. World Cup results,  VanderSloot, Tony Awards and Vuvuzela.  We have a title for the show. By the way, I think it's Vuvuzela. I've been saying it wrong all this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  time. You got to remember that Bing has a person carefully curate what images they put on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do as the Romans do now. It's confederations cup time. And if you're in South Africa, whether you  like it or not, you got to do the Vuvuzela. The confed cup has moved a cross section of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  soccer lovers into the stadium, but not everyone has been entirely happy with the icon of SA soccer

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  culture. And please do not blow the Vuvuzela. That's like an internet moment right now. You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like, please stop retweeting that link. Please. Please close your Mifi and do not blow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would think we next WWDC, next Steve Jobs keynote, we should all bring Vuvuzelas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't imagine anything going wrong with that. Please do not blow the Vuvuzela.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, they didn't stop for the Vuvuzela. And neither did the live bloggers for WWDC.  So crazy idea. I think there's no explanation about why Google would even consider doing this.  It just doesn't make it so uncharacteristic. I'd love to know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They wanted to showcase the fact that you could add a background image if you want.  But the thing is, again, Bing has a person deciding on a balanced image that fits the layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could it be that they are somehow threatened by Bing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It certainly looked that way. And I don't think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What if somebody hacked them and they didn't want to admit it? Or if it was a joke?  No, they clearly said- I don't see why everybody wants to  bypass this concept. It was only up for two hours.  No, it was up for 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But John, you know why we want to bypass this? Because if it were true, it would be terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, if it was a hack, it was one that involved sending out a press release on behalf of Google  saying, we've added a grand new feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is actually a pretty good idea for a hack, for a hoax. Send out a press release, do the hoax.  Why would they add this as a feature anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, again, competition with Bing. People like it on the Bing.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounds like the parking lot after a Raiders game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Okay, we're going-

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You got to keep that bookmarked every time. Every time conversation gets boring, you just play that.  You want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, so Google will not be putting- I guess they've changed their minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's get back to this other issue which came up and which I think is important,  because I bring it up a lot and I'm going to keep bringing it up, which is the death of these  search engines. If they can't deal with SEO, the fact- My example is you try to find-  besides trying to find the D-duper, I've always tried to find the world's best weed whacker,  the little thing with the string that spins around. You can't do it because everyone's  selling these things, and so they have SEO guys come in and they pump it up.  Nobody can do a comparison because if it's on Google, if you look it up,  you'll find it's on page 80. You'll never get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I guess I don't know what website you would go to to get comparisons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's probably a hundred of these weed whackers, and yeah, every site will have-  maybe there's a few legitimate sites that will compare five of them. It's useless.  It's just ridiculous. I know there's a matrix out there somewhere that where somebody's  compared all a hundred of them, I'll never find it. That's what Google's supposed to do for me,  but most of these sites are like, well, let's then seeing it included in all these guys,  they sell these things. It's all commercial. I can't find the data,  and Google has done nothing about this. They fight it off as best they can with anti-SEO  concepts, but the SEO guys are beating the crap out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but I think it goes even farther than SEO. I think it really goes to the nature of  how we get information on the internet. I think a search engine is a blunt instrument for finding  information that was good in the early days, but now because of real time, because of curation and  aggregation, basically, I don't think it's just SEO. There's just too much crap on the internet,  and a simple search, as good as Google can get page rank, I don't think a simple search is going  to be enough. That's why you need human editors. That's why I think Google's added Twitter to its  search results. If you search for World Cup on Google, you will get not only some traditional  Google search results, but you'll get a live real time Twitter stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's part of the reason I've started doing searches and actually putting quotes around  actually asking the question, because I don't necessarily think it'll leave me to the answer  directly, but surely somebody else has asked this question in a public forum. A lot of times,  you get the Yahoo Answers, which comes up, and sometimes you get good answers, sometimes you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't. And John, we've gone through this before. Remember, there were link farms where a real  problem on Twitter a few years ago. It's all you'd ever get is a link farm.  For Google, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, Google, not Twitter. Yeah. And so I think that that's part of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the Parker sites used to come up all the time.  And they finally beat them back. But these commercial sites that are all over the place.  I mean, another one, try to find anybody out there, go to Google and type in,  find the best cell phone, mobile phone plan. Just put that in your search and see what you get.  You'll get thousands and thousands of hits for people that are with bogus sites,  phony baloney, they're selling mobile phone services. And it's just like, it's impossible.  And what else-  Well, and that's what-  Yeah, I can find Leo Laporte, and that's about all I can find on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. It's good for data objects, but not for more abstract concepts. And by the way,  that's the point of Bing. Bing was exactly that, or at least that's how Microsoft sold it, the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just Google warmed over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it isn't, because it's so hard to do algorithmically. Really, the way to do it  is with humans. And that's to me why Twitter, the success of Twitter, truthfully, the success  of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wonder what the critical mass is. There's some basic number of followers that I bet if you have  it, when you shout out a random question, the odds become in your favor that somebody will happen to  know the result. Now, I try not to abuse it, but oh my God, if I want a direct answer about something,  you ask it over Twitter and you get highly curated, valuable responses out of the crowd,  the wisdom of the crowds.  Yeah. Or you just get a vuvuzela.  Yeah, forget the cloud. I'm all about the crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crowd. I'm with you. I'm with you. And I think that that's where we're going to see. That's  the next stage. And I imagine that Google is running scared a little bit because their dominance  is threatened by humans, oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The irony to this whole thing is that's the way Yahoo started.  Right.  And then they gave up on it.  Algorithmic search has its limits.  Yahoo owned the place if they had stuck to their guns and not brought in Semel or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are they not doing the Yahoo Answers anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, not the Answers. The original Yahoo Answers.  He means the director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's actually having people physically make the directory. Yeah, of course.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I don't know if that works either. But that's, I think, probably what Mahalo is all about,  Yahoo Answers. I think that's probably the idea is human powered search.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But even if Google were to add something very simple, like a dig-like effect where every time  you got a search that gave you obvious SEO, you could just tag it. And if enough people  would weigh it down, you would bring in that human element. But I don't know enough about  their wizardry to know if that would work with their plan or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a site, we interviewed them on Net at Night called Aardvark that was the same idea.  It was kind of a recommendation search where you would, and Google bought them, by the way,  you would ask questions and then they would, your social graph would answer the questions.  And what happened is Google said, oh, good, and bought them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, Patrick Norton has been sending me direct messages saying he wanted in.  Oh, we'll get them on.  He wanted to know if we were still on. He says he's been trying to call.  I'm sorry, Patrick.  I don't know what it says about me, but he said, yeah, I knew you'd still be on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Press this button here. Press that button there. He should show up magically.  So a couple more stories. Did you see the Twitter account, the fake  British Petroleum Twitter account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dude, been following it for a while.  Hysterical.  Wizards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brilliant. BP wants Twitter to put a disclaimer on there. They can't get them to shut it down.  I'm sure they've tried.  There he is, Patrick Norton. Hey, Patrick.  Hey. Thank you for coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I got your email so late.  No, it's my fault. I should have emailed you sooner.  I was looking at my emails. I'm packing a boat up and I'm like, oh, I have a chance to be on Twitter.  Oh, I wish you hadn't done that. You could come on any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope it didn't ruin your day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no. I just, I just, I'm just really happy I finally broke down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's the little box that you stick on your dashboard that you put on?  The little board that goes beep when you go under the bridge tunnels.  Oh, you have a fast track.  Finally broke down. I got a fast track.  You didn't have one before?  Well, the man could track me with a fast track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're very privacy conscious. I didn't know that. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's amazing. I actually, I lost a lot of time. The baseball game let out and everything around 3rd Street was full of Giants fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were they playing the Vuvuzela?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what they, there was some singing going on from the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually can do it now, but it's B flat.  There it is. You saw this. This is an image somebody put in the chat room. What game is that, Brian? Look up on the monitor over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that's the Ocarina of Time. That looks like Link there doing the...  You played...  That's a Legend of Zelda game right there.  Legend of Zelda. See, see, you know these things.  See, this is good. I passed my first test. I'm in for the E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can now go to E3 with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're right. BP Global PR, the Twitter account, was asked to put a disclaimer to make it clear that this was not actually BP.  So they put, quote, we are not associated with Beyond Petroleum, the company that has been destroying the Gulf of Mexico for 52 days.  The new disclaimer now reads...  Beyond Petroleum?  Yeah, well, that's what the ads all say. I don't know if they actually changed their names from British Petroleum to Beyond Petroleum.  So what is the fake account? BP...  BP Global PR. The actual one is BP underscore America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not killing animals in the Gulf. We're creating fossils in the Gulf.  Have a little perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To create new fossil fuels. See? You're part of the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I love it. Every one of them has the hashtag BP Cares.  Just dump 40,000 barrels of free $25 BP Cares t-shirts into the Gulf.  Now, the interesting thing is that the fine for British Petroleum, somewhere around $60 million, the fine for Limewire for stealing music over a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the difference is in BP's defense, the government has capped liability for this. That's part of that.  Whenever you get government involved with this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The government has capped claims of lost business. They have a cap on the amount of lost business they can pay.  There is no cap on what they can pay or potentially find.  To fix things.  Interesting.  There's a difference. They're only required to subsidize lost business due to the oil leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the RIAA wants a billion dollars from Limewire. And I'm sure Limewire is just sitting on a billion dollars.  Could just write a check, make that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could say Limewire's lawyers aren't nearly as good as the ones...  The Pirate Base lawyers.  The relationship to the government isn't nearly as good as, say, the entire oil industry's relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, isn't there, talking about the RIAA, Hillary Rosen? Doesn't she work for BP now?  Yeah, that's what I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Former president of the RIAA, Hillary Rosen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Certainly the spokesperson for the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who then went to work, I think, for Obama and is now working for BP. Well, that's interesting.  She is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I am also certain. I could be very...  Maybe Google can help us.  Wait. Yeah, it says Hillary Rosen, first the RIAA, now BP. Hyperbot.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She works for a strategy group in D.C.  She's at Brunswick Group.  I think she left Brunswick and started her own firm and then ended up at a place called rchart.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For an encore, Ms. Rosen, in her capacity as a managing partner for the London PR firm,  the Brunswick Group has been hired by BP to put a pretty face on the oil spill in the Gulf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they couldn't find a better person for that, let me tell you.  Wow. Geez, Louise. She was responsible for the dismantling of Napster,  for the passage of the DMCA. She initiated the Grokster lawsuit.  She got the Performance Right Act passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The rest of the article sums it up by saying,  whether you want to listen to music or live on a planet not poisoned by corporate greed,  Hillary Rosen is there to say, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. She's like that tobacco industry spokesman. Thank you for smoking.  I mean, she's just like... There's some people just... They don't care.  We're going to take a break, come back with more. Thank you for joining us. Patrick Norton,  the host of Tekzilla. Tekzilla.com is here.  Glad to be here.  So nice to see you and talk to you. We'll find out what the latest is with Patrick.  He's also the host of one of our new shows on the Twitter,  This Week in Computer Hardware.  Mr. Ryan Schratten. I show up from time to time.  Yeah, it's fun when you show up.  It's a great show. In fact, I used to do it with Ryan.  I used to do it with Ryan. And when I stopped, it was great because when I did the screensavers,  I was really up on hardware. You and I, you covered it and so I was able to keep up on it.  And then I stopped following it. And so it's really nice to do Twitch because  there's a lot of changes going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to work really hard to keep up with Ryan because Ryan's on top of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's John C. Dvorak's... Must be time for a commercial.  You know who's in the studio with us, Patrick, is the old voice of Tech TV, Jim Cutler.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah. Say hi to Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Dude, you and I wrote an article together a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know that?  A long time ago.  Oh, you remember that?  Like nine years ago, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like nine years ago. And I kept thinking,  Patrick Norton, what's the anti-virus guy doing with me?  And then we did Tech TV and then I found the magazine and I said, holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick Norton in the house.  Hey, we're going to continue on in just a second with This Week in Tech and our hosts.  But I got to tell you about backup and I got to tell you about something for business from  You've heard me talk about Carbonite, the offsite backup that does such a great job.  It's automatic, runs in the background every time you're connected to the internet  without slowing you down or your computer.  It's a must have for everybody who's got data.  You will lose a hard drive. You will lose a computer.  You will lose your backups.  At some point, having an offsite backup is critical.  Even more so in business.  Just do a thought experiment with me.  Close your eyes for a minute.  Imagine what would happen if you...  Maybe there's a fire at your business and you lost your data and you lost your backups.  You lost everything.  How would you recover that data?  How would you get back to business?  How long would it take?  How much money would you lose?  A great backup is critical and you got to do it offsite so that if the worst happens,  you still can get that data back.  That's why I recommend Carbonite Pro.  Go to carbonitepro.com.  You could try it free for 30 days.  Back up every seat in the house, all your employees' computers,  centralized dashboards so you know how it's doing, and affordable.  Absolutely.  If you go to carbonitepro.com, you could see how affordable.  18 computers.  This is an example.  Five gigabytes on each computer, just $50 a month.  Eight computers with five gigabytes per computer, just $25 a month.  It's simply the most affordable way to back up your office.  Now you can try it free for 30 days.  And I have to say, I did the 30-day trial just to see how it was.  Really great.  Really helpful.  They gave you a lot of information, sent you emails saying,  here's how's it going?  What can we do?  carbonitepro.com.  Try it free for 30 days.  carbonitepro.com.  Brand new from Carbonite.  We thank you for their support of this week in tech.  Twitter says, it's been crashing a lot this week.  They call them site availability issues.  Networking problem.  They said it was some networking gear bit us in the butt.  Problems were going on throughout the week.  It's interesting.  Twitter's been much better of late.  I didn't really notice any problem this week,  but apparently teams are responding to this incident.  There are no details on what network hardware.  But I have to say, Twitter's been pretty good of late.  And I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know, it crashed on me a couple of times this week.  What do you use to tweet?  I use the website.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How lame is that?  That's so sad.  Well, you know what we say to people who say that?  We say, blow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I was waiting for it.  Wait, wait, wait for it.  Wait for it.  Try again.  Yeah, could it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't hold it down long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Boofazella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're a sick man.  Blow me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's very-  That's a musical.  By the way, that's blowme.co.za.  If you'd like to participate in the blowout.  Do you guys use WikiLeaks?  Are you familiar with WikiLeaks?  I think WikiLeaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm familiar with it by reputation only.  I don't usually head on over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge asset to the United States, founded by an Australian,  who by the way, does not publish his name,  because he publishes some really steamy stuff.  John, do you ever use WikiLeaks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a front for the CIA.  I do.  They don't know-  I mean, the guy that got busted just recently,  he's talked about how he gave more of that video.  He gave him other videos and then also a bunch of other things,  and WikiLeaks never ran any of that stuff,  and they're not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, according to the Daily Beast at ABC News,  Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts  of Julian Assange, the Australian-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't the guy recently on some TV show?  How hard can he be to find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're worried he's going to publish a huge cache of classified  State Department cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's the giveaway.  We talk about this on No Agenda today, by the way.  Cables?  What is it?  What State Department cables?  It's random.  Well, it's a very important telegram, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't say it was from this century, John.  Hitler is attacking.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dateline 2010.  Stop.  Important cables leaked over the intertubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leaked by a 22-year-old Army intelligence specialist,  Bradley Manning of Pertel, McMaryland, who is now in custody.  And the feds are worried because they say these cables  are prepared by diplomats and State Department officials  throughout the Middle East,  regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders.  Sounds like it could be pretty embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we heard from other sources that the cables are mostly about  Vatican and pedophiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that would be even more embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, and shocking.  What?  Yes, we were stunned.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What?  There's gambling going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like your winning, sir.  Well, when they come for me, I hope you'll do more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was that you guys today were talking, John,  about the dangers of sitting.  This report direct from the No Agenda newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is evidence that sitting alters metabolism.  It changes the way the body metabolizes fat and sugars in the body.  It increases the risk of diabetes, causes higher blood pressure,  increases the risk of developing dangerous abdominal fat.  She sounds like she's having a hard time keeping from laughing as she says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She sounds like she's about to laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cancer, endometrial cancer, causes a decrease in bone density.  So it increases the risk of osteoporosis.  It's harmful to vascular health, affects brain function.  And overall, research is showing that more time spent sitting  is related to an increase in deaths from all causes.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She could not sound happier as she delivers that very grim news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what the real problem is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this actually is legit, but it's not new.  This has been around for a while.  Yeah, people have been sitting for years.  It's just in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Breathing keeps you alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, sometimes you feel like sitting.  The real problem is that if you're standing, you can't play the vuvuzela.  Oh, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's the real...  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My vuvuzela is broken.  That's... we just drew the Monopoly card.  Technical error in your favor.  No vuvuzela.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Seriously?  It's... oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is the story with that, John?  It's just some random piece of crap that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, we related it to some information that appeared on  the Whitehouse.gov site, some of the things Obama's trying to do.  It's all connected, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sitting, Obama, BP, health care.  I think we've cracked the code right here, John.  It's all connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That lazy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Wave, anybody still talking about Google Wave?  One year in, it was announced at Google I.O. a year and two weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh my God, it was a year and two weeks ago?  A year and two weeks ago.  Wave coming out.  I've used Wave once and I found it novel to watch somebody else typing on it.  And have never used it again.  I was like, hey, look at you, you're making an update.  It was novel.  Real time.  It was novel like the Wiimote and about as impactful.  What are you talking about?  Well, I think all of this is a fad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian, I just want to say you're about to go to E3.  You might not want to talk too much crap about the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know. I will state very directly, I'm highly skeptical.  I hope I get proven very, very wrong.  I hope I walk out, you know, totally invasion of this body snatchers where I'm like, you know,  Natal, who needs controllers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you said Vuvuzela.  This is a story for you, John C. Dvorak.  According to the American Association for the Advancement of Retired People,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  25% of older Americans are using social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I would think that's probably a good thing for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is people 50 and older.  I guess I'm in that group too.  Well, you use social media.  I use social media.  Half of those surveyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't get away from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a great flow chart in Esquire this month that basically helps you decide  whether or not you're too old to be using social media with a bunch of particularly  brilliant Donald Rumsfeld references inside of it.  Basically like, are you too old to use Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I am.  I think I am.  You have to use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have children.  How do you track children without being on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually quit Facebook.  Don't use it.  Don't know anything about it.  Face what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you did this with Twitter too and you came groveling back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll admit, you know what?  I realized that how can I cover Facebook without a Facebook account?  So I have created a new Facebook account.  Not that I'm going to use it, but I just because I, for one thing,  I want to see what are the default privacy settings today if you create a new Facebook account.  That accounts to sit in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Define privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privacy what?  How?  They're okay.  They're okay.  I think the biggest thing, and I wish that when  Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher last week at the D conference interviewed the sweaty Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sweaty Mark?  Is that the name he's going by these days?  Sweaty Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Sweaty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was really sweaty.  I wish they had asked him a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you would be too, Leo, if you had those two sitting across from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding.  They were tough on him and they finally released the full video,  so I was able to watch the full video.  I thought he was more responsive than he was given credit for, but they pressed him,  but they never did get an answer for him.  The biggest thing that bugged me, which is that as soon as they made this last policy change,  if you had interests, what are your interests in that?  It actually joined you to everything you had your interests as.  Somebody was in the studio last week and said that he had put in his interests something like,  I'm not interested, and neither should you.  And he was joined, they made up a group called I'm Not Interested,  and a group called And Neither Should You.  Brilliant.  And joined him to it.  So it just shows you how stupid, but it's a public group.  So if you put, my interest is in, I don't know, baby butchery.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'd make up a public group called Baby Butchery, and you'd be the sole member,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and that'd be pretty embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hundreds of mildly obscene things are being created in fake Facebook accounts  right now because of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody in the chat room is now cranking out these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also part of-  Don't put baby lover.  You're right.  But it's also part of Facebook trying to keep on top of search engine optimization  to own categories, and most importantly, to allow its advertisers to directly mark people  in certain areas.  Because if they create a group and 100,000 people join it, then suddenly they are the  place to advertise for nothing or weasels or 195 millimeter profile tires or whatever it is.  And Facebook's always been about do it and then ask forgiveness later if you manage to  piss off enough of the user group.  And the truth is, is they haven't even really pissed off the user group.  I think it got to the point where they're starting to get worried about the eventual  stock price based on the ass kicking they were getting in the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't about real users.  It was about the press, and that's what they said.  I take you now to Bluff City, Tennessee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dateline 2010, Bluff City, Tennessee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just over the cables comes the following from Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian McCrary, 33, receives a speeding ticket.  But after receiving the $90 speeding ticket for cruising through what he called a police  speed trap, he tried to go to the Bluff City Police Department's website.  He wanted to reschedule his hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He said, see you here, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When he noticed something unusual, the site's content had been replaced with a notice saying  the domain name was on the verge of expiring.  He saw an opportunity.  He waited a few weeks until the name had lapsed, then he bought it.  He says, I really thought the city would renew it.  I was surprised to find it was still out there.  I was surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was overjoyed to find out it was still out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so he bought the site, whatever it is, Bluff City Police Department dot com.  And he posted stories about speed cameras, features comments from other camera critics.  It's basic.  He's gotten a thousand unique visitors.  It's phenomenal.  He says, I hope this will attract the attention of the local representatives to get the cameras  removed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, he said he said that once it hit the story hit the news wires.  Ninety five thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bluff City Police Chief David Nelson said he didn't even know they'd lost the domain  name.  We have a website.  Until somebody told him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they can get their website back if they give him his money back for the  speeding ticket and then take it off his record.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The chief of police says, I feel like he's throwing it out of revenge because he got  a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She chief Wiggums is in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, you know, the web domain was hosted by GoDaddy.  I got a call.  I got a call from Brian Parsons.  I haven't returned it yet.  What's his name?  Parsons, Bob Parsons.  Bob Parsons.  Yeah, I should play it.  You want I'll tell you what, I'll give it to you, John.  You could play it on no agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Email it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the what is the privacy if somebody leaves a voicemail message?  Is that become public?  I mean, I could I then play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, there's no expectation that it's not being recorded.  I think clearly what it says, please leave a message at this recording clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would imagine you have very little.  Yeah, Chief Wiggums said I had no idea to run out.  I'm sure I will probably be able to get it back.  She has some good domain registration.  Lou.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go Daddy says once a name expires, it's fair game from anyone who wants to snap it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which they make it sound like that's an unusual policy.  But when a domain name expires, it is nobody owns it at that moment.  And it is clear that there's a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't there some grace?  There's a grace period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that was the grace period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and they said what they do is they send an email warning.  And if they don't get any response or interest from the email warning,  then they actually put that message up on the website because they figure maybe you've  changed your address.  And let me tell you, I almost I registered schwood.com with Network Solutions.  Is that who the original ones were back in the day?  And I registered for five years.  And of course, I had gone through like five different email addresses since then.  And they still had an old one.  I almost lost my primary domain.  And it was just dumb luck that I went to check the settings.  And I happened to figure out that they were sending stuff to the wrong email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to ABC, who talked to General Counsel for Go Daddy, Christine Jones,  the police chief didn't understand how the domain name worked and his tech guy was out sick.  And it lapsed.  Somebody else got it.  So we hope the tech guy is feeling better.  And we hope that Chief Wiggum gets his domain name back.  And we hope that the guy's ticket is refunded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because that'll happen at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chief Wiggum said before the camera was installed, there were nine to 13 accidents  in that area every month.  So I guess they really didn't need a speed camera there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Folks, we are...  They're finding out that most of these speed cameras,  especially in San Francisco, are causing more accidents.  Because people speed up to avoid them?  I definitely have almost caused an accident.  Slamming on the brakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh.  Because I think to myself, and it's like, you know, I usually have my show gear in the back of the truck  and I hear it all clanging around behind me.  Oh, that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe if you drove the speed limit, this would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that just is.  I live on a road that has stoplights and has a 65 mile an hour speed limit.  So it's like, I'm doing 65 and you see yellow.  And there's a stoplight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not good.  They should...  The two should not combine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a couple in Napa Valley on the road of 29, I think, that are like 55 mile an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right.  Yeah, you're right.  Hey, we're out of time.  I thank you so much, Brian Brushwood, for being here.  Brian's going to head down to LA with us to cover E3.  Our coverage starts tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.  5.30 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm already shopping for the bottle.
