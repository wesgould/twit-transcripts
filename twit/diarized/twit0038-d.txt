Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Breakdown works for me, and you know that's every bit as good as being in there. Yeah, it is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on. It's it's a it's an Apple keynote which means there's gonna be applause at every announcement  Yes  There's gonna be a huge number of basically engineers and Mac employees in the back to make sure if there's no clapping and clapping starts  At the back and moves it way forward  They take the journalists and they bury him in the middle or off to the sides of that they're surrounded by enthusiastic people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're brilliantly mad. Oh, you think you're so smart the Apple people were in front this time

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They were all over

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ever seen those old Betty Boop cartoons  But the audience is that they show typically with a Betty Boop cartoon with everyone's clapping and jumping up and down hippopotamuses and whatever  It's pretty much the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  So there was a hippopotamus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a tutu yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve was kind of down today. I think he was actually sick you think he was down. No. I think he was sick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was slow he kept referring to his notes which kind of surprised me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spoke a couple of times and that is not like Steve. Yeah, I mean he would if if Steve could clone himself  He would have fired himself for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have to say that the anticipation is in stark contrast to the keynotes at CES  Which were really duds the anticipation beforehand the excitement people were running they had the usher saying slow down  You're all gonna get in people were running to get in it felt like you know a festival seating in an Aerosmith concert

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's get in there. Yeah, that's very typical  But I you know actually if you've seen a lot of Steve Jobs keynotes you kind of noticed that he's most of times  Okay, we got great stuff to show you today was like  We have some  March on few things and he coughed a few times he was yeah and and I thought there were some good stuff  Announced today, but he really wasn't kind of delivering that this is incredible and look at this and look at this  And I don't think it was because of the nature of the products

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But rather I think he was sort of feeling under the weather let's kind of was afraid of being hugged by Otellini again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now well, that's why he had that suit on we're gonna get to the Otellini thing because I think there was a major faux pas  That happened there with Intel  But I'm also very interested in the Intel Apple relationship because it's not exactly what I would have thought but we're gonna get to that  Let's start at the beginning and work our way item by item through John's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now  Couple of okay first of all people here I start 855 people are taking their seats

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The crowds going wild look at that this is unbelievable. No, let's talk about some of the numbers because he did announce some

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  spectacular sales figures a hundred sold every minute through the quarter 42 million iPods sold since it was first released

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40,000 five and in the past quarter they sold whatever 14 million 14 well 4.5 during the holiday

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, you're blowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Million I thought that's right. You're right. It's 4.5 in holiday 2004 14 million for that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See that's what Steve got a big a lot out of that. I said you have to take notes anymore. This is so cool  John's in a journalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mac rumors life for doing this for that's wait a minute 14 million iPods sold and all of them by the way video iPods  Right Oh except for the Nanos and the shuffles, but but a lot of video  I  Didn't give but that means a lot of video iPods at a 42 million iPods out there is pretty stunning also  What were some of the other numbers he said 83% market share did a huge quarter 850 million songs  8 million videos in the iTunes music they'll be there'll be a billion songs in about a month and a half about six weeks  You know that stuff it doesn't knock me out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think what's amazing is how many iPods they've sold discuss in the eight at 918 a.m. He discussed the Jeep Dodge iPod integration  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That gives it see the problem with that list is it it's not there's no you know  There's no kind there's no weight to it. He didn't spend a long time  But most people just want facts facts facts. All right, give us some facts more facts. Well, I think that's about it  Nothing else to announce it's you know, the rest of its applause and now you can see this word  All right, he did show the software  Okay, let's talk about I life Oh six because I think that there was some neat neat stuff in that including the ability to podcast  Directly from garage band. Yeah, that's really cool. You press a button and it's a podcast uploaded the app iTunes music store and  What Amber and I realized is we sat there doing a podcast and of course they shut us down

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What did you do? Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If that's for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went over to the we start playing with the new iMac which is by the way  Well, we haven't got to that yet. They don't know about it. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about just talking about what some of the highlights were that as you saw them? Let's talk. All right, I like  Alright, you want to talk about it. Oh, you're all over the map

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John bought me wine implied me with liquor. I feel like  glass  I'm looped. We had a call for Odley. I'm legally drunk. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, Odley knee at exactly 1010 first of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all some no not Odley knee some smoke comes out right and a guy in a bunny suit appears  You know nine a guy in a bunny. So if you're gonna do this with a whole show, I'm gonna have to take that away  Through the through the whole the guy comes out in a bunny suit and you don't know who it is and he's carrying a big chip  He's practically gets down on his knees to Steve and says here we are delivering you the chip  And then he takes off his hat now  I knew it was Paul Odley knee but at no point did anybody say this is the chairman of Intel Corporation here  It could have been some guy from the fab and they never and and Stephen say ladies gentlemen Paul Odley knee from Intel  They never did you see anything crisp green? Did they CG it? They never they said Paul Odley knee on the screen  Oh, I must have missed it. Yeah, they did say that. Yeah  Well, never there goes the story sorry well  No, it doesn't because I mean and then at the end they say goodbye Paul and then that's when I figured out  It was some guy named Paul. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was Paul McCartney

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe Leo has the feeling that he was stiffed. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thought he was stiff. But now I see that it sounds like he was too  He wasn't if they put it up on the screen, but they did pretty quickly put it up on the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was no hug  There was no hug was no hug and they hugged before so the last time they had Odley knee up there  There was kind of the the brotherly very male hug  But well come down here sir and I'd be happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well for anyone listening to the rate are to the podcast that was disgusting so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you kind of need a 45 degree angle  To make that okay and but and also again, I think Steve was sick and so it only he had the suit on and oh  That's the bunny suit. I think that was it. You know, he said, you know Paul, he said to Paul  Look, I'm not feeling my best and only said look  You know, I'm having a hard enough time kind of this relationship to begin with you know, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the this was the kind of I thought the subtext of the whole thing was that Intel was surprisingly  Dossa I thought that they really acted like in fact they allowed  I don't know how this happened Apple to do an ad that  Essentially said the Intel chip has been trapped inside of PCs all this time. Finally, it's free. Yes  That's the ad no no sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do see that Intel's very happy about this. I mean surprisingly so and if I were Bill Gates, I'd be a little bit miffed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Bill Gates has been working

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Bill Gates Bill Gates and in basically with the Microsoft and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five or six years that's where I actually longer than that. Well, yeah, and this is apparent  This was I mean this wasn't ever since the Windows hardware  Developers conference and the Intel developer for us split and started promoting whatever version that Intel thought the hardware industry should go versus whatever  Direction Microsoft. So is this the honeymoon phase or do you think that there really is it gonna be a love match between?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel and Apple I think it's just  maneuvering for best position just depending on you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Hey Bill decides to you know flip the switch and say screw you guys right we got we got IBM and they've managed to  Manufacture a bunch of powers PCs for our software granted. It's in a game console  But I think it's a situate wouldn't that be funny if Windows suddenly went over to the power PC side

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With the Xbox the Xbox, but I think essentially you're just dealing with a vendor who's dealing with a typical Silicon Valley  Semiconductor company  And these guys tend to be kind of  Crummy to each other they're mean and I think you're gonna see a fight take place and I think within the long run  Here's a you know, I only year everyone comes a you've been predicting this Intel thing forever  And so I'm gonna predict something new. I think that Apple is gonna switch to AMD within two and a half years  Hey  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If AMD can deliver a mobile  Well, you know, that's that's the only missing piece of the puzzle

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's that's the only missing piece of the puzzle with AMD there's no mobile part  So right now there's no okay mobile part not a great not as good as in Intel's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's jump to the chase then I mean now obviously the Apple announced  It a new laptop the Mac core book duo  The power we for dual I can't what is the name of it Mac book pro  Is that not the worst name you ever heard the Mac book pro yeah the pro book

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Why don't they just call it a Macintosh laptop anyway, so the Mac book pro which I still can't remember the name of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But which is a pretty impressive product and the and the new iMac which is kind of depressing me because here's this not  You know this cheap 1299 computer that's faster than my dual g5  tower  Oops, I mean it's depressing. I mean and we went over and played with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really fast the new iMacs you can order you'll get it by this weekend  I want you to buy one because the price will go I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One time he bought one of those cubes and that I still have the continued at the next night the day the same day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought it they discontinued. I got home and they discontinued  You know they just waited for you to put out your credit card  They did but no Alex Lindsay and I are sitting watching the keynote and we practically we were ready to vault over the chairs and  Run to the Apple store, and then he says but not the power the Mac power Mac book pro  Core duo won't be available until February, so I was disappointed, but I think I'll probably buy one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm gonna get one for sure look great. Yeah, they're beautiful Chris preem would you who's got the cash to buy a $2,000 notebook oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on. That's nothing you're not gonna wait for the revision fee well. That's the question should we yes, I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got the right. I'm not gonna wait. This is their first Intel product. I wouldn't I'm certainly gonna pimp my employer for one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think look at they are I am not kidding. They are  Spectacularly faster, I mean this is by the three-year warranty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And remember don't ever throw it away because when it breaks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll release the fix and the recall after you that happened to me with the iBook yeah  I know what you're talking about you don't have to look at me like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to rub it in this is the no yeah the voice of notebooks past

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well I mean I'm just I have to say  This the speed of this what the first thing it makes me think is Apple's been lying to us about the g5 all this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait wait we've been telling you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fastest computer in the world it's so powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exported I think the one that my favorite that was the snail with the Intel chip glued on the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna live to regret that one, but I mean it's palpably faster means that so you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What applications are you running and how is that well the parent you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all you got to run the native apps which means anything with OS 10 is all native now  noticeably faster launch times  Launch ifo they the sample machines they had on the table there had six thousand photos now if you've ever used I photo with six  Thousand photos go and take a break because it's doesn't you can't do anything with it this thing  I made the thumbnails as small as possible scroll through the entire thing like that like butter like butter  That's Steve Steve was sick because he coined that phrase that scrolls like butter  How exactly does that scroll Steve must have been under the weather because that was like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What did I just say  Gross he was in another world  Yeah, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Butter firewire is in there, but firewire 800 is not in the laptop. Yeah, they pulled that out so  They do have PC X PCI Express  In the laptop which is good news cuz that I guess is that on the PC card hey someday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There'll be a PCI Express mini card. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that's good news maybe  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's only one there's only one firefire 400 port though  I mean it is a little bit stripped down in that respect FM tuner on the iPod  final I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carry around an iPod so I don't have to listen to the crappy radio and say I agree  Except for pirate cat radio 87.9, please FCC don't kill them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we should get all that in there, okay, so as so in the iTunes store now you can buy Saturday night live

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Old stuff yeah the whole presentation. I kept thinking of the yes Steve jobs spoof from Saturday night live at the beginning  I couldn't get that out of my head at the beginning. I kept thinking he was joking with all the numbers the iPod piqueno

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I  Wish I could erase that for my mind. Do you think that'll be for sale or will Steve ban it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I thought he was gonna show it. I think it's done a bunch of Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Paradise the best one I like is where they make the I know which is essentially a digital version of a post-it note  But they come in the same size stack

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody at the end of these things always says well, what did you think of this thing?  What was it like and I thought this was a very nutritious sort of keynote?  It's it's stuff that's good for you  Well, you know what I mean is say I mean there's like a lot of good protein and carbohydrates in there  So like there was no new iPod which is like glittering it goes oh that is so great  It does this it lights up and it does that and this was all stuff that needed to be done  We all knew about the Intel transition. Okay good. Now. We've got some Intel machines. That's good. We've done that  Ilife oh six was necessary and expected we all knew that was gonna be coming along. So, okay here it is and every so often every  Four keynotes maybe jobs kind of delivers on what needs to be done. This wasn't particularly flashy  But it was a good solid. I don't know. I thought it was really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think these Intel iMacs are and I was a snake there  I mean you knew you had a you had to talk me down. I was on a ledge. Yeah, you're bad  It's all over and and now maybe I've swung too far the other way. Maybe I'm bipolar you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or a tripolar perhaps. I think many many holes. Yeah, you may have swung too far

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's even I was this look at I said it Rosetta won't you know the emulation?  That's gonna be a pig even word runs very nicely on these in emulation. Hmm cuz you need that speed to operate or well  It's not challenging. I  Just it felt like a much faster computer Safari. Look Safari. Let's face it has always been the Achilles heel of  The Macintosh people switch to Mac and say but what's with the browser? It's so slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fire because they didn't use Internet Explorer back in the day. Well, even Firefox is slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the apples just are not use opera no nothing's fast on a Mac except now  Actually Safari is snake. He means browsers the rest of the snow browser  Why is it the browsers were slow on the Mac? I don't understand that tell me ask him  Ask him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bad processors, yeah, I think so  That's what I took away from the entire thing was that these are all upgrades that were necessary to get them up to speed  With everything that we weren't competitive side of things. We were not competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's something simple superior operating system and cleaner applications, but they were running on a bad hardware, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sure the people a free scale which should be here. They've been playing with dual core now for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why free scale two years? I know there was a did that and there's so many but now now we're finally starting to see the software

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is really a good time for Apple to jump into it, right?  Now the developers are actually taking advantage of it for a the new consoles for gaming but on top of that  It's also just all the other applications that can be ported over like encoding  I can't wait to see well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chris Breen, aren't you jumping up and down? Does this make you in any way excited you write for a Macintosh magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please help me out here. It's like an editor. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can no I am but I kind of  I've been to enough Steve Jobs keynotes that I'm all I always walk out going that sounds really really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was no nano there. There was nothing there that would just make you  He's thank God that there was no new iPod enough of it. I'm trying to read in my book

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I I am excited about the stuff that Apple's doing it all looked really good  just needed to be but I need to have hands-on time with it and then I can kind of verify where the where the problem is and  And just like Patrick I I am concerned about any time  They do a major hardware shift that I want to make sure that I'm  You know, I'm not the first in line to get one of these things and and people ask me is it time to buy a new Mac?  I wait a couple of months. How many people here pre-ordered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  nobody one guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Two Wow, how many of you would have pre-ordered if you were at home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same two it's not you know, that's interesting. I think there are a lot of people like you were just sitting back  How many of you are don't care because your windows use it?  You're very brave man, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it all looks good, you know on paper it looks great but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was very hot on the bottom if you picked it up but then that's how I like my laptops  ladies and gentlemen Andy Walker  Ladies and gentlemen Ricky Gervais the star of the BBC's office  So it's good to see you and you came down with Sean Caruthers. You're there the lab rats  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That is not true by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not true. I have a question. Yes. My question is did you notice that?  In the entire the entire keynote there was time slices of stage occupation  So, of course Steve had most of it right Oh Lini had about 30 seconds with his little suit and his puff of smoke there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I felt bad for Paulie. I thought that was a humiliating. It was hugely humiliating but I noticed that Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everyone feels when dealing with Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But Microsoft got a huge chunk of time they did and she wasn't very good and she was awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Roz ho is she in the audience?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I wonder what you guys thought what you made of that the Microsoft got top billing basically second banana

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right. I think what it is is Microsoft Apple Intel Microsoft  Apple has to beg Microsoft to keep doing office and that's essentially what Roz ho was there to say is yes, we  That's why I said it again John that Roz ho said was

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Say make fun of I just asked what he just wanted to know what it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor woman her whole life has been unless she married into it in which case she should never have taken his name. Not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, what you're talking moving on before the lawsuits

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why the screensavers is no longer on the air  Can you finish your story Leo? I forgot what I was talking about  No, I thought that I thought that what it looked like to me was Paul O'Dellini  And I think you're exactly right and it is where you're going was kind of in this humiliating brief  You know, here's the chairman of Intel in a bunny suit  You know and smoke and he's and he's like here we bring you the chips  Meanwhile jobs in exactly the same position with Microsoft saying and now Microsoft's gonna take over and bore you for ten minutes with corporate  Speak because we so desperately need office. I think that's exactly what you saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm somewhat stunned by the fact that but that over all these years that office has been dominating the Mac in the office  Environment that somebody hasn't come up with an alternative has it that I said that a that size isn't anyone nice is still exists  It's great  I mean, well, how come it hasn't that they have it in the background in a skunk works in some secret way  Built something they could just all of a sudden just well  We broke up with Microsoft and here's the new thing and I throw a lot of big product  They've had years and years and years to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's always been the speculation that Apple is building a spreadsheet program  And I think you'll saw a little bit of it in keynote which now does calculate all I work I work which got 15 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  On it. All right. I saw the idea of the I work. It's like this big this biggest slice. How was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't even mention pages which is their word processor  I mean, it's almost as if they were embarrassed. Oh, what? Yeah, we have a word processor  But really word is what you should be using this all began when they dumped Apple basic  No, I know what this is actually tell the story John because this is  This is actually I think you're exactly right this is a historic story that only a man as old as John would remember  But  Actually is a telling story Apple developed the most incredible basic called Mac basic Mac basic was an amazing basic  And yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Came up with this thing called Mac basic

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just darn disappeared no Microsoft killed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they did Bill Gates made a call to Steve Jobs and said if you  Skulley's ago maybe was sculley sculley if you shipped that product your toast your toast and  They pulled it and and actually it leaked out. I used to distribute it on my bulletin board system  And it was just it was very slick. Yeah, I'll give you the number later  Two modems 1200 BPS no waiting  And not one but two 20 megabyte drives  so  So I think that that's exactly what's happened ever since even since then that was 20 years ago Apple still there may have been some

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sort of a deal. We don't know about that was signed in blood that  In Midnight at the crossroads. I mean it's possible. There was some contractual obligation  That was that was fulfilled especially maybe when the gates did the 150 million dollar deal or something  And that is how place which is the only reason I believe and that's why why they  Trivialized the I work thing at this presentation  I think or marginalized it because I think there's some I think there's like a dislike a  Deal in the background and then the woman specifically said they're gonna at least keep this thing going for five years  That's probably when the contract runs out. Oh, yeah, she said that number. She gave a number  I mean, why would she say that what why five years why say anything?  So when you start to hear because it's the digital decade. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So did anybody get to see the product called I see oh I did I saw it at CES and I really like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is that? It's pretty cool. What is it? Essentially? It's a it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's essentially a hundred and ninety nine dollar video  player kind of a  No, it's 250 but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  255 sold for 299

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  CES it was like 279 to know it was 250 here, but it seems to me that you can get these for  200 if you look around there's a million from China  But the fact is this has no hard disk and you take an old defunct  iPod one of the old ones and you shove it in there and you use that as the hard disk and becomes like it's cool  Video recorder you can record you know it's like a mpeg for record point six inch screen four hours of battery life  And uses it has a camera in it no no no so listen it's a DVR. It's a handheld

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can record video, but they didn't have any  There you can record it. It's more like what is it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's for I think an old iPod and do an iPad video you can take an old junker you get your iPod because everyone who?  Buys these iPods they buy the newest one right and they got these old clickers  Shove it in here now you got a nice little video device

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty cool like you have to use a 4g or a 5g so you can't go back to the 3g or anything earlier than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a connector. Yeah, how do you get video onto it? Well you can use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know you have to use their proprietary software and the  Right from the VCR. Yes, it also has an audio video in and audio in dongles basically you can I see oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got one. Oh, no. He's just got a piece of paper with a picture of one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, that's just as good that one's only $49.99

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any other questions just come down here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought it was a good idea for people who have these old iPods, and they want to recycle them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually the interface is very nice a couple of people from Apple old the old Apple days one of the original  Mac developers is the the software engineer behind the thing and it really has a nice graphical interface it does video it does audio  It does photos. It's got a bigger brighter screen than the iPod photo  250 bucks  It's it's kind of a nice way to use that old iPod and it's a little expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It shouldn't be that high it should be 150 to be honest about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But well yeah, I've been looking for something for the iPod video for like my daughter  So instead of having to get a full-fledged  Portable DVD that I can put in the car  Which is like a dumb monitor that I can put my iPod for video back there and say here do this  It's perfect for that yeah, because you've got you've got tons of video on these things anyway, so you might as well use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is close, but not quite it was like a portable player with the seven or nine inch screens out of the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And not for most not yet  Did anybody what did anybody that much money was anybody baffled by the fact that hauled D?  What you know normally Mac Expo has the two halls hauled D is usually filled with all kinds of cool little gadgets  There was closed they had one haul period yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I and that makes sense after the last couple of years because they've been doing the two-haul thing and then increasingly that these  Blackway spread out everywhere, and you sort of wander around in the other hall  And it's good there isn't really that much here  And I think this this adds a little more excitement to the show that everything's packed together there. No curtains anywhere  It's all in one place  the 300 vendors I guess which is  How that compares is that more or you don't know see yes at 2,500 so slightly yeah, but the CES have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You this is a podcast the oh you can't you doing this is jokes somebody somebody gave me the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wandering around  Power supports the name of the company. It's a little keychain size green cleaner  I'm not kidding this go ahead clean your it's perfect for your camera  I have a postage that oh, it's cool. This is like a scrape your screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got like some sort of a fiber fiber  Yeah, just don't get the metal on there because you'll scratch the mohair mohair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little piece a little piece of mohair  We have a question from the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just gonna  Comment and ask about the keynote I agree with you that you know it was updates had to be done  But for the MacBook everybody wants the portability and the main thing I thought about in it was the battery  Well, it's gonna have I think better battery life. Yes. Well you got to think it the top end is 1440 by 900  It's got a 1.8 and a brighter screen. They said as bright as a cinema. It's lighter than a 30 inch  You can get a hundred gigabyte 7200 rpm drive in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it is 54, but they have you can order order. Yeah, you can get a hundred at 72

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And then you can also get 120 at five  5400 right how's that thing gonna even last well, I mean that's the whole point though higher power  Right in the 256 megabyte also of on the V-RAM. Yeah, how's the battery gonna last off?  Nobody said anything about batteries. No, it's not posted anywhere. That's the thing gasoline powered

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You make a good point because they probably would have been touting the battery life had it been improved  What's the weight on the number five point nine five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's really light. It's gonna call that fairly light. It's a 60 watt

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  60 watt performance our  Battery that they had a description on it, but it never gave the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you might be right the fact that they left that out may be significant also John

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Thanks, I typed that up for Arnold Kim for Mac rumors today. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is your transcript

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  I'm from Penn State University. There you go. Did you have to look at your bad? I'm wondering  Yeah, I looked at his badge  I used a 15 inch power book with a Verizon card and he had another guy on the phone  But I had a chat room going with my buddy's back. So you're using evdo and that worked pretty well  Yeah, yeah, no drops at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The did you notice that they kept showing Al Gore in the audience and during the keynote during the keynote?  Yeah  Kept showing Al Gore in the eyes and then Gavin Newsom the mayor of San Francisco goes up to him and shakes hands  Then they kind of almost pose for the camera up there. They'll be at each other's throat in the 80 years. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting  Well, isn't Al Gore doing a television station or something? Yeah. Yeah, what's the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does anybody has anyone ever seen that I've watched some of the stuff. It's it's dreadful, isn't it?  three minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People describing it's well it is it's an idea that we had a tech TV briefly describe it that way  Oh there he is. Ladies and gentlemen Al Gore is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, where is that? How come he wasn't doing the show with us? I almost ran up to him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then there was this barricade. Hey Belkin had a product. What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can I just fill an audience with this  They had a cool so I guess because Belkin no Belkin  Belkin's got some pretty cool stuff. They had a  You are ultra wideband USB lash up and a scent you saw it  Would you think?  It's awesome audience long before it ships. No, it'll be shipping like right now  But what it basically tell us what it does  It's a it's essentially it's pretty much a point-to-point thing  but you have your printer and you have you stick the little antenna in there and then you have this little  Ultra wideband thing and you can just be 10 meters away and it'll just zoom it over there full  You know 400 megabits per second right to the  It's a wireless USB is what it is exactly reading about speeds twice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been playing wireless speeds and then by second quarter  I know what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree with you in theory but the Belkin people have been doing pretty good work recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the second quarter of this year, they're supposed to have ultra wideband for distributing HD video as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is one this does that the other HD yeah, they were they were showing an HD feed they claiming to HD  How much is it five thousand dollars?  It's like 200 bucks or  Wow, that's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Airport Express what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  125. Yeah, this is a different situation. This is a ultra wideband doesn't have a lot of range

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so you say the question and I'll speak into the microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I am a city thank you fewer cables, okay, here's the one I was looking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What about running windows on these machines nobody's talked about that and and Apple said they won't stop you from running windows on it  It uses a different bios. It doesn't use a standard bios use EFI, which is the Intel new standard for modular bios  You have to write some drivers, but it's apparently doable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you'd have to write drivers who would want to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, they probably win maybe Linux whether there's stupid people in every walk of life  But it's not because I particularly want to so get off my ass about the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is called playing to the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll happen very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, nothing I don't you guys were at the very end after the show was over at the keynote was over  Steve Jobs walked out of the  Auditorium with Andy Grove. They went outside beside talking really Andy Grove. Yeah, any girl was there  Together Paul Linnie. Unfortunately, like a couple steps behind in his bunny suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was embarrassed. Did they go into the back and exchange souls?  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can play the blues

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have soul good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got me in that one. He's a Andy Grimes chairman emeritus, but he doesn't have any role in Intel anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure he has no suede Intel whatsoever. All right. All right. It's probably just there to get you have a isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's gonna make a chip. Well, I think it will run windows  I'm sure I'm gonna say we'll run it and I think it will do it with the sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unspoken blessing of both Microsoft and Apple. Yeah, you know what? There'll be something missing  There'll be like a key that you have to have and it won't have it  I mean, there'll be some I get I guarantee there's a gotcha if they try to run windows on that thing  Well, I think they could certainly just be the way Apple is. I don't think it would even be intentional  They don't have to be intentional. These things just happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why not?  I mean why not make it work with windows because they sell more max because people are tired of you running lousy  PC laptops so they want a dependable laptop you can run both operating systems and  Windows nearly natively because we look at virtual PC they can write this thing very close to the hardware  So instead of getting lousy virtual PC speeds you're getting real windows speeds if I'm working in a currently  I have if I have a Mac at home and a PC at the office and I have the opportunity to get one machine that runs  Both really well. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I thought that was kind of the key like the brilliant part of the strategy was that Apple would become  One of the top flight windows. Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think there'll be the premium machine eventually running both the operating system

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So why didn't Steve address it was it why you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think he's gonna start I think that's down if you're stepping into the dark side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think is with the fan base that's out there nice to Intel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The developers come six months ago, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soon as that's over boom things change. No, it's good for Microsoft. It sells copies. Why would Microsoft not want it?  I mean, that's a good thing. So it's copies of Windows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They make more money off of office. Don't they they make a lot of money off of office for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know that definitely has to go here part of soft. No, but I ran into him at CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about this very thing and what now scoble is of course he became a well-known as a blogger  But he is the product manager for Vista Windows Vista. Yeah at Microsoft. What did he say? We were talking about this very thing about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about  Apple's computers running both windows and  He'd probably have an inside track to that  Well, he said, ah, you know, I don't really sort of deal with those things, but I see that as a win-win for Microsoft  Yeah, I think that's right. So I obviously somebody up there way up the food chain gets it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, although you could I don't think Robert speaks for Microsoft necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They could have let me work at Microsoft use a rubber stamp for their business cards. Seriously

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Visit our website  Scobel is I think in he's given free rein at Microsoft, but I don't know if he speaks for Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and I know this nothing of this was official. We just sort of tossing the idea around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he said why wouldn't they except maybe that Dell would get upset or I don't think Microsoft cares if Dell's upset  What is del gonna do right? Oh, we won't use windows anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they saw more copies of hey there was a moment during the case where Microsoft did  Strong arm Dell because Dell had released a bunch of Linux boxes early in the game and then they pulled them  Now Chris did you can get him but it was there was there they they care about this. They don't advertise it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you have to ask for it. Yeah, I mean one time they were pushing it they have it's like under the counter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got Linux on those things? Yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Knock three times. It's a special version of Windows. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I think I'm sure it'll happen. In fact, I think that's one reason somebody should immediately on this panel buy an iMac  You you already oh, yeah, I'll do it. Yeah  I'm made of money that way the price

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and the price will drop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was there another way that before you go before hold on second cuz John you said there was another thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That I like there that people should check out I think it's kind of hard to find think maybe maybe some people  didn't want to see what this was but there was a  Little booth over by the Google booths called live worship and as a religious product and you know, you laugh but  Lot's here that could find these useful it was an interesting and I think you should check this out. It was an interesting  Competitor with PowerPoint and it was designed for it's actually got more versatility than PowerPoint because you can bring up any slide you want  And it's the reason for this thing. I don't think it's a big not the dominational, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe people don't know that John in it was a Dominican minute priest for many years

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But anyway, the point is is that this thing is look like he was a priest

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Think someone should Photoshop John and a pope out. I could die be looking good. So anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The idea is this is this was used mainly for the you know  These mega churches have these rock bands that come in and they need that they do these light shows  And so apparently they came up with this thing so they could project all these kinds of interesting  Quotes from the Bible and whatever on the thing versus that's what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Quotes from the Bible far he is fallen, but the point is man used to be a priest

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The point is is that it's a very cool product  And I think you should check it out  Especially if you do a lot of public presentations because it did I think you can do some some things in here that you can't do  With the normal presentation software does it have wood textures? No, but you could probably you know, it's probably got plugins

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Import my satanic

Transcript:  Well a special hello to amber fellow Canadian here  Hi there question for the quick panel or I guess that's sort of a half eaten donut there, but  One million one million dot Mac users right now which seemed low to me didn't that seem like a low number  yeah, but here's an interesting question, so now we have  Iweb and  What is that gonna do what are your thoughts in terms of the the the growth in dot Mac usage is that gonna drive a lot?  Of people I think for myself. I was really attracted to what I saw  So that's question one and the second thing is in terms of the workflows Lille you've talked a lot about the workflow to create a  Podcast being you know a little bit of magic a lot of work. I was depressed it made it look so easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought oh there it goes everybody's gonna make one now exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what was it so I'll just leave you guys to talk about those two things  Podcasting workflows and what do you think is happening with Iweb and dot Mac in terms of growth of dot Mac and is that really viable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I think I web is a great program  I don't know if everybody's had a chance to learn a little bit about it  But I think it really takes a lot of the tools that are built in  To the Mac and makes them integrated and really easy to use and really easy to share more importantly so you can share  You know your eye photo  Pictures you can do a podcast you can have a blogging software. Well. It's not just I mean  It's really create about creating your own website. Yeah was it blogging type

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leaves out the sleaziness it's not gonna go anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Put it this way for the average person who doesn't know how to build a website and doesn't really take advantage of all the tools  They have in their Mac like I photo and I movie it makes it really easy to put all that information online and be able  To share all that information with RSS  Yeah, I mean it's good for anyone literally in a few minutes.

Transcript:  I think it's a little expensive until now. There's really not 99 bucks for you have a lifetime web here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

As HTML and the answer is yes, and you know you have to use those templates or can you be much more random?  The answer is yes, so I'm more whelmed

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you ask him if it can be less than $99 it's it's yeah, it's already less than

Transcript:  I got a great book for you John. It'll it's one of your books. Yeah, I want it autographed

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't put my name on it because then I can't resell it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I usually just write to eBay customer Leo report I  Find that's the best that works strategy. So David. What what did you think was interesting in all of this today anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  you know the Intel stuff looked pretty good and then like I say then you go and you play with it and  You know the speed matters. I mean, it's a big difference Wow, and did you try starting one up? Yeah  I mean the Apple logo makes an appearance like this blink and it's over. Yeah, it's like really it's a significant difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gonna have to fix that though

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Install Microsoft office and you're back to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I was surprised how well given that it's an emulation office and and Photoshop run they really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What we're gonna write I open a file filled with photos and funny lay out. Yeah, it's nice and it's friendly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so you you like the speed then so I've been trying to get these guys to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Acknowledge that there is a big difference. Just buy it just buy it. All right, I'll buy it trying to sell us  Let's go back to this I web thing  You know what because our buddy back here is going on about I'm never gonna do a web  I'm just gonna use this from now on cuz gonna be so much easier. Does it do blogging? Yes  I have to say, you know your transcripts a little thin on the I web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually does a good job with podcasts it does a good job with blogs I was pretty impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we've none of us has actually used it. Well, I played with we played with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, so you guys are just basing this on demos. No, we play no we sat down and we've done a website and bend and sustained it over

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, we didn't actually publish one today, but we did play with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nikki what do you want to know Nikki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, my question is looking at this new

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Intel power book whatever. Oh, I believe you want Macbook Pro

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I cannot remember this name. I swear there's many problems with it that people aren't addressing like one the remote  It's just gonna float around the bottom somebody's bag  It's a selling point for Apple to charge you 50 bucks if you want the IR  Which they should use radio frequency the laptop is extremely hot if men put it on their laps. They're gonna have no children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is not necessary that could be a selling point it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of these Mac owners, yeah, I don't know if you've taken a look around the room here, but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Selling price though for that price. Honestly, I'll just go buy a $600 laptop at CompUSA and download OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1086 for the same thing and then it'll break in six months

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Mac products never ever break. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's talking about the fact that Apple just make it so it doesn't work and sick  I mean Nikki you might do that but not not most of us most people are not gonna do that  I mean, I think that if you want to like this thing apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, well, you're the only one here that I feel I think that feels that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let's see  I don't get questions like that like it reminds me of gmail when it came out and how it would put ads off to the  Right of your incoming mail based on a scan of the content. It was like, oh my god  They're looking in my underwear drawer. They're gonna know my innermost thoughts  I'm like first of all, it's software and second you don't have to use it  So if you're worried about the remote control throw away the remote control and then you have a power book like it was before

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Use radio frequency instead of IR  Better hatch because line of sight I thought you're getting rid of IR. I thought it was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because you're not standing behind your power book watching movies exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You've got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean that's the point of front row I that's that's the whole idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the whole point of putting a remote with a notebook that you're gonna have sitting in front of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, it's across the room. Yeah, right, but what if you're not so what if I close it and leave it running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are you gonna navigate driving my HDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have an answer for that. This thing has a driver for the 30 inch display this laptop  And the IR receiver is not on the lid but on the driver  Not if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would doubt that there wasn't a toggle that doesn't there should be there will be because it's a great other way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then it's a great media center. I'm sure that's why I was on that. Yeah, it's a it's a media center  I think it's a great idea and then  If you close it you can continue to watch the movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you're doing one of these jobs and across the room trying to hit the notebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's the thing with my art  It's a good idea to have the remote like when I'm in a hotel and I'm not gonna you know  If I want to set it up and watch a movie, I have to be right in front of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not gonna take the time to hook a notebook up to a hotel TV  I'm gonna sit there and watch by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This woman has OS 10 running on a Sony PlayStation portable  I am NOT kidding  She does I don't know how legal it is  But I'm not sure that's cool for the mess the masses exactly. I think she's got a good criticism though  Well, nobody else does that why should Apple do that  Oh, I suppose you could program it to their probably there's probably a code you can probably do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some of you can program so you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good idea yeah, and I actually did this with the with the new iMac because they have the same boat there and I used  Belkin's media center keyboard and it works fine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, thank you another question from the floor, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Just just one item first of all that the first just and I'm gonna stutter all over the place  But the first thing is that the myspace equals  Iweb thing is like nails on the chalkboard comparing Iweb to the cesspool of humanity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a clean myspace that I would have you know my kids  No, you understand I have a 13 year old who has a page on my point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think his point is that is nothing like my

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Because I think we're just comparing it to my if you know what my  I'm a 13 year old and it has you know it you share music and you make friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could tell my 13 year old you can use this you may no longer use myspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying it's myspace that brought the dirty nasty people there's no dirty nasty people are gonna show up on Iweb  That's a heck of a thing for that's a thing. It's not the same on Iweb

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's not the same design program myspace is a website. All right. I'm sorry I mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  But okay if we're getting it right you're comparing it you're comparing it to the web design tools in myspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm saying that my kids think that making your own web page means my kids are I kids I kids  I'll get the cease and desist will think that making a web page means  Going to myspace and making a web page there now  I can say no no no look you can do all of that just as easily in a in a much in a better environment  And that's what we're not in myspace anymore. Well, that's what they're gonna say  They're gonna say none of my friends are on over here, and they're all in myspace, so yeah  Well they can use dad's account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things we saw at web 2.0  is it type of the average spending habit for consumer electronics and consumables and crap and  17 year olds are spending more on it than you and I are it's a little so it isn't myspace free

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so forget I mentioned myspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is free. Forget it. That was a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna take a chance point is why compare the sophisticated brilliant tools inside of iWeb am I getting it so far my spinning  But here's my question for you people make crap out of myspace because they pick horrible things and they tile them on there  They do weird pictures and they blow up and they pick horrible fonts  Can I not do crappy design instead of inside of iWeb if I want to most definitely?  definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I just had one other thing as  With with this this transition that we're going over. I'm a little slow on the page here  I'm just still trying to catch up with everything with this transition over to the OS 10 on the Intel  Well, I've noticed when I do like a format and reinstall on a Windows XP machine  Is that like for a customer like over a period of a year when I go back and visit them even if they've not downloaded  A ton of crap onto the machine. It's slower. I mean we're talking about all the speed  But are we gonna be hitting the same type of wall? I don't think that's an Intel problem. I think that's an OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably I don't think it's gonna get slower because well you can build bulletproof Windows machines  Yeah, you just make sure they can't log in as administrator in there. That's part of it. That's inconvenient

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  But yeah, I'm just referring to the build itself on OS 10. Are we built to handle? No, I think it'll be fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Intel make makes any difference in that regard

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You want to know something weird that they did not say at the keynote?  We've already heard that Photoshop and Steve Jobs  Oh, it's it's it's okay if you open this nine hundred dollar program once in a while  But you know all the people who actually have to use it you won't be able to do it until well  There's a bunch of things that Phil Schiller later said will not run in it like any  Video editing programs including final cut will not run it all not run until they release their dual binary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're referring to the OS is the nine hundred dollar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There isn't the other one shop I'm talking about he was referring to this large group of casual users who've dropped six hundred dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's well, but they're allowing for a lot of people use Apple products is for those tools

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's right  And that's what they're saying is the pros should stick with power PC and you'll be able to move when we could went in down  The road I six months I got another hint of that when I talked to somebody from Apple about getting word running  He said it was a bear  I think there's a lot of tweaking that has to be done of Rosetta  The itself to get these programs to one run just like with wine for instance in order to get a program to run in  Wine you have to really kind of tweak wine. I think that's probably what it is  I think it's not it's not in other words. It's not automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's got the right advice then don't buy these machines for the next if you're a pro user

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, in fact, I was talking to Alex Lindsay said well, I'm not gonna I can't upgrade because I use final cut  I'm not gonna it's not time to get an Intel but but if mostly what you use is the Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Products that come with OS tan but he was all he was also saying anything where timing or sinking is important  This would also mean digital performer and pro tools and all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  More pro stuff. So you're coming out publicly and saying this is a turkey

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What's in your filter man  It ain't coffee baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's listening to you complain about the fact that nothing that's really a quality product will run on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I had a briefing with Schiller later. I thought I share with people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So no, I think that no, this is great. This is fast jobs did not say this and as you just said

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's only a matter of a few months until these guys make these apps compatible with the Intel processor natively  But for now, this is something that people should know this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what speaks though to what Patrick was saying which is don't be the first to buy this thing wait and see what these little  By one anyway, well, I know but what these little issues are because there may well be more issues and now already we're hearing  Well, yeah a lot of programs won't run on the Intel a lot of Mac programs won't run on the Intel Macs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a big deal. Yeah, but Steve did say we are gonna port all our professional apps. I can't buy March  He said March March. So that's soon. Yeah, it's not terribly far away. So you'll have final cut  You'll have logic and I can't remember with you. Right? Well, that's why I was gonna that's why I was gonna point work in March

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By a copy of XP Pro and dole boot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's one there was one pro app that I use which is soundtrack pro. It sounds like that will not run  If I get one of the new Macs it will not run well because that's very timing specific any music program  It sounds like would have trouble sounds like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  But just yeah, that was just the one last thing and I'll leave you alone. But  You know Mac world is usually, you know attuned to like the consumer apps and consumer computers and all that and so that's what we saw  Right and so basically when we start seeing these pro machines, that's where we'll probably see the kick for the software  Which is why he mentioned the cross grade but like 149 per app 49 bucks 40 49. Okay, shoot. That's a good deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if you're a final, I mean, I guess it is you already paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  $18,000 for the program, but I just want to give a shout out to the Mac addict people who told me to come here  So Mac a day people Mac addicts Mac addict forms Mac addicts. Oh Mac addicts. I can't put it on the wrong syllable. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sounds like some sort of a sounds lewd it does sound and I am with the Mac addict

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Victor  So just beating up an old heart beating out of an old horse here in I web  I just wonder how is this basis you're gonna show up on a Windows PC and not exploring you know  Because that's a good question like like dreamweaver in the old days was like oh you can just drag your photos over here  It's gonna show up fine. And then right press F12 and looks like trash  I think Steve addressed it in the key work final Safari

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when I said I think Steve addressed that in the keynote  He said it works well on it's like he said Internet Explorer specifically as well as fire  And he said Firefox as well. I think any ma he said any modern browser, which means it's using a lot of CSS  I would imagine  Ajax as well. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because whenever you try to make a page is how to make it work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in every well and that's something that dreamweaver does very well  Which is does browser checking and make sure that it degrades properly and so forth. I think I can mix everything. Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah puts a lot of Java in there saying what's the browser?  All right, I can't do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't do that and the other thing is they're still selling like power books for the same price and  The 15 power book is the same price as the same price. I think it's a great deal. That's five times faster  So I wonder why do you guys think about that? Why they still selling the power books at the same price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you want to raise the price or do you mean the old one?  58 where you said Ajax

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick I noticed work along those lines Patrick. He used the spec benchmarks  He's spec in and spec floating point. Those aren't those are synthetic benchmarks. Are they considered?  Well, there's some that use applications, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's anybody even application-based

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Application based benchmarks can be spun and tweaked right if he's used any spec is not what I would call  Or is it a good useful benchmark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, there's I think about this way you can you can build a car and run it in the quarter mile, right?  Or you can you know take the engine out and and and and put it on a machine right and run it that way, right?  And you can guesstimate the horsepower either way, you know, I mean that you can get the power off a dyno  You've got a great number for horsepower, but if you change settings on the dyno or settings  That's essentially what the spec is doing. Yeah, the spec is like a dyno number. It's like whoo. It's a hundred percent more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know dead crab great and since Steve's credit he said but now that's not the full power of this machine because there's hard drives

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Aren't faster. So you think that Steve maybe would use benchmarks that made his stuff look better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe  There's a long history in every every hardware manufacturer on the planet of spinning things as best they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? It's true. That's why when I used it and it felt so much faster  That's the real test any difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All you have to do is pick up the mouse and try it and you're like wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've always believed that the best way to tell is when you you feel if it's faster  And it does and that's i've always felt it was the better benchmark it emphatically numbers. It emphatically feels faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The web stuff is unbelievable and I asked phil my buddy phil

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  iWeb or

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Dot web safari the web book code duo core and like he demoed in the keynote pages just blink onto the screen  I was typing urls. I knew hadn't been cached with you know, cnn.com blink and  And I thought that you know  A lot of that would have to do with the connection and the hard drive and the cache and all that stuff  But he said there's so much, you know actual processing java and whatnot that it actually makes a big speed difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And those previous systems must have been slow as dirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chris brian did you notice I noticed this in the keynote in fact right at front  I'm at the beginning. I said he's using an iMac and this is the fastest  I I said this there must be something he's there's a cray underneath the desk. It's it didn't did you know?  I mean immediately I noticed that what's going on. Well, yeah, and that's what I suspected

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're running the mail just popped up. I mean anytime steve does anything it's never slow unless he wants it to be right so  Invariably, they're running some kind of hot hardware up there  So yeah  I suspected they were running a new intel machine of some kind  I was far enough back that I couldn't see exactly what he was doing up there  But particularly when he he brought out the new eye photo and you know had 25 000 thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And like butter and it really was it's scrolled like it's scrolled like butter. That's a t-shirt people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we have another uh smaller element here that's going to ask the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A little a little twit a little little baby click on all the rumor sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said oh they're going to update the iBook and the Mac mini first with the intel processors  But why didn't they do that and it seems like apple would want to do that first just kind of ease into the transition  But the power book is more the pro  Laptop and the iMac's kind of mid-range. So why did they do you have any idea why they did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They basically just wanted to teach the rumor sites a lesson. That's right  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I have I have a thought on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody asked us asked what's your podcast kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So jeffrey, I think that what you see is steve jobs is kind of a guy who likes repeat success  And when he took the company over again, the first thing he came out was with an iMac  And so I think he's just basically doing  Essentially following the same pattern he did before that little one will come out last

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, like the mac do you have a podcast jeffrey, um, well me my friend used to do in a long time well not a long time ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  When he was three

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, he's beyond it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What have you moved on to because i'd like to know because i'm I want to get into it now now he runs kiddy soft

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, my friend is really likes runescape. So it's more his podcast than mine. So I just kind of set it up for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what what you're saying is you're a producer more than talent get him a t-shirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Can you come over and set up my home theater

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks jeffrey appreciate it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  15 years from now we'll be working for him. Yeah, maybe sooner

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so, uh, I did actually we did we abner and I talked to the uh, um  Mac mini product manager and uh and asked him actually that very question and he didn't say anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is he really really little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's tiny, you know, it's interesting. He actually used to work at shuttle pc until january, which is another actually very cool  It's the only cool pc really it's a little box pc and obviously apple said we're gonna do a little computer you want to come over  But uh, obvious, I mean I would say it's pretty clear that that's the next  Kind of media center. I think they're still going a full speed ahead on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a pretty typical move for most anytime you're going to launch a new chip like that  You want to show off its best side and on the fastest hardware and obviously it was needed and it's good to see  I mean everyone sounds pleased with the performance you guys sound like you're well, here's the thing that kills me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a dual two gigahertz tower and now it's all you've been complaining about the whole have I already said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You're trying to give it away

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's been a crying need for uh  I mean people at on the max side have been crying about the power books power for a long time and it's it's sort of that  The the pro users who are portable people have seen, you know  We really have got to have this and we're never going to put a g5 in this  So please please please and I think apple really wanted to live on the high end in the portable side  So I think have a big first quarter  Well, they will I mean the iBook users don't care quite so much  They don't have to be as fast as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But the people that are buying the professional portables do seriously leo you have about three days to get that thing up on ebay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know i'm moving. I know it's gonna drop off, you know, one of the things that uh  One of the reasons that I was about to get on the ledge john when they decided when they announced the intel thing  Was I thought of the osborne effect? I thought they'll never sell another apple  Uh, you know until they come out with the intels and that's not so in fact  They had the biggest quarter in apple history last quarter. They sold more  Product not less product. What do you attribute to that?  Well, no, no, I think he's talking about mac sales as well. We're we're up so it's the ipod  He sold a lot of matt I think they said it was a large  Oh, well, I can't read your transcript. So also the thing about all these transcript

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've heard that a lot today. In fact, uh, there was no osborne effect apparently, right?  And there isn't one because think about it. Let's say you're one of these people who says oh, I like that new  I like that new power book. I'm not going to buy a power book now. So it was like, oh apple's dead  They're not going to sell any power books until this one comes out in march, right?  So but it's just a delayed purchase then when it comes march they will buy it  So I don't understand what the big fuss is  It's not like that people are switching to windows because it's going to take two more months

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've been totally convinced that that osborne effect actually existed  It happened with osborne because this product that they announced they never could they weren't  They didn't get out in time. I mean you knew they had all this announcement and there was also a lot of competition  That they were facing. I'm not absolutely sure  I mean  I know what the osborne effect is supposed to be which is for people out there who were just listening now is that  You know  And this actually the real time that this happened was with north star computers some years earlier when they announced the double density  Controller card at the same exact price. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah at the same exact price as the single density card  But they couldn't ship it and but people stopped buying the single density card say why am I going to just wait for the double?  It's the same price and then the company almost went broke  And this has since become the osborne effect because he did something similar  I really did go broke but they but they didn't have any other products either  I mean the apple if they stopped selling all the other stuff they could just coast on their ipod sales  So I mean it's it's not going to really hurt the company like the other gentleman brought up isn't the pricing right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The same as the previous hardware. So that right then and there it's like, okay  I'm gonna get something that's twice as fast as you guys are saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty that's pretty I'm waiting. But yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is honestly the first time I actually considered apple was up four dollars a share today

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Five percent better value 82. Yeah. Yeah apples at 82

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, wow buy on good news sell on 60 bad news or no just the other way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I could never figure that out. This is why john is yeah, that's why no longer a Dominican priest  You know, I we've run out of time. I can't believe it. I'm getting the wrap-up signal  I haven't seen that since the screensavers. So that's uh  We don't we have a hard limit of an hour and 20 minutes. Otherwise aol can't burn this to a cd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't afford those 70 minute. I wish I were joking. I really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
