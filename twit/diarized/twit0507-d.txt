Christina  Warren from Mashable dot com.  Jason Heiner who was here last  week for our 10th anniversary.  He's back in Louisville at CBS  Interactive but he'll join us.  He's joining us via Skype.  Before we get into that though,  I want to welcome an old friend  who has kind of got his own  podcast. John Miller is the  creator of the rest of Everest  podcast at the rest of  Everest dot com. John, I know  you have a great many friends in  Kathmandu and Nepal that you've  been to Everest many times. Of  course this week yesterday,  devastating 7.9 earthquake hit  Nepal. 2800 at last count dead,  probably many more. 17 climbers  killed Dan Fredenberg who was a  Google executive. He was a  director of privacy at the X  project. Google X passed away  at the base camp. Just  devastating. This is a YouTube  picture. How come we have this?  This is one day later this video.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Communications in  Nepal are really difficult to  come by but all the climbers are  using satellite modems and  satellite phones. The earth is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  starting to shake right now but  if you look and you'll see it, a  wall of snow, a giant massive  avalanche about to hit base camp.  It's really remarkable that so  many survived, frankly. That

Start time: 202.59
End time: 217.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  avalanche came from a mountain  called Pamori which is across  base camp right across from the  Khumbu ice fall which is what  many people know of. You just  don't think of this kind of  thing happening at base camp.  You think of it happening up

End time: 240.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  structures fell. Yeah, the  ground was covered with  snow. It's not like here in  California where there's real  standards. There hasn't been an  earthquake there in a while. I  wasn't familiar with how long it  had been but it sounds like it

Start time: 240.96
End time: 290.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hadn't been an earthquake of this  magnitude since the 30s. Nobody  was prepared for this. Just  devastating. You've been in  touch. It's interesting how the  tech community is in some ways  more concerned about this.  Facebook has a site called  Safety Check. They started this,  I can't remember when, but not  so long ago there was a  devastating natural disaster and  they created this. If you're on  Facebook and you're near the  site of a disaster, it will  prompt you to post something to  say I'm okay. Then if you have  friends in the area as I know  you do in Kathmandu, we were  talking to Chris earlier, you  can go to Facebook.com. Google  has a person finder that's also  in effect right now where you  can search for people. But a lot

Start time: 291.04
End time: 339.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of people are missing and  unknown.  It really feels to me like  social media like Facebook is  playing a leading role and will  continue to play a leading role  in disasters as they occur  because certainly in this part  of the world, most people, their  mobile phone is their computer  and they all use Facebook. I  don't know if you know this, but  Facebook is a great place to  get your friends.  They're on treks.  No kidding.  On Facebook.  And the mobile communications  infrastructure is the main way  that they communicate because  it's so expensive to run land  lines. Everyone has cell phones.  It's much less expensive  obviously for the wireless to be  put in. So they all have it.  So it's just really, we've been  getting much relief from getting

But I'm happy to say that Apple  is putting on the front pages,  as they've done in the past, of  iTunes, a click to give to the  Red Cross to help out. So we  just want to urge our viewers  and listeners to do what they  can.  You're still planning to go  back to Everest soon, right?  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't planning

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on going this year. But I was  thinking next year, we'll see  what this comes down to. But  yeah, this is a very, very poor  country. A lot of income relies  on tourism, which is obviously  decimated at this point. And so  it's important to get people  safe and everything, but long-term  recovery involves keeping the  economy going. So there's all  kinds of things that will be  needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was just kind of  fortuitous that you were in the  area, and I'm glad you could come  by and give us a personal point  of view. The rest of Everest is  a great podcast for people who  are intrigued by this area. And  as you and Chris Markard have  said, because both the people of  Nepal are really beautiful, warm  people, and this is a terrible

Transcript:  Thank you, John. I appreciate it.  Therestofeverest.com. Just kind  of a heavy note, I understand,  but I think this is a time when  the tech community can get  together and do something about  this. Maybe donate a buck or two.  If each of you donated a buck or  two, there would be a quarter  million bucks in there. Thank  you, John.  Meanwhile, here we are talking  about the iWatch. It feels a  little strange, doesn't it?  Christina, did you get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I was going to say, I  heard you're unhappy with it. If  you don't want it, I'll buy it  from you.  No, I'm not that unhappy with  it.

Start time: 479.94
End time: 568.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See? You're not that unhappy  with it.  I guess what I'm saying now,  I think it's conceivable that in  time, apps will come out that  will make this more interesting.  It's certainly, I think it's a  good-looking watch. This is the  38mm stainless steel with  Milanese loop. You notice that  what happened there? Because I  took it off my wrist. It's  asking for a passcode. It's  aware of when it's on your  wrist. So the Apple Pay, for  instance, once you authorize it  from the phone, you have to tie  it up.  So the Apple Pay will continue  to work even if the iPhone's not  nearby. I'll enter the passcode  so I can use it. I guess I  decided it didn't need it.  Double tapping the, I've learned  a few things. First of all, this  thing has more controls than an  iPhone does. You've got a big  friends button on here. You've  also got the crown, which both  clicks and twirls. And you've  got force touch. So get this  though. Take a look at this.  This is the icons. This was one  thing that worried me. You can  zoom in a little bit. It's dang  hard to hit those icons. But I'll  give you the bottom line taken  and then we can talk about the  individual things. It doesn't  seem that much. I was hoping  there's the Apple Pay, so now I  would hold this near to a  terminal if I double tapped that.  It doesn't seem to me to be  significantly better than any of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the other smart watches. Not in  the first place. I've heard  battery life. I've heard  reasonable things about battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  life. Still got to recharge it  every day or so. I don't mind  that. The pebble you don't. But  you do with Android Wear. I'm  charging my phone every day. It  has a nice little magnetic puck  that goes right on the thing. So  it's easy to charge it. It charges  fast. Charges in a couple hours,  about an hour, an hour and a half.  You can give it a little club nap  and then you can go to the  Apple store and try it on. I  want the pale pink. I want the

Start time: 604.90
End time: 623.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pale pink. Now it's funny because  when I looked at the Milanades  loop in person, the one that  you've got on the 38mm, I really  loved it. It actually looks like  I could get that one. That one's  shipping four to six weeks. I  don't know if that means I would  get it before or after the one  I've ordered. I don't want to

Start time: 624.92
End time: 655.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  place a second order and see  which one I get first. I was  just thinking about it this  morning. I'm just thinking about  how you could actually make it  so that you can get it. I think  the only thing that's been  different is actually the  Android Wear watches. The  Android Wear watches, which  are the best available in the  world, would kind of, as they  have, as they did with the  iPod, the iPhone, the iPad,  take an existing business and  make a leap forward in  usability so that what was kind  of okay really became usable.  Smart phone, tablets, music

Start time: 659.96
End time: 670.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so geeky. Which I think is  honestly a big part of it,  right? I mean, that would be my  argument that has held back a  lot of the other watches has  been the looks. I mean, it's as  much a fashion device as it is.  Isn't that fashionable though?

Start time: 670.92
End time: 671.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think that looks that

Start time: 671.90
End time: 675.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  fashionable? I do actually. I  think that looks really nice.  I think that it looks really,

Start time: 676.94
End time: 709.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  really nice. Jason, you don't  agree? God, no. I don't. I  don't. But like Christine is  saying though, it is very  personal. Some people, people  love it. There are people who  dig it. Like from the first time  they showed it when they  unveiled it, like I made the  same noise that I just made  there. I was like, what? This  big square thing? You know what  it reminds me of? And this is my  immediate thought when I first  saw it was it reminds me of in  the 80s. Remember those  calculator watches in the 80s?  Yeah. And we thought they were  so cool. I mean, I had one.  It didn't have Mickey tapping his

Start time: 710.06
End time: 712.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  toe. That's true. But we thought

Start time: 712.96
End time: 750.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they were so cool. And then  like five or 10 years later, we  were like, oh my God, we used to  wear calculator on our wrist.  But like that thing was so  hideous. And I kind of feel like  the square is going to be I think  Apple will get there. I think  that it's it's it's an evolution  towards something that's going to  be really slick looking. But I  just felt like I wanted to be  thinner. I wanted to maybe not  be square. So so square. I  wanted it to be a little have a  little more of a wow factor that  most Apple products. And I just  didn't with this, but it is a  very personal thing. And I just  didn't with this, but it is a  very personal thing. I do think  some of the Android ones are as  good looking like the Moto 360  looks OK. Yeah. Yeah. I think

Start time: 751.39
End time: 752.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you're a dude. Yeah, I mean,

Start time: 752.90
End time: 805.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're right. Like exactly.  This is huge, too. This is big,  but it's it's I mean, I tried the  38 millimeter on my wrist and I  have ridiculously small wrists.  Yeah. And yeah, it's to the  point that, you know, you know,  I like the small band is  actually there. At least Apple  was telling me they're kind of  thinking is probably more for  children. Ironically, that's the  size I'm getting from my wrist.  And it looks great on my wrist,  whereas the Moto 360, you're  right. It looks good. But if  you've got a small wrist, I mean,  it just works it. It's just it's  such a it's such a male centric  device. Me personally, I'm kind  of with you, Jason. I wish that  maybe this had a slightly  different look. I didn't I  didn't know how much I like the  square at first, but I'm glad  that there's finally a watch  where they actually took into  consideration that 50 percent of  the public doesn't have, you  know, gigantic risks and and and  made something that can at least  be styled to be more feminine.  That's that's good.  I agree. I'm glad to hear you

Start time: 805.90
End time: 821.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  say that because that was one of  the things I wondered how many  so I've asked, you know, I've  tried to get it since where are  there women that are excited  about wearing it? I haven't  found too many, but.  Christina doesn't count, but you  know how it is.  You don't count. You're a geek.  No, you're a geek.

Start time: 821.96
End time: 823.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a geek, but I also spend.

Start time: 823.90
End time: 828.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, but I also spend like  five hundred dollars on handbags.  OK, so you're fashion-forward.  Yes, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a fashion-forward geek.  Yes.  Yeah.

Start time: 831.90
End time: 832.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, you compare that,

Start time: 832.92
End time: 848.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  say, for example, the LG, which  is a clunking great bit of  technology, which sits on your  wrist.  And I've got fairly slim wrists  as well.  And I tried it on and it just it  looks horrific.  I mean, the Apple Watch does  look pretty good, but I'm still  not sold on the whole  functionality.  I don't think it does much for  me, but I may be I may be wrong.

Start time: 849.16
End time: 881.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just and maybe the time maybe  apps will come out that will blow  me away.  Yeah, people are getting excited  by things like, oh, I can do  this.  They're like, oh, I can touch  the Shazam button.  It'll hear songs.  That doesn't matter to me.  You can, unlike most, you can't  make phone calls on the Android  Wear watches.  You can only see the calls  coming in.  Then you have to pick up your  phone.  You can make a phone call from  this and talk to people.  I'm not sure a lot of people are  going to do that.  You can talk to Siri on this.  And actually, Siri seems to work  better on this, frankly, than it  does on the iPhone.  I don't know why that is.  That's what, yeah, that's what

Start time: 882.08
End time: 978.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  CNET, you know, their review,  CNET's review on it said the  same thing, that they felt like  Siri works better on the watch  for some reason than it does on  the phone.  But I do agree with you, you  know, Leon, that I think that  there's not a lot of, there's  not a lot of great, you know,  functionality that knocks your  socks off with this yet.  I felt like they tried to do too  much and they were a little  undisciplined with this.  They did it and pick a few  things and try to really make  them great like they normally  do.  And so I think this shows that  they're still, you know, they're  taking baby, it's a baby step  out of the post jobs era, right?  Because the lack of discipline  does, I think, show in that way.  But there are a few things, I  think, that there are some  gloomers of hope for me that  make me think like, okay, this I  could see being pretty  interesting.  And one is like the American  Airlines thing.  They worked with American  Airlines.  I think a couple other airlines  too, but where, you know, it  automatically will have, you  know, your boarding pass that  will put on there.  It will even show you like your  flight in progress.  It will show you like how much  time is left and those kinds of  things.  Like that's pretty cool.  Like you can have that on your  phone and, you know, that's cool.  But I can see myself wanting to  glance.  You know, there's a couple  glanceable things where I see  like, okay, that would make  sense and I would like having  that without having to get out  my phone, you know, every time I  want to do that kind of thing.  And I think they would have  laser focused on the stuff that  would be better to just glance  and not take out the phone.  You know, the better this  product would have been.  And I think they're still finding  their way a little bit there.  Yeah.  I mean, if you've got to carry

Start time: 978.98
End time: 993.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the smartphone with you anyway,  then, you know, I don't really  see that there's an awful lot  there at the moment to justify  what's a really quite high price  tag for a bit of hardware that  Yeah, this one's 650 bucks.  Yeah.  You know, as displayed on my  wrist.

Start time: 993.90
End time: 999.94

Start time: 1043.92
End time: 1122.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  months.  I mean.  Yeah.  How long it's taking to launch  Flipboard?  This is the processor, and this  is the equivalent of an iPhone  4, I'm told.  Yeah.  It has a decent heart rate.  I like the idea that it's  always, every 10 minutes  measures your heart rate.  I wrote it on a record  bicycle in yesterday to kind of  test that.  And it's, you know, there's, but  nothing here on here is  significant, in my opinion,  significantly better or  different than the existing  smartwatches.  All right.  Maybe you could say  aesthetically there's a  difference, although that's a  matter of opinion.  You know what I really get from  this is the strength of Apple's  marketing.  That instead of saying it  vibrates, which is really all  the Taptic feedback is this  vibration, the Taptic engine  will give you the power of the  Taptic engine.  And I think that's the  thing about this.  It's not just the Taptic  engine.  It's the Taptic engine.  The Taptic engine will give you  a subtle tap on your, it's,  it's, it's an amazing  marketing ability they have.  And, and, and not to diminish  it.  I mean, the ability to tell a  story like that and get people  excited around something that is  essentially just vibration.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They tell better stories than  anybody else.  They tell great stories.  The navigation on this watch is  virtually identical to the  navigation on my Moto 360.  It vibrates when you're supposed  to turn left or right.  It doesn't vibrate slightly  left or slightly right.  This sort of feels like it's  slightly left or slightly right.  Yeah.  Not enough that I can't not look  at the watch and know which way  to go.

Start time: 1122.92
End time: 1126.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also for navigation, you've  got to run Apple Maps, which.  But you have to use Apple Maps.

Start time: 1127.10
End time: 1142.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I presume Google and  others will, you know, update  their apps.  One of the things that happened  that is very different is there  were before the watch even came  out, 2,000 apps.  Right.  On the store.  And there will be more all the  time.  Right.  And that's different.

Start time: 1143.21
End time: 1206.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is different.  And the one thing I would say,  too, is these are all the apps  that we're seeing with very few  exceptions have been created by  people who have not had access  to the watch.  Right.  They've had access to the  simulator, which to me is  actually a big difference  because I think that, you know,  right now I think your  criticisms are probably  directly are dead on.  You know, it's not demonstrably  different from a Pebble or from  Android Wear.  But, you know, you give this  thing a few weeks with people  who actually, with developers  actually having a chance to use  it natively and start to create  experiences with the hardware.  I think that we might start  seeing some really interesting  things because that's what  we've seen in the past, you  know, with both the iPhone and  especially with the iPad, where  what we really saw come and make  the devices and the platforms,  frankly, so unique was after  developers really had a chance  to play with it because  otherwise, I mean, this is just  out the gate.  You've got all these apps, but  people are basically making  extensions and, you know, it's  running little widgets on the  screen.  I'm looking forward to seeing  where we are, you know, at WWDC.  And I'm also looking forward to  seeing, you know, how they open  up the API.  How they open up the APIs for  this thing and allow it to do

It's very 1.0, but they have  your, it's funny to see how  different this company is from  when the iPhone went out and  they were really not sure if  they wanted third party apps on  it and third party apps is what  kind of made it.  And they are way out front on  this one, but not having the  product and being able to, you  know, have the watch itself in  the hands of the developers  beforehand, you know, it is a  limitation.  And like I said, there are some  rays of hope where you can see  like, okay, this would be better  having it here where it almost  makes me want to wear a watch  again.  Like I said, the flight  information on my wrist, being  able to just glance at that is  an example.  I think there are other things  where, you know, you don't want  to necessarily have your phone  out.  But I think that one of the bits  that maybe is a little overblown  is this idea of somehow it's less  rude, you know, to look at your  watch and your phone.  I don't know about that.  I think that's a little bit  oversold because it's still the  same as like if we're having a  conversation and I'm looking at  my watch, you know, that goes  back a long time where that's  pretty much a signal like I don't  really want to talk to you  anymore.  I'm more interested in leaving.  And so, yeah, I don't think that  that's the part is as significant  as even Apple has kind of said of  like, oh, you know, you'll have  less, you don't have to take your  watch out of your smartphone out  of your pocket 27 times an hour  or whatever.  I think this is one of the big

If you're constantly checking  your wrist when you're in the  middle of a conversation, you  might as well just say to the  person you're talking to, yeah,  I'm not really interested in you,  but look at this, isn't this  great?  And it's, you know, whenever I  try smartwatches on, you know, it  gives a little vibrate, puts the  notification up, and you've got a  fight not to look at it if you're  in the middle of a conversation  with somebody.  If you've got to take your  smartphone out, that's also very  rude.  But, you know, actually having it  on your wrist encourages that  glance.  And honestly, if you're looking  at your watch when you're talking  to someone, you're really not  doing them any favors at all.

I think there is, but maybe he  hadn't discovered it.  And every hour, even though I'm  watching a movie, it said, stand  up.  You can turn that off.  And you can turn a lot of this  stuff off.  I think there is going to be a  period of discovery for a few  weeks.  I guess, and maybe my opinion  will come around.  I don't hate it.

Like, I remember 80% of the time I  still used my Blackberry because  it was more useful.  But like with the iPhone, I would,  within two weeks of having it, I  set it down and my two-year-old  picked it up, swiped across, tapped  the photos app and started swiping  through photos.

It's a luxury.  I don't feel like anybody has to  have it.  Unlike, say, a smartphone.  Were you crazy if you're still  using a flip phone?  Yeah.

You know, I've tried all of  these, you know, all the Android  ones too, or a bunch of the  Android ones.  And there's cool things that  they do.  I agree with Christina.  They're huge.  And so I don't like how huge  they are.  And so that's sort of a turn off.  I think they have to get smaller.  But then the smaller they get,  the sort of less useful or the  harder it is to actually, you  know, to use it to touch and tap,  you know, once the screen is  that small.  And so it's a tough one.  It's a tough one.  And I do think that I'm one of  the people who should be  interested because I do a lot  of kind of the fitness stuff.  And I like analytics.  And the other thing is, you know,  I've had a Fitbit since Fitbits  first started coming out and  tried that.  And I've enjoyed that.  And I've worn the ones that, you  know, the different ones on your  wrist, the Flex and then the  Charge and those.  But even those, I always end up  kind of getting fatigued and not  really wanting to wear it on my  watch, wear it on my wrist after  a while, like a watch, just  because once I started using a  smartphone, I quit wearing  watches.  And I think a lot of people are  like that.  And I do think the Pebble guy,  CEO Eric, he said that he said  the best thing, you know, and I  think he was exactly right.  He said this at CES last year.  He said, our biggest  competition is not Samsung.  It's not Sony.  Those were the two big ones at  the time that were making smart  watches.  He said, it's people not wanting  to wear watches anymore.  And I still think that's the  case.  And I think it's a case for  Apple, too.

Transcript:  Android Wear, by the way, what's  really interesting is that Apple  took so long to release this  watch and did so little to kind  of further the game that Android  Wear actually has an opportunity  to keep up.  Google's already released an  update for Android Wear just a  few days ago that apparently is  going to add Wi-Fi capability.  I'm not sure if all watches will  be able to do this or what.  They've added emoji drawing.  So if you feel left out that you  can't draw a picture to your  loved one, you can now do this  in Android Wear, not that  anybody would want to do.  I don't know if anybody would  want this.  But I think this Wi-Fi support  is what's most interesting.  The Apple Watch, as long as the  watch is on your Wi-Fi network,  will communicate with the phone.  So I brought my phone out here,  but I didn't need to.  I could have left it in the  office.  I think that's great because  almost all of us are on Wi-Fi  most of the time, right, except  we're on the road.  Apparently, this will happen to  Android Wear as well.  And what's interesting about  this, it won't just be Wi-Fi.  It'll be Internet.  So if you're, and this, I think  this will require additional  hardware.  But if you're like the LG Urbane,  if you are, if your watch can  get online, it will communicate  with your phone, even if you  left your phone at home.  It's a really good, it's a really  good mechanism.  That's intriguing.

I like ducks and acid baths.  But, I mean, it's just.  Ducks and acid baths?  Well, like a duck and water.  You have a vivid imagination.  No, I mean, seriously, the big  problem is battery.  And Wi-Fi is not very good with  dealing with battery life.  So that is going to be an issue  for it.  I like some of the other things  they've done with the wear  update.  I think the gesture control could  be tricky considering, you know,  people flinging their wrists  around in the middle of meetings  isn't going to look particularly  good.  But they're getting there and  they've got an opportunity for a  straight fight with Apple now on  this one.

Android didn't even exist when  the iPhone came out.  I think at this point, Apple took  long enough.  They took a long time to get this  watch out.  They might have given the other  guys a chance to at least still  be in the fight.  So I'll wear this.  Go ahead.  The thing that I think they got,

Transcript:  sorry, the thing that I think  that they advantage they may have,  Leo, is in working with  ecosystem.  They've gotten pretty good at  working with ecosystem.  And so I think that in the same  way they did with iPod and  eventually with iPhone, they  have gotten pretty good at  working with ecosystem.  So I think that the thing that  I think they have done with  iPhone and iPad, too, is working  with healthcare providers and  equipment makers.  So I can see the day the Apple  watch taking off to the point  that it works with all of the  equipment at your gym.  It easily syncs and you can sync  your data to your Apple watch.  I see it working with the big  motor companies where it's a  fob.  It gets you in your car where  you work with security companies  and you can use it to scan  instead of your badge and things  like that.  I think that their win with this  thing might be the ecosystem win  where because it's one platform  and it's one company to work  with versus Android being so  distributed that they could win  with partnerships where an Apple  Pay is another example, too,  where all of a sudden they can  make this thing interact with  lots of things out there in the  world, the Internet of Things,  and all of a sudden the Apple  watch becomes significantly more  useful because of those  partnerships.  I think that's their best shot at  winning with it.

In addition to the heart rate  meter, apparently the Apple  watch has a chip in there and  the capability of measuring  blood oxygen levels.  I don't know if they didn't turn  it on because it didn't work or  they're waiting to do maybe a  rollout of something additional.

You have to be an iPhone user.  And if you're an iPhone user,  you really haven't had many  choices.  You've had Pebble or this, this  is going to be the way to go.  If you're an Android user, I  don't think you should feel left  behind.  I think Android wear, there's  some really good choices for  Android wear.

And that's what I'm coming away  with mostly from this is an  amazing job by Apple and by Sir  Johnny of creating a story  around this watch that is  compelling and is pushing people  to go into the store and spend as  much as $17,000.  It's the Apple reality  distortion field.

But that just means there's a  lot of, you know, that's good  marketing.  That doesn't mean anything  because that's sight unseen.  Yeah, that's basically sight  unseen.

Transcript:  I think that the big test is  going to be once a day.  I think actually there are two  big tests.  One, let's see the first wave of  apps that are actually developed  by people who have had access to  the watch.  Right.  Because I think that will  drastically change the  experience.  Number two, I think that the  most important thing is that  they need to get the, you know,  I guess production cycles down  so that they can actually get  these things out to people  because I'm not getting mine.  You're frustrated.  You're really frustrated.  I am really frustrated because

Transcript:  tell, it is the band rather than  the watch itself that is the  holdup.  And that's, you know, I mean,  get the supply, you know, Apple  is so good at supply chain  dynamics, but in this case, it  really seems like they went into  it blind.  And it's not like they're going  to be able to do that.  I mean, I think that's the  problem.  They're not going to be able to  get into it blind.  And no, it's frustrating to buy  something and to not get it for  two months.  That's a frustrating experience.  To not have enough to actually  have them in stores.  I think if they want this to  take off, this is the time where  they risk losing momentum if  people can't have it, you know,  for a couple of months.  That's a real problem.  So I am glad that they're making  it easy for developers or  easier, I guess I should say,  for developers to get access to  a watch really.  That's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think we've got a lot of  people that are going to be  looking for a watch that looks  correct.  And having the first wave of  watch apps actually built by  people who have access to the  watch will make a big difference

This was very easy.  That's the first time I've done  it and I was able to take it  apart very quickly.

It would be like three or four  hundred bucks for RAM where you  could get it for a hundred bucks  if you just went through, you  know, get it to yourself, did  the upgrade yourself.  It sort of reminds me of that.  You know, they're sort of  making extra on the accessories,  which seems a little silly.  But like I said, I do think the  success or failure of this is  watch the ecosystem play because  they haven't, you know, they've  done a good job of selling it.  Even if the product they've been  a little undisciplined on,  their storytelling is brilliant.  And if they nail it on the  ecosystem thing, they could turn  this into, you know, something  that's far more useful and then,  you know, lack than what they've  lacked a little bit in some of  the focus on the product itself  in terms of really focusing us  on a few things that it can do  really, really well because they  have that opportunity again to  partner and do some really big  things, whether it's, you know,  from checking in with flights,  checking into your room, checking  in, you know, being able to scan  into your building, you know,  two factor authentication, all of  those kinds of things I think  could turn this into something  that would be useful and really  a product that turns into  something you'd want to put on  your wrist again.  That's all that I can see that  would make me want to wear it.  And I know a lot of people that I  know that are on the fence about  it and aren't sure if they want  to wear one again.  Same thing.

Transcript:  Both.  And thank you for writing a nice  article about the return of the  screen savers.  I appreciate that.  Yeah, that was fun.  We're excited.  The new screen savers starts this  coming Saturday.  I'll tell you a little more about  that later.  Our show today brought to you by  My Razor.  Harry's.  We're kind of, we've kind of  become a Harry's company here.  Everybody here shaves with Harry's  razors.  They're so great.  Harry's decided they were going  to change the razor business.  Instead of going to a drug store,  persuading somebody to unlock the  razor blade case so you can get  your $4 blade out there, Harry  said, we're going to do it easy.  We're going to send you the blade.  We're going to make them in our  own factory, a beautiful factory  in Germany.  We're going to design and  engineer them for performance,  for sharpness.  And we're going to get them to  you for about half the cost of  those expensive fusion blades.  About $2 a blade.  It's a great deal.  Harry's gives you high quality  razors at half the price.  They engineer them to be great  blades, performance and sharp,  and then they ship them free to  your door.  Now, I want you to go to  harrys.com and get started.  See the Harry's kits?  This is the way to get to begin.  And boy, they make this  affordable.  With the Truman kit, which is  $15, you get the half the price  of the kit.  You get the handle and you get  your choice of colors.  You get three blades.  You get the travel blade cover,  which is not to be dismissed.  That is actually a very handy  thing.  You also get your choice of the  foaming shave gel, which most  people like, although I'm kind  of partial to the cream.  But you get your choice.  And then you can sign up for a  monthly subscription.  They also have the Winston set.  They've just added it.  I just ordered it.  The stand for your razor, which  is kind of cool.  Is that on the page there  somewhere?  They have a nice little stand  that you could put your razor  in.  There it is.  I just ordered this.  And you can get this engraved so  that you can have his and her  stands, which I do.

Well, some reports, an intrepid  reporter has gone around asking  some questions and it seems to  be Tripp Chowdhury, I guess he's  an analyst, it seems to be pretty  clear that he is going to  announce a $13,000 battery.  Now you may say that's  ridiculous, but in fact this is  an incredible deal.  Yes.  Yes.

Start time: 2934.06
End time: 3041.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to buy one right away.  First of all, PG&E subsidizes it  by half.  Right.  And you can amortize it over a  long period of time.  So the deal is this is a home  battery.  Tripp Chowdhury, who is an  investment analyst, kind of asked  people, and apparently Tesla,  which owns a company, or Elon is  the chief executive chairman and  a major shareholder in a company  called SolarCity, has already  been testing this battery with  300 customers.  So Tripp was smart enough to go  around.  He met a couple of them at trade  shows.  He asked them.  He talked about it.  He pressed for details.  Here is what he learned, and we  think this is probably what Elon  is going to announce.  The system is offered in 10 and  15 kilowatt hour configurations.  The idea, of course, would be if  you have solar, most of the time  if you want to store that, you  have to get these massive arrays  of lead acid batteries, car  batteries, in your basement or  your garage or somewhere, there  explosive, there dangerous, so  most people don't store the juice.  They just sell it back to the  utility company, and so it  reduces their utility bills.  But if you could, it would be  awesome to store it in case of a  power outage or you want to cut  off the grid.  So this is enough to do that.  PG&E is here, and I imagine other  places, other electric companies  will do this, offers a 50% rebate.  They like it because you can get  your power in off-peak hours,  store it in the battery, and  then use it during peak hours.  They will set up the financing  for the customer to make an  additional $1,500 payment.  This is, again, Tripp's research,  this may change when the actual  product is announced, followed by  $15 a month payments for 10  years.  So it's relatively affordable,  and if you've got solar, it makes  so much sense.

Start time: 3045.79
End time: 3142.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A lot of the problem with all of  the renewable energy is that  storage and transmission.  Our grid was not meant for these  types of power, and so we lose  lots of it, solar especially, the  transmission of it.  You lose a lot of it in  transmission, and so it is better  to store it right away.  And if you're selling it back to,  also you have the problem that if  you're selling it back to the  power company, they're charging  you whatever they want.  So if you're selling it back to  the power company, they're  charging you whatever they want,  or they're basically paying you  whatever they want.  There's no competition, and so  they can make money off you.  They can buy that from you for a  certain amount and then sell it  to someone else at a higher price,  and so you're at their mercy.  Now, if you can store that power  yourself, then all of a sudden,  you know, you're taking some of  the power out of the hands of  the sort of the power company,  which is very much a monopoly in  almost every case.  And now, you know, you can be  off the grid and you can do a lot  yourself.  You can use it to power your  hybrid.  You can use it to power your  electric car.  You can use it to store up in case  of a power outage.  You can use it in lots of  different ways.  And so this is one of those  things that a number of people  have said that essentially Tesla,  what they may become is more of a  battery company, basically a  power outage company, and they  may sell their battery  technology, because that's sort  of their secret sauce in many  ways is what they've done with  batteries.  People have actually bought

Start time: 3148.45
End time: 3175.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  You can do a mod on, say, for  example, a Toyota Prius, so in  the event of a power outage, you  can use the power in the Prius  and run the engine to power up  certain aspects of your house.  That's a great idea.  It's like a little generator on  wheels.  But it's a really tough mod to  do on the car.  But something like this, I mean,  particularly if you're working  with, if you've done that, signed  up with SolarCity and you've got  solar powers on top of your  house, this is a great way to  store it.  And as I say, if we live in an  earthquake zone, so who wouldn't  want to rely on that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, Tesla's building a  factory in the Nevada desert,  their Giga factory, to make  lithium-ion batteries.  That goes online in 2017.  So this all kind of makes sense  as a move for Elon Musk and  Tesla.  We'll find out April 3rd,  a few days, what he's planning.  But I like this idea a lot.  And as they point out in the  Guardian article, so many of us  really, with our computers and  our smartphones and our smart  watches, the power goes out.  It is debilitating.  It's the worst thing that can  happen.  During Hurricane Sandy here, I

Start time: 3211.90
End time: 3259.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean, that was one of the big  problems was that power went out  all over the main part of the  city.  And I was very fortunate that we  didn't even lose Internet in  Brooklyn.  But I had college students,  I had colleagues who literally  devastated, where I had people  who were, their apartment  buildings were flooded out.  But the power was out in the  city for a week.  And you think about just how  many things we rely on that  rely on power.  I mean, I'm fortunate that I  have a gas-powered stove.  But even if you think about, like,  if you're in a place where you  have an electric stove and other  things, it's like if the power  goes out, you're literally SOL  on so many levels.  So I think this is great, at least  for some sort of generator  options, if not just for the  additional power saving and  environmental concerns.  We're on a well, so if the power

Transcript:  Did you see, we were talking  about iFixit.  Kyle Weins, who is the founder of  iFixit and its president, wrote a  really strong article, I thought,  for Wired Magazine.  We can't let John Deere destroy  the very idea of ownership.  Turns out that the idea of  ownership is not going to be  the idea of ownership.  Turns out there are consumer  protection laws in the United  States that prevent car companies  from copyrighting the code and  from preventing you from fixing  your car.  But there isn't anything  protecting tractors.  So John Deere, which makes, of  course, these $100,000 combines  and tractors, these very  powerful devices, have applied  to the copyright office saying  farmers don't own these tractors  because of the computer code,  the farmers get an implied  license for the life of the  vehicle to operate it.  It's John Deere's tractor, writes  Kyle, you're just driving it.  Several manufacturers submitted  similar comments to the  copyright office saying the DMCA,  the 1998 copyright law, protects  the copyright on the code in our  tractors.  You cannot modify them, and you  don't own them.  So if you want to fix your  tractor, you have to go to a John  Deere authorized service  representative and pay whatever  he says because only he has the  cute computer equipment that can  fix that.  This is really about big data.

If you know what their yield is  and all of those kinds of things,  then all of a sudden that  information is gold.  And John Deere is now sitting on  that information and they can

So you're talking $300,000 to  $500,000 for one of these.  All that just to borrow the  hardware.  And you don't own it.  You're only borrowing it from  John Deere.  There is a law going through  Congress right now to do the  very same thing to vehicles, to  regular cars.  You really do want to write your  Congress critter and say, you  know, I like the idea that I can  fix my car myself, that I can buy  third-party OBD2 connectors and  look at the data in my car, and I  want to keep that right.

And I think in some ways farmers  are maybe more used to this,  because they don't own their corn  seeds either.  And you take a little bit of that  crop and you'd use it for seed  next year, can't do that.  In fact, didn't Monsanto sue  somebody who was...  They sued seed sorters, yeah.  Because the seeds were blowing  over the fence.

Transcript:  It's an attempt to do a Microsoft  on the seed industry, basically.  Yeah, and Monsanto is also into  this big data and farming  business, too.  We wrote a long-form article  about this on Tech Republic called  The People by 2050.  Wow.  Yeah, and it's about how these  companies, Monsanto and John Deere  particularly, are using this data  and again harvesting this data  to manipulate farmers, to  manipulate markets, and they  understand that this is the future  and they are trying to get a step  ahead of farmers.  And the farmers, you know, there  are people out there that are  helping farmers band together to  make sure that they can control  their own data, to make sure that  they can, that they realize the  value of this data and all this.  So there's like almost like this  big data war coming in farming  and it's important stuff and these  companies are trying to get ahead  of it.  And I really do feel like this  article, which Kyle wrote, which  is really well done, but I think  at the root of this is sort of  John Deere wanting to make sure  that they have control of that  data.

Transcript:  Scottish version of John.  Ian Thompson is here and Jason  Heiner from Tech Republic.  Before we get to the Gazelle ad,  I wanted to show a couple of  things.  First of all, you know that this  Saturday we are launching the new  screensavers.  For many years people have said,  oh, Leo, obviously you're  building Twitter, recreate Tech  TV.  I said, no, that's crazy.  Who would want to do that?  And people would ask me all the  time, when are you bringing back  the screensavers?  And I said, well, I'm not going  to because that was something we  did.  I don't want to be a county fair  nostalgia act.  But at the same time we noticed  from our New Year's Eve broadcast  in the last couple of years that  we felt like we needed a variety  show.  There was a lot of stuff we  wanted to cover you couldn't make  a weekly show out of like cord  cutting or cooking.  There's a lot of stuff we wanted  to talk about that geeks do and  are interested in.  So we thought, what if we had a  variety show?  Gee, has anybody ever done a geek  variety show?  And then I thought, oh, yeah, I  did.  So we decided, now's the time.  I've got the studio.  I've got the staff.  I've got the people.  And let me, do you have Jason  the, so we borrowed some segues  a couple of weeks ago.  We went for a ride and look what  happened.  So we figured we'll do a sabado  gigantico every Saturday  afternoon, right after the radio  show about 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m.  Eastern time, 2200, starting May  2nd, this coming Saturday.  And my cohost for the first  episode will be my cohost for  the last episode, Patrick  Norton will join us.  And so that's going to be a lot  of fun.  We're very excited about that.

Starting at 10 in the morning,  Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern Time,  1700 UTC with Mike Yelgin and  tech news today and then  throughout the rest of the day.  Actually, we're going to have a  fun one on Friday because Bill  is in San Francisco.  Paul Therotte and Mary Jo are  going to come up after build.  Microsoft has a lot to talk about  with Windows 10.  They'll be in town for that.  They're going to bring some  other famous Microsoft Windows  journalists and we'll have a  very special version of Windows  Weekly.  That's going to be 2 p.m. Pacific,  5 p.m. Eastern on Friday, 2100  UTC.  Not on its normal time,  Wednesday morning.  So Friday for Windows Weekly this  week.  Our show today brought to you by  Gazelle.  If you're trying to save up some  money for your new Apple Watch  or your new whatever, maybe you  want to sell some of those old  gadgets.  Gazelle's a great place to go to  get top dollar for your old  gadgets.  They make it easy.  In fact, they give you 30 days.  So get a quote now.  Find some stuff in your drawers.  I bet you there's a few things  gathering dust in your drawers  right now.  And bring it.  What?  What?  And bring it to Gazelle.  Bring it to Gazelle.  I know there is in mine.  All right?  Is that what you were waiting  for?  Bring it to Gazelle.  You get a quote that's good for  30 days.  It gives you time to buy the next  thing, get the data off of the  old thing, put it on the new  thing, and then ship it off to  Gazelle.  They pay shipping on anything  worth more than a buck.  So might as well just pile stuff  into that box.  Just get a ton of stuff.  They'll recycle gadgets too for  you.  So you don't have to, if it's  something you can't get any  money for but you do want to  have it sensibly and  responsibly recycled, Gazelle  will do that for you.  They even buy broken iPhones  and iPads.  Then, by the way, if you want  to buy, let's say you break  something and you want to get a  new one, they also sell the best  quality stuff they get back.  They have two conditions, one  certified like new.  Those are basically new devices  barely used.  And then certified good, they  might be some, you know, some  gentle signs of wear.  But in both cases, fully  functional.  In fact, all devices have been  put through a rigorous 30-point  inspection to make sure they do  everything they're supposed to  do.  And of course, certified pre-owned  devices from Gazelle are backed  by a 30-day risk-free return  policy.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  To buy or to sell, you got to go  to Gazelle.  Gazelle.com is where we sell all  our old gadgets.  The pace of a gadget is  accelerating.  Do you hear the new G4, new phone  next week?  I mean, it just is moving so  fast.  In some ways, I feel like Apple  is at a little bit of a  disadvantage.  We're going to reiterate once a  year on this stuff, right?  And some of these Android  devices, every few months, there's  something new.

Start time: 4147.00
End time: 4156.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, the thing is  that at least with Apple, Apple  knows that if they put out a new  phone, a certain percentage of  the customer base will always buy  it.  Even if it had spikes in it,  they'd still buy it.

Start time: 4217.90
End time: 4225.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has been just that it's big and  that's nice, but it's kind of big  without a reason for being big.  It's just big for big things.  It's not a great screen.

End time: 4237.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a great screen.  It's not a great screen.  It's an okay screen.  It's not a great camera.  It's an okay camera.  I really like the S6.  I really do.  The S6 Edge, the Galaxy.  And you're using that right now.  Are you going to review that  before you buy?

Start time: 4237.94
End time: 4242.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually got my review  in the can at this point.  The edgeless version.  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  The camera was phenomenal.

Start time: 4243.90
End time: 4294.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man, that camera blows me  away.  On the other hand, you won't be  able to use it with Project  Fi-Fi.  Fifi.  Now, so let me give you the  details and then we can talk  about why is Google doing this.  So it is a $20 a month, no  contract, sell contract.  They use Sprint and T-Mobile.  They're going to be a reseller,  an MVNO of Sprint and T-Mobile.  That's kind of interesting.  You'll get a Project Fi SIM to  put in your Nexus 6, which will  automatically switch to the best  signal.  Throw in Wi-Fi into that mix,  because it will use Wi-Fi  calling as well if you have a  good Wi-Fi signal.  So presumably Google is going to  be able to charge you $20 for  unlimited text, unlimited calls.  By the way, unlimited  international texting too, which  I like.  I guess that's probably something  they get with the T-Mobile  relationship.

Start time: 4294.90
End time: 4331.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'm on T-Mobile at  the moment and they're very good  on there.  You get free international data.  So every time I go home back to  the UK, it's just like, I mean,  it's slow.  It's 2G, right?  It's pretty slow.  2.5G, GPRS, yeah.  But it's something.  Yeah, I mean, trust me, someone  that you used to regularly get  stuck with data running charges.  It was just, those prices were  insane.  I'd have to haunt myself on the  street just to pay them off.  But I mean, it's just, with  something like this, I think it  could be very interesting.  They're not going to get the big  players to play along, but it's  an interesting opportunity for  Sprint and T-Mobile to actually  get themselves out there a bit  more as well.

Start time: 4332.08
End time: 4373.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're also separating out the  data completely.  So that's $20 a month.  Then you buy data and you'll,  it's kind of like our old  sponsor Ting, where you ahead of  time, you guess how much data  you're going to use, 10, 20,  whatever, five, three, and you  buy that.  But they rebate you what you  don't use.  And it's a flat $10 a gigabyte  for one gigabyte or for 20  gigabytes.  It's $10 a gigabyte.  I didn't see, maybe you guys saw  anything about overages.  So you say I'm going to use,  let's say, five gigs a month,  $50, so that'll be $70 for the  total package plus taxes.  If you use six or seven  gigabytes, do they just charge  you an extra $10?

Start time: 4374.39
End time: 4382.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I assume it just bumps you up to  the next tier.  Yeah, that was what I was  assuming.  But again, I haven't asked about  that either.  But I do think, go ahead, Leo.

Start time: 4382.90
End time: 4385.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying it's a good  deal because you only pay for  what you use.

Start time: 4387.00
End time: 4449.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, which is cool.  And that's probably where this  is all headed ultimately.  I mean, this is kind of where  things are headed.  The thing that I wonder about  this is most of the people that  I know that have the Nexus 6,  including my colleague Bill  Detweiler has one and likes it,  and it's big.  It is big.  It's a cool device.  I do like how native Android it  is.  I wish the S6 was more native in  the same way, but it's closer  than previous Samsung devices.  But the people who I know who  have the 6 are power users.  They're all power users.  Everybody that I know that has  it.  And so they're going to be using  a lot of data.  So typically it used to be you  never used much data with an  unlimited plan or even if you  had 5 gigs or whatever.  But now with Spotify, with  YouTube, with just web video in  general, I know a lot of people  that are using 3, 4, 5 gigs a  month.  Sure, if you watch Netflix or

Start time: 4450.10

Transcript:  Edge.  And it works pretty well.  Did you try that, Jason, using  Wi-Fi calling?  You have to have T-Mobile for  that to work.  You may not have had T-Mobile.  No, I didn't have a T-Mobile  device.  So on my T-Mobile S6, works  great.  And it's seamless.  You leave the house, hands off  to the cellular network.  The handoff is really nice.

I remember back, I had a BlackBerry,  a Curb-8220 that had Wi-Fi.  But even then it was not terrible,  but it's gotten really good.  Yeah, the 8320.  Great BlackBerry.

Transcript:  You know, the funny thing is Apple  look at doing this too, MVNO.  I think especially when they're  having all that challenge with  AT&T, you know, when they were  exclusive on AT&T for those first  few years.  Yeah.  And they kind of decided, you  know, we're just not in the  wireless business.  We don't want to do that.  But Google, I think Google is  getting better at all of the  kinds of things that, you know,  in terms of being an Internet  provider.  I do think that long-term, you  know, this is another one we've  written a long-form article on  A Tech Republic about Google  Fiber.  You know, and our conclusion is  that they're in this for the  long haul.  They are trying to change the  carrier arrangement, but they  could make money.  We think that they are making  money on this, and they will  make money on this, and that  they're serious about it, and  it's something that they're good  at, right?  And they know that it increases  their bottom line the more  people use Internet.  And obviously they're sending  up balloons now and doing, you  know, Wi-Fi via drones and all  kinds of crazy stuff.  I mean, I think that they are in  the Internet business for the  long haul, and so it completely  makes sense for them to become  an MVNO and get their feet wet  and figure out what it looks  like to try to be a wireless  carrier or at least, you know, a  middleman that's peddling  wireless, you know, wireless  networking.  But who's to say that they don't  buy T-Mobile, that they don't  start buying up wireless carriers  would not surprise me at all?  I think that long-term, you want  to...  I think that they would face

Start time: 4638.90
End time: 4661.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  significant challenges if they  tried to buy.  From the government.  Oh, yeah, they would.  Absolutely.  Because I mean, to me, the big  thing that this is about and has  been about is all about them  getting data.  You know, I mean, they can say  that it's for other reasons, but  I mean, they want the data  because, you know, increasingly  they're losing people who are  going on mobile, right?  I mean, that's their earnings.  They're trying to dispel that  myth, but it's the truth.  But Apple's blocking Google.  In fact, if you do a search on

Transcript:  They can say that they're not  invading your privacy, and we  can kind of get into how  paranoid I may or may not be  about the fact that I don't  think that I would, under any  circumstances, want Google to be  my wireless carrier.  They know enough about me as it  is.  Maybe I'm overly paranoid, but I  do think that by being in the  ISP game, whether it's through  Google Fiber or whatever, I  think that by being in the ISP  game, whether it's through  Google Fiber or with a carrier,  you know, they have access to  all this information.

I think Google know an awful  lot about us already as it is,  and they will know more if  they're an ISP, but from a  purely selfish point of view, I  really like this to succeed  because I am just sick of...  It's a good deal.  Well, I'm just sick of seeing  how badly people over here get  done over for their mobile  contracts for their ISP.  Wait a minute.  You're saying people over there  don't get done over?  You compare the prices in the  U.S. to the prices in Europe.  You're paying about double what  we're doing.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good choices.  You've generally got in most  places choice between three or  four ISPs.  They're all competing on price,  same with mobile vendors.  I think there's seven in the UK  now, and they're all trying to  undercut each other on price.  I have to say, though, the  Project Fi does not sound like

Start time: 4792.08
End time: 4800.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's that good a price.  I mean, I use...  I probably do use five  gigabytes, so now it's $70 plus  taxes.  It's a start.  It's exactly what I pay T-Mobile.  I kind of have a theory of...

Start time: 4800.98
End time: 4829.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a start.  The theory about this is that we  aren't going to know anything  until it actually finally rolls  out, right?  Because if this interconnected  web of millions of Wi-Fi access  points actually has the ability  to be blanketed enough in your  region, your geographical  location...  To never leave Wi-Fi.  ...that you're always on it,  then it doesn't matter how much  data you use right now.  It matters how many Wi-Fi access  points surround you.  Well, here in Petrouma...  Because if you're hopping on it  all the time, you aren't going  to use Wi-Fi.  If you're an Xfinity customer,

Start time: 4829.90
End time: 4840.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you pretty much never have to  leave Wi-Fi here in Petrouma  because of that thing Comcast  does where they take over  wireless routers and make them  available.  I'm always within reach.  In New York, they've gotten

Start time: 4840.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pretty good too because there's  a group between Optimum, which  is Cablevision, Comcast, and  Time Warner, where basically all  three can kind of roam on one  another.  So it's not everywhere, but it's  a ton of places.  I'm an Optimum subscriber, so I  have access in a lot of places.  So you don't even need a cellular

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, but depending on  what area I was in, I wouldn't  necessarily have to.  They also...  Cablevision just started this  thing Freewheel, which is a Wi-Fi  only phone service, which  basically...  Again, I don't think that many  people could use it just that,  but the price of where it is,  it's getting to that level.  Also, I think that you look at...  What I think Google Fi is very  similar to is things like  Republic Wireless, which is  another MVNO.  And I've used Republic Wireless.

Start time: 4894.90
End time: 4904.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  similar kind of idea.  So I think that it's their way  of kind of, like Jason was  saying, kind of getting in the  door of wanting to kind of be  this ISP, be this carrier.  If getting all my information is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the argument they  use with Gmail, but I think  mobile is...  I mean, there's such a lot of  money to be made in this, but  and I think, to be honest, yeah,  if you compare the prices to what  say T-Mobile or Sprinter  charging, it's not that different.  It's the same.  If you compare it to, and I think  the real targets for this are  Verizon, AT&T.  That's exactly it.  Because Verizon are charging,  say, $10 for a thousand text  messages, and the data load on  that is nothing.  So I mean, it's pure profit.  It's free.

Start time: 4935.33
End time: 4951.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes through...  I mean, that's the dirty little  secret.  SMS is free.  It goes through data signals that  are already sent out anyway.  It's like the extra bits.  So the carrier is literally  paying nothing for SMS.  Exactly.  Yet they continue to charge  more for it year after year.  It's the biggest racket in the  entire world.  Well, I'm a T-Mobile customer.

Start time: 4952.00
End time: 4967.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I pay $70 a month, unlimited  text, unlimited phone, and  unlimited data.  And when they say unlimited, I  think they...  I keep saying really unlimited,  and they say, yeah, really  unlimited.  I think they actually do slow it  down after five gigabytes.  Five gigabytes, and then they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm getting essentially the  same thing, right?  Because I could travel  internationally, I get the 2G  or 2.5G, and I get the free  international text.  So essentially, I'm getting this.  What I'm not getting is Sprint.  Right.  So because I am getting Wi-Fi  calling also, and T-Mobile is  great here, but when I go  somewhere where T-Mobile is not  as good, then I don't have that  option of moving over to Sprint.  So that would be the one.  New York City, ooh, ouch.  Brutal.  What is the best...  It's Verizon, right?  Because that used to be 9X.  Oh, yeah.  I think Verizon is the best.  Right.  So is AT&T good in New York?  It is.  It is.  I think Verizon is better and  faster, at least in my  experience.

Start time: 5050.90
End time: 5141.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  taken over everything, if it  would have worked out for them,  if Y-Max would have worked out.  But the problem is, they didn't  competitive.  The reason it didn't work out,  because they still have as much  or more spectrum, which spectrum  is like the bandwidth, right,  than Verizon.  They have all this 4G spectrum.  But the problem is they had to  buy so much of their backhaul  from H&T and Verizon, right?  And so because of that, and they  didn't not sell it to them, but  they dragged it into the  company, and they didn't sell it  to them, and they didn't sell it  to them.  And so they had to buy so much  to them, but they dragged their  feet and made it so slow and  also expensive.  And so because of that, Y-Max  did not succeed.  But Y-Max was this great idea,  and if it would have worked, it  would have been great, because  they were talking about, look,  we're going to, for 30 bucks a  month, your whole family can  have this 4G connection, and  we'll just pay you, they were  going to pay you per gig or  whatever.  But it was going to be, they  were going to charge you per  gig, but it was going to be, and  they even said, I asked the CEO  at the time, I was like, you  just going to be a dumb pipe?  And he's like, you know what, if  we're a dumb pipe and everybody's  honest and we're making lots of  money, I don't care.  He said, but we just want to  bring fast Internet and spread  it around and make it and stop  the carriers from gouging you.  And it was very altruistic, and  it ultimately didn't succeed,  but they had the right idea.  But now they still are sitting  on all of this spectrum.  Wait a minute, my watch is  ringing.

Those are like, I think that  like WebOS sold, well okay,  well WebOS probably sold less  than that.  But that's probably the last  time we had anybody sell  anything that poorly.  I mean I think they could work  as far as the software company  goes.  They're really going into MDM.  But I mean they bought QNX from  Harman and you know, I mean that  makes a nice side business.  You know, but they've got to do  kind of the licensing terms.  But I don't know.  I mean I think they can totally  survive as a software company.

They at least tried to pivot.  BlackBerry, I mean it took them  how many years to get BB-10 out  the door and then even then they  still misjudged what was  happening.

I got blacklisted by BlackBerry  million dollar app fund or  billion dollar app fund or some  ridiculous thing.  And I was on the phone with  somebody.  I was working at Download Squad  at the time, RIP.  And I was interviewing somebody  from BlackBerry and somebody  from this fund and talking about  apps.  And I was like, okay.  So at the time I was a BlackBerry  user but I had an iPod Touch and  I was knowing I was going to  move to an iPhone because I was  so frustrated with my BlackBerry.  But I was like, okay, so, you  know, this is great that you've  got these apps.  Well, when are your apps not  going to suck anymore?  And they got so offended that I  would dare say that their app  situation was dire in 2009.  And I was like, but you guys  understand, right?  Your apps are really bad.  They are nowhere near as good as  what Apple has and even what  Android is doing.  And they got so mad and so  offended I was blacklisted for  like a year and a half.  Which I thought was hilarious.  Yeah, like completely blacklisted.  Completely cut off.  And I thought it was funny.  I was like, you know, I got off  the phone and I turned to my now  husband and I was like, well,  that was the worst interview  phone to me.  The worst interview I've ever  done in my life.  Because they were so, like, they  were like not happy at all.  But I mean, but frankly, I mean,  we could all see it then.  And this is when they were  selling, you know, tens of  millions of phones a quarter.  You know, they were number one.  They were out selling the iPhone.  But they didn't have any app  strategy.  They were crushing it.  And I was like, well, okay, well,  when are you going to make your  apps not suck?  Well, our apps are great.  We've got the best app catalog  out there.  Da-da-da-da-da.  I'm like, no, no, you don't.  And that was when I first went,  ooh, something is wrong here.  Something does not smell right.  And unless they can face reality,  they are going to have problems.  And sure enough, they did.  You know, the playbook, the whole  we can't even, I mean, that's a  whole other saga.  Their ridiculous tablet strategy.  But yeah.  I think every journalist has got

But above all, they could make  it look stylish because Google  Glass version 1.0 just looked  like an engineer had cobbled it  together out of bits.  Yeah.  If they can actually build it  unobtrusively or relatively  unobtrusively into a pair of  stylish glasses, then it might,  just might, take off a little  better than it has so far.  But there's still a hell of a  lot of work that needs to be  done on it.

It has to be, it's a big  it has to be three or four  hundred bucks.  It has to look better and be  more integrated into what looks  like a normal pair of glasses.  And then they have to take the  technology more in the direction  of like Microsoft HoloLens,  which I think is much more on  the right track of something  that could be useful than what  glass was.  I think Microsoft HoloLens is  more like the promise of what  glass could be than what glass  was ultimately.  Yeah, I was blown away by Holo

I came and actually I did a very  excitable interview with Megan  in which I just raved about this  thing.  And then the next day when I was  writing up the full review, it  was just like, well, yes, it is  still bloody brilliant.  But at the same time, you know,  I mean the headset visor that  they showed.  But they were showing you a

You've got to wear this headset.  But it worked.  It worked and it worked really  well.  The thing that, I mean, yeah,  okay, the Minecraft in the house,  that's cute.  Skype calling, that was cute.  The thing that really blew me  away, NASA.  NASA have taken the Curiosity  Rover footage and they've built  that into that.  And then, you know, a bloke from  JPL came in and had a chat with  it.  I was just, as a space geek, I  was just stunned.  But Google's getting into this in  a big way.  They've got Magic Leap  investment.  That's right.  They had the technology to do  it.  Yeah.  And I came away from that  thinking Oculus Rift is a  complete waste of time.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be there.  I mean, it's years away, right?  HoloLens is years away.  But I feel like it's on the right  track.  No, it's this fall.  It is.  It is.  But I mean, for it to be really  awesome, right?  To be, it's good.  I mean, this is a year, this is  a Microsoft year.  Windows 10, HoloLens, you know,  they're becoming such a much more  multiplatform.  Somebody in the chat room brought  up Microsoft Band when we were  talking about the watch.  You know, that's actually true  multiplatform.  And so kudos to them for doing  that.  So I feel like this is a  Microsoft year.  Microsoft's going to be, there's  going to be more to watch, more  to cover, more to be interested  in in Microsoft than there have  been in a long time.  HoloLens this fall is a good  example of it.  But I think for HoloLens to  really, the promise of HoloLens  is still, I think, a couple of  years away when it's, you know,  it is more like Google Glass and  it is integrated into something  you can wear around.  But when it does, you know, and  I feel like they are on the  right track and they're going to  be, suddenly they're going to  be, suddenly they look like  they're ahead of the game on  this, that they're a couple of  steps ahead of everybody else,  interestingly enough.  And that's one of the biggest  breakthroughs, the biggest, you  know, forward-looking areas in  technology is augmented reality,  virtual reality over the next  two or three years.  And so, you know, they are going  to be in this game big time and  they're one to definitely keep an  eye on.

Instead of having an out of work  actor jumping out at you, have  someone bursting out saying, let  it be, whatever the song is, and  you know, kids would eat it up.  And yeah, you've got to wear a  backpack.  Well, you know, chances are you  are wearing a backpack anyway.  So it's, yeah, I think HoloLens  is really, really interesting.  If they do it right, it could be  a lot of fun.  If they do it wrong, and let's  face it, Microsoft does have  form on this sort of thing, then  it could be a rather big let  down.  It's going to happen.

Transcript:  Let's take a break, come back  with more in just a bit.  Ian Thompson from The Register,  Jason Heiner from CBS  Interactive and Tech Republic,  from Mashable, Christina Warren.  We're talking high tech.  We're talking fresh books.  The simple cloud accounting and  invoicing solution that will  change your life.  It did me.  As a freelancer, the worst thing  in the world is billing, invoicing.  I hated the end of the month,  firing up Excel and trying to  figure out my hours were, and  getting all the expenses together.  I just put it off, which means I  didn't get paid.  Fresh books solved that for me.  This was back when I was going to  Toronto.  Amber MacArthur told me about it.  I had to bill Rogers every month  in Canadian dollars.  She said, oh, no problem.  Fresh books handles currencies  and makes it easy.  Your invoices look pro, and you  get paid faster because it's  easier for your clients to pay.  Fresh books will let you create  and send invoices, capture and  manage your expenses with their  Fresh Book apps.  Even keep track of time and  hours.  You can press the button on the  app when you start, press it when  you stop, and it automatically  gets right into the invoice.  Super intuitive, easy to use.  I felt like, to me, this was my  first Web 2.0 app.  I mean, this was a mind-boggling  experience.  Now, here we are, 5 million  customers, almost 10 years later,  Fresh Books is even better than  ever.  They've surveyed many of their  customers.  They know a lot.  For instance, Fresh Books users  save about 16 hours a month on  admin tasks.  That's like two extra days a  month.  You double your revenue in most  cases in 24 months, in many of  them, on average.  And on average, they get paid  five days faster.  I'm not guaranteeing you'll  double your revenue, although I  did come to think of it.  FreshBooks.com slash twit to try  it free for 30 days.  If you ever need help, they're  support rock stars.

You know, it was a great  article.  Frank Eliason, who used to be  Comcast cares on Twitter.  He was the guy.  He revolutionized.

Transcript:  So he moved on.  I think he's working at City  Bank now.  But he said, and I thought this  was hysterical, he said he  believes that the merger didn't  happen because of us.  And he said, you know, Comcast,  even though they spent  something like $25 million  lobbying Congress on this issue,  even though Tom Wheeler is a  former head of the National  Cable Television Association.  Member of the Hall of Fame as  well.  And in their Hall of Fame, and  he's the chairman of the FCC.  And by the way, what happened  to the former chairman of the  FCC?  And by the way, what happened  to Tom Wheeler?  Did he like flip?  I think he flipped.  Oh, he flipped hard.  He became one of us.  But Frank Eliason says, and  here's a guy who's watching very  closely and has ties to  Comcast.  He says, you can spend all the  money you want.  You can have the chairman of the  FCC in your back pocket.  But if the people don't want it  to happen, it's going to work.  And it was so encouraging to me.  He said, this is Comcast  chickens coming home to roost  after many years of crappy  customer service.  People hated Comcast and  basically wrote to their members  of Congress and said, we don't  want this merger.  No matter how much you give your  member of Congress, it's the  vote that ultimately counts to  them.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, at the end of the day,  you've got the two companies  with possibly the worst customer  service between them.  Horrible.  Trying to get together.  And the American market does not  need large ISPs and cable  companies.  It needs lots of little ones  competing problems.  And they're not going to be  doing it properly rather than  just trying to lock up the  entire market.  And people just looked at the  way they're getting treated by  these companies at the moment  and said, if they join together,  you know, there's nothing we can  do.  And they got on the phone and  they got people.  They got people against it.  I don't know.  I mean, I think I think everyone  who was in the sector really  rejoiced when when the news came  out that it was again that it  was fully that the whole deal  had fallen down.  But now we've got to see what  charter are going to do.  And if they're going to say,  load themselves down with debt  to try and take over TWC,

I mean, what the net neutrality  when he was appointed, we were  just discussing in the office  and you look at his record and  it might as well have been  written by the telecoms industry  as the person they wanted in  charge.  And he's just been a  revelation.  I don't know what it is.  I mean, whether the government  got something on him or he

Start time: 6438.47
End time: 6485.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  realized maybe his duties is to  the to the consumers and to the  public rather than to the  lobbyists.  Go figure.  But it's so amazing to see that  even the one he did from his  first proposal for net  neutrality, you know, a year  ago versus what actually ended  up happening and what he ended  up championing.  You know, his original language  and his original proposal was  ridiculously out of whack.  And obviously that's why  everyone wrote in and, you  know, signed petitions and  called their congressmen and,  you know, filed complaints and  responses with the FCC.  But for him, you're dead on  Ian.  I mean, do they have something  on him?  Because he just literally has  done a total 180 from every  position you would think someone  like him and someone in his  someone in his position would  take.  Well, I also give credit to John

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He called Tom Wheeler a dingo  and his excellent conversation  about net neutrality raised, in  fact, the issue of Comcast and  Netflix, Comcast putting the  screws to Netflix as they  eventually did to get access.  And so John Oliver, I think,  gets some credit.  I think he raised awareness of  people to net neutrality.  I think we can give him some  credit for changing net  neutrality in Tom Wheeler's  mind a little bit.  And by the way, John Oliver  says he is not a dingo.  Well, he may be a dingo, but  he's one of the nice kinds.  He's a cuddly dingo.

It doesn't always happen that  way, but I think in this case  in some cases his true colors  have shown through.  He's not an elected official.  His job is to sort of act  rationally on behalf of the  American people.  And so I think to everyone's  surprise, he has.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise totally  still has it.  I mean, he might be crazy as  hell.  Don't sue me, Tom.  But allegedly.  He's charismatic.

That by participating, by  being active, by writing members  of Congress, by using the tools  available to us, we can actually  sway Congress.  We can sway the FCC.  We can get them to do what we  want to do.  But we have to be active.  And those were two hot-potting  topics that geeks were very  active on.

We've got a presidential  election coming up in a bit,  a little over a year.  And it is not going to...  Whoever gets nominated, it's not  going to be a choice any of us  want to make.  No, really.  None of the frontrunners look  good.  And so what I think is  unfortunate is when that  happens, young people  especially get disillusioned  and say, well, see, all I can  vote for is one muppet or  another muppet.  I don't want either muppet.  So politics obviously doesn't  matter, but it does matter on  the local level.  It can matter when you...  On the congressional level.  You know, you need to get  involved.  President, maybe not so much.  It costs so much now.  I think they're saying that it  will be a billion and a half  dollars for each side in this  presidential election.

And you are only allowed to  campaign for three weeks.  I love that.  The business of government goes  on until three weeks before  the election and then everyone  goes home and goes campaigning.  And now you've got people who  are announcing for the  presidency 18 months before the  election.  And you have to.  But, I mean, it's...  And most members of Congress  are raising money all through

You know, it's like Bill Clinton.  He seemed OK at the time.  He seemed OK at the time.  And then my local Labour MP at  the next election, I wrote her  an email the night before the  election.  I was terribly drunk.  Just saying, look, I've been a  Labour voter all my life.  I just cannot bring myself to  vote for that grinning little  whatever.  And she sent me a lovely email  saying, Tony will not be with  us for that much longer.  And when he's gone, you can  come back to the fold.  Wow.  He was just...  Tony looked good initially.

This, you know, fast track on  this treaty is appalling.  Fundamentally undemocratic.  And, of course, the eavesdropping,  which has done nothing but  increase during his tenure, all  of that kind of soured me a  little bit.  And I'm trying not to get sour  to politics in general.

But, you know, everyone's got  the choice to do what they want  to do.  But no, particularly after the  last two presidents, then  there's...

Homeland Security at RSA this  week, you also got Obama's  cybersecurity sort of aide or  whatever, Congressman Mike  Richards or whatever from who was  overseeing, and they all said the  same thing.  We need a perfectly safe, strong  form of encryption.  No.  We need a form of encryption  which law enforcement can also  access.  And every single person who knew  anything about cryptography there  was just like, you don't get it,  do you?  But Silicon Valley can invent  anything.  Math doesn't work like that.  They're still pushing the back  door.  Yeah.  I mean, I thought we got this  settled in the late 90s, and you  got a new generation of  politicians who have come through  who just...  You've got to explain it to them  again and again.  It doesn't work like that.  And even if it did, you then  got to give that same power to law  enforcement around the world.  Yeah.  Right.  And who at the end of the day is  going to buy an Apple or an  Android phone if they know that the  encryption is already broken?  It just...  It makes no logical sense at all.  I had one cryptographer in the pub  late at night who was just like,  it's just...  I mean, he's British, so it's just  bollocks.  There's no possible way they can  do this.

Transcript:  This is going to be a common  theme, but we have another long  form article on this called Why  AI Can Destroy More Jobs Than It  Creates and How to Save Them.  But it's actually so it has some  interviews with a number of the  people that like at MIT and other  places that are working on AI,  Eric Bernolfson, who did the  second machine age, the book, the  second machine age and others.  And ultimately, actually, if you  read the article, there are some  things to come away with.  You know, I'm not as freaked as  Bill Gates or Elon Musk.  I'm not as smart as those guys  either.  But but I think that's the  thing.  I think that these researchers  who are working on this stuff  bring up some ways that clearly  AI is a long, long way from  getting even close and may never,  ever be able to deal with the  kinds of experiential knowledge  that human beings can where they  take two different kinds of  knowledge and bring them together  and then come up with conclusions.  You know, and then, you know,  now it's going to automate a lot  of manual labor jobs.  But we've been worried about  that for decades.  And, you know, the likely result  of that is that people are then  in those jobs going to have more  time.  And that will, you know, it's a  brutal process.  But that will every time we've  had one of these leaps forward  in technology, what happens is  humans find better, smarter,  more interesting things to do.  And it ends up pushing humanity  forward.  Let's see.  That's a very optimistic view.  You're an optimist.  But looking at history, that  tends to be the way, you know,  these things happen.

Transcript:  No, he's sweet.  He's kind.  But one of the interesting  things, the biggest takeaway  from this is that Honda's been  working on this for a long time.  They've been working on this  since the 1980s for 30 years and  they have developed what is the  most humanoid-like robot that we  have in existence.  And Asimo itself is about the  12th version of the humanoid  robot.  And it came out in 2000.  I remember seeing it walk

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about the research and the trial  and error that has gone into  this.  And every year it keeps  advancing.  It keeps doing more.  And now it can kick a soccer  ball.  It can walk up and down stairs.  It can run.  It can pick things up for you.  It can shake hands.  There's another photo where I  was shaking hands.  Now, was it a firm handshake?  It was pretty firm.

Start time: 7792.70
End time: 7795.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty firm.  It seemed like you didn't want  to let go.

Start time: 7795.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But as soon as I, but it was  smart enough to when I, you  know, disengaged my grip that it  gave up.  It disengaged.  Okay.  But this is a long way, or  I'm not sure, but it's a long  way.  But this is a long way from  being usable, right?  And artificial intelligence is  the next big thing that can feed  into this.  But one of the things, like, I  pushed them on is, like, are you  guys connecting up to the cloud?  Like, are you partnering with  people who are doing artificial  intelligence and that kind of  thing?  And they are.  And they're working on some of  those things.  They were kind of coy about, you  know, how much of that they're  doing.  Because, you know, there's a lot  of massive processing that can  go on in the cloud doing things  like IBM's doing with lots of  dots and those type of things.  But, you know, we're a long,  long way from this being, you  know, something that can be, you  know, human-like.  They're aiming Osimo as being a  helper in the home, for instance.  So people that are, that have  some kind of physical  limitations, right?  It can pick things up for you.  It can answer the door for you.  And the eyes are essentially  cameras.  And you can look at your phone or  a tablet and see who it is, you  know, interact with them.  It is looking at things like  going in and doing, like,  nuclear waste cleanup, doing,  you know, landmines, searching  for landmines, using robots,  things that we don't want to use  humans for.  But it's very, very basic.  And it's a long way away from  being something that can, you  know, replace humans in jobs  other than sort of very, the  very, you know, most, most basic  things.  I mean, obviously some of the  home helper thing, you know,  would compete with somebody like  a home elf, Hade, and that kind  of thing.  But only for people that need  very little of the things that,  you know, the healthcare.  I love this UniCub that you were

Start time: 7922.44

Start time: 7927.71
End time: 7964.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So out of the Osimo  technology, they did a lot of  research on how humans walk,  right, to make this walking  humanoid robot.  And so two things came out of  it.  This device called Walk Assist,  which is a belt that attaches  and then attaches to your legs,  and it helps people like that  that have had a stroke or that  are somehow physically limited  in walking.  It helps them walk.  And then also the UniCub, which  is a little device that you sit  on and you sort of lean forward  and you can use the pedals.  You can see my feet on a little  bit.  Just a little bit of pressure  helps you kind of speed up or  slow down.  And then you lean to kind of  steer and to, you know, direct  your feet.  It's like a segway.

Start time: 7964.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 7965.85
End time: 8026.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is.  It's like a much less expensive  version of a segway.  They're aiming them at things  like airports.  Yeah, there's the, you're pulling  up on the screen now, the Walk  Assist device.  But the UniCub is like a little  exoskeleton almost.  Yeah, it is totally an  exoskeleton, exactly.  And they eventually want to make  it small enough so it could fit  under your clothes and, you know,  assist you in walking.  That's going into clinical  trials next year.  So that's getting close.  The UniCub is going to be  something that they have at a  science and technology museum in  their testing in Tokyo.  And the UniCub is aimed at  things like airports and museums  and, you know, wide open spaces  where it is, if you are limited  in your mobility, you might be  limited in being able to walk.  So they have taken this robotics  research and done some very  practical things with it in ways  to help people today.  And they're going to be able to  do that today, you know, within  the next five to ten years.  And so, you know, I took my hat  to them on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you feel like, did you feel  like this was personified that  there was, obviously you don't  need really to make a robot with  legs and able to walk or in a  humanoid form at all.  But they clearly want to do that  so you're comfortable with it.  Do you feel like, I mean, were  you, did you feel like this was  a thing, a human or a thing?

Start time: 8046.10

Start time: 8050.18
End time: 8078.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but they did particularly,  interestingly enough, you know,  you saw, you put the video up  there or the photo up there of  the different evolution of Asimo.  And you could see that they  actually shrunk him in the last  few iterations.  So he is now only four feet tall  and they said that is to make  him so that he's not as  intimidating to human beings.  And so they purposefully have  made him small so that he's not  as scary, essentially.  Well, originally, apparently he

Start time: 8079.34
End time: 8083.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  looked like Mouseketeers.  So no, no, that's the wrong  picture.  Wait.

Start time: 8084.17
End time: 8123.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's him.  So there's a Disney Land in  Anaheim, California now.  There's an Asimo exhibit where he  sort of does a little  performance.  Asimo's a rock star in the  gallery that I did there on  ZDNet that you're pulling the  photos from.  You know, there's him shaking  hands with the ruler of Dubai  and there's him all over the  world, you know, doing,  performing for crowds and doing  its thing.  I shouldn't say he.  They haven't said, although  the voice is a 15-year-old boy  whose voice they use for Asimo.  But because the voice is high,  it's kind of androgynous, you  know, and purposefully so.  And so Asimo is...  Well, not unthreatening, I think,

Start time: 8124.00
End time: 8129.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is what they're going for.  If you look at the early Asimos,  these are terrifying looking.  I don't want to go anywhere near  them.

Start time: 8130.30
End time: 8151.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are, definitely.  So yeah, the four-foot Asimo is  very friendly-looking, but it  does, you can tell that this is  still, you know, essentially  decades away, you know, from  being something that we've seen  in movies or that kind of thing.  But obviously decades in the  grand scheme of things is not  that far.  Things happen fast, as we've

Start time: 8151.80

Start time: 8162.86
End time: 8173.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Grand Robotics?  It was like these cars could  barely go five feet before  driving off the road.  Now cars have driven across the  country completely autonomously.  What's the grand challenge going  to be this year?  They've got a six-foot one

Start time: 8174.78
End time: 8206.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  robots whose job is to drive a  car for humans to a crash site,  break open a door, kill John  Collett, turn off a valve, punch  the wall, do a whole bunch of  other stuff.  The idea is that these are going  to be rescue robots as  untimely robots.  They're going to come back to  us.  That's how they start.  But as you said yourself, with  the automotive challenge, that  was a hilarious first attempt.  And yet they made great

Start time: 8207.74
End time: 8210.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  progress.  They made it work.  Very fast.

Start time: 8210.80
End time: 8289.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it works.  We could have it now.  The problem is insurance.  Is who pays for it?  They have far fewer accidents  than human beings, far fewer.  But if there is an accident, who  is liable?  The person.  Exactly.  Who pays?  Is it the company that made the  technology?  Is it the person who owns it?  Is it whatever?  So this still has to get worked  out.  In Israel, these self-automated  vehicles essentially are  patrolling borders in Israel.  They are very much real and they  are very much in use and fully  capable.  The one that the Ben Gurion  University in Israel did, they  are one of the ones that have  won these robotics challenges in  the past.  They have an SUV that can now,  it's now smart enough that can  handle four-way stops, which is  something that is unique to the  U.S.  But it's one of the most  difficult things to handle,  right?  Because there is a little bit of  unpredictability, like, okay,  who got there first and can we  tell, are you about to go or are  you not?  And it takes a little bit of,  you know, a little bit of  awareness.  And so they have gotten to the  point that their vehicles can  now even handle four-way stops.

Start time: 8290.50
