This Week in Tech.  We're going to cover a lot of ground today.  So I'm going to get going very quickly introducing our panelists and a great panel assembled  today for the show.  Starting with my friend Alex Lindsay who's in studio with us from the Pixel Core.  Hello.  Good to see you once again, Alex.  It's good to be here.  Right after the show today, we're going to have a live concert.  Alex is bringing Peter Himmelman in to perform for us.  That's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was excited.  You were on the show.  I guess you were on his show.  Yeah, he does a show on Usetim called Furious World.  Yeah.  And I mentioned that I really enjoyed his music.  And next thing I know, he's coming up.  He's doing a concert in your backyard.  Yeah, he's coming.  I think it's raining here.  So I think he's going to do it in my living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's something Bono never did for me.  I told him many times how much I liked his work, but nothing.  Nothing at all.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think we're going to be streaming live from my living room later this evening.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it should be fun.  Also with us from channeldvorak.com, it's John C. Dvorak, the world's most prolific  computer columnist.  Hey, John.  Hey, there I am.  There he is in your clown wig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wears that.  I'm supposed to have that big finger or something that goes back and forth.  You sit in the front row at a baseball game.  We're number one.  Whatever happened to that guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also with us from the Houston Chronicle, and I think a good time to have him on because  he is a Hearst employee, Dwight Silverman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, and I'd like to keep it that way, Leo.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we shall see.  I don't know if you have the option.  We're going to talk about this is the week that newspapers kind of started the beginning  of the end, I think, in some ways.  I hope not.  Well, good.  Well, this is good.  This will be a good topic.  I hope not, too.  I love my newspaper.  Denise Howell is on vacation.  I'm so jealous.  She's at Indian Wells enjoying the fine weather, but she's consented to join us in her bikini.  And it'll be a first.  I think we've never had a twit panelist in a bathing suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think I'm the only one not on video, and that's no accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we tried.  You can't say we didn't try.  Hi, Denise.  This is the host of, of course, this week in law.  And she does the Blogarithms column and what is it?  Blog and baggage, which I love.  Bag and baggage.  Bag and baggage, which I love.  And has a new page, imetdenise.com.  It's your channel, Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My lame attempt, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we're all here to talk about the end of times, actually.  This was the week that the Rocky Mountain News halted publication.  Really upsetting, I think, a lot of the employees there.  They said, well, you didn't even try to fire us first.  You didn't even try to cut down.  And the guy in charge said, well, we could have cut the newsroom in half and it still  wouldn't have saved us.  Even if we had a 40% increase in online revenues for the next five years, it still wouldn't  have saved us.  We're essentially out of luck.  The San Francisco Chronicle, not the Houston.  The San Francisco Chronicle also announced $50 million a year losses.  And they said, we've got to do some, the Hearst Corporation, their owner, said we've got to  do some severe cutting or we're going to have to sell the operation.  Something similar to what they've said in Seattle on the Post-Intelligencer.  They said, we're either going to find a buyer or we're going to shutter the doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My question is, who would buy a standard newspaper in these days?  Paul Allen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  He'll buy it for the tax deduction.  You have a dog in this hunt, Dwight Silverman, because you work for the Hearst Corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  And the Houston Chronicle is not quite in the shape that the San Francisco Chronicle  is.  We're looking at some layoffs sometime in the next probably 45, 30 days.  So we already had some at the end of last year.  Newspapers essentially are trying to get their staffs and their operations down to  meet their revenues, which are declining.  The print revenues are dropping because of the economy and other factors.  And the web revenues aren't going up fast enough to meet them, although growth is pretty  good on the web.  So it's a real sticky situation and a tough time to be in the business.  What's killing the newspapers?  I think it's a variety of things.  I think that economic seesaw that I mentioned with the cost of video, I mean the cost of  the web versus print ads that just doesn't make up for it.  Print ads are a rarity.  They are few and far between because of space.  But on the web, they're a commodity.  And so you just can't charge as much for them.  So far what we've been trying to do is generate as many page views as you can to put ads on  them.  But that causes the value of the ads to go further down.  And of course, in an intense economic recession, I like to call it an economic tesseract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is, by the way, for those of you who don't know, a fourth dimensional cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  And the reference actually that I like is from Madeleine Lingel's A Wrinkle in Time.  Because it kind of feels like we're going back in time through this fourth dimensional  cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So economically speaking, is it no coincidence or is it a coincidence that the Kindle 2 came  out this week?  John, do you think that that's part of what's going on?  Nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nah.  The fact of the matter is the newspapers have been in a slide since the advent of TV news.  It's been a slow decline and it was accelerated only recently.  But they were sliding years ago before the web.  And then now what the web has done is it's pointed out a couple of things in my opinion  that are a problem.  One, I think the newspapers aren't providing a quality product to their readers.  In fact, if I was looking at the Rocky Mountain news site right now and they have their covers  all online, and I'm looking at these covers and they suck.  I don't see any reason I'd buy this newspaper if it was on a news site.  Only one of these covers are interesting.  But the rest of them are just like boring.  It was a tabloid paper, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are two papers in Denver.  So I mean, I don't think there's any markets except New York City where you could support  more than one newspaper, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's always possible, but not when these papers are so dull that nobody cares.  But anyway, let me bring up a couple of interesting factors besides the fact that the papers are  crappy product.  And of course, then they cheapen them as they have to do cutbacks.  They don't put more money into them.  They take money out of them, which makes it worse.  But it seems to me that what's always been overlooked and what I think the web managed  to point out to everybody is the redundancy of news.  I mean, if you're a newspaper and all you do is run AP stories and stuff that you've  syndicated from the New York Times or even your own syndicate, and everybody and their  sister that's in the syndicate runs the same stories.  And if you go on the internet and you see nothing but redundancy, you say, why do we  need all these newspapers for?  I think there's just too many.  There really only needs to be a few national newspapers and some local newspapers.  And these kind of quasi-national papers, which would include the Houston Chronicle, which  are really only sell into a small and moderate sized area, I think they're all toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Chronicle has 330,000 subscribers, the 12th largest newspaper in the country.  Is it gone?  The Chronicle?  Yeah.  Not Houston, San Francisco.  It's toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which means San Francisco will not have a daily paper.  Well, it's still...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got a couple of these, these free ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The examiner's still...  The free ones.  The free ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great.  Well, the one thing that's happening in San Francisco is that the Hearst has told the  unions that it wants serious concessions and is talking about some serious cuts in terms  of staffing and they have to get to a certain amount before they can achieve it.  They have said they will close it if they can't get to that, but it's also interesting  to look at what's happening in Seattle where it looks like they're going to go with an  online only version.  I am not in the loop in terms of Hearst corporate.  I don't know anything more than kind of what you read in the newspapers.  That's ironic.  Or on the blog.  Or on the blog.  But I'm really intrigued by what's happening in Seattle.  I was kind of hoping like that would happen a long time ago.  I think Seattle has an opportunity to be a real test bed for an online only newspaper  with a brand is primarily promoted by a website as opposed to print.  I wish that Hearst would do that in San Francisco, but I don't know that the economics are there  in that paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Denise, you're in beautiful Indian Wells with your husband.  You're enjoying a beautiful Sunday.  Did you sit down to brunch with the Sunday Times and take hours leisurely reading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not brunch, but we do get the paper every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love my Sunday paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'll go out and get it if it's not delivered to the house.  That's mostly driven by my husband.  I'm a paper reader because it's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We subscribe to the local small town paper, the Argus Courier, which comes out on a Wednesday.  It's owned by Times Corporation.  We subscribe to the Sunday Times and we subscribe to the San Francisco Chronicle.  On my Kindle, I subscribe to all the same stuff, including plus the New Yorker, the  Atlantic and the Salon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you like reading it on the Kindle?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is where it's calling me.  I love the Kindle.  I'm very happy with the Kindle for reading books, but it is not a satisfying experience  for reading a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's something about browsing a paper that is a very different aesthetic experience from  reading sequentially page after page on a book.  A paper is meant to browse.  I think images are important.  I think scanning is important.  The physical tactical side of it.  Denise, you're not one of those people who feels...  I thought that maybe you were a Sunday paper kind of person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am a Sunday paper kind of person, but only because somebody else is going to the effort  of putting it in front of me.  We subscribe to the paper at home.  I'm looking forward actually to getting the new Kindle because one of the papers that's  going to be on there is the San Francisco Chronicle.  Like you said, I don't regularly go and check out sfgate.com.  I used to live in the Bay Area and I do miss that paper.  It has a unique flavor all its own.  I'm looking forward to getting it on the Kindle.  I'm kind of hoping that it's a better experience than reading it on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things about the Kindle and newspapers is that what you're getting is part of the  morning edition.  In other words, not everything.  It isn't the whole thing, is it?  No.  It's only delivered once.  What kind of irritates me about newspapers on the Kindle is that they don't update the  news during the day.  I think it would be really cool to have a device that you could carry around with you  where just like on the web, you got breaking news.  You got things that were happening during the day.  I think that's an opportunity lost on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a device like that.  What's that?  It's called my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  iPhone is an amazing device for getting breaking news.  I've been kind of running around our newsroom and talking to our managers and yelling that  we should be doing a lot more on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not just the iPhone that you can get breaking news on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, but I'm talking about just smartphones.  I think mobile smart devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's mobile.  Yeah, because it's mobile.  I think that makes sense.  I tweeted last night that I won an iFindle.  An iFindle.  Well, now one of the stories that did circulate when the Kindle 2 came out was that maybe  Amazon would be releasing this format and making, for instance, an iPhone application  possible.  I don't think the form factor of the iPhone is really as easy to read.  It might be ironic.  You might be right, Dwight, that the iPhone is better for reading a newspaper and the  Kindle is better for reading a book.  For breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I find that I got into the habit of doing it, going through the New York Times  on my iPhone when I was in San Francisco.  Times is a very nice client for that.  Yeah, and I didn't use the client.  I actually used their webpage.  Really?  And I took the cable car to work.  And so it was really a pain in the neck to open a newspaper because it would blow and  it'd be hard to keep track of it while I was reading it.  And once I got used to it, I got to a point where that's actually what broke me away from  ever going back to the paper was I got used to having this little box that had all my  text in it.  And it was much easier to eat your breakfast and read the New York Times on my iPhone than  it was using a newspaper.  Well, there's also some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but there's also some sort of a green irony here.  The newspapers have largely promoted the idea of conservation and going green and all the  rest of it.  And when you look at surveys about why people stop subscribing to newspapers, a lot of it  has to do with the fact that they don't like to waste all that paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I admit it.  I feel really guilty.  And we recycle it.  New York Times, 70,000 trees a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I mean, I feel guilty when I see that big stack of paper.  And the truth is the other reason you feel guilty is you only read a fraction of what  that paper represents.  So it really is waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And the Sunday paper.  And all the good stuff that comes from sitting down with the Sunday paper, all the advertising  that you have to throw away when you have that paper is just disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's how they were making their living.  I'm going to submit that there's really three things that killed the daily paper.  Ink, paper, and Craig Newmark.  I mean, if you don't have Craig's List, isn't...  Dwight, am I wrong on the economics of newspapers?  Wasn't the classified ad what kept newspapers alive?  And without that, can they survive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a real interesting illustration of that.  You're right.  In the 70s, when the kind of Rust Belt was falling apart, people were moving to the south.  The Houston Chronicle and the Houston Post's classified sections were incredibly fat and  happy and people used to sell them on the streets of Detroit and other Rust Belt cities,  the classified sections because they had the ads for Houston in them.  We had a huge influx of people coming down in that era into Houston from Michigan and  the Rust Belt.  But what ultimately has happened is, yes, that the internet, I wouldn't say just Craigslist,  I think Craigslist had a real impact in San Francisco, less so in other parts of the country.  But the internet in general and ways of being able to distribute goods, including eBay,  I think wound up cutting into classifieds terribly.  And it's now very thin.  I mean, you look at the classified section in our paper now versus what it was in its  heyday in the 70s, and it's just astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about...  They were putting too many eggs in that classified basket, let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree.  What about really the bigger issue, which is newsgathering?  You know, they're all saying we can't afford the big newsroom.  But, you know, I look at, you know, you look at Drudge, you even look at the Huffington  Post, and mostly what they do these days is aggregate mainstream media.  They're not doing much journalism on their own.  If you get rid of the newsrooms, if you get rid of the investigative reporters, don't  we as a democracy suffer as well?  And when I say we, the US, but worldwide, doesn't the world suffer without a free press?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's already suffered.  Look, people have already talked about the foreign, all the foreign correspondents are  all gone.  They've been gone for decades.  That's true.  They've pulled them, and they pull them, and they don't have resources for these investigative  reports.  We're living in a dream world if we think this stuff even exists anymore.  Now it's just redoing, you know, Associated Press stories, Reuters, whatever else you  have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've just taken the feeds.  So is it Reuters that's got the big newsroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reuters does have a big newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that's the solution.  Denise, what were you going to say there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, you know, I think of it as kind of parallel to the music industry,  the impulse to do journalism certainly hasn't gone away.  Just like the impulse to be a creative musician, but the business models are all in flux, and  the old ones are falling apart, and the new ones are being figured out.  And what I was going to say about the Huffington Post, for example, that's interesting is,  you know, they do give a forum for some unique individual voices that you wouldn't see in  mainstream media.  True.  You know, you have Esther Dyson reporting in for a base camp in Russia, and just random  things that I think are fascinating examples of citizen journalism or, you know, individualized  journalism that are trying to find their way into this new business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that I completely agree.  I think that the issue is that you are going to end up with less of a professional class  of journalists that are more syndicated, you know, so that there's less writers writing  about the same thing.  Right now we have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where do Woodward and Bernstein come from in the future?  Who's going to pay for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that you're still going to have national brands of people who are writing  that are going to end up exposed to a lot of markets because-  More markets.  Because the markets will be, you know, I think that having a local reporter reporting on  national or international news will become less and less common because it doesn't-  You just don't have the money to do that.  But I also think that you're going to continue to have this exploding, you know, blogosphere  where people are able to put stuff up that isn't necessarily as refined.  But, you know, this is the same thing we hear every time there's a revolution.  Everything turns over-  It's disruptive, yeah.  When I was working at a cable network learning how to do pre-press, you know, learning how  to do computer- and I've said this before, that the art directors were lamenting these  interns that were getting paid $4.50 an hour and taking away their work, you know, and  that the art direction was going to go, you know, to hell in a hand basket because of  all of this.  And, you know, it was bad for a couple years as people figured all of that out.  But then something else came up and replaced it.  And I think that we're going to see that happen again.  I don't know exactly how long it'll take, but it's exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wanted to take exception to something John said about local investigative reporting.  I think that's still being done in a lot of markets.  Last week, we had a federal judge plead guilty to charges of sexual harassment of his staff  as a result of stories that we had done in our paper.  And stories like that are being done in major cities and newspapers all the time.  The Rocky Mountain News was known for that kind of thing.  So I think that that type of journalism is still going on.  I think-  Well, who's going to do it in Denver?  Well, in Denver, you know, there's the Denver Post.  That's it.  I don't know what their reputation is, right.  But that's more than zero.  Yeah, one more than zero.  It's close to zero.  Close to zero.  And I think that one of the things that we're doing at The Chronicle is we are  trying to provide a platform for the community to cover itself.  We allow people to set up blogs and we have recruited people to write about kind of their  niches. That's not investigative reporting, but I think that the future of newspapers is to kind of  find a way to let the community tell its story.  Our traditional past mission has been to go out, get information, compile it, make it  understandable, and then present it to people.  And I think now what we have to do is kind of go onto the web, go to where people are talking and  writing about themselves and doing video about themselves, organize that, compile it, and make  it understandable to the community, help the community cover itself.  That's the way I think that we can in the long term go in and provide the coverage that people  want in a city from a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dwight, what are you going to do after the Houston Chronicle folds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to write a blog?  I don't think that the Houston Chronicle is going to fold.  We're in relatively good shape compared to the rest of the country.  But yeah, I mean, if tomorrow I had no newspaper, I own DwightSilverman.com and I have a few other  catchy little domains that I'm thinking about, and I would throw up a blog and just go after it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think now's the time, Dwight.  I mean, would the Chronicle let you do that?  Would it let you pursue that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not independently.  Having the Chronicle's brand behind me is pretty powerful.  I make a phone call, I get it returned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just use as a model what I did because I've been through media downsizing.  At every stage, I think it's really great if you could transfer the brand to the new media  before the old media disappears.  Just from my own experience, it's a very useful thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably one of the best examples of that recently is Harry McCracken.  His technologizer.  He started that from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was still at PC World when he did too, wasn't he?  Or no?  He had already left.  He had left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He kind of disappeared for a little while and then he came forth.  I talked to him about it at CES and I think he's making a go of it.  What's funny is the same day that he quit from PC World, he closed on a new house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's brave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a leap of faith.  That's brave.  I think it shows that you can still do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to take a break.  One of the things that's happened is that Hearst has announced its own Kindle.  I want to talk about the prospects for that.  Also about Kindle 2.  I've got one here.  I'll play you the voice.  But before we do that, I want to mention a brand new sponsor on the show and really welcome them.  I'm actually thrilled to have these guys on board.  It's a company called Squarespace at squarespace.com.  I know you know about them, Alex.  It's kind of funny because Alex and I both looked at this independently and I am blown away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is the next generation in a lot of ways of blogging.  It's hosted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does the hosting for you.  Fully hosted.  So you're not doing the geek stuff of installing software.  But boy, you get really great functionality.  You get the ability to scale very well in case you get dug.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also you are able to...  There's tons of widgets that are pre-built and there's no code.  It's not like, oh, I got to cut and paste some code over.  It's literally I just open up my template.  I drag stuff in.  I want to make sure that this thing is orderable by Amazon.  I can input my affiliate.  I can add things to Digme.  I can add all that stuff.  All the things you would normally want on a blog are all just kind of built into it.  I did some research because we almost went with it with Twip and then Scott had his own people.  Scott wanted to do his own thing.  But he had his own capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As somebody who has run now a bunch of my own WordPress blogs,  we are moving the corporate blog over to it.  I'm looking at moving Leoville over to it.  There's a real advantage to not doing it yourself.  They've got a server...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Let me interject since we're plugging this guy.  Yeah.  One other thing I think people should know out there is it actually employs a kind of  dynamic CSS.  It's very cool.  Which is very interesting to play with instead of having to run.  You can import your own code if you want to.  Oh yeah.  It's not like it keeps you locked out.  But it's got this dynamic CSS.  It's quite fascinating.  I've never seen anything work as well as this.  This is a WYSIWYG design.  It's quite unique.  On the fly while you're live.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's say you decide I don't want that column to be so wide.  You drag it.  Yeah.  I mean it's really...  These guys are doing some very...  Yahoo interface builder.  I asked a little bit about the underlying technology.  They're doing some very interesting JVM stuff.  Some virtualizing in the servers so that they can throw more servers in place and it  load balances across all the sites.  There's huge value to using people who are using state of the art technology as your backend.  I mean I like having my own backend.  I like having the root login.  But I got to tell you...  I've kind of...  I've learned my lesson.  We found out today that we were offline for eight hours.  My blog was offline for eight hours because somebody at the server had kicked an ethernet  cable loose.  So Squarespace sounded better and better.  Take a look at it.  You can try it for two weeks and get 10% off if you decide to stick around to your new  account at squarespace.com slash twit.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  I'm going to tell you the most important thing to you and certainly when you're doing the trial,  it will automatically import WordPress blogger, movable type, type pad and export it.  And I was so impressed by this.  It is not one of those Roach Motel sites where you get your data in.  You can never get to that again.  They have from day one had complete data portability in and out.  If you're a photographer, this is why Twip should have used it.  The photo gallery templates.  Unbelievable.  Incredible templates.  Widgets for Google Maps.  Built-in search engine optimization.  Website tracking.  Permissions.  That's why we're going to use it because we're going to have multiple editors.  The cloud architecture is just mind blowing.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  You're going to hear more about them on the twit shows.  I've just become a really big fan of this.  And if you're looking at a place to host your blog, to do a blog that looks gorgeous, easily,  quickly and affordably, squarespace.com slash twit.  And we thank them so much for becoming part of the twit family.  I talked for a long time to Anthony and Dane, who are the two guys behind it.  They're young guys.  It's really kind of neat what's going on out there.  All right.  Let's talk about...  I have a feeling I can almost guess John's reaction to the Hearst Corporation saying,  well, we're going to do a Kindle ourselves.  What do you think, John?  They have a shot at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You already guessed my reaction.  Why ask?  It's idiotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun to hear you say it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just sounds better coming out of John's mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not do their own?  It's going to be a larger format, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they spending their time on this sort of thing?  I mean, let's face it.  If we go back to the argument that the content stinks in these newspapers and the things aren't  compelling and they're not doing a very good job and they've cheapened the product and this and that  and the other thing, that's not going to change whether you have a Kindle-like device or not.  I don't think the typical newspaper reader, especially the ones who are still subscribers,  are really like what you say, Leo.  I'm in total agreement with this.  When you have a newspaper, you browse it in a funny kind of way that is very unique to newspapers.  This device is, you might as well just read the headlines on your iPhone.  It's the same thing, only bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say that while it's going to be black and white, because you're really stuck with the E Ink,  black and white right now, they do want to go to high resolution color.  They want to do video.  Now remember, Hearst doesn't just own newspapers.  They own a lot of magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, the one thing to notice is this isn't a Johnny-come-lately kind of reaction.  They invested in E Ink quite some time ago.  So this is their technology.  This is the technology that's being used.  Over 10 years ago, they invested in E Ink.  So they've been playing this game for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're a little late to the game.  Amazon's there.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that the thing that they're looking at also is that they are trying to be more  flexible with the business model.  They want to make an open device.  Right. So basically, they're going to allow magazine companies and newspaper companies  to define how people pay for it, and so on and so forth.  Rather than taking Amazon and what will sure to be an Apple reaction when Apple eventually does this,  this is the way it gets done.  This is the way it's distributed.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a money loser.  It's going to be a big time...  You might as well just buy a yacht and throw money into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Denise, do you have a Kindle?  You have a Kindle, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ordered mine last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aha. So this would be your first Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what put you over the top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both Ernie Svensson, who is a frequent guest on Twill,  and Robert Scoble gave the new version rave reviews.  And when they both like something, I'm bound to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I think this is to publishing what the iPod was to the music industry.  I think it's actually...  The first one was not.  The first one was the Pontiac Aztec of reading devices.  This is elegant.  It's slim.  It solves a lot of the UI issues.  Alex, you're zining it right now.  Solves a lot of the UI issues that I had with the first Kindle.  The page turn is faster.  You don't accidentally press buttons.  The screen isn't...  I can't...  16 grades.  You can't touch it.  And you do want to touch it, don't you, Alex?  Well, after you're trained by the iPhone...  Let me turn it on for you.  ...to touch it, you know, you're...  Do you want to hear the reading?  Would you like to hear the reading a little bit?  Yeah, sure.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious about the reading because did you guys see Will Wheaton's comparison?  No. What did he say?  There was that whole thing that came out last week about  whether they were going to be permitted to do the tech...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The author's guild made a stink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The moronic author's guild said,  you're going to kill our audio books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  To which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to mention the fact that, how are you going to kill the audio...  You already bought the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So Amazon caved on the Fair Use issue,  which isn't surprising since Fair Use is basically just an invitation to litigate the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a theory on this whole thing.  But let me play for you.  I'm going to...  John, you're going to be muted for a minute.  I'm going to use your microphone to plug in Mr. Kindle.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, a dramatic reading from Masters of Doom.  This is the story of the id guys, John Carmack and George Romero.  How two guys...  Something, something, something...  Dot, dot, dot, ellipsis.  By the way, this is very slow.  I'm stalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Suspense.  Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.  Romero mimicked these video game sounds the way other kids did celebrities.  That's the female voice.  Romero's voice was worth risking everything.  The crush of the meteors.  The theft of the paper route money.  The wrath of his stepfather.  Because no matter what Romero suffered,  he could always escape back into the games.  At the moment, what he expected to suffer  was a legendary whipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, I'm going to play the male voice,  which I think is maybe marginally easier to understand.  But this is a computer voice.  There's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.  Romero mimicked these video game sounds the way other kids did celebrities.  Unlike this was worth risking everything.  The crush of the meteors.  The theft of the paper route money.  The wrath of his stepfather.  So I guess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The male voice has more inflection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's still kind of, you know, a mechanistic inflection.  But there's some inflection to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So Will Wheaton did this interesting side-by-side test  where he...  His theory that he was positing,  and I think it's where you're going by playing this for us from the Kindle,  is that there's just no comparison between a mechanized voice and a human voice.  And so he read from his book, Sunken Treasure,  and then he had his max text-to-speech generator,  which he was told was sort of like the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually a little better, but it's roughly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The Alex voice he picked.  And had that read.  And you know, I got what he was saying,  that certainly it's better to have a person read,  but the machine-read version wasn't bad.  And you know, in a pinch, I would definitely do it.  And unfortunately, Amazon has sort of left us in that pinch,  because getting audiobooks onto the Kindle isn't all that easy,  especially if you're on a Mac, right?  Because you have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to use the Audible software, or I don't even know how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And I think on the Mac, I found an article, it was from a year ago,  so maybe this has updated since then, but it was on Rex's blog,  grousing loudly about the fact that if you have a Mac, you're out of luck,  because the Audible software that works with the Kindle is PC only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I got an iPod.  I really don't care about putting audiobooks on the Kindle,  which will kill the battery life.  In fact, reading kills the battery life.  I think this is more like I'm reading a book, I have to get in the car,  I'm going to turn on the audio so I can continue to kind of read along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Amazon's issue right now is they can't afford to lose trajectory.  They need to just be streamlined about launching this new application  and not have a lot of hubbub.  I think one passive aggressive way they could handle this is to  make sure that it's very clear when you're ordering a book from the Kindle  that it's not audio enabled.  That's exact...  Big button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You hit the nail on the head.  They're doing it passive aggressively.  Here's my thesis.  First of all, within two days of the Authors Guild  kvetching Amazon backs down and says,  and I know you appreciated this, Denise,  what we're doing is completely legal.  We are not in any way saying that they have any merit in their argument whatsoever.  We would win a lawsuit, but we're going to be nice guys,  and we're going to let each publisher mark their books  not for text to speech, if they should so choose.  Here's my passive aggressive theory on this.  How could they have done it in two days?  They knew exactly what was going to happen.  Jeff Bezos played this like a perfectly played chess match.  He said, they're going to bitch.  Here's what we do.  We go public.  We let them bitch.  We make sure everybody hears them bitch.  Then we say, okay, we'll be the nice guys.  We'll back off.  And now you're exactly right, Alex.  It's going to make it very clear when you buy a book.  This may not be read out loud.  And nobody's going to buy it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll just skip right over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rae Beckerman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you really skip right over it because you couldn't listen to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really like to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Denise, they're right though.  There's no legal merit in the author guild's point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's where I was going a second ago.  You're into this fuzzy area of fair use.  Will Wheaton's point was, there's really no difference.  You're not taking away from the market for audiobooks  because people are always going to want that human reader.  There's just no comparison.  And actually, when I heard his side-by-side thing, I went,  you know, I wouldn't mind having Alex the bot read me a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  And the one thing that I will say is that we are,  this is still voice text to speech is still very early on.  I can see five years down the road, 10 years down the road,  getting to a point where I may not really care.  And if it was a lot less expensive, if I only had to pay  the reduced cost of the book and get the audio for free,  I can see where the authors are trying to draw a line.  But I think that they're going to lose this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But as far as what you were saying a second ago, Leo,  I think you're dead on that Amazon may have been  pretty crafty in the way they did this.  Ray Beckerman, who's the RIAA versus the People lawyer,  he represents a lot of the defendants in those cases,  had a comment on Flashdot where he said,  Amazon showed this threat for what it was, extortion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was very, I think it was,  if I were in a cricket audience, I would applaud politely and say,  well played.  Well played, Amazon.  It was pretty clear that Jeff knew exactly what was,  how else would he have been able to say within two days,  okay, we'll turn it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they obviously had that capability already built into it to do it.  I don't know if I haven't seen it.  Has anybody seen any books yet that already have the audio turned off?  Has anybody spotted that?  Who has a Kindle?  I've got a review Kindle in the one.  No, no, no, I haven't at all.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't see that.  And what if you already have it?  If you already have the book on your Kindle,  I've got about four on the review unit they sent me.  I guess there's nothing they could do.  You've got to be grandfathered in.  You're grandfathered in.  The one thing about the Kindle that bothers me still is the pricing.  I think it's still way too expensive to become a mass-priced device.  I agree.  It used to get down to about $199 or less in order, I think, to really take off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's US only, which really, now that's because publishing is such a crazy  quilt of national jurisdictions.  And I don't know if they'll ever solve that.  We've learned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Leo, you mentioned earlier that there was some hinting that they were going to do,  allow you to read it on your iPhone.  And in the initial announcement, when they were talking about the capability  that the new Kindle has to kind of, if you have two Kindles and you stop reading a book  in one place, you pick up the other Kindle, they bitch in or on other devices.  Right.  And I know that if I don't own a Kindle and there's an iPhone application that lets me do that,  I will get the iPhone application and skip the hardware on the Kindle unless  version three is just dramatically better and dramatically cheaper.  I'd read it on my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John, would you ever buy a Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Why not?  I don't buy anything anyway, if you haven't noticed.  Now, if I was going to buy it, I think it needs a $99 price point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's way, well, I don't know about 99, but I think you're right.  What's wrong with 99?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I'm sure that, I don't know.  Do you think it costs more than 99?  What do you think it costs to make this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, probably the way they're making it, obviously, what are they charging for?  Then it's probably costing a bag of parts would probably be around $70, $80.  All right, then they could charge 99 because they're making money on the book.  No, they're not going to make any money.  They have to get the bag of parts down to $25, but that means the screen mainly.  All right, so what about $150?  I think that would be a sweet spot.  $99, there's your number.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like a comparable to iPod price because, Leo, you said a bit ago that you  have your iPod for audiobooks.  I could see my Kindle replacing what I use my iPod for mostly, which is audiobooks and  podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I could, that's sort of my legacy device I carry around with me right now is my old  video iPod.  I have my iPhone, but I can't put all that stuff on it because the iPhone memory is too  Right, it's only 16 gigs.  And plus it kills the battery on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what, then what's interesting to me about both the Kindle and the iPhone is  that there's kind of a tradition in electronics that they will, electronics makers will sometimes  continue to sell an older version of something at a lower price.  Apple didn't do that with the original iPhone.  They could have sold that for $150 and made it the older, cheaper model.  And Amazon did not do that with the Kindle.  They could have continued to make kind of the bigger clunkier one and sold that at say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised they didn't do that actually.  But you know, there was a real question whether there's any incentive for them to do or cut  price anyway since they can't seem to make enough to sell anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they also have to pay for the bandwidth because it rides over the cell phone network.  Don't you think they build that into the price of the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would, if I'm, if I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's built into the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, because if I'm Jeff Bezos.  Because the books are cheap.  I would, yeah, but okay, so here's the, so  John, you probably better at this than I am.  But as I remember the normal cut that a book publisher takes from the bookstores 50%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's between 40 and 60 depending on the, on the book typically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so that's presumably the same deal they make with Amazon.  So if Amazon is charging 50%, they need to charge a little more obviously than it's costing  them for the book.  But the publishers don't have to kill a tree.  They don't have to print it.  They don't have to ship it.  So presumably the publishers are making a deal that is better than 40 to 60%.  Amazon's charging, you know, 10 bucks for a best seller.  What is that?  That's, you know, 25 bucks best seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's overlooked in the formula is the fact that the authors are getting screwed in this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do the authors not make as much for an ebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if the book is selling for $10, which is what everybody wants these things  to sell for, I mean, there's going to, there's even a protest movement right now to  boycott any books on the Kindle that are more than $9.99.  And if you do a two way, you know, just a 50% split with a retailer, so it's $5 essentially  for the retailer and $5 for the publisher.  And the typical royalty is 15% of wholesale.  Or 50% of retail is going to be a buck or so.  When if they were doing a hardcover book, they'd be making $5 a copy or three, four,  five bucks, something like that.  So they're losing about one, two thirds of their income on these electronic books.  I'm sure authors aren't too happy about it.  That's probably one of the reasons the Authors Guild kind of made a fuss to just harass them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one question I have as far, I mean, in the long term is whether authors could possibly be  empowered to publish directly.  I mean, what do they need a publisher for when they're not having to send a book over to China  anymore?  That's a good point.  Why not just publish directly?  Especially if you're an established, if you're Stephen King or you're someone like that,  why would you, why do you need it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't.  That's the joke of it.  And in fact, there should be some way of directly just a writer should be able to put together his  own book and then sell it directly to the Kindle for $9.95 and take the entire $9.95,  minus whatever it costs to run the server, and put it in his pocket.  And I think that's absolutely where things are going to head in some way, shape or form.  It's almost like indie music.  I mean, all the kids listen to these weird bands you never heard of.  I think it's going to go that way with the writers.  I mean, I think a lot of them are going to have some trouble getting much traction,  but you don't need as much traction if you're taking all the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon's deal with authors I'm seeing in our chat room is 35%.  So it's even better.  And Jeff Bezos was on with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show.  Stewart asked this question, said, Jeff, why do you charge so much?  Why don't you cut the price?  Bezos said, because it costs us that much.  We can't charge any less.  Which might be credit.  You know, Amazon has its own self-publishing arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a company called Book Surge.  And I wonder if there's anything being routed directly from Book Surge into the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I tell you, it's not the authors guild that should have been complaining about the Kindle.  It's the publishers.  It's Pearson.  It's Random House.  Those are the people who are really threatened by this device.  Those are the people who are going to be disintermediated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if we go back to looking at what Hearst is doing, an open format from Hearst would  once again allow the publishers theoretically to be able to sell their stuff online directly  to another reader as well, where they don't have to pipe through Amazon.  I think maybe that's what Hearst is seen as an open opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why wouldn't Hearst just jump on the Kindle?  Why make your own device?  They are on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are on a lot of the Hearst papers.  All their magazines are?  Oh.  Can I make a comment?  There's a number of magazines and newspapers.  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Dvorak, make a comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was looking in the chat room and people are talking about Lulu.  Lulu is a complete ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Lulu.  They take the author's commission just as overhead.  It's ridiculous.  But they're printing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're shipping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're shipping it.  You know, if you went out there and found there's plenty of people that do print on  demand, shipping and printing, and they don't take 15% out of the blue.  They just charge you what it costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, and then you charge a price over and above that to make your profit.  So what about Blurb?  Is that the same as Lulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't looked at their deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  More photo-oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like people like Cory Doctorow are in a great position here.  Oh, God, yeah.  People who have their own audience.  You had him on the show last week.  He was talking about how he has the change logged between  editions of what he's going to push out to the publisher.  Cory could readily just put his work wherever he wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I read an interesting article.  My daughter gets a magazine called Mental Floss, which is actually a pretty cool magazine  for kids, you know, and they wrote an article about Paul Coelho, the guy who wrote The Alchemist.  And Paul is very hip.  Paul is very with it.  Turns out, for instance, that the book wasn't selling in Russia.  The Russian edition wasn't selling.  So he put it for free online.  And it's the kind of book, I guess, that gets a lot of people excited about it because it  started selling.  The print edition started selling.  He, like Cory, has done that very counterintuitive thing, which is give it away online.  And he's done very, very well.  The things that the book sold, more than 10 million copies.  He's done very well by doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think that I think for people in the creative field, I think a lot of people,  and whether it's future, whether it's video, but I think that there's a really important  thing of maintaining your own brand and making sure people know who you are and building your  own following, whether it's on your blog or on Twitter or on anything else that you're doing.  That you're portable so that when you publish something to Amazon or to iTunes or to  somewhere else that people know who you are and they'll actually go buy it because of  you.  And I think that's the kind of thing that we're seeing from Cory Doctorow.  Well, that's what we do here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, ultimately, what you've got to do is build a community that will support you,  whether you're Jonathan Colton, Peter Himmelin is coming in tonight, Cory Doctorow.  You build a community that loves your work and you bring it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you bring it straight to them and you say, hey, you like this, you support us.  And again, Nine Inch Nails is a perfect example.  Nine Inch Nails?  What really made the money was their limited edition.  They gave the album away and had a limited edition that they made three quarters of a  million dollars in a week on because they had a strong, intense following of only a handful of  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you could do that if you're an established brand, but how easy is that to get started with?  I don't think we've actually seen yet anybody who's kind of taken off from that as a starting  point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, where was Cory Doctorow before?  Was he on?  He was never on a national brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think you could do it.  I really, Jonathan Colton.  I agree.  Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But over a very long period of time, you know, it's not something.  I think Cream Rises, no matter.  Yeah, but it might take it.  I mean, you have to think about it as like a project.  It might take you a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's a long period of time to you?  How long does it take for Metallica?  10 to 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How long did it take for the world?  Not that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should be able to build a brand in 18 months.  John is the king of brand building.  That's not true, but I can tell you it's doable in 18 months.  Everything I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say from scratch without the help of national media, it could take.  I mean, what I'm saying is people need to prepare for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you knew anything about, you know, yeah, absolutely.  With the internet, I don't think it's a problem for 18 months.  All you need is Twitter, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need to recommend you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I know is it took Mike Harrington a lot less time than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, is he a brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember sitting and talking with him at Stanford when he had just started doing  TechCrunch, which at the time he was doing a sort of a joint project with Keith Peer for another.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's that?  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Keith has been around for a long time.  And, you know, TechCrunch took on a life of its own.  And obviously, by that time next year, it was an interesting conversation to look back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was very quick.  It was. It was a year.  It was less than a year.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would agree.  It takes you 15 years.  If your product is crap, you can still get an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, boy, TechCrunch, because it was really right on, it really covered the stories.  It was the place.  And word spreads fast among that audience.  Now, that's key is the people who have done well with this, at least so far,  have done well with the tech community because, for instance, us, our audience is very wired together.  Or in the record industry, where you have an audience that's very,  it's already tightly knit, you know, and people will say, oh, nine inch nails, nine inch.  So you need that.  You do need it.  You can't be some loosely knit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the people have to be on a computer.  That's the key.  Yeah, that's very key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For now.  I mean, over time, people are going to, more and more people will be on the computer.  But definitely the reason that we picked the shows that we started with was because we knew  that those were the...  Start with the tech shows.  Yeah, those were the niches that we wanted to jump in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now Adam Carolla is number one on iTunes because it's gone beyond that.  It's gone to mainstream media now.  Right.  What's Adam Carolla doing on iTunes?  Adam Carolla lost his job.  Remember, he was going to be the guy who saved Howard Stern's, you know,  when Howard Stern went to satellite, he was going to save Infinity.  Big flop, lost his job, made a podcast.  I should be nicer because I'm going to be on the podcast on Wednesday.  But he's made a podcast.  And the funny thing is, you know, flop in the mainstream media terms does not mean much.  When you go to the podcast, look at, we only have hundreds of thousands of people who listen to  this show.  If you're Infinity, that's not enough.  Howard Stern had tens of millions.  A broadcast TV show.  It's fine for me.  I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, a broadcast TV show that is a flop is five million or five or six million people or less  is considered unmanageable.  But if you look at a million people listening to your show and you're getting, let's say,  $30 CPM, I mean, it's not, you know, that's a lot of money.  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it surprise you guys to know there are only 24 magazines available for the Kindle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  And I'm very, it's very disappointing to me, but I have to say the New Yorker,  which just recently became available in the Kindle, that was a big deal for me.  Because of the cartoons?  Yeah, I like the cartoons.  Well, I only read it for the pictures.  And you know, the nudies.  It's really big for it.  No, I'm a big New Yorker fan and my problem is we subscribe to the paper edition,  but between my wife and daughter, I never get to read it.  They, my daughter will actually, and I can't really stop her because I'm thrilled,  we'll take it and go upstairs and we never see it again.  And what am I going to say?  No, you can't read the New Yorker till I'm done.  No, I wanted to read it.  That's pretty good for a 16 year old.  Hey, I want to take a little break here and talk a little bit about audible.com.  Audible is our sponsor and they're not going away.  I got to tell you, even if you can get, the Kindle can read to you.  There's a big difference between a computer voice reading to you and a performance.  And that's what audible books really are.  They are performances by some of the best actors in the world.  They bring these things to life.  Now, you may not know that some of the names go to audible.com slash twit two,  sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  You'll get a credit towards two books.  Then look at some of the books.  You may see the names of the readers.  You may not know them.  Believe me, you will come to know them.  It's a specialty.  Audible's recording studios are located near Broadway.  They get some of the best actors, the best, most talented readers.  And these guys and gals bring a story to life.  I think this week in honor of our newspaper discussion,  our audible pick is going to be all the president's men, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.  I mean, this is what journalism to me, there was a whole generation of kids my age  who became investigative journalists, became reporters,  became news people because of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward and all the president's men.  It was inspiring.  It's the story of Watergate, how a president was brought down by deep throat and brilliant reporting.  And if you've seen the movie or if you've heard the story, it is so dramatic.  Let me play a little bit of all the president's men here.  This is by the way, Richard Poe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had run into a solid wall of riot equipped Washington policemen  who had pushed them back onto the campus of George Washington University  with tear gas and billy clubs from their balconies, anxious tenants.  Hey, I got to also mention now the clips.  And some had cheered and toasted when the protesters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The clips are often in a lower quality.  They have a new format now on audible.  I'm really excited about it.  The E format, it is full CD quality.  Now I've always thought that the format four was good enough, but E is incredible.  I'm downloading all my books over again in the E format.  So if you're an audible member, take a look at it.  This is also available in the E format.  I'm changing.  And it makes a difference?  Oh, it sounds beautiful.  I mean, it sounds good anyway.  If you've listened to audible books, I never thought it was a problem.  I think it's something like 32 kilobit MP3 that the type four was.  E is now 128 kilobit high quality.  These are on the ears, I imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just wonderful.  They've done a great job of getting these books converted.  This book, even though it's an older book, is already available in the E format.  If you saw Frost Nixon and you want to know more about that whole story, this is a great one.  All the presidents meant.  Now here's how you can get it.  And as long as you're reading that, you might as well get another book about the same subject.  The Secret Man, the story of Watergate's deep throat.  Now, many years later, we finally found out who deep throat is.  Bob Woodward wrote the story.  This book came out, I think, two years ago, three years ago.  Who was deep throat?  Bob Woodward tells the story.  And you can hear that.  Make two books.  It all turns out to be a disgruntled employee.  It always is.  That's what it all came down to.  It always is.  Audible.com slash twit.  Join the platinum group.  Get two books a month.  I go through two books a month and I don't even commute anymore, but I listen in the car.  When I'm driving carpool.  In fact, my wife will say, can you get the kids?  I'll say, yeah.  And she'll say, how come it took you an hour?  Well, I was listening.  I got involved.  I couldn't get out of the car.  When I'm at the gym working out.  When I am walking the dog.  When I'm gardening.  When I'm doing housework.  It's great for housework.  I hate housework.  But listening to Audible, suddenly the house is clean and you don't even know how it happened.  Audible.com slash twit.  To try it today.  You're going to love it.  And we thank them so much for the support of This Week in Tech.  Audible is owned by Amazon.  So you've got to figure Amazon is not going to...  It can't be thinking that the Kindle reading is going to cannibalize the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just bought.  Right.  Well, they win no matter what.  Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true.  I know it's one of their goals.  Jeff Bezos' goal is to get every book on the Kindle.  But I think it's also his goal to get as many books as possible.  If not all books in Audible format, which I'm behind 100%.  Everybody okay?  Anybody want to take a break?  Shall we move on to our next story?  Dwight, how you doing?  You're all right?  I'm doing fine.  He's plugging in.  He's going to charge up his iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm charging my Kindle.  Actually, I just got the note that said you were running low.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My battery life has been a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been about like the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  They said it was going to be 25% better.  I don't find it to be at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, was the first one connected to an edge network or a 3G?  I've been asking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was my understanding that it was GPRS the first time around and it's EDGE now.  But I've been told...  Or EVDO now.  But I've been told by everybody it was EVDO.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's lasted.  I charged it the day after I got it.  I had it fully charged up on Wednesday and I just now got the message to charge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe there's something wrong with my battery.  I've charged it three times since Wednesday.  I'm not doing a lot of text to speech.  How much are you reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say I'm transformed by this.  Denise, you're going to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  I'm thinking of getting one for my dad too.  I'm liking the fact that I went and checked the network availability and it seems to be  really, really good.  He lives in a very rural place way up north.  He lives in Mendocino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Sprint's pretty good up in Mendocino.  Yeah.  It's Sprint.  It's Sprint PCS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said it's got coverage there.  Didn't they have big fulfillment problems with the first one or was that just a big  publicity stunt that all of the first ones sold out immediately and then you had to wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's the question.  Is it the Nintendo marketing technique or is it that they can't make them fast enough or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have never said how many they've sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They won't say, but there were shortages whether they were artificial or...  All six of them.  Yeah, exactly.  We're sold out.  We can't keep them in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one analyst estimated that they sold about 500,000.  How did he get that?  How did he...  Right.  I mean, we don't know where those numbers come from, but I would think probably that...  Seems high.  Does it?  It seems high and I think that they probably wound up under producing with the desire to  make it look more desirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wouldn't put it past Jeff.  I'm going to stand on what I've said, but I really believe that this is the breakthrough  that the iPod was.  Well, do we think that Apple, if they build the tablet...  I got the date marked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mark it.  Mark it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I called the patient dead, print books dead on March 2nd, 2009.  I still think that Apple will build an iPhone that's about the same size as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be a great product?  This almost looks like it.  And it'll be in color and play video and it's going to be a great product.  It's going to be in color and play video and we'll give it a real run for its money.  It's March 1st, by the way.  Well, this show comes out March 2nd.  Wow.  And I think Apple will do it by July.  Really?  By this July?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By this July.  I would abandon this in a heartbeat if they do.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm looking at that thing on the screen there, Leo.  Yeah.  And the contrast sucks.  It looks just like a gray thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the same as before.  You know, it's not a breakthrough.  It's for reading text.  It's readable enough.  And if you have a good light on it, it's...  Black ink on white paper is better.  You know what I love?  That's something you can't do with black ink on white paper.  You can change the font size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gray ink on gray paper.  It's gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's gray.  But you can change...  For somebody who's old like me, not as old as you, John, but somebody's old like me...  Oh!  The fact that I can get this to basically a large text format is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just need more pretty pictures.  You wouldn't need to do that if it had a good contrast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  I do.  It is a little harder to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I can read off of the little E71 Nokia, which has got like two point type.  I don't have any trouble reading it because it's got extremely high contrast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, have you had a problem accidentally buying books with it?  Not yet.  But they do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have been sitting on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Twice.  I bought...  What happened is, at least on mine, when I press a button,  the button to click an item on the screen, there's a delay.  And the first time I tried to get past the menu, I hit the button and I hit it again.  The second click triggered the buy button on the next page and I bought a book I wasn't  intending to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yikes.  But now they do...  I think this must be common because they do say immediately, you can take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, and I did.  But what they end up doing is they charge you and then they issue a credit.  That's not so good.  And I've done that twice now with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biggest improvement to me is it's just harder to turn the page than it was before.  It was so easy to accidentally lose your place.  That's a big deal.  They've added a few little things that on the surface don't seem to make a difference,  but I think do.  For instance, when you lose your place, it was very hard to get back to your place before  you'd have to kind of jump around.  Now they have go to last page read.  Just something like that makes a huge difference in usability.  So I'm very happy with it and I have now read...  I've probably read 20 hours on it and I've really enjoyed it.  It's comfortable.  It's very comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how you can do this, because you're on the air 24 hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was laughing when he said he does housework.  I don't know when he does that.  Yeah, you were laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You ought to hear my wife.  I can hear from here.  Housework?  What is he talking about?  Housework.  Speaking of a new iPhone, CBS, I think CBS is really showing that they actually have  a little bit of an inkling about what this whole thing is about.  Now is putting Star Trek episodes on iPhones, along with CSI and other full episodes of TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say full with an asterisk.  Oh yeah, what's the asterisk?  This is the new iPhone app.  So I installed it.  And so the new...  It's tv.com.  So if you search for CBS or tv.com on the app store or whatever, you can download it.  And it'll play on 3G or Wi-Fi.  That's cool.  It'll play beat up one.  I will say that having an application that does this is a completely different thing  than having a web page, which is what NBC did much better.  The experience of actually going through them is great.  Versus like Hulu.  Versus Hulu.  The only thing that's a little frustrating is it's full episode,  and then you get here and there's six little videos.  So you have to click one and then you'll play and I think...  Oh, it's a chunk of the time.  But there's these little videos that you have to chunk through and not...  Clearly you're not a Star Trek fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't mind so much.  I love Star Trek, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want tribbles on my iPhone, no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that... You're showing the application right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the other thing is there's not that many full episodes on here.  You cruise through it and there's a lot of snippets and only a few full episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Hulu was like that when it first started, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, hopefully...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the start, I have to say the experience is actually pretty good.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you're on Edge, you're out of luck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it works on Edge.  Well, 3G.  Oh, 3G, I see.  3G and Wi-Fi.  How does it play on 3G? Pretty well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It plays okay.  I mean, it plays on what you'd expect with a 3G connection compared to a Wi-Fi connection.  I haven't been able to test the Wi-Fi yet.  And this is free?  It is free.  How many spots? Is it like Hulu or is it just kind of a lower number of commercials?  I just saw it today and installed it today, so I haven't hit the spots yet.  I just wanted to see if it would work.  So more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't seen any commercials in it.  More or less than we have.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the cutoff.  I think less.  Would you pay Comcast 10 bucks a month for online TV?  An article in the New TV says that Comcast...  Probably kicking and screaming, but Comcast is going to start doing online video as well.  They have to do this.  I guess they do.  Now the question is, will they charge extra?  How are they going to do it?  Are they going to maybe say, all right, you're an HBO subscriber, so  we'll let you watch HBO online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it sounds like what they're talking about is original content,  which could be really good for you or somebody.  Well, they do this on the fan.  So the idea is that it's not necessarily...  What they're saying right now, at least to begin with, is they're not taking...  It won't be the Sopranos.  No, they don't want to do that.  So it's going to be...  Original content, new content that they're going to be adding to it,  which is great for smaller developers, I think.  People like you more than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Netflix is also saying we might spin off our streaming business as a separate business.  So you could be a Netflix DVD subscriber or a Netflix streaming subscriber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I just become a streaming subscriber.  Yeah, me too.  Although the only thing I like about Netflix now is being able to rent Blu-rays  because I don't really want to commit to another piece of plastic anymore.  I don't want to buy plastic anymore, but I do like my Blu-rays until...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're charging more for the Blu-rays, right?  A buck more a month.  A buck more a month.  Yeah, I have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is not too bad, but it's just insulting.  Why?  Don't you get enough from me?  Why are you charging a buck extra?  They get a lot from me.  You think that's okay, John, that they should...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at the moment, yeah, and I think just for a while,  it's a way of...  I mean, let's face it, the business is going to die,  and they got to do what they have to do to stay in business,  and it's a good service.  I don't think it's a bad thing, and Blu-ray is really nice to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is.  It's a huge improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this Comcast thing is pretty clueless.  I'm not going to be paying my cable company any more than I already do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what if they did it for free?  Would you...  Well, I mean, they do if you're already...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they did it for free, I mean, I think they're missing a good opportunity here.  They could kind of do what TiVo does, which is try and aggregate some good web content  and point people to it since they have a bunch of people who are using their service already.  And if Comcast could sort of build their brand by doing that, more power to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think if they had quality programming within certain niches,  I think that it would be an opportunity because I know people who buy the extra package so that  they can watch their home football team, or they can watch Showtime, or they can watch...  Now, the thing is that niche content has to be really good, but if they added things that are...  If they queued off of what was already happening in the podcasting world and took some of those  top ones, gave them a little bit more money and got something good, I could definitely see people  saying, oh, I'll pay 10 extra bucks because I really want to watch people rebuilding cars or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 bucks is a lot though for this kind of thing.  That is a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On top of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $120 a year for a subscription to look at low end, probably semi-amateurish crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I agree. If that's what it is, I think that wouldn't work. But I think that if they...  Them charging for it also creates a revenue stream to start giving people who maybe have gotten  really good at doing stuff for 500 bucks a show, giving them 5,000 a show, and having them increase  the production value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think anybody's going to pay for anything I do. I think this is advertising based for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I tagged something for Twit you should take a look at.  Oh, okay.  It actually goes toward journalism discussion from earlier too.  There was a good episode of On the Media, NPR's On the Media.  I love that show by the way.  Yeah, that's a great show.  That's a great show.  Where they were looking at the demise of the newspaper industry and they highlighted  this company called Ka-chingle. Great name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Ka-chingle, I guess. Yeah.  Ka-chingle.  You make... Yeah, you want to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an interesting model. You decide how much money each month you want spread over the  the things that you're consuming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good idea because the thing that's driving people crazy is this  Penny, Annie, 1Z, 2Z. I got 23 bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. The problem with Ka-chingle is what they're hoping people will do is put the  little Ka-chingle badge on their site. Then as you're reading, you decide if you want that  logged as something you're enjoying and so you click the badge. Then Ka-chingle aggregates  all your clicks and says, okay, you've spent more time on the New York Times and some time over  here on Twitter and we'll take your money that you're giving for this content and we'll spread  it out according to where your attention has gone. Very interesting.  Yeah. I think there could be a more effective way of tracking you rather than making you click

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  something. Are you a regular on that show? Because I see you've been on it a number of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've only been on it once. Oh, okay.  But no, I listen to it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I missed your episode. What were you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was talking about a shield block case in California. Do you remember the Apple V Doze  case from 2006 where I think it was the ThinkSecret people were saying that they didn't want to have  to disclose to Apple. You remember it was about the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They had some rumor that they had, but they didn't want to say where they got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was about the, what are the little spaceship things, their routers.  The airports?  Airports. They had some, they'd broken some  pre-release information about one of those. They had a real picture of it, yeah.  Yeah. And so there was a big lawsuit and Apple wanted to get at their sources.  And the California court said, it went into this whole question of what's journalism and are we  going to distinguish between online journalists and any other kind of journalists. And in California,  under our shield law, the court interpreted that as being no, journalism is journalism. It doesn't  matter who you are doing it and we're going to protect your sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, wasn't there a federal decision recently about that? Or no, maybe it's a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two different bills pending right now in Congress to amend the federal shield law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the house version does not really protect bloggers, but the Senate version says, well,  anybody who's essentially in the business of journalism, which might leave a little hole for  bloggers, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, absolutely. The Senate version is much more inclusive in the way that the California  court was back in that case. The house version wants to put some sort of bar of how much money  you actually have to be making from your acts of journalism, which as we were saying when we were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  talking about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Constitution that you have to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's ridiculous.  I think that all of this is going to end up in the Supreme Court no matter what, no matter how they  craft this law, the first time that they try, they collar someone who's got, if EFF jumps in,  there's going to be a great opportunity to take this to the Supreme Court and nullify anything  that's there anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, even if your hobby is journalism, you should get a little credit.  So the shield law is what protects you from revealing your sources.  Okay. So right now as it stands, if you're a blogger outside of the state of California  and you have a scoop, can the- but wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The laws vary from state to state and I'm by no means familiar with-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems like real journalists go to jail all the time for not revealing their sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't that happen from time to time?  It depends on the state and what is protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I distinctly remember an episode of the West Wing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a reporter in New York, it was around the Plame case, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Spent some time until he revealed his source and then worked it out.  So that's state by state. Denise, that's not federal law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. There is a federal shield law, but yes, each of the states have their own take on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  through their own state. I should probably find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we should- Not to completely change the subject, but while we're talking about legality,  there's a story on your list here that we really have to get to now that we have an expert on the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Finally, we've got somebody who knows what she's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple says iPhone jailbreaking is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. This is an older story, but I would like to get your take on this, Denise, in just a moment.  But before we do, in fact, we have a couple of other stories.  Nice tease. Yeah, you like that, huh?  We have a couple other stories, including a VP at Apple saying, no, Steve's coming back.  He's coming back. And some more interesting stories, including Gmail going down.  And a competition in the online app store fart space.  Apparently. Soon into quite a brouhaha.  Yes. It's quite a kerfuffle, if you will.  But before we- Why should that get a laugh? I am not a teenager.  It didn't, Leo. It didn't.  Okay. Thank you. I'm the only one.  Before we go on to that, I do want to mention my friends at Citrix who do go to meeting.  That's what we use all the time for online meetings. And I highly recommend it if you are  in a situation where you're stuck on a conference call. Poor Denise, sitting here with the phone  glued to her head. You're talking to somebody on the phone. You know he's playing Tetris.  She's checking her email on her Blackberry. They're not paying any attention to what you're  doing. That's because what you're doing is not so very compelling. That's why you need go to  meeting. Go to meeting takes a boring conference call where you're not grabbing people and makes  it engaging and interesting through the use of visuals, ladies and gentlemen. Simply put,  when you're going to have a conference call, you could do it ahead of time through an email. It's  very simple. A couple of clicks in the email. Or you can do it, even do it when you're on the  phone with somebody. Say, look, I've got to show you this. Go to go to meeting.com. Here's the  meeting ID. They don't have to install any software. They don't have to jump through any hoops. And by  the way, if you're trying to sell somebody on something, you don't want to make them work.  This is very easy. They go to go to meeting.com. Suddenly they're seeing your computer on their  screen. By the way, Mac or Windows. They see the computer. They see the PowerPoint or the Keynote.  They'll see your drawings. You can collaborate together on a document. That's kind of how I use  it is working together with other people because we have a far flung group of people that we work  with. You can also use it for training. If you have an application and they don't, you can show  them how to use it. This thing is amazing. You know, Dick DiBartolo, the Gizwiz used it with Ludwig.  They were working together on a site. Ludwig's in Poland. Dick's in New York City. They used GoTo  meeting and they were able to see what was going on. It's very affordable. One low flat monthly  rate. You don't meet as often as you want. You don't have to count the meetings or count the minutes.  And now you could try it free for 30 days, which I would recommend. This is a great thing to show  your boss or your clients to try it to see what they can do for you. It's very addictive. I got  to warn you. Go to meeting.com slash twit. Go to meeting.com slash TWIT. Spend 30 days with GoTo  meeting. You'll see what I'm talking about. Citrix is a great company. They've done this right.  And GoToMeeting is the best product on the market. I've tried all the others. This is the one.  God, we had a meeting the other day with our payroll. I'm not going to name names with our  payroll company. They were using some other company's solution. I wanted to shake them and say,  please, this is horrible. This is painful. I couldn't do it on a Mac. I had to go over to PC.  I had to download and install software. I had two ActiveX controls I had to click. The thing was,  I'm going, this is a nightmare. You can't make a client do this. That's why GoToMeeting. It's just  simple. Just do it. GoToMeeting.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support.  So John, you're saying that what? Hello? Oh, John went off to base his turkey.  He posed the question and Denise is here, thank goodness, to answer this question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the basis for contending that there's something illegal about jailbreaking your iPhone is the DMC  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. What the Copyright Office can do is give exemptions

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  from violating that act. So they can say, well, in the letter of the law, this would be wrong,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but we say it's okay. Right. You see Apple coming down on one side of this exemption  alternative saying, no, we don't need an exemption for this. It should be against the DMCA to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  jailbreak your iPhone. Oh, okay. So they're not asking for exemptions. They're saying on the face

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of this, the law says it's illegal. Right. When are we going to get rid of this idiotic DMCA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, please. Is there any chance? No, not now. If you look at who is getting appointed and  what's going on right now, I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So on the other side, you have the EFF who is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They ask for an exemption. Right. And what is the current status of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in process. I'm not sure exactly when it all gets worked out, but it will happen this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But traditionally, unlocking a phone is not illegal, which is kind of what jailbreaking is,  correct? I mean, why is this exemption worthy? Yeah. Didn't the FCC say-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're forcing the unlock though. They're not- the FCC can have- I mean, if it's by rule,  but if someone's actually changing the code to unlock it, it is a circum-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're not unlocking it. That's the irony of it. They're not using it with a different  carrier. They're just saying, I want to- all you're saying when you jailbreak is,  I would like to get apps from somebody besides Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's circumventing the DRM, which is on the face of it, illegal. I'm not-  No, no, you're right. I think it's a bad idea. I think it's- but I think that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that it, Denise? That's it. That's why they need an exemption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's circumvention. Right.  This stupid law. Just appalling. All right. Well, we're all in agreement on that.  There is a battle in the iStore- in the application store between a program called  Pull My Finger and iFart, but I really don't want to descend to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The big question is whether you can trademark Pull My Finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pull My Finger.  You can't trademark Pull My Finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only existed- I think there's previous art. I think there's previous art for the last 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to ask my attorney, Denise Howell. Denise, I would like to trademark Pull My Finger,  could I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would tell you that that would be a very weak trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And why would you want it anyway?  I think Beer.com has the trademark on it originally, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was that big fight over the iBeer application and like Heineken or somebody  made an application and they said, yours, giving away the application that we're charging for.  It's funny. There must be money in the iPhone store. People wouldn't be fighting so bitterly.  There's a lot of money in the iPhone store.  And yet we're finding that you cannot charge more than two or three bucks for an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I think that that's- it's the old line, we'll make it up on volume.  Because of that's what's happening is that, you know, there was the case with David Pogue's book.  They released, which was brilliant, putting his iPhone, the missing manual, on the iPhone as an  app. And they initially released it at $4.99 as a grand opening sale. Then they moved it up to $9.99  and sales dropped by 75%. This was in Saul Hansel's Bits blog this week.  And what they wound up doing was bringing it back down to $4.99. They kind of found where people  would actually buy it. And I just think that it's- I think people are making a lot of money. They're  just making it in, you know, $2.99, $3.99, $1.99 apps. It's interesting because Steam,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  which is Valve's online gaming service, found that they would sell huge- we talked about this  last week- huge numbers of applications when they cut the price 50%. Is it because of today's  tough economic times or this is just always true that maybe people are just overcharging for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  software? There's a rule in direct marketing that's kind of interesting. And I don't think it applies  to all pricing. But the rule is- and it's a very solid one. And people don't- you know,  direct marketing experts, in fact, are one of the guys that heads up direct marketing over at  Intuit. They actually showed me some documentation for this. Whatever you charge for a product  in a direct marketing environment, the net sales will be exactly the same.  So if you charge $10, you'll sell half as many as he's charged for five. And if you charge $2.50,  you'll sell another twice as many. Well, that's just macroeconomics. That's the old supply to  man-code. And with direct marketing, the argument is you want to go with the lowest price that gets  you the maximum number of people because, in fact, the real money is in the mailing list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. What I know, we had with some of our software, we literally doubled the  price and then we doubled the sales. Wait a minute, you charged twice as much and you sold  twice as much? And it doubled the sales. Okay. That happens a lot. In fact, that happens with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wineries. And in fact, I did some work with Robert Craig Winery up in Napa Valley, and they used to  sell their wines for 35 bucks and 40 bucks. When they went to $75 a bottle, the sales skyrocketed,  which just tells you how dumb wine buyers are. It's the same wine. This happens in a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  industries because it's a perceived value, but I think that that does not exist in the iPhone  area because people expect it to be 99 cents. So it has to be really good if it's over 99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. See, that's the difference. I buy wine by the price, but I buy iPhone applications by

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the pretty picture. I have some bonehead who's on my Skype just sent me a note saying this works

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  with hookers too. Okay. Thank you. None of us will admit any expertise in that particular area.  Moving along, Dell is in deep trouble. Fourth quarter sales dropped 16%. They now want to trim  costs by $1 billion. If you thought support from Dell was going downhill before, imagine. How do  you cut costs for a billion when your margins are razor thin to begin with? I think that one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ways they're doing that in that article, they're talking about the fact that they're outsourcing  more. They're going to send more of their manufacturing out. They've closed the North  Austin, Texas plant. But I think that one of the things that we're going to see in this recession  is that a lot of manufacturing is going to be gone by the end of this because now there's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  much pressure on them. In a way, this is the post-industrial era, right? Everybody has said  for years we're moving from an industrial economy to a service economy. The bad economic news is  just forcing this to happen more rapidly. Much faster, yeah. Dell employees, I was surprised,  78,900 people. That's a lot of people. What were they doing? What the hell are they making?  They say they're going to save, the bulk of the billion will come from reducing the cost of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  designing, sourcing, and building. I didn't know they spent that much money on design. Boy,  you wouldn't know it to look at it. This stuff was designed in China. It looks crappy. I don't know.  Now they have red and blue. You realize how rare that is when you look at, it's just a handful of  guys at Apple that design everything. Johnny Ives. They have a whole division there. That's one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the leading industrial design firms in the world. They used to outsource to places like Frog Design

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and IDEO. That's years ago. They've pulled it all in. But as far as the decision makers at Apple,  I think there's still a handful of guys that make it. There's one. One, right. Exactly. He's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  vacation. That's still working, I understand. That was interesting. The Apple investor meeting,  one investor, in fact only one, pressed the directors on Jobs Health and said,  when is Jobs going to come back? Director Arthur Levinson said, nothing's changed since Jobs  announced January 14th he was going to leave. We expect to have him back in June, by the end of the  June. I don't know what to say about that. I guess that's good news. That's the news. We'll see.  We'll see. It either happen or it won't. Denise, does a director have any responsibility to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shareholders to tell the truth? Yeah, they have fiduciary duties to their shareholders. So they

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  can't just make something up. Here's a little bit of a scary story. It's almost comedic in its  extent. The Marine One, which is President Obama's, the president's helicopter, was compromised by a  contractor who had a peer-to-peer file sharing program on his computer. And it saw the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hard drive. This brings up a topic I wrote about about I think about eight years ago and I've  revisited it a couple of times and I bring it up and people always think I'm joking.  People who use computers, just like people who drive cars, should be licensed. If you're a defense

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  contractor going on Marine One, I agree with you. I agree with you. If you have on your computer,  the plans, the communications information, the schematics, the avionics, the network information,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you've put lime wire on your system. Why are you connected to the internet? If you have that  information, why is that computer connected to the internet? And then this guy's so stupid that not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  only does he put lime wire on there, but he overrides the standard settings, which by the way,  do not make the whole thing visible and says, hey, you can have anything you want. Whatever you want,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's all there. I do want to point out that the people who figured this out, that it happened,  was a company outside of Pittsburgh. I'm from Pittsburgh, so I have to... Cranberry Township.  I've been to Cranberry many times, so it's a beautiful place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this happens all the time in businesses. Businesses are constantly finding programs like  LineWire and BearShare on their computers, and it's a real problem with industrial espionage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Geez, Louise. Well, I guess the guy will lose his job, but it's kind of a little too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this was a defense contractor. This is somebody who, in theory, has to adhere to  security standards that are required in order for them to be contractors with the Department of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Defense. And the other thing to realize is that this is the new helicopters, I believe. I don't  think it's the old ones. I think it's the new design, that are teetering on the brink of them  not making them because of the economy, because the question is, should we spend them? They're the  most expensive. These helicopters cost as much as an F-22. Whoa. Yeah, incredibly expensive  helicopters. And there's been a big question about whether they're going to move forward,  and this undermines that. You've got to imagine that the companies building it that were  contracting with that defense contractor are going to be insanely upset because now they're like,  well, why should we build them? Because Iran has the schematics. Yeah, that was who got it. We went

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to an Iranian IP address. Oh, that's even worse. It's like the rebels getting a hold of the Death

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Star. Worst nightmare. The rebels getting a hold of the Death Star. It says Alex Nancy Lucas fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No Bothans died in this. It was simply a peer-to-peer. See, if the rebels had only had  had a peer-to-peer, they would not have had any Bothans dying to get a hold of the Death Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that an Apple product? Bothans? No, Iran. Iran. Oh, I'm sorry. So it's true, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that if you had written this as a plot line in Star Wars, it would have been thrown out as too  far-fetched. Corny. Corny. Oh, well, somebody put a peer-to-peer. Turned out some storm troopers had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a peer-to-peer on the Death Star, and we were able to download the entire thing. Storm troopers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  aren't so goofy as all that. Denise Howell is online at imetdenise.com. You should also  listen to This Week in Law, her wonderful podcast all about tech law and IP. That's on this network.  Read her blog and blogarhythms. Blogarhythms blog. Blogarhythms at ZDNet, and I'm Dee Howell  on Twitter. Oh, let's follow everybody. Follow Denise. I follow you. Thank you. Yes. Dee Howell  with two L's. Do you follow her on Twitter? Oh, Twitter. No, I just follow her around. I follow  her on Twitter. All right, Denise, thank you for being here. We really appreciate you taking the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  time from your vacation. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure. This is a vacation for me, Leo, coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  on Twitter. Yeah, and you don't have to take care of your son? Your husband has him out on the golf  course. That's right. Teaching him nature's greatest game. Yes. Dwight Silverman, we really appreciate  your time from the old school. Well, I appreciate you having me. He's the old school, a newspaper man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not yet. Let's not call it that yet. An ink-stained wretch. I'm a blogger too. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Blogs.cron.com slash tech blog, and I read it every day. In fact, I steal your links.  All right. It's a great blog. You keep up on everything. And my Twitter handle is Dee  Silverman. Dee Silverman, like Dee Howell. Right. Excellent. Somebody sent me an email, John C.  Dvorak saying, hey, did Dvorak get knocked off of Twitter? There's no the real Dvorak. D-A-V-O-R-A-K.  Dude, you got to spell it right. Then you'll find him. He is the real Dvorak. D-V-O-R-A-K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I only need 50 more to get to 45,000, which of course is half of yours, but it's beside

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the point. Oh, me? I'm number 38 on the Twitter list. I don't count anymore. I know the whole thing's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gotten out of control thanks to your Britney Spears. It's not, you know, and this is a long

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  conversation that I don't really want to get into, but- We're not going to do it. Don't do it. No,  no, stop, stop, stop. It's the Twitter suggested list. And you're seeing people now getting 10,000  new followers a day because they're on that suggested list. And those of us not on the list-  How do we get on the list? I need to get to- I don't know. Nobody knows how to get on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw you in our local ink stained newspaper on that point, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, the LA Times. Not that I'm bitter. You know, the Times was bitter because the New York Times  has two. He has two listings on the suggested list and has gone, and Twitter hasn't mentioned  the LA Times. And they're just- the rest of us are just stuck growing at the normal few hundred a day  or whatever. And these other guys are getting five, 10,000 a day. I don't- you know, it's totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stupid. No, no, you're upset about this. I can tell. No, I'm not. And it underscores actually the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  real silliness of these numbers. Finally, in a way, I'm glad because it finally just diffuses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the whole topic. If Twitter were smart, they would rotate that list frequently. That's what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  should do. Yeah. They're never going to put me on it because I'm too outspoken a critic. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fine. I don't care. So anyway, go find me at channeldvorak.com and the real dvorak on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the place. That's the place. Alex Lindsay is at thepixelcore.com as well as the pixelcore.tv.  And he is Alex Lindsay with an A on Twitter. Yes. Am I right? That's correct. I am correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S-A-Y. S-A-Y. I get emails going. I can't find you on Twitter and then it's always

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  S-E-Y. Wasn't the- wasn't John Lindsay the late mayor of New York City L-E-Y?  If he was A-Y. I think he was A-Y as well. There's not very many of us. So we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an unusual. Yeah, it's- E-Y is much more common. It's a common spelling. You have it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your chiron, Leo, as a Lins Day. Oh, you're right. Lins Day. Oh my goodness. The whole day-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm horrified. I've had it misspelled and I'm not going to cry. It's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y. There you go.  Lindsay. Lindsay. What does that mean in Greek? It's not Greek. It's Scottish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It mostly means that the informal meaning is we caused lots of wars in Scotland and they kicked

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  us out. I won't let it kill me unless I've got a spodum. I'm Leo Lepore. We thank you so much for  joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Colleen, anybody? Dane? I can tell all you new world journalists when you might get thrown in  contempt of court under the narrow federal shield law, which I looked up after we-  Am I okay? Am I okay? Under the broader state laws, you're usually immune from contempt,  but under the federal law, it can be pierced. If they can show that the confidential information  is necessary and not obtainable through other sources. If you clam up even in the face of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  showing, that's when you're going to jail. That's what happens from time to time. In the Valerie  Plame case, for instance. Exactly. Wow. Thank you, Denise. I'll make sure not to clam up in future.  Another Twit is in the can.
