Transcript:  Friday, 11 a.m.  I know it's on my day off  because I sit in my jammies  and I listen to This Week in Law.  There's some law to talk about,  big, big case going on,  Google versus Oracle.  It's back in court and we're  starting to hear arguments and  it's kind of mind boggling.  Also joining us, I'm thrilled to  have a guy who hasn't been on  twit in quite some time, but a  man I've always admired going  back to the 90s when he was  Silicon Valley reporter for the  San Jose Mercury News and one of  the best journalists in  technology.  He's now at the Cronkite School  of Journalism at Arizona State  University and also writes for a  number of publications.  Dan Gilmore, great to have you  back on twit.  It's great to be back.  Thanks for joining us.  I want to start, you wrote an  article actually, Dan, that I  think we can use to kick off on  your column on Slate, your  Future Tense column, why it's so  funny Republicans are upset with  Facebook for censoring news.  First of all, I think there is a  certain amount of, I don't  believe this story coming from  these anonymous curators that  were brought in to work at  Facebook.  I mean last week the same  anonymous people or person said,  oh yeah, Facebook was just using  us to polish their algorithm and  blah, blah, blah.  Now they're saying Facebook  actually censored conservative  news.  First of all, do you believe  that's true, Dan?  Well, in the I think first or

End time: 326.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  second paragraph I did not write  that headline.  I said...  That's a good headline.  We should be really cautious  about believing this because it's  based on anonymous sources.

Start time: 326.88
End time: 335.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, as you point out  from Gawker Media, which makes it  even less reasonable to trust.  Right, another interesting

Start time: 335.74
End time: 390.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing.  But so I had a lot of doubts to  start.  But the thing about it that's  really intriguing to me is that  Republicans, even if this is not  true, there's a really good and  interesting point there, which is  that Facebook has unprecedented  control over what news is at this  point.  And it's charming to watch  Republicans suddenly realize that  a big company has a lot of power  but they should have realized  that a long time ago and that if  I were in charge of any policy  right now, I would have the  antitrust people looking  incredibly hard at Facebook  because the power they're getting  is, again, unprecedented and I  think dangerous.  It would be kind of a bitter

End time: 418.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  irony if a party that championed  the free market, if they were  the free market, was bit by a  company that used the free market  to dominate news.  It is true, I think, and I know  one of the things you teach at  Arizona State at the Cronkite  School is media literacy.  It is true.  Is it not that Facebook is the  source of news for a vast majority  of Americans?  Like the primary source.

Start time: 419.35
End time: 423.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  And it's dangerous that there's  one company with this kind of  power.

Start time: 425.43
End time: 429.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it more dangerous that it's, I  mean, isn't Google, doesn't Google  have similar power?

Start time: 430.33
End time: 451.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Google should be under  intense scrutiny all the time  because of the power that they have  in search.  And I don't think they're under  sufficient amount of scrutiny at  this point, although Europe is  doing a lot at the same time.  What they're doing is kind of weird,  so that's a problem.  But...

Start time: 456.31
End time: 496.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Cronkite.  Yeah, I can't quite figure out  what Europe thinks it's doing with  this, but it's...  We really have to start  acknowledging as a society that  Silicon Valley companies are,  or tech writ large, has  enormous influence that is not  something that we've thought too  much about beyond, well, look at  what they can do.  And they have the power to shut  down speech.  The First Amendment, if you use  Facebook, is not relevant.  It's the terms of service that are  relevant.  Right.

Start time: 499.61
End time: 511.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Denise, I'm curious whether you  think, A, that Facebook is  slanting the news.  Wouldn't...  I mean, it would behoove them to  be as careful as they can to  look balanced.

Start time: 513.99
End time: 523.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got to confess that  until this story came around, I  never looked at the trending  topics over on the right.  I didn't even know it was there.

Start time: 524.80
End time: 536.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's easy.  That's easy, because there's so  much crap on the Facebook page.  Right.  You know, Facebook groups.  What?  They have groups?  Oh, yeah, it's right here on the  left.  Who knew?  So I understand that.

Start time: 536.92
End time: 611.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So to the extent...  Yeah, so I wonder if I'm alone in  that or not.  I mean, I know people who  religiously go to it for their  news.  I just am not one of those  people.  And I imagine I'm not alone in  that regard.  Where I get my news via  Facebook, and I think it's  important to recognize we're  talking about Facebook as a  source of news, but all they're  really doing is pointing you to  other sources.  Right.  Based on whatever their editors  are putting in the trending  topics and based on what each  individual editor is putting in  the feed.  And that's where I get my news.  I get my news from the people  that I follow on Facebook.  And yes, that leads to...  I realize that leads to an echo  chamber and I see a certain kind  of news based on the kinds of  people I follow, but that's not  Facebook's responsibility.  I do think it's good that this  was brought to Facebook's  attention.  I don't know if they were  conscious that this was  happening.  If you read what Zuckerberg has  to say, he's anxious to make  sure that over there in that  right-hand trending topics  column that they have an even  handed editorial approach to  what they're presenting.

Start time: 612.49
End time: 643.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's also the algorithm.  So what you see on Facebook, and  I think most normal people have  no idea of this, is very  carefully modified by computer  algorithm.  You don't see everything that  Aunt Judy posts.  You don't see everything that  your friend posts.  You may see more of something  that somebody you don't know  posts, but you follow.  And that's where I think...  Do you think, Dan, that's the  case that that's where Facebook  could, inadvertently or  inadvertently, very much  influence what people see?

Start time: 644.47
End time: 747.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when we say that an  algorithm is making decisions  we're one step or several steps  removed from the actual  decision maker, which is the  programmer who wrote the  algorithm.  And so there are editors at  every level of how Facebook  does news, whether it's in your  feed or in the trending area.  And among those editors is the  user.  But there's a complete lack of  transparency about what  actually goes on.  And that's, you know, Facebook  says, well, you know, we don't  show our algorithm as Google  says the same thing.  And so we're basically relying  on a company that is without  precedent in its size and  reach making decisions that are  editorial decisions, whether  they're made by a programmer or  an editor.  And I'm actually glad to see  they're using both.  But we have this fundamental  issue of not knowing exactly  what is going on.  I will say one thing about  their they did put out after  the Guardian published part of  it pretty much their full  guidelines for their human  editors.  And there's some redactions for  how governmental there.  But I thought it was  interesting because it showed  to me that they've actually put  a lot more thought into this  what aggregation, et cetera,  means than almost any news  organization you can name.

Start time: 748.19
End time: 788.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is also a time when  Facebook is actively courting  the news media to put content on  Facebook using instant articles.  And now with Facebook Live video,  at least a few outlets, not the  big networks, but at least a few  outlets are starting to do  Facebook Live video.  I know the Activision folks are  going to do a daily live video  to push e-sports.  I mean, everybody's jumping on  this bandwagon because Facebook  is the one place you can go on  the Internet where you know  almost everybody's going to see  it, or at least there's a chance  for everybody to see it.  We don't know exactly how well  that part works.  And you're just describing,

Start time: 788.76
End time: 862.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  again, you're describing another  element of Facebook's power over  the news.  If news organizations feel  absolutely no alternative, but  to be part of that, I think  that's amazingly short-sighted  of news organizations to  basically pour their futures  into a company that in the end  is their biggest competitor for  advertising.  But when has the news industry  ever thought past next week?  I don't remember that ever  happening.  So again, I'm glad to see people  starting to think and talk  about that.  But Emily Bell, who teaches at  Columbia University, did a  wonderful piece called Facebook  is Eating the News or Eating the  Internet.  And I think we really have to  I don't mean to be a broken  record on this, but I  desperately want people to pay  attention to this and other  re-centralizing factors that are  taking the power that we had as  individuals and putting it back  in the center instead of at the  edges where we are.  Boy, was that a brief moment in

Start time: 864.98
End time: 916.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  time where news was democratized  and everybody had a voice.  And then never mind.  And the problem is you see  something like Facebook that does  wield such potential power.  This is what I fear, Dan, when  you say we need to keep an eye  on this, is that everybody is a  stakeholder and everybody's going  to want to suborn Facebook to do  what they want to do.  The government is going to do  that.  The Republicans are going to want  to do that.  The Democrats are going to want  to do that.  Everybody is going to get as  active as they can.  But unfortunately, it's not going  to be to protect us, the people.  It's going to be to use Facebook  as best they can against us.  Let me ask Steve, do you guys,  either a business insider or a  tech insider, you must look at  Facebook and there must be  meetings saying, well, should we  post our content on Facebook?  Should we use instant articles?  What do we do?  All the time.

Start time: 916.76
End time: 1010.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I mean, first of all, what  really bothers me is maybe it was  about a year ago, Facebook told  Recode that that trending topic  section was completely by  algorithm.  And then it comes out a couple  weeks ago, which is a lie.  It was actually a lie.  So first of all, they were lying  about how this product works.  It's a bad sign.  And like Dan was just saying,  they have all this power over the  content we see and they're lying  about how that content gets to you.  So that's my first big problem.  And then it comes out, oh, we do  have these editors.  And by the way, here are guidelines  and they're humans and so forth.  Whether or not there's editors or  censoring, that's almost besides  the point right now.  I mean, just the fact that they're  lying about how this product works.  At the same time, I don't think  the trending module matters that  much because it exists mostly in  the desktop version.  Most people use Facebook on  mobile and that doesn't matter.  Facebook on mobile and that  trending thing is just buried in  the app.  You never see it.  The algorithm and the newsfeed is  built to keep you addicted and  scrolling through as much as  possible.  So it's going to give you stuff it  thinks you like.  If you're a liberal, you're going  to get a lot of Democratic liberal  news.  I get a lot of that's what my feed  looks like.  It looks like a lot of business  insider, a lot of tech insider,  a lot of WSJ and New York Times  articles.  I don't get a lot of, you know,  break parts and things like that  in my feed just because Facebook  over time has learned the content  I'm going to want to see and want  to keep scrolling through.  So that's another part.  There is a built in bias into the  algorithm which is to keep the  individual happy and scrolling  through.  That's in their long run business

Transcript:  interest is getting to use more  Facebook, not slamming the news.  Right.

Start time: 1015.74
End time: 1083.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then as for media companies  like Business Insider and Tech  Insider, of course every new media  company or old media company, the  Times is doing it too, is  constantly talking about, I mean  we're shifting our strategy year  by year based on what Facebook  thinks is hot.  A year ago or a year and a half  ago they went all in on video.  So we started pumping out tons of  video natively to Facebook.  Then it's instead articles that's  been kind of lukewarm so far.  And now it's all about Facebook  Live where they're literally  paying media companies, not  Business Insider yet, but that  might be happening.  They're literally paying media  companies to post live video and  you get a bunch of garbage.  You get a Washington Post column  that's eating his own column.  You get, you know, exploding  watermelon.  That's not journalism.  That's I mean it just stunts.  So I think we really have to like  kind of take a step back when we  talk about as journalists, the  kind of stuff we're posting to  Facebook and whether or not  that's useful to the viewership  or if it's just to get eyeballs  for fun.  And that's something we're  constantly talking about at  the INTI.

Transcript:  Well that video of Dana Milbank  eating his column was good video.  I mean that was worth seeing.  He had predicted that Donald  Trump would not get the  Republican nomination and said,  I will eat my column if he does.  And he did.  It was a joke.  It's a stunt.  It is a stunt.  It's not news.  I think some Canadian

Transcript:  publication, they were eating  cheese.  Mike.com, they tied helium  balloons to a dollhouse to see  if it could fly like up.  Like what are we watching?  But that's why Facebook

Start time: 1111.76
End time: 1118.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  probably wants to put more real  news in there.  Why they're working so hard to  put more substance in your feed,  right?  But that's the result of these

Start time: 1118.78
End time: 1133.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  media partnerships.  That's the result of Facebook  paying Mike to put this content  in your feed.  So Facebook wants to put more  news in your feed, but you get  people eating cheese.  Right.  It's not working right now.  So I did an interesting  experiment on Facebook.  I followed all the candidates  for president, Republican,

Start time: 1133.86
End time: 1151.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Democrat, even Gary Johnson.  I followed all the candidates  for president, Republican,  Democrat, even Gary Johnson.  I followed all the candidates  for president, Republican,  Democrat, even Gary Johnson,  the libertarian, one of the  libertarian candidates.  And I'm still getting mostly  dogs playing with lemons and  I have a good solution for you,  Leah.  What's that?  I have a good friend.  She's one of my best friends and

Start time: 1151.74
End time: 1171.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  she is as politically opposite  from me as she could be.  Oh, follow her.  Yeah.  Follow your best friend who is  completely the other end of the  political spectrum and put them  in your close friend's pocket.  And then you can follow your  best friend who is completely  the other end of the political  spectrum and put them in your  close friend's pocket.  And then you can follow your  best friend who is completely  the other end of the political  spectrum and put them in your  close friend's category.

Start time: 1171.74
End time: 1190.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you'll see all their  stuff.  But aren't most people going to  do the exact opposite, which is  unfriend, unfollow and  concentrate the stuff on stuff  they want to see.  See, I don't think people, even  though they admit they're getting  their news from Facebook, they  don't see it as a news source.  That's the real risk of Facebook  is that we are getting all of  this material kind of  unconsciously.  Right.

Start time: 1191.76
End time: 1196.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw some study come across my  Twitter feed and of course I  didn't click it.  I just read the headline, but  that's the other problem.

Start time: 1196.90
End time: 1197.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the other problem, by

Start time: 1197.92
End time: 1238.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the way.  But the stat was right there in  the headline and it was a  significant portion of people  don't know where the news is  coming from.  Like if they see it, whether  it's a Business Insider article,  a Slate article, they just see  it as Facebook.  Facebook is pushing this  content to me.  I don't know where it comes from.  I'm just like scrolling through  Facebook.  And so that's a problem too.  There's no brand identity.  If you're a new publication like  Tech Insider is not even a year  old yet and we're trying to  build a brand identity and  relying on Facebook to do that,  it's kind of tough because  people don't realize or a lot of  people don't realize those  articles are coming from Tech  Insider or New York Times or  wherever.  It's Facebook and that's great  for Facebook, not so great for  the media companies.  So why do the media companies

Start time: 1238.86
End time: 1242.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  keep pouring all their stuff  into Facebook?  They're desperate.

Start time: 1243.86
End time: 1276.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The unfortunate truth is we need  viewership and right now Facebook  controls all of that.  And the unfortunate thing is  you kind of have to bend to  what's hot on Facebook at the  time.  And I know that's maybe not the  best long term, but it's what  you need right now to grow.  The new media landscape is  intensely competitive and we're  seeing the littler guys die off  and consolidate.  But even among the big guys,  you've got to bend to what  Facebook's doing.  Facebook's a media company,

Start time: 1276.88
End time: 1284.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right?  I mean, do we agree now it's not  a social network?  That's the old days.  It's a media company.  They don't see themselves as a

Start time: 1287.74
End time: 1305.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  everything, but to the extent  that people are creating media  using Facebook, of course they're  a media company.  They're certainly a media  company because they're selling  advertising.  That's what media companies  generally do.  And so they're by some standards  the second biggest media company  in the world after Google.

But how do you foresee that  looking?  Is it the job of lawmakers and  policymakers to figure that one  out?  What's your proposal there?  I don't have a good one.

Transcript:  But when a company achieves this  kind of dominance, traditionally  this has triggered antitrust  review.  It's not illegal to be in a  monopoly.  It's illegal to abuse one.  And what I'd like to see in  general, and this would not just  be trying to regulate, I don't  like regulation.  I'd rather avoid that if  possible.  I'd like to see a lot of  different people, including  government, think about how do  we inject more competition,  re-inject competition into this  world that was massively  distributed and decentralized  but is becoming radically  centralized again.  How do we do something about  that?  I don't know if government wants  to.  I think government kind of likes  it when there are these choke  points that it can apply  pressure to itself.  But that's what I really want to  see is for politicians and  others.  That's why I'm happy Republicans  suddenly realized they were  getting, that they might be  under the control of one media  company.  If we, the solution to these  things is the best solution is  always competition rather than  regulation.  But I don't see much of either  being done.  And that's really what worries  me.

Transcript:  I also wonder if this is not just  inevitable.  I mean, Tim Wu in the master  switch kind of predicted that  this would happen.  This is, when companies are  small and businesses are small  and they're new, there's a lot  of ferment, a lot of creativity,  a lot of competition, but then  money starts pouring in, the  incumbents move in, companies,  new companies become  incumbents like Facebook.  And we're right back to the old  way of doing things.  Isn't that kind of what's  happened?  To a degree, yes.

But the fact that we're, we  I'm not sure that scale is the  right word for the economy here,  but there's things that can be  done better.  But look what happened.

Instagram, got it.  They just swoop in.  I mean, they try to get  Snapchat.  They haven't been able to get it.  So that by itself suggests that

If, for example, Facebook  announced tomorrow that it was  buying Slack, I would hope that  people at the Antitrust Division  would like awaken from their  Rip Van Winkle sleep and say,  oh, okay, this is too much.  That is a false hope.  You know that is never going to  happen.  Well, and if they're asleep  during Democratic  administrations, they're going to  be put to sleep in Republican  administrations.

We'll be covering the keynote,  streaming it live as we always do  on Wednesday, starting at 10 a.m.  Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time,  1700 UTC.  You can, of course, watch Google  Stream, but it's so much more fun  to watch us snark about Google  Stream behind the scenes.  I hope you'll join us for that.  And in a special This Week in  Google at 2 p.m. Pacific, and  Jeff and Jason will be joining  us.  I think we've got a space inside  of Googleplex to stream them  from.  So I think this is going to be  some interesting stuff.  We'll talk about what we're  expecting at Google I.O.  also later on in the show.  Our show today brought to you by  Blue Apron, This Week in Tech,  sponsored by This Week in  Cooking.  I love Blue Apron.  I love blue apron.  Blue Apron solves the problem of  what to eat for dinner.  Yeah, you could go to the fast  food restaurant or you could  just take what's in the  refrigerator.  I don't think there's much I can  do with mustard and peanut  butter, but I'll find a way.  Or Blue Apron Day.  I love coming home and finding  the Blue Apron box on the porch.  There's three separate meals in  there.  Always interesting, too.  I mean, it's really about  unusual ingredients, amazing  recipes that you can make  and it's really about  amazing recipes that you  wouldn't think of buying.  I don't have to go to the  grocery store because they've  done all the shopping for me.  Exactly what I want.  There's no waste.  You know, if it calls for one  rib of celery, that's what's in  there.  There's always exactly what you  need to make the recipe.  It's all fresh from local farms,  sustainably produced.  Seafood is sour, sustainably.  Beef is raised humanely.  Chickens are free range.  The pork is natural.  And always fresh, never frozen,  which I really like.  They use regenerative farming  practices for produce.  And you're going to find some  unusual ingredients you've  never cooked before.  Let's see what's on the menu  this week.  Crispy cod and cabbage slaw  tacos with pepita, pineapple,  and avocado salsa.  See, I don't know what  pepita is, but see, once you've  used it, you go, oh, I'm going  to use more pepita.  Whatever.  That's good stuff.  I love that pepita.  How about crispy catfish?  And what is that?  Yuzu koshu udon.  I know udon's noodles.  See, it's, and the thing is,  you can make this.  You can make it in half hour to  45 minutes.  And your family's going to go,  wow, catfish for dinner.  Pan-seared pork chops with two  cheese mashed potatoes and  sauteed spinach.  They have plans for couples.  Great for date night.  It's really nice for date night.  But they also have family plans  with kid-friendly ingredients.  And what a great way to get the  kids cooking.  Blue Apron delivers right to your  door, 99% of the continental  United States.  They support it.  They support healthy families.  In fact, Blue Apron families  cook three times more often.  So, you know, I know the kids  are going to say pizza tonight  again?  No, we're cooking tonight with  Blue Apron.  I want you to try your first two  meals free and free shipping by  going to BlueApron.com slash  tweet.  You'll love how good it feels,  how great it tastes.  The house fills with this  amazing aroma.  The kids say, oh, what are we,  oh, what's for dinner?  This is good.  It's hard to do this at my mouth  always waters because I started  thinking about my Blue Apron.  BlueApron.com slash tweet.  Your first two meals are free,  with free shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

He'll do a camp this summer  that's all about exploring and  being creative and doing  whatever he can to make it  work.  And he's going to be able to  do that.  And he's going to be able to  do that.  And he's going to be able to do  that.  And he's going to be able to do  that.  And he's going to be able to do  that.  And he's going to be able to do  that.  Steve, I'm sorry.  I just want to make sure that  it's clear because you've been  in the business for years.  I love being creative with  Minecraft.  But one of the reasons it's so  powerful is that it's such an  open system right.  There's so much you can do with  it.  No one has ever Mojang and now  Microsoft following the same  path.  I said, you know, here are the  building blocks.  Build what you want and really  aren't asserting ownership at  all in what people build so you  can.  There are all these various  probably thousands and  thousands of buildings, right?  I mean, they're all very  famous.  And you know, there's a lot  of stuff going on in the  building block.  There's thousands and thousands  of servers out there where you  can do different things on  Minecraft.  And one of the things my son is  really into is playing factions.  So it's basically video games  built on the platform where you  can go in and play a game that  someone invented.

Transcript:  Yeah, I like it.  So I so much prefer to see him  playing that than Call of Duty  or heaven forbid Grand Theft  Auto because it's like Lego and  it gets kids, you know, into  computers in an interesting way.  I really think that the  Minecraft universe and the  building blocks of Minecraft  universe actually prepare people  better than we might think for  engineering jobs, for technology  jobs.  There's something about it that  really kind of fosters this  sense.  You're learning kind of how  pieces fit together, the  consequences of different  actions.  You know, you I find it  fascinating.  We ended up setting up our own  Minecraft server, actually three  of them in my house.  And I even kind of got sucked  into it for a while.  I would stay up till three in  the morning building stuff.  And then you start running  software in Python and it's kind  of the sky's the limit on this.  You know what I love is that  Microsoft never did what probably  was very tempting, which is to  raise the price in Minecraft or  better yet, give it it's only  twenty seven bucks, but give it  away and then charge for  textures and bit maps, you know,  do the in-app purchase thing.  I'm sure that must have been  tempting.  I'm sure that right.  And they let other people do

Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very interesting.  All right.  Let's talk about Google versus  Oracle.  And I'm very curious what you  all think of this.  And correct me if I'm wrong,  because I'm going to try to give  you the timeline and Denise, I'm  sure you'll fix it if I screw it  up.  I interviewed James Gosling  about three weeks ago, the guy  who wrote Java and Sun, which is  a company he was working for  that owned Java, made Java open.  People could develop for Java.  They even said you could, I  guess, write your own Java's.  Of course, I think that's a  good point.  They made their own Java's.  Of course, at one point, Google  came to them, or maybe it was  Andy Rubin before, it probably  was Andy Rubin before Android  was sold to Google and said, I  want to put Android on, I want  to make it a Java based  operating system.  Can we license it?  They talked.  There was no license deal, but  Andy decided he didn't need to  do a license deal because it was  an open platform, created his  own Java based operating  system.  He had a machine called Dalvik.  Google bought Android.  Oracle bought Sun.  The interesting thing is, Gosling  told me this.  He said, we saw Google's code,  and we felt like it was a little  slimy.  Google didn't just kind of do  clean room development of Dalvik.  It looked like some of our code  was in their code.  It felt like we saw bits and  pieces of our stuff in their  code.  It probably wasn't clean room,  but it wasn't the point where we  were going to sue them.  It's like, oh, that's slimy, but  we were upset, but we didn't  plan on doing anything about it.  He says, but when the  negotiations between Oracle and  Sun began in earnest, and he was  in the room talking about this,  he said, I saw the Oracle  lawyers' eyes light up.  They knew they had something,  and they knew there could be a  big payday at the time.  Oracle ended up suing Google.  He said, the thing I really  disagree with is that they  didn't sue them over stealing  the code.  He said, the lawyers apparently  decided that that wasn't a  winnable case.  They copyrighted the API and then  went after them for stealing the  API, which is really kind of  antithetical to the way the whole  computer industry works.  Because of APIs, everything can

Transcript:  We wouldn't have the PC  industry if you hadn't been able  to copy the interface to IBM's  BIOS so that you could make IBM  compatible computers.  That just wouldn't have happened.  So everything from then on really  relies on this idea that APIs are  free and open and can be  duplicated.  Oracle lost the idea of  the API.  I'm not sure the timeline on this.  They lost the case.  The case was appealed, turned  down, appealed, again turned down.  Finally, Oracle appealed all the  way to the Supreme Court, which  decided we're not going to hear  the case.  Not just yet.  Tell me about that.  They tried to get the Supreme  Court involved before the entire  case had been resolved.

Start time: 2358.48
End time: 2403.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It got to the Supreme Court.  It was a case that was  appealed before the entire case  had been resolved.  It got sent back down for trial,  which is what is going to start  retrial on a particular issue.  The fair use question, which is  going to end a couple of other  things are going to happen next  week.  So the Supreme Court just  declined to get involved at an  early juncture.  It could still get involved later  on.  Once there's been a trial and we  have a case, we're going to  get involved.  We're going to get involved.  We're going to get involved.  And then, whether or not there  will be another appeal, whoever  wins or loses, because the  stakes are so high on both sides

I'll tell you how high the  stakes are Oracle suing for.  $2.3 billion.  I think the trial has begun.  There's testimony.  So I think the trial has begun.

Transcript:  Yes.  We started this week.  And it's in front of the judge,  William Alsup, who we celebrated.  So he was the judge before and  ruled in Google's favor.  And we celebrated him because we  thought finally a judge who  knows something about this, he  studied, he was a math major,  but he said he taught himself  Java so that he could rule on  this case.  And I think he even said last  night I wrote a bubble sort of  something.  I can't remember the exact thing.  But anyway, we thought, wow,  this guy's good.  And so it's back in front of him.  Basically, the court set it back  to the jury trial.  It's a jury trial now, which is a  little nerve wracking.  It's a jury of 10 people.  And apparently there was at one  point one person potentially on  the jury who knew about  technology and was bumped off by  Oracle.  So basically it's 10 normal  people who don't know anything  about this subject at hand.  And I don't feel like, Steve,  these are people who are capable  of, you know, do they even know  what an API is?

Start time: 2504.73
End time: 2555.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's what that  motherboard piece really focuses  on.  I mean, this is such like you  just said about what the  importance of what an API is and  how it you know, we wouldn't be  talking over Skype right now.  Right.  So the fact that people who don't  even clearly grasp what that is  and they bump the one person who  does grasp what that is off the  jury, that's dangerous almost.  You know, I don't know what's  going to happen.  I don't know how they're arguing.  I haven't listened to any of the  testimony or anything.  I hopefully the lawyers are  phrasing everything such that the  jury can understand it and distill  it down to so they can understand  the true importance of what this  means for the competing industry  in general.  It's really worrying actually.  I mean, that motherboard  particle is scary.  But they're not talking about

Transcript:  The reading I did on the first few  days of this and not being there,  this is by definition superficial.  It sure sounded like Google played  fast and loose in a lot of ways.  And the internal emails that they  kept pulling out were horrible.  Yeah.  But I do want to come back to this  idea that the APIs can be  copyrighted.  That's catastrophic for technology.

Transcript:  Boy, you know, all right, I don't  want to...  Larry Ellison is not my favorite  person in the world, let's say.  Let's put it that way.  So I think I got this a little bit  wrong.  So the judge said that APIs should  not be eligible for copyright.  That was the right thing.  Right.  And there was an appeal.  The Oracle appeal to the US Court  of Appeals, which said they are  creative works and should be  copyrighted.  And that's when the Supreme Court  said, well, we're not going to...

End time: 2688.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what could happen here then is  that the jury could say, oh, yeah,  it's not fair use.  Nine point three billion dollars to  Google.  Would Google then try to appeal that  ruling or would they go back to the  Supreme Court about this whole notion  of whether you can copyright an API?  Because that's...  I don't care about nine point three  billion dollars for Google.  That's one thing.  I care about  copyrighting APIs.  That seems like a very dangerous  precedent.  Right.

You need to finish up your trial,  which you didn't do the first time  trial court because you decided they  weren't copyrightable.  He threw it out.  Yes.  So you need to go back and have a  trial on that issue and see if Google's  fair use defense flies before a jury  and they'll go through applying the fair  use analysis and see how Google fairs  there.  And then once there's a final decision  on that point, they once again, they  can't go straight to the Supreme Court.  They have to appeal to the Ninth  Circuit and let the trial...  You know, we already...  The Ninth Circuit has already spoken on  that one substantive issue that is so  important to you, Leo.  So if they say the same thing again,  at that point, Google can knock on the  Supreme Court's door and try and involve  them.  But again, that's purely up to the  Supreme Court.  They don't have to take cases.  Wasn't it the...

Transcript:  It wasn't the Ninth Circuit, though,  wasn't it?  The...  It was the D.C.  Court of Appeals.  The D.C.  that loves everything that has  intellectual property attached.  It went to the Federal Circuit,

Transcript:  according to Joe, because there was a...  They hear all payoffs.  They hear all payoffs.  There was a...  There was a...  They hear all patent appeals.  And Google prevailed on the patent  claims.  Oracle did not appeal the patent  claims, but because the patent claim was  in there, it went to Federal Circuit.  And actually, I think the Ninth Circuit  is, I would guess, a little more  sophisticated and maybe perhaps  more sympathetic to Google, yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably right.  I was thinking Ninth Circuit because  they're back in trial in San Francisco,  but you're absolutely right because...  No, no, it went to the Federal Circuit.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Ninth Circuit, I think,  would probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just in case.  They're much more tech savvy,  partially because of their location.  And so, one would...  But again, this is...  What really scares me is this seems to be  in the hands of people who have a fairly  thin grasp of what it all means.  And maybe I'm giving too much weight  to Sarah Zhang's motherboard article,  because she quotes from some of the testimony.  It was kind of a little chilling.  The headline is,  in Oracle versus Google, a nerd subculture  is on trial.  And her point, at least her analysis of this,  is that the jury is trying to get,  wrap its head around things like free software  in the sense of open source, liberated software.  And at one point...  At one point...  Part of the problem is that you've got  Jonathan Schwartz, who's trying to explain  what an API is,  by talking about hamburgers on breakfast menus  in restaurants, which even the judge said,  I don't understand one word of what he says.  I don't know what the witness just said.  The thing about breakfast menu makes no sense.  Oh, boy.

Start time: 2864.61
End time: 2877.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, there are, I think,  a couple of ways that Google could  pull this out, ultimately.  I mean, right now, it has to live with this determination  that APIs and this particular API is copyrightable.

Start time: 2877.16
End time: 2878.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't dispute that.  That's already been decided.

Start time: 2879.44
End time: 2950.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been decided for purposes of this trial.  But, you know, ultimately, hopefully,  they'll get to take another whack at that one.  So this is a fair use case?  Yeah, because they now have to argue that,  okay, if it's subject to copyright,  we get to use it anyway.  I'm hoping that somewhere in here,  and I, like Dan, not there at trial,  haven't read the briefs, et cetera,  but I'm hoping that an implied license argument  is being made as well,  because they didn't have an express license anywhere,  but maybe the way that the parties conducted themselves  and what Google was led to believe,  you know, you can't just sort of take back  making something open simply because there's been  a change of management and lawyers  with a gleam in their eyes.  Right.  So hopefully, they do have some latches  and a stopple arguments.  Those are ways of saying you waited too long  and you led us to believe that, you know,  you led us down the Primrose path  and led us to build things in reliance  on what we reasonably believed.  Do you think it's a case that the jury could handle this,

Start time: 2952.06

Start time: 2965.13
End time: 3022.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, lawyers all the time in technology cases  have to distill very complicated issues  in a way that juries can understand,  and, you know, the copyrightability question,  I think, is really, really hard,  but with that off the table for purposes of this trial,  then you're into the whole fair use analysis,  which, while kind of a wild card,  and it doesn't fit this case very well,  we're used to fair use being applied in different contexts,  it's really hard to think about an API as a creative work,  and that's why the copyrightability question  is so controversial to begin with.  Yeah.  If the jury's just asked to, you know,  whether they misled Google  and these latches and estoppel arguments should apply,  or whether Google hit the four fair use factors,  that should be something a jury can process.

Start time: 3023.50

The amount used, how much of the copyrighted work did you use?  Did you use a portion of it?  They used all of the API, 37 calls.

Start time: 3057.55
End time: 3061.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3084.32
End time: 3101.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to give the lawyers any arguments,  but it undermines the value of Java.  If anybody could come along and say,  well, I don't need Java, I'll just duplicate the API,  I think you could say that undermines the value of Java.  But your point is well taken that that was the intent of Java.  That's what Sun's intent was before Oracle came along.

Start time: 3102.18
End time: 3119.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I always thought this was a fascinating issue  when I first started practicing and looking at APIs.  And in some instances, people licensed them.  And in other instances, they're open and they're widely known as open.

Start time: 3122.02
End time: 3153.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of the nature of an API.  You have to publish an API if you want people to use it,  because if they don't know the API,  then they don't know how to use your stuff.  So the API is always, to some degree, open.  There are hidden API calls.  Microsoft always kept some to itself, secret Microsoft API calls  that only you could use.  Or at least that was the assertion that many of us always used to make.  How do you feel, Dan?  Are you bullish on this or are you worried?

Start time: 3154.83
End time: 3182.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really worried.  I think this could be pretty disastrous for open technology in general.  There's a lot of things that we use every day  that completely rely on the interoperability of technology and the web, et cetera.  Right.

Transcript:  Right. It stifles innovation.  And you've got to love a company that names its AI engine,  Parsi McParf's face.  I think this is a little tip of the hat to Bodie McBoatface.  Remember the OpenVote, the British research vessel, the Antarctic research vessel.  They asked for names, and they suggested Endeavor and lots of good names.  And the internet decided it should be named Bodie McBoatface.  And then the agency that was naming the boat did a turnaround, said,  well, we're going to name it anyway. We're not going to name it that.  Well, Google decided, I guess maybe as a consolation prize,  to name its AI project, Parsi McParf's face.  And by the way, Sundar Pichai tweeted that.  Our state of the art language parsing model is now open source for you to use.  Google plays fast and loose with the idea of open source and so forth too.  I mean, they've always said, oh, Android's open. Android's open source.  And I guess technically it is.  But at the same time, there's considerable restrictions on how you can use it  if you want to have Google services.  In other words, if you want it to be fully functional.  That's one of the things that the EU doesn't like.  Who doesn't like?  Bodie McBoatface was named RRS Sir David Attenborough.  Thank you very much.  That's a good name too. I love David Attenborough.  Yeah, who doesn't love David Attenborough?  It's still.  100,000 people voted for Bodie McBoatface.  Sir David Attenborough.  All right, let's take a break, come back with more.  I want to talk more about Google I.O. What do you expect?  It's just around the corner on Wednesday.  There's lots to talk about, as always.  Microsoft says Windows 10 is now on 300 million active devices.  And only half of those were upgraded behind people's backs.  Just joking. Joking.  Ooh. Joking.  I somehow annoyed Windows people.  I got all these tweets saying, stop it.  I don't even know what I said.  I don't know what I said.  Our show today brought to you by my mattress.  I love my Casper. A good night's sleep.  We're learning more and more about health, about your, you know,  not just how you feel during the day, but your overall health.  You need to get a good night's sleep.  A premium mattress you buy direct from the manufacturer, made in the USA,  and you save so much money because they don't have to pay for showrooms.  It's Casper.  You get your springy latex foam plus your supportive memory phone  to give you an award-winning sleep surface with just the right sink  and just the right bounce.  And I say that because I know it.  Because here it is, my Casper mattress.  We got a queen. You saw how small that box is.  This is the other thing I love about Casper.  I got a queen for my son in college, too, because he's on the,  it was on the third floor, no elevator.  I got a queen for him to get it upstairs.  Look at that. Talking about sink and bounce support.  You get free delivery and, and I know some people say,  Well, here's the good news. You can lie on it for a hundred nights.  And if at any time in those hundred nights you say, yeah, it's not right for me,  you call them, they'll come and get it.  They'll refund you every penny, every penny.  They're made to uphold the highest environmental production standards.  I, I, when I open that box, you know, you, there's not,  there's no smell that you don't have, you don't have to air it out.  It's great. And by the way, talking about breathing, it breathes.  This, this is a cool, comfortable mattress.  You get free shipping, of course, and free returns in the U.S. and Canada.  $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size.  We're going to save even more because you can get additional $50 towards the mattress.  If you go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash T-R-I-E-T.  And using the promo code TWIT.  Casper dot com slash TWIT promo code TWIT terms and conditions apply $50 off.  Your award winning sleep surface.  It's not a mattress, it's a sleep surface.  Okay, it's a mattress.  It's a very nice mattress.  We do love it and I hope you will enjoy your mattress.  But if you don't, return it.  It will refund every single penny.  Don't forget the Casper pillows and sheets and all that too.  The pillows are great.  We fight, Lisa and I fight over our Casper pillows.  I want my pillow.  We got two, so we wouldn't fight over the pillow.  Thank you Casper for your support of This Week in Tech.  And thank you to our team, our panel this week.  Steven Kovac from techinsider.io.

So, in fact, someone who wanted the Supreme Court to intervene in the Google case when the Supreme Court declined to,  made the pitch that you should find that languages like Klingon are not subject to copyright and APIs are likewise a system not subject to copyright.

He's a First Amendment lawyer, Dan, and was the guy who put Ritehaven out of business and has had all kinds of really interesting cases in his career.  And just was approached by these folks who wanted to submit the amicus brief and just knocked it out of the park.  I mean, the brief is not long. I highly recommend it. I usually don't recommend that people go read legal briefs.  But this one is so clever and so well written, and they even managed to find a Klingon font to write out the Klingon language in the briefs.

Transcript:  Oh, this is, Mark has a good sense of humor, I must say.  I mean, it's like a real brief and everything.  By the way, here's the introduction.  There is no word for love in the Klingon language. They don't need it. They don't need it.  Some things just remain unsaid.  As the Klingon proverb says, I can see why the court turned this down.

And if you, you know, when they made, I guess, the reboot or whatever, you have to have everything exactly right.  They treat this as a very serious subject. There's no messing around with Paramount on this subject.  Let's talk about Apple.  We talked about it last week, and I've been very quick to say you shouldn't blame users.  Jim Dalrymple and James Pinkstone both have complained that Apple's... Apple Music deleted files on their computer.  Pinkstone, who's a designer, said 120 gigabytes of music files after he matched it in Apple Music, Apple's software just deleted it.  This is behavior that, you know, most of us who use Apple Music have never seen before, but enough people have reported it that I hate to say it's their fault.  I think a lot of people, including some Apple press, said, ah, it must have been their fault.  Well, maybe not. Now Apple says, hmm, there may be bugs in iTunes. Could happen.  Just in case we're going to fix some... we're not admitting anything, but just in case we're putting out a patch next week.  That's not an admission. That's just, you know, just we're just going to be... here's what they wrote.  In an extremely small number of cases, users have reported that music files saved on their computer were removed without their permission.  We're taking these reports seriously. Good for Apple, as we know how important music is to our customers.  And our teams are focused on identifying the cause. Here's the key, though.  We have not been able to reproduce this issue, which usually you need to do if there's a bug.  We need to be able to show how that happens. However, we are releasing an update to iTunes early next week, which includes additional safeguards.  So they haven't fixed... if there's a bug, they haven't found it, they haven't fixed it, but they're going to do something extra.  If a user experiences this issue, they should contact AppleCare.  I don't know if you can say this is victory for Jim Dalrymple and James Pinkstone, or if Apple's just, I think, probably doing the right thing.  Assuming it even fixes the issue, I mean...  Well, if they don't know what the problem is, you can't fix it.  Right. Exactly. So what is this patch? If they can't recreate the bug, or if it is a bug, or whatever it is, it sounds like they don't even know.

Start time: 3983.10
End time: 4005.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so I don't even know what this patch means. If it's... it's a bug, it's a bug.  I mean, great that they're taking it seriously. And it's also great that they're supposedly totally revamping Apple Music again this summer.  So hopefully they get a lot of those kinks ironed out.  They need to tear this sucker down.  Yeah, just start. Burn it down. Start from the beginning.

You know, it wasn't... Beats Music was not burning up the charts.  But it's still a fraction of the 30 million that Spotify has.  And I think Apple really wants this to succeed. So they need to. And iTunes is terrible.  They really need to fix it.  I'm a little disheartened by the early reports of what they're going to do.  They'll announce this, I'm sure, at WWDC. According to 9to5Mac, it's just going to have a new sidebar and a refreshed media picker and things like that.  That's not what it needs.  Start from scratch. We've seen enough patching on iTunes.

That's fine.  He says, we're showing a picture of the middle finger and the caption is, Apple's terms of use abridged.  It says, when your Apple Music subscription term ends, you will lose access to any songs stored in your iCloud Music library.  You expressly agree that your use of or inability to use the Apple Music service is at your sole risk.  Of course, this is boiler-prayed. Every company has this.

Transcript:  Right. Right. Right. You can still sue them. You can sue them for anything.  You might even win, as we've learned. You never know what's going to happen.  Now, here's an interesting article that I really did want to talk about with all of you because...  Well, I found it. This is from a website by Neil Seiberg called Above Avalon.  And the analysis is quite interesting. He's taking a look at Apple's R&D, their research and development costs.  In the past, it's been pointed out by many that Apple's R&D costs are unusually low for a company of its size with its cash.  But all of a sudden, starting in 2010, the costs started to ramp up rather rapidly, and they have increased significantly.  $10 billion a year in 2016, that's up 30% from a year ago.  And just four years ago, Apple was spending $3 billion. So from $3 to $10 billion in just four years.  He says, this is evidence, and I think this is interesting, that Apple is about to pivot.  Now, I think he's using pivot in a way that is not kind of common usage.  Usually what you mean when you say pivot, at least with a startup, is, oh, what they were doing didn't work, so they were trying something else.  Pretty clear what Apple's doing is working. There's no need for Apple to pivot.  On the other hand, I think there's significant interest in having the next iPhone, and that's where you do a lot of R&D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't read this as, when you say pivot, it's not even the next iPhone, which is what, another personal computing device.  And I don't think we're going to see that kind of revolution in personal computing. I'm going to be an old guy before that happens.  I think when he says pivot, he means a whole new kind of category, and the obvious category is transportation.  There's that billion-dollar investment in the Chinese company. I'm going to pronounce it wrong. It's a Didi or Dai Dai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uber of China, which is...  Let's call it that.  So it's clear they're thinking not just building a car that you're going to go and buy a physical object,  but it's also clear that they're thinking the transportation and mobility services, which is super interesting and very ambitious.  And that's not personal computing. It's maybe enabled by, you still call the car with your phone, but that's just a wild new step for them,  assuming that's where all this R&D spending is going. So a physical car plus this concept of mobility services,  which there are already some startups working on that now, like that Faraday Future startup.  And even Ford is thinking about this and GM. So the fact that Apple is going to be going after that kind of market, that is a pivot in their business.  It's not a personal computing play.

Start time: 4361.00
End time: 4383.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess you're right. That is a pivot, isn't it? Yeah.  It could be wearables though. We don't know what they're spending that money on. We know they spent, as you said, a billion dollars on the acquisition.  Right. Or the investment.  But we don't know what the $10 billion is. It could be on the next iPhone. It could be on the next Apple Watch. It could be on anything. They don't break it down.

Transcript:  They are. They have their hand in everything. If you go to South Korea, Samsung is everywhere. They're 30% of the GDP or something.  So they touch everything, not just phones and chips. But yeah, it's not pivot and Silicon Valley talk like the way you and I used to talk about it.  But for Apple to go from a personal computing company into this whole new aspect of just getting people around, whether it's through an Uber-like service or an actual vehicle, that's huge.  That's a huge fundamental shift. And I totally agree with Neil that they're working on such a shift.

I mean, Tesla's already have the semi-autonomous autopilot and things like that. That's where you kind of start now.  But I think the more interesting thing is actually that service. I think that's the fact that you don't need to own a car, especially in urban areas.  That's just a huge opportunity for any car company now. The fact that you just call the car when you need it or you get one where you need it. It's like Spotify for cars.  I think that's a more interesting play than even just building an electric car.

Transcript:  Right. Is it credible, Dan, you think? I mean, you've been watching Apple for practically since the beginning that they might do this kind of massive, you know,  shift in business. There wouldn't even be a computer company anymore.

Start time: 4507.72
End time: 4609.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it would be a computer company. I think they're, I don't know if they're going to do a car. It wouldn't surprise me.  But Apple strategy for the last number of years has been to make Apple the center of your digital life.  And as everything we touch in a and this is kind of scary, but everything we touch is getting or already has software in it and memory and is connected to digital networks.  Apple could make a very strong play in being the hub of our increasingly digital existence.  And that might include transportation. It makes perfect sense that it would.  But the whole, you know, the entertainment portion of many people's homes is all Apple at this point that could expand out into the badly named internet.  Things and and and onwards. So if I if Apple is being the Apple, I think I understand.  I think they're going for much bigger thing than simply software that runs cars.  I think it's a much bigger thing if this is what I think it is.  Yeah. Denise, what would you do if you were Apple right now?  I mean, you you you had the probably the most successful technology product of all time in the iPhone and it's starting to taper off.

The iPad didn't really take over the Apple Watch.  Didn't you do you have to find the next big thing or do you just kind of coast on what you got?

Transcript:  You know, people on iPhones tend to also own other Apple stuff.  They tend to use I would imagine Apple Music over other music solutions.  Lock these guys in.  You've got them build on that.  And I don't know if a car can do that.  A car is is a pivot in the sense that it's just a completely separate thing.  And you're entering a market where there are already companies that have that kind of loyalty and lock in.  Well, iOS, I mean, Apple is trying to, you know, monetize those iOS users a lot more.

Transcript:  I mean, the last two earnings calls, and if you want to be cynical, it's because iPhone sales are down and they were projecting them to be down.  But they are talking more and more about services.  revenue.  What that looks like.  I mean, Apple Music is part of it.  App Store sales are part of it.  iCloud storage subscriptions and so forth.  What their big challenge is.  I mean, a lot of there's just suck right now.  That's the real problem.  Yeah, they are making they made nine million dollars on it last quarter, but it sucks.

Start time: 4733.12
End time: 4740.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4741.02
End time: 4784.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, on that side, the core business right now is to make that not suck and make it good and make it a pleasurable experience that when, you know, I store stuff in iCloud, it's going to be available or iMessage syncs correctly between all my devices and just numerous little glitches throughout their entire services ecosystem.  When I search for an app, I get the app I'm looking for.  I don't get a bunch of clones and garbage.  That's terrible.  I think or was it last week or two weeks ago, the App Store search just totally borked and you'd search Instagram and you'd get like just garbage.  You know, so there's a lot of holes in their services and that's there's a huge opportunity there and they see it.  But they haven't really proven that they can fix it.

Transcript:  So there was a rumor.  I don't know how true this is.  Apple's denied it from digital music news that Apple within two years sooner or then later will stop selling music for download.  They're they're going to they're going to move towards a streaming only service.  Apple's issued a denial.  But of course they would, wouldn't they?  I mean, that's the last thing you want people to do is start buying their music somewhere else because Apple's going to shut down their music service.  If Steve Jobs were alive, one source said he would have killed it by now.  Maybe Steve was always willing to make the next move boldly.

Transcript:  There's one reason people still need physical digital movie or music, any digital files.  But music in particular with, you know, we're all in this realm of everyone's a creator.  Everyone's got their YouTube channel and is getting their subs up as much as possible.  Or, you know, I mean, people people are out there creating digital media every day.  And if you don't have an actual music track to lay over what you're doing, you can't do that with whatever you're streaming from Spotify.  Then then you're not as creative as you could be.  So people at least have to keep buying music for that reason.

Start time: 4905.34
End time: 4983.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This article cites a number of reasons why this might make sense.  According to one analyst, once Apple Music hits 20 million subscribers, their revenues through streaming music will exceed the revenues through sales.  And that should happen by, say, 2020.  The next few years, he says, by 2020, Apple's download business would be 10 times smaller than the streaming revenue.  And even more crucially, streaming revenue will have reached the 2012 iTunes Store download revenue peak.  So the lines cross.  That's the point at which Apple would choose to turn off the iTunes Store.  Also product confusion.  I think part of the reason that we saw those articles about Apple deleted my music is this kind of confusion between downloading songs and owning them and having them on your hard drive.  And streaming them only.  If you just are on a streaming service, those things don't, you know, that doesn't come up.  And also, I think you got to consider the music industry, which loved, embraced Apple's iTunes initially because Apple was small.  They didn't think that would be a big deal, whatever.  Now iTunes is the number one place people buy music.  And that gives Apple a huge amount of power and influence in the music industry.  And I don't think the music industry much likes that.

Start time: 4984.64
End time: 5004.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the same time, the music industry would love to create a world where we own absolutely nothing.  And so streaming services, my only surprise is that they didn't create their own first.  Well, again, we're talking about an industry that, you know, thinks backwards 20 years not ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Yeah. And it would certainly solve the piracy issue. It would solve.  If they could just get the revenues up to a certain point on streaming, I think the industry certainly would like it.  I don't know if users want. I think one of the main reasons today people buy music is they want to reward an artist.  You buy Taylor Swift's newest album or Beyonce's newest album, not because you have to.  You can listen to it on streaming. You buy it because you want to give her ten bucks.  Thank you. It's a tip almost.

Transcript:  Thank you, Megan, Megan Maroney and Jason Howell on tech news today, Monday through Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time, 2300 UTC.  You got to watch each and every episode.  Our show this week brought to you by Harry's. You may have noticed how clean, shaven and soft my cheek is.  That's because I use Harry's high quality, high performance blades made in Germany.  Because you know what? Harry's bought the factory.  They decided if we're going to get people great blades at a great price, we're going to own the place where they're made.  They asked and they said the best razor blades are made at this factory in Germany.  They bought them and now they ship them right to you.  So the blades are half the price of leading brands.  You don't have to deal with lines at the drugstore.  Kind of feel like a criminal as you stand there as somebody comes to unlock the plexiglass so you can get your blades.  That's a sign they're charging too much for the blades.  I think one million guys have made the switch to Harry's, including me.  I love my Harry's easy to go to the website.  Start with a Harry's kit like the Winston set.  That's the one I use.  I actually have a collection of Winstons.  I've got the copper handle, the silver handle.  I love my Winstons.  And then of course I get the blades in the mail every month.  And now you have your choice of foaming shave gel or the shave cream.  I like the cream. It comes in a tube.  But I know a lot of people like gels.  You get your choice and that's mailed to you each and every week.  But you got to start with the razor handle and that's where the kit comes in.  Take a look at the Truman set.  $15 you get a handle.  You get three blades.  You get a full size, not a sampler, a full size bottle of the gel or the cream.  And the travel cover, which I think is actually really a very handy little added product.  And then you get the razor and the shaving cream delivered to your door.  So why pay $32 for an eight pack of shaving blades when you get them for half the price from Harry's.com?  And a great shave.  They've got the Truman set as I mentioned $15 but we've got a little deal for you.  $5 off your first purchase when you go to harrys.com slash twit.  H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com slash twit.  Pick up the Truman kit that's ten bucks.  And a great way to try it, get started.  I think you'll like it.  Harry's, stop compromising. Give Harry's a try today.  H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  So thank you FCC.  They're going to allow charter communications to merge with Time Warner Cable, a $78 billion merger.  This after Charter got in trouble for flouting customer service rules.  That didn't stop them.  Remember Charter was blocking cable subscribers from using their own modems even though they weren't allowed to do so by law.  Charter customers in June 2012 the company stopped allowing new customers or those switching new price plans to use their own cable modems because they get ten bucks a month for random.  This continued through August 2014 and the FCC slapped them with a fine that probably didn't come to 10% of the amount of money they made, a $640,000 penalty.  And oh here's the prize, why don't you merge with Time Warner?  The big get bigger.  $640,000 is 18 minutes worth of revenue for the combined companies.  Time Warner Charter will make $18.6 billion a year.  Now there's still number two to Comcast I think. So you've got Comcast and this new Time Warner Charter.

And we decided to celebrate the fact that we are IPTV.  That we have for a long time, for 10 years now, really been a television network on the Internet.  What is the, is the teespring.com slash twit, is that the?  Yeah.  This is our, we call it our World Tour T.  It says twit IPTV.  And on the back, the reason we call it the World Tour TV is because we got all the t-shirt,  is because we got all the shows.  But it looks like the concert dates.  So this just went on sale, as with all of our t-shirts, it's only on sale for 30 days.  And I talked Lisa into $20.  She said, let's charge $25.  I said, I said, let's charge $19.  She said, all right, I'm not going to go for the $19.  We'll do $20.  I said, okay, deal.  So very affordable.  Very affordable, 20.  We have them in a variety of sizes, including, yes, we have women's, V-neck and regular.  And there's also unisex for people who aren't sure which they are.  And we only need 18 more to print.  And we're going to get, we're going to get to that level.  But we'll keep printing them for 28 days.  And they will be shipped on June 12th.  And there is a discount.  The more you buy, the less shipping costs.  And I think that the price of the shirt goes down five bucks too.  So I thought I'd plug that.  We are IP.  We finally admit it.  We've been IPTV all this time and you didn't even know it.  All you need is internet.  Google I.O. around the corner.  It's going to be Wednesday.  What are we looking for?  Anything exciting?

Transcript:  The information I think was the first publication that broke up.  They're working on an Amazon Echo-like device.  And then I think it was recode this week, figured out that's the name, chirp.  Or at least it's the code name is chirp.  But you can easily imagine what it's going to be like.  Basically Google Now on a speaker.  Hopefully it has a lot of good partnerships.  I mean, the one reason I didn't buy Alexa right away was because they didn't have Spotify.  So hopefully they have a lot of those.  It has Spotify now, though, by the way.  It does now, yeah.  So hopefully, you know, they have a lot of those key partnerships locked down right away.  Uber and all that kind of stuff that makes the Echo so much fun.  But for me, I'm super excited to see what this thing's like.  I am an Echo fanatic.

Transcript:  I think the Echo is a really interesting product, and I was always surprised that neither Apple nor Amazon had.  I mean, Google had a similar product, so it makes sense.  On the other hand, people might be a little nervous about it after reading Gizmodo's story, and it's not really confirmed.  The FBI, they did a Freedom of Information Act with the FBI asking if they'd ever turned on the Amazon Echo for wiretapping purposes.  And they got back a response from the FBI.  We can neither confirm it nor deny it.  So that isn't a confirmation, folks.  It's just we can't confirm it or deny it.  Sounds like a threat.  Yeah, that's exactly what I thought is they would like you to think they could, even if they had or maybe they hadn't thought of it.  But really, aren't we surrounded by microphones the FBI could turn on with a court order?  Yes.  I mean, everywhere. Your TV, your Xbox, your phone, your webcam.  James Comey, the director of the FBI, even admitted, I keep a piece of tape over my webcam.  He knows.

Start time: 6140.08
End time: 6174.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think what's great about Google now is how it ties into everything.  Basically, it hits your email.  They know more.  Yeah, they know more.  Flight alerts, restaurant reservations from OpenTable, things like that are just going to be baked into there.  So getting a reminder, hey, Google or whatever the keyword will be, is my flight delayed?  I think that would be really cool.  I just feel like they can open up so many more use cases just by the nature of how awesome Google now is on the phone.  Yeah, I would.

Start time: 6176.84
End time: 6268.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one thing that Amazon does right with the Echo is it's an open somewhat of an open ecosystem.  It is not hard to write a they call them skills for the Echo.  Amazon has a platform, an Amazon Web Services platform that you can use to host the skills.  And they don't charge a lot.  It's very affordable.  In fact, it's free for the first, you know, I mean, if you're just using it for personal use, it would be free.  So you use Amazon Web Services Lambda.  So your code runs on Lambda in the cloud.  You don't have to run a server or anything.  And it's a fairly straightforward process to write skills.  A lot of people are writing skills who are not particularly wizard coders.  And you don't have to handle the language recognition.  That's all handled for you.  So Google, I don't know if Google would do something this open.  I'd love to see them do it.  The problem with this is if you have an Echo, it's a pain to figure out there's like 80 pages of skills and you have to enable the skills.  You have to figure out what the skills are.  And then you have to remember the unique syntax.  On the other hand, I love it that you could do this.  You can have somebody I could say read Hacker News to you.  You have to say Echo open Hacker News and then it will read to you.  I play Jeopardy because the folks at Jeopardy have written a Jeopardy game and they ask you six questions from from last night's Jeopardy show.  There's a lot of neat stuff in 90 pages now skills.  It's hard to keep track of.

There's you can have it tell you a dad joke.  The jokes are bad anyway, but it has even worse jokes for dad jokes.  You can also ask it to tell.  Yeah, that's the syntax.  Echo ask for a fart.

You can tell Echo buy me another some more of that.  And you have to enter a PIN code so that your kid can't do it.  But of course, your kid will be listening the next time you use it.  So it's not really that effective.  And it will send it to you.  It arrives two days later.  But you're saying you bought switches so you can turn on lights, right?  Is that what you're saying?

You cut off the speaker and you can pair it to any Bluetooth speaker.  So you'd pair it to your car or aux plug it into.  Yeah.  The problem is that you'd need a battery backup on the echo because it has to restart  every time you turn on the car.

You put in your then and then it's called zero touch.  I think it's Alexa for the echo for the car.  Let me go back.  Let me go back.  It disappeared.  I got it.  There it is.  Learn more.  I got click the learn more button.  So the idea is as a smart car phone holder with a voice command app.  So when the phone is on the holder, I guess, is magnetic, it launches the app and then  you can text by voice, voice activated music, voice navigation.  It can use glimpse to share your location.  Hands free calling.  So even though your phone probably does that, this kind of integrates.  It seems anyway, I ordered it.  I'll let you know.  I'll do a review.  It's just a matter of time before we can just talk to everything around us.  Right.  And it'll respond and do stuff.  I like that.  Do you mind?  Is that scary?

It doesn't feel like government regulation is a very good solution to a lot of this stuff  and you can not just point to here, but the EU as well and some of the things the EU has  been doing lately where every time I go to a website now, I get a pop-up saying, oh,  we use cookies, is that okay with you?  That's because of an EU regulation and every website, if it wants to have, you know, do  anything in the EU has to do this and it's dopey because all you do is you click yes  and then it's just like, why do I have to, it's meaning, it doesn't do anything.

It's like Prop 65 in California.  It has exactly the opposite effect of the intended effect.  The proposition 65 said people have to warn you if there's carcinogenic chemicals in an  area.  So you just everywhere you go in California, there's a Prop 65 warning that chemicals known  to cause cancer in this area.  And you just ignore it now because it's everywhere.  It's exactly the opposite of what the intent was.  That's why I fear that government regulation is not the solution in a lot of these things.  I don't know what the solution is, but I just.

Why bother charging for it?  You know, Microsoft's future is not selling copies of Windows.

Transcript:  Not everyone is properly represented in emojis.  For instance, women are not well represented in the emoji world.  But I just read that Google has announced that it's going to start producing new emojis that will represent professional women such as scientists, doctors, educators, and farmers.  The farmer emoji, the farmer emoji, of course, fertilizes her field with the emoji.  Yeah.  I'm glad emojis are becoming more inclusive.  It was only recently they added skin color options to represent people who don't have jaundice.  Apparently, apparently, apparently, even though women use emojis more than men,  they're a little underrepresented in the emoji verse.  Let me show you how uneven it is.  If you're a man in the world of emoji, you can be a police officer, a British palace guard, a Santa with a weird flesh beard, a private investigator, a I want to say bike helmet salesperson,  a construction worker who also sells pot, a saxophone player for stay human.  All right.

Transcript:  It's you know, I think part of the fun of emojis is it is a closed world and you have to be creative in how you put them together to convey what you're saying.  But, you know, all to the good.  There's no there's no central it's not a government thing.

Transcript:  You can't get mad at whoever's putting out emojis because the Unicode Consortium, believe it or not, because they decide because it's part of the Unicode set.  This is this is a request for comments.  Expanding emoji professions, reducing gender inequality, and they have to get it approved by the folks at the Unicode Consortium.  They're they're the ones who decide what's in the Unicode code set and what what emojis are available.  So I don't know.

Transcript:  I mean, if they're if they have various emojis that could be either male or female, it would be nice if you had the choice like you have the choice.  That would be nice.  Am I a boy swami or a girl swami?  That's a good point.

Start time: 7182.06

Transcript:  And I don't think that would need approval because that's all the same Unicode symbol.  There is, of course, there was a Kickstarter to raise money for the dumpling emoji.  They they.  Yeah, you have to actually buy a seat on the Unicode Consortium.  And that's who decides emojis.  And I don't see a lot of women or swamis on the here's a guy wearing a T-shirt.

Transcript:  Well, you know about Emojipedia.  This is this is the this is where you go.  If you want to know what an emoji means, you paste it into Emojipedia and and it gives you everything you'd ever want to know.  It even shows you the representations of the emojis for all the different phones and Google and Microsoft and Twitter and Facebook.  Because, you know, they have a see that Mozilla one that blowing a kiss.  That's definitely a lady emoji right there.  It's a weird one.  I don't know what's going on with the eyes.  Oh, I guess she's winking.  I get it.  Yeah.  Microsoft's blowing a kiss also a lady emoji.  Let's take a break and we can talk about what's going to happen to Yahoo.  Apparently, Warren Buffett is now getting into the act and he's and he's got friends.  Our show today brought to you by this little doohickey.  This is a great thing.  This is the tracker.  And, you know, I was just looking because I didn't have my keys with me.  I thought, where are my keys?  So I launched the tracker app on my smartphone and it tells me where my keys are, which is pretty darn awesome.  But there's even more you can do with the tracker.  See, there's what my keys are.  And it says last seen to 16 p.m. on Sunday, May 15th.  Oh, that's at home.  I left them at home.  But I just found out I can do other things with the tracker.  For instance, this is Jason's tracker.  He's so cute.  It's about the size of a quarter.  And so it will let me know when I get separated from his phone.  But it also if I'm carrying around the tracker and I left a phone under a cushion, I could press the button on the tracker.  And the phone lets me know where it is.  Isn't that awesome?  By the way, you could pick your own sound.  That's an excellent choice.  And if you're driving in the car, no, you are not being stopped right now.  That's just Jason's tracker.  I hate it when they do that on radio shows.  The tracker.  These are the new trackers.  They're really nice.  Coin sized aluminum.  You can put them on anything.  And this is the neat thing.  Tracker is the largest network of trackers.  And this is this is the crowd GPS network.  Now, obviously, something this small and light and inexpensive doesn't have a GPS in it.  The phone has the GPS, so it uses that.  But here's the cool thing.  If your phone gets near somebody else's tracker, it notices it and sends a note to their tracker.  So if your item goes missing, the tracker app records the last note location on a map.  And then when another tracker user comes within 100 feet of it, you're going to get an update of where your item is.  So other people will help you find your tracker.  It's got a million and a half trackers out there right now.  That's pretty guaranteed.  Tracker just announced their tracker Atlas.  It works with your tracker Bravo.  That's what this is.  Or your third party Bluetooth tracker to pinpoint your items inside the house.  What?  Yep.  So now you don't just know it's well, the keys are at home.  You know they're under the cushions.  You just ask the tracker Atlas where your item is and you get an answer.  You don't even need to search.  I love these things.  Tracker Bravo.  It's beautiful anodized aluminum.  It's thin. It's light.  And when you go to the tracker dot com, you're going to get 30 percent off your entire order.  They've got nice colors.  Works with the iPhone, the Android phone.  Go to T H E T R A C K R dot com and use the promo code twit.  You get 30 percent off your trackers.  Attach them to everything.  Remote controls.  What would you you could put it on a dog.  It's light enough for a collar.  Would you attach your tracker to I have it on my back.  What I do is I put them on my keys and then I put my keys in the backpack.  So it's kind of you know, keeping an eye on both.  Really cool idea.  T H E T R A C K R.  No E at the end there dot com and use the promo code twit for 30 percent off.  So you may remember the names Tim Katigan and Dan Rosenzweig.  They were Yahoo executives no longer there, but they have formed a consortium, including Warren Buffett and Bain Capital.  Is it Bain? No, no.  Who's involved with this?  Quick and Loans founder and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert to make a bid on Yahoo.  So we've heard that Verizon's making a bid.  But by the way, it's moving along now.  They're having day long meetings with Marissa Meyer and the Yahoo's and stuff.  And and these guys, Rosenzweig was CEO of Yahoo from 2002 to 2006.  And then Tim Katigan was in charge of search and advertising from 2003 to 2008.  Presumably they have some inside information that makes Yahoo more valuable than the rest of the folks think.  Neither is interested in taking a larger managerial role there.  They both have their own startups.  What do you think? What's going to happen to Yahoo?  Dan, can Yahoo be saved? If Marissa Meyer can't save it, who can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, hard to say that she's done that good a job in trying a lot of acquisitions for no apparent purpose and Tumblr and doing killing off some very good stuff.  This Buffett thing is really interesting.  Someone I don't know if she's still on the Berkshire Hathaway board, but Hillary Schneider, who was a senior person at Yahoo, was on the Berkshire board of directors.  And she's gone off to run some other company.  But I can see some pieces possibly fitting together if that's why he's in it.  But yeah, Yahoo can be saved.  They're still enormously used by lots of people.  And I think that they're running out of time for sure.  But there's a lot of cash flow there and there's a lot of pretty amazing properties that they could still do a lot with.  I think it's been to some degree squandered, but it's not over.  There's users for sure.

Transcript:  This article is by Kara Swisher. She seems to know pretty well what's going on inside Yahoo before anybody else does.  She says that it's guessed that the company will go for $4 billion once you separate out about a billion in patents.  So who's bidding? Verizon, some private equity firms, TPG, Sycamore Partners, Vista Equity, and Bain Capital.  And now Warren Buffett and Dan Gilbert. Kind of interesting. $4 billion? I don't know.

Start time: 7684.00
End time: 7699.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like a lot of money for a company.  I've been sitting here trying to think of how I've encountered Yahoo in the last year of my life.  And I think the only two ways I can come up with is reprinting AP news stories and posting Flickr.

Start time: 7699.00
End time: 7808.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flickr. Flickr is the last gem there. It's not worth $4 billion, but it's definitely still a gem.  Although Flickr, you wonder why didn't they launch an Instagram before Instagram?  Why did they miss the boat on that stuff? If anybody could do it, they could.  Let's see. Anything else we want to get in here? The Philly police have admitted now.  That was great. That was their truck.  So actually, I'm glad Denise is here because I would love to know the legal ins and outs of this.  So the Philadelphia police are employing a device. Let's see if I can find the name here. Called the LSAG MPH-900.  It is an automatic license plate reader, and it's a pretty damn sophisticated one.  It uses infrared to look at temperature differentials on license plates between the raised letters and the base of the plate.  And it can read multiple license plates at the same time with great accuracy.  Who knew more than a thousand agencies across all 50 United States are using the digital automatic license plate reader?  They're sitting on the roads and just capturing every license plate that goes by.  I know people complain about license plate, red light cameras and the readers on bridge tolls and so forth.  But apparently, the police can just sit on the road and do it.  But they're a little hesitant because these trucks, these vans have some equipment on the roof.  And maybe that might scare people. So the Philadelphia police said, oh, we can fix that.  And they affixed a Google Maps logo to the truck.

Start time: 7809.10
End time: 7821.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not even a good disguise. It's a bad Google Maps logo.  They just took the app icon and made a little sticker and put it on the car.  I mean, it's like a car car. It's just hilarious that they thought that would do it.

Start time: 7822.12
End time: 7831.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you two are the only people in the world who are not the only two.  But you're among the very few people who would know the difference.  I mean, I would look at that and go, oh, I would even say, yeah, that's sure.

Start time: 7832.50

Start time: 7835.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, right, because Google owns those logos and trademarks.  Oh, that. Oh, yeah.  You really aren't allowed to use them without Google's permission.  So that that's just a no, no.

Start time: 7850.02
End time: 7861.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it is it allowed? I guess I guess the streets are public.  So it's allowed for. Can anybody have one of those devices and sit on the street and watch license plates go by?

Start time: 7862.18
End time: 7864.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7866.02
End time: 7880.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So not only law enforcement, but I can do it. Probably. Right.  So, you know, that's interesting.  However, they might be in trouble with Google because, as you say, it's their trademark.  In fact, Google seems pretty unhappy about it.

Start time: 7921.04
End time: 7924.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 7927.26
End time: 7954.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's it's it's privacy.  I mean, what what gets people's senses tingling is, hey, I didn't give you permission and that's my private information.  But when you're out in public, privacy, to a large extent, goes out the window.  You can be photographed in public if you as long as you don't reasonably feel that you're in a photo free zone.  So, yeah, I just don't see why they can't do it.

Start time: 7954.04
End time: 7970.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure they can. But the difference now is, of course, that the stuff becomes ubiquitous.  I don't think that people had any expectation that they would be trackable at everything they do at every place they go.

Start time: 7971.62
End time: 7991.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and of course, the addition not only of the tracking devices, but the ability to create massive interrelated databases that can deduce all sorts of stuff from the state of smog that you leave behind you.  That's the that's the real power of it, right?  It's not merely knowing that you are on the street is knowing everywhere you went, what you saw.  There you go.

Start time: 7992.44

Transcript:  That's so easy to get. What's the difference?

Start time: 8010.44
End time: 8028.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole point of a license plate is so that the public can identify you and turn you in if you're doing something wrong and the police can identify you if you're at a stop.  So they're you know, here's they're using it.  Somebody needs to entrepreneurially come up with an alternative to the license plate floated out there.

Start time: 8029.24
End time: 8064.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also feels a little bit like a fishing expedition, like they're just sitting there.  But I guess that's what the police officer would do anyway.  If he had a you know, an APB on a license plate, he'd be looking at the license plate.  So this just automates the process.  Don't isn't there a long standing tradition though of the police and FBI hiding their activities in a van that has like the local pests control?  Yeah. Right. I mean, that's or is that just in movies?  Are they not allowed to use other people's trademarks?  You can't say you're the phone company.
