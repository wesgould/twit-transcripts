I decided to give the team the week off.  It's New Year's Day.  No one's going to come in to work anyway.  And we certainly wouldn't be able to get any hosts.  But fortunately, there's a lot of good stuff we did over the past year.  And we thought it'd be kind of fun, as we've done in years past, to do a best of episode.  So that's what we've put together for you today.  Kicking it off, Oh Doctor, who's always a fun and wonderful guest on the show.  He just a hoot.  And you probably remember back in November, he was a little teed off, shall we say, about  Apple's new MacBook Pros.  Listen.  Actually, it's in the other room.  The new Apple MacBook.  We did an interview yesterday on the new screensavers with Kyle Weins.  He's at ifixit.com.  And as you know, ifixit does teardowns of all of the new stuff whenever it comes out.  They did a teardown on the new MacBook.  It's kind of part of their mission, which is to kind of make repair manuals, tools,  and parts available for everything.  So one of the things they do when they do a teardown is they rate these things on how  easily you can repair them.  The new MacBook got a repair factor of one, repairability of one.

Transcript:  That's what Tim Cook says.  It's a beautiful thing.  But in their in their mood, in their haste to make thinner, lighter notebooks, what Apple's  really done is make notebooks with that.  There is it's not upgradeable.  You can't add.  It's a big iPhone.  It's a big iPhone.  It's exactly the model, even down to the point where not only the battery is not removable,  they're so heavily glued in.  Kyle said it was almost impossible to get them out.  We had infinite patience that it's also and this is the thing that really bugs me, not  recyclable.  He says, really?  Yeah.  He says we hear from recyclers all the time who have fires from lithium ion batteries.  They're either left in by accident or we didn't find it.  And when they grind it up, of course, as with any lithium ion battery, it explodes and it  bursts into flame.  And it's a real problem for recyclers to the point where this is going in the landfill.  This is not going to be recycled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait.  So Apple, I remember years ago, Apple getting heavily criticized for like burning down the  earth and being bad citizens of the world.  But they came back and they're like, oh, no, but we do this and we have our new building  is going to be LEED certified.  It's a spaceship.  It can take us to Mars if the earth ever melts down.  Like I remember that press conference.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And they're a member of EPET, you know, and their stuff is EPET certified.  But I have to think it has a little bit to do with the millions of dollars they gave  EPET more than the sustainability of the electronics.  Here's what I'm going to propose.  By the way, it's not just Apple.  It's everybody.  This is the Google Pixel.  It's a sealed battery, right?  Now it may be possible to take it apart and take the battery out easily.  I don't know.  But I think increasingly the drive towards thinner electronics is driving us towards  sealed cases and batteries.  Remember the days when you could take the back of a phone and replace the battery or  pop the battery out of a laptop and put a new one in?  I mean, the battery goes bad in a few years anyway.  These are they're essentially making disposable electronics.  This is an awful big chunk of disposable electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So I asked Kyle, well, doesn't Apple recycle these?  Because you're supposed to bring your old stuff back to Apple.  He said, I know the recycler that Apple uses.  And no.  And so so here's the issue.  That's a crime.  Going forward, I think we as consumers for our own benefit, because replaceable batteries  are good for us.  It keeps electronics lasting longer.  If you have a cell phone with a replaceable battery, you can put a second battery in.  And it's good for the environment.  Shouldn't we start demanding not thinner and lighter.  But removable batteries and recycling.

Transcript:  So first of all, let me just go and then I'm going to stop.  You make a laptop with only C ports in it and then you put a headphone jack in it.  After you just told me that you were magically getting rid of my headphone jack that I try  to put in this iPhone 7 Plus repeatedly.  Now why is it in that and you can't have a way for me to just plug my phone into my laptop  and charge it when I'm on the go and I got stuff to do.  And instead now I have to pull out this dongle and look like a doofus.  But you couldn't put an SD card reader in it because you told me aerodynamics.  I'm thinking this dongle is aerodynamic.  Everything is wrong with this thing.  You told me.  Any professional knows how to use the function keys to get around any of these pro tools  that they're using.  It's so insane.  The things that they're doing.  I never miss Steve Jobs.  I thought to myself, he's a man I never met.  I don't need him, but I miss him so much because it's so ridiculous.  The stupid stuff they're doing.  And if you wanted my grandma to have a MacBook Pro, then maybe you shouldn't charge $3,000  for it.  You stupid doofus.  I don't need it.  And it makes me so mad because I need a new computer.  And I'm going to have to go back to Microsoft because they're the only ones I hear.  Can I tell you something?  Did you see that sexy 28 inch tablet that you can roll down and scroll down and write  on with?  Where is Apple's innovation?  Y'all ain't got no magic.  Y'all ain't got no courage.  I'm going to stop yelling because people get mad because I yell on the show.  But I hate it so much.  It makes me so mad.

Start time: 537.34
End time: 583.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a real story because apparently it's very expensive to get a Buddhist monk for  your memorial service.  Monk delivery service from a temple is about $830.  A funeral could be as much as $8,500.  So Amazon has jumped in to this market with cut-rate Buddhist monks.  So it's not that you're renting up.  The name of the service is Mr. Monk Delivery.  Is there a Mrs. Monk Delivery?  No, there are no Mrs. Monks.  Apparently this is a big moneymaker for Japanese Buddhist temples.  The Japanese Buddhist Association is up in arms.  But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  When the government breaks a lock and they're doing it in the physical world, that is one lock.  It's constrained by the...  Even if you want to take an example of a golden key.  If you want the TSA luggage, rouhaha.  Now luggage has to have a TSA approved lock, which can be unlocked by a particular set of  keys that only the TSA has.  And then someone stupidly took a picture of it and put it on Twitter.  And now you can 3D print the key that can unlock basically all the luggage in the world.  It's a great example of the problem with golden keys that they do leak.  And when they do leak, then now everyone has access to every single luggage lock in the  world was weakened immediately, all at the same time.  The difference is you still have to get the key and go to every piece of luggage and unlock it  one by one by one by one.  There's a physical constraint on what can be done with a golden key.  The real danger with a digital golden key and this idea that there...  The only way you can fulfill this law, the only way is that Apple has or Google or WhatsApp  or any service, Amazon.  And again, this applies to basically every single company that has anything over the  internet, period.  That every single company has to retain a key that can undo their encryption.  But the difference is when and if that key leaks and these things do leak.  And again, you don't design for the best case, you design for the worst case.  So you presume what happens if this key leaks.  If this key leaks, not only is every single piece of software and every service and everything  that that touches immediately vulnerable, but it's vulnerable in a way that can be taken  of advantage of immediately and at scale because that's how digital works.  Like some bad guy in some Eastern European company or Russia or China or in the US or  wherever it may be can immediately compromise and take advantage of that weakness in a matter  of minutes.  And that's very different than having to go to every single piece of luggage in the airport  and lock them one by one.  The degree of risk is massively, massively greater.  And you put that in an equation where figure out who has the most to lose, who has the  most to keep secure.  If you did a census of every single country and every single citizen and every single  company in the world, who has the most to lose?  And if you put this in a ledger and you weigh it out and you balance it out, it comes out  that the United States has the most to lose of any single country in the world.  And instituting an environment where the you're hoping you're basically your security  rests on hoping that stuff doesn't leak or doesn't get out, which the history of everything  shows never persists and over the arc of time will get out.  That's what happens.  And that's why you design security for the worst case.  You don't design it for the best case.  So when if that happens, who will be decimated?  It will be us.  It will be the US.  And that's the argument that we need to win on, not calling the idiots even though they  are.

Start time: 919.11
End time: 926.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  It's it's it is tremendously satisfying to call these people wankers, but you're right.  I know.  It advanced the conversation in any way, shape or form.

Transcript:  You baited him into it.  You made him do it.  I would love, though, to ask Senator Feinstein, what do you know, what's your thinking here?  Now, remember, these two are ranking members of the Intelligence Committee.  Maybe they know something, you know, maybe they and they probably do have a good reason  to be very worried and think that, well, you really need to do something about this.

Start time: 952.02
End time: 964.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they're being told by the intelligence agencies that they are  going dark and, you know, but we seem to forget that before smartphones,  we did have a pretty good record of catching criminals.  You know, it wasn't what we do before phones.

Start time: 964.22
End time: 965.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 965.22
End time: 1011.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  You know, I mean, we've had encryption now for decent encryption for decades and we're  still catching criminals.  There are still stupid people out there.  It's just it's that mindset that this will make law enforcement's life easier.  Therefore, we should do it and we should ignore the consequences.  And as you say, Ben, the consequences of this are absolutely huge.  If the government's OPM department can't keep its senior fingerprints and securities  clearances safe, if Microsoft can lose its source code, if Google can suffer serious  outages, you know, I mean, there is no way to keep an escrow system key safe.  And if you're going to introduce a deliberate flaw into the encryption, China, Russia,  malware writers will do a Manhattan project to find out what that is and to exploit it.

Start time: 1012.26
End time: 1024.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Just to be clear, you can design a golden key that cannot be discovered.  I mean, it's a like the problem is the golden key can and will leak or can will be discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Actually, that is one thing Google mentioned that I think is terrible.  You know, they've got their own now Amazon Echo clone.  It'll be out the Google Hello someday in the not too distant future.  Home rather.  Aloe home.  And one of the things I think somebody said, I think was Google.  I envision a day where you have a bunch of these on your mantle and you're talking to  no, that is not the day I envision.  I do not want that.  I want one thing.  I talked to that one thing.  It talks to everything else.  That's what we want.  I want Scarlett Johansson and her.

Start time: 1056.72
End time: 1080.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah.  The other problem with the Aloe idea is that you're inserting an agent into like one on one  conversations.  That was one of their demos where you're like, hey, to your it would answer for you.  Yeah.  Or you would bring it in to schedule your dinner reservations or something.  And I saw that and I thought, no, no, no, no, no.  When I have a conversation with one other person, I do not want to bot in between.  Maybe though.

Start time: 1081.20
End time: 1113.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wait a minute, though.  Maybe there's people that you, you know, bug you and you could just say, okay, Aloe.  Talk to the bot.  You don't even tell them you say Aloe handles because you know, inbox has this great auto  answer thing.  I've been using that more and more.  It looks at the email.  It learns how you respond to things and it's it's uncanny.  It comes up with responses.  I actually use almost all the time.  A lot of times I'll write more, but if Aloe's like that, I can only imagine that my wife  and I started discussion and then it ends up Aloe's talking to itself.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Magic calendar.  Just I've scheduled something for you.  I'm telling you Skynet.  It's coming.  Facebook, of course, working on AI as well.  I think Facebook and Google do have an advantage in that we've already given them so much of our  personal information that they at least know my name.  Siri is a little of a disadvantage there.  Facebook is starting to do digital vision, artificial intelligence.  Both Facebook and Google have open sourced a lot of the code that they're using,  hoping that others will work with their code and start improving it.  This is kind of the benefit of open source.  The disadvantage is you're giving away company secrets.  The advantage is if you've got cool stuff like a TensorFlow from Google,  people will start using that and then we'll all benefit.  Worried about Skynet?  Are we getting closer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing that the security people ding Aloe for is that you have to go into secret mode  as opposed to just having everything being encrypted.  At least you have a secret mode.  It's good that they've got one.  By default, it's not secret.

Start time: 1292.70
End time: 1315.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Why are you trying to find out what my dinner is?  No, it's true.  It's just I think the idea there is that then out of habit, you always do your things unencrypted.  And therefore, there's always been that argument back in the days of everybody doing PGP email  that you should encrypt everything or HTTPS instead of HTTP on the web.  If you encrypt everything, then everybody's happy.

Transcript:  And it's not a red flag to the NSA saying you must be up to no good because you just turned on encryption.  Yeah, I use PGP.  I sign everything.  And if somebody sends me their keys, then by default, our conversation will be encrypted,  thereby making sure that every conversation will be in the NSA database.  I don't know.  You know what?  Who cares?  Because it's just as dopey a conversation under the encryption as it would be if it weren't unencrypted.  So one of the tough things for us to deal with this year on Twitter was politics.  We aren't a political show.  We're a technology show.  But there has been all year long kind of an intersection of tech and politics.  This was shortly after the election.  We had Lauren Hawkinson and Alex Wilhelm on along with Mike Elgin.  And frankly, I had just had enough.  This was my response to Trump's latest tweet.

Transcript:  Stop because this is the second conversation we can have,  which is what a Trump administration will look like to tech.  My reluctance to get into that is it's an unknown.  And we can say what he said in the campaign.  I think he's already backpedaling on some things.  In many cases, he's said inconsistent things about a lot of things, H-1B visas.  I'm not sure what his policy is because it's not written on his website.  And his public statements have been inconsistent.  I mean, the guy was a Democrat three years ago.  We don't really know what is going to happen.  Of course, one hopes that the most misogynistic racist things  that he said and encouraged were inappropriate rhetoric that he will abandon.  But we don't know.  And so what I'd like to do, and maybe that's wrong,  but what I'd like to do is defer judgment until such time as  he says what his policy is on the FCC.

End time: 1613.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_28

You can't debate something he might do.  You can't.  There's nothing to debate.  I think it would be a good thing if he stopped AT&T, Time Warner.  I think it would be a bad thing if he appointed somebody in the FCC who would overturn  the net neutrality.  We can say that, but we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  He hasn't done it yet.  Let's talk about what has happened.  This is a complete shift, and I hope you don't mind about this.  In 2008, eight years ago, I wrote a column that flatly...  I'd come to the conclusion that social media determines elections.  At that time, President Obama was running for office, and I said,  he's got more juice on social media.  He's going to win, and he won.  And then every major election since then, I've looked at the social media,  number of followers, the amount of engagement, etc.  And in 100% of the cases in major elections, whoever has the most  juice on social media wins.  And clearly...  This one wasn't even close.  Wasn't even close.

Start time: 1694.16
End time: 1735.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think it's simplistic to say it's that thing or another thing.  You can also say he was very good at getting mainstream media  to cover him because he was so good for ratings,  and they got billions of dollars in free television coverage.  You could also say...  You could say a lot of things.  Reality TV.  Yeah.  I don't think we should oversimplify...  I'd see a lot of this.  Well, it's all Comey's fault, or it's all Bernie's fault.  Right.  And you know what?  It's a lot of things.  And I don't know if anybody will ever know what was the reason.  It could well be that Hillary Clinton was just not likeable enough.  Well, we've had eight years of a Democrat.  It's time for a Republican, which, by the way, happens with regularity.  I don't know what it is.

End time: 1841.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're going to New York.  So there was a good New Yorker article about them.  And Baratunde told me about them.  He says, I don't use Uber anymore  because it's exploitative.  I want to use Juno.  Now Juno is started by the guys who started...  They sold Viber.  They started Viber.  Remember that?  Yeah.  For $900 million.  So the founder, Tom and Marco, said he thought,  well, I could sit around and just enjoy life  or I could take some of that money and start another company.  He looked around and he said,  we could do what Uber is doing better.  Now they're kind of cannibalizing Uber  because they're going after the best Uber drivers.  If your Uber score, your rating on Uber is over...  This is something out of a Black Mirror episode.  If your Uber score is over 4.7 out of 5 stars,  you can apply to drive for Juno.  In other words, if you were one of the best,  they'll steal you away.  Although many drivers do both.

Start time: 1842.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Juno takes 10%.  And what's happening with a lot of Uber drivers  is getting squeezed.  It started out great.  And then Uber takes more and more and more.  I took an Uber the other day.  We were in Florida and I tried to give the guy a tip.  He says, no, the company doesn't let me take tips.  And I said, oh, my friend, you are so wrong.  They don't let you tip within the app like Lyft does.  They pretend that you're getting tipped.  I always assumed Uber was tipping the driver.  And they told drivers you may not ask for a tip  until the driver sued and won.  And now Uber drivers can ask for tips.  I told them, not only are you allowed to take tips,  you can now ask for tips  and don't believe what the Uber guy is telling you.  No.

Start time: 1887.88
End time: 1902.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  I mean, Uber has a long record of treating its drivers  terribly badly.  They're on the record of saying that basically  they're just hanging around until the automated car comes out  and they're just going to dump all these drivers.  So it's a very, it's not a company I choose to patron.

Start time: 1902.96
End time: 1918.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Lyft allows you to tip within the app.  And what I like about that is I'll tip after I get out of the car.  When I'm at the end of a ride,  what I like about Uber and Lyft is I can just get out of the car and leave.  I don't have to fiddle with my wallet.  But I kind of feel bad because I do like to tip if I get good service.  But Lyft lets you do that at any point after the ride.

Start time: 1918.48

So Lyft now lets you schedule.  I actually have Lyft reserved.  I think I'm paying a little extra for that.  But it's a relief to know that a driver will be there at 4.30 in the morning.

Right.  You can talk about, and some do, retraining, teaching people to have skills that are more  in need, but it's very clear with the advance of machine learning, artificial intelligence,  that we're rapidly getting to a situation where even jobs like mine, that one would assume  require human skills, won't be available in the years to come.  So that leaves a very interesting question.  There was an article this week in the Atlantic, a world without work.  This is Derek Thompson writing, and this is an issue that a lot of people are starting to think  about.  Actually, I apologize.  This is a year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16

This is one of those issues that, you know, that you have this, our economy in some ways has never  been more efficient, but it comes, but it's employing fewer people.  And that's the challenge is if you lose another 1% of the workforce, are they going to outlaw  robot trucks?  Probably not.

It's much easier and cheaper to assemble in China.  It's not about labor.

I mean, it's not that these jobs are fleeing to China.  They are going to disappear thanks to automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence.  And that's what this article says.  But the thing that this article wants you to think about is do we even need to work?  And this is why psychologically it's very difficult.  Historically, we associate who we are with what we do.  Without my work, I don't know who I am.  And so psychologically, Marc Andreessen has addressed this, the Netscape billionaire.  He says you don't have to worry about income inequality.  You don't have to worry about job loss because there will be such a surplus thanks to automation.  And machine learning that there will be enough to go around and you actually won't need to work.  That we can all have a basic essentially.  Yeah, that's a bad word.  Well, yeah, the idea and Marcus, if there are problems with basic income, huge problems,  yes, chief of which it replaces other entitlements like medical insurance that won't be covered in  the long run by basic income.  But but let's assume we could fix that discontinuity.  If there is a surplus, maybe in the future we won't need to have jobs,  but we'll have to psychologically adjust who we are.

It's part of the universe there is that Earth is on a basic income at that point.  The idea is you don't have to work just to survive.  But if you want anything more, if you want to buy  Survival's guaranteed.  Clothes that don't come out of a machine and food that doesn't come in cubes,  then you then you choose to work.  And the idea there is that we could all end up being more productive if we can choose what we  want to work on.  And it could lead humanity to interesting places instead of sort of fighting to fighting to do  just enough to survive.  It is also a bit of a utopian vision.

So we had a flood in our house in July and we've had workers here constantly for the last  several months, you know, putting walls in and painting and doing things that cannot be done  currently by machines.  Admittedly, but a lot of money.

Transcript:  Some of the part of the problem is that these jobs may in fact exist, but pay so little  and be so grinding and grueling that they in fact don't raise you above the poverty line.  In fact, the minimum wage in the United States does not raise you above the poverty line.

Transcript:  Right.  But but doing carpentry work in Palo Alto, at least at the guys that we hire, is $75 an hour,  which if you didn't live in Palo Alto, it was a pretty good wage.  I mean, the problem is to live in this area so high.  But I mean, what I'm saying is that there are still jobs out there.  In fact, I think this whole home automation thing that we're in right now, the IoT thing  requires skilled people to know what to buy, to know how to install it, to know how to configure it.  And I do think that there are service jobs that are going to be emerging over the next few years.  They may not last forever, but but there will be some opportunities for people.  And many of these jobs don't require a college education.

Transcript:  Here's from this Atlantic article of last year.  The most common occupations in the US are retail salesperson, cashier,  food and beverage server and office clerk.  These four jobs are about 10 percent of the labor force, 15 and a half million people.  Each, according to an Oxford study, is highly susceptible to automation.  So yes, admittedly, there will be people working.  I'm hoping that podcast show hosts will not be eliminated by automation.  However, even if you have 10 percent of the labor force not working, you have to address this issue.  And I would I would submit that this is a clear future at this point.  So we really need to think about what does that mean?  The FCC is the ultimate lame duck agency at this point.  In a few weeks, January 20th, the new president will get to nominate a new chairman of the FCC.  In fact, Congress has already said to the FCC, don't do anything.

Start time: 2496.02
End time: 2519.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is he is not.  So, yeah, this is so frustrating because this is what everyone said was going to happen when we  allowed zero rating. This is not a surprise to anyone.  Yeah.  And oh, look, it's happening.  And AT&T and Verizon by by ignoring T-Mobile and not going after the first mover, the weakest one.

Start time: 2519.72
End time: 2522.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because T-Mobile started this with their Binjohn program.

Start time: 2523.48
End time: 2527.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Binjohn and zero rating for Spotify and some things, which everyone's like, hey, free Spotify.

Start time: 2528.00
End time: 2578.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We're like, no, this is like this is why it's so hard.  Zero rating is so hard because customers love it.  Right.  What they don't understand.  And it's I feel like I'm preaching at them when I say this is you it's not good for you.  You shouldn't.  I know you're not paying anything for listening to Spotify,  but the problem is the next hot, new, exciting music service is disadvantaged.  You won't listen to them because they cost you bandwidth.  So in effect, you're telling John Ledger and T-Mobile, you guys get to pick who the winners are.  And we don't want T-Mobile to pick who the winners are.  We don't want AT&T to pick who the winners are.  We want the market and consumers to pick who the winners are.  Did I describe that accurately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Part of the problem is the is the term net neutrality is terrible.  Yes.  And I wish we could come up with a better name.  I keep thinking maybe net discrimination or bandwidth discrimination.  Network freedom.  Well, it's for freedom, but it's against discrimination.

Start time: 2599.60
End time: 2626.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yeah, but discrimination.  They took advantage of that word because discrimination in the FCC  sense now means a lot of crazy things.  But on this story, so AT&T with DirecTV, that's their own service.  So they're basically like, oh, you belong to us.  And that's why the FCC went after them.  So with T-Mobile, T-Mobile wasn't being as egregious.  Well, it is.  It's worse.  It's worse today.

Start time: 2627.02
End time: 2646.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It is way worse.  Yes.  But it's not really worse because ultimately the whole problem is picking winners,  whether it's you or somebody else.  And we don't know what deals T-Mobile is making with these companies to get zero rated.  Zero rating is it, by the way, another terrible phrase.  These phrases are chosen to obfuscate the problem.

Start time: 2648.68
End time: 2686.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the people in their marketing departments are great.  AT&T sponsored data.  So with this, I'm just I'm so sad because AT&T, even if the FCC does go,  even if the FCC had the ability to go after them, which I don't think,  given the people who are in Trump's transition team, that's going to happen.  AT&T and Verizon will fight like hell to make sure this goes through.  And they fight the long game.  I mean, the fact that we're still talking about net neutrality.  How long, Om, has it been since we've been doing that neutrality?  Like 2008, 2009?  I mean, before 2005 was the term was invented.

Transcript:  Terms and conditions.  Will they ever cease to amuse?  All right, coming up in just a bit.  One of the most moving moments from this year on a tweet, but first a word about sheets.  I know you probably don't think a lot about your bed linens, but let me tell you,  I bet I can even remind you, you know, that the moment when maybe it's at a hotel,  maybe it's at home and you have a freshly made bed and you've got really nice sheets  and you're tired.  It's been a long day and you, and you crawl into bed and you just,  it may be one of life's greatest pleasures.  It's simple, right?  Just go, oh, that feels so good.  I get that every single night because I have Bolin Branch sheets.  Bolin Branch sheets are 100, I love them.  They are 100% organic cotton and that's one of the reasons.  Sometimes sheets are very, it's almost scratchy, right?  Not with Bolin Branch.  These cotton is super soft and it softens over time.  So you just, ah, you just, you just feel like you're being pillowed by these sheets.  You'll also feel good.  Your conscience will be pillowed.  They use sustainable and responsible methods of sourcing and manufacturing.  And now normally sheets cost, good sheets like this cost a lot of money,  like a thousand dollars in stores, but Bolin Branch sells direct to you.  So there's no markup, there's no middleman.  So you're getting basically what is, what is wholesale price is what the department store  would pay for the best luxury sheets.  Instead of a thousand bucks, it's a couple of hundred bucks.  And a portion of every sale goes to fight human trafficking, which I think is really great.  Just check them out.  Thousands of five-star reviews, ah, articles in Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company,  even three US presidents, we won't say whom,  but even three US presidents sleep on Bolin Branch sheets.  Buying bedding is inconvenient, but they make it easy to order from home  and receive it beautifully packaged.  And when I say beautifully, this is suitable.  The package that I got looked like it was a wedding gift.  If you wanted to give this for wedding, if it would be so welcome  and it comes in a beautiful box with a big satin bow, a ribbon around it.  It's perfectly beautifully wrapped.  And by the way, free shipping, you don't pay extra for the wrapping  and you could try it risk-free for 30 nights.  If you don't like it, send them back for a full refund.  You won't want to send them back.  In fact, within 30 days I was ordering more.  It was like, I want this all the time.  Bolin Branch.  Now the spelling's a little odd.  It's like a cotton bowl.  B-O-L-L.  B-O-L-L, not B-O-W-L.  B-O-L-L and Andy.  You know how to spell that.  Branch.  Bolin Branch.  Get it, it's like a, you know, it's a cotton thing.  BolinBranch.com.  Do use the promo code TWIT and you'll get 50 bucks off your first set of sheets.  BolinBranch.com.  Promo code TWIT.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  I know it's, you probably, I hope you got everything you asked for for Christmas or Hanukkah,  but if you didn't, this is a good gift to yourself  and anybody who happens to join you.  BolinBranch.com slash TWIT.  All right, this is, I mean,  TWIT is a lot of things.  It's always fun, of course.  Always thought-provoking, I think, this show.  And sometimes it's very emotional.  Sometimes we laugh a lot, sometimes we cry.  This is a moving moment from one of our regulars, Owen JJ Stone.  I mentioned him before.  This was a show, a jam-packed show.  Sija Vaidyanathan, Siva Vaidyanathan was there, Jeff Jarvis, Jason Hiner from Tech Republic.  And I think at the last minute we asked Owen to join us  because we were talking about race relations and things got a little heavy.  Oh, doctor, you're my favorite guy.

Transcript:  I want to live in a world where it's okay when she's with her mother to call the police,  but I fear when she's with me.  I've been pulled over 30 times in the last two years and I'm a very quote unquote friendly  speakable guy.  But in the last four years, I've had three of those cops pull guns on me where I had  to deescalate the situation because they were just out of control.  And I fear that if she ever, if something happened to me and she called the cops  and she had fear in her voice, they might show up, see her.  I'm out all the time and people think that I've kidnapped a little white child.  So I wouldn't want a cop to show up and her be upset and think that I'm the aggressor  and something go wrong.  So depending on the situation, she calls her mother or she calls my mother and then  they get to make the decision on whether the police are called or not.  And I don't like living in that world.  I don't like living in that reality.  I just want everybody to be somewhat more responsible and respectable other people's  feelings.  I want black people to live.  I want police to live.  I mean, I can't say blue lives matter more than black lives, but all lives matter.  But right now it's a very dangerous time and I just want people to realize that it's also  a great time.  I'm sitting here with Uncle Leo.  You know, he done sold my inheritance.  I plan on taking over him in the near future when he retires and things will be positive.  My daughter is beautiful and she is healthy and she is driving me crazy.  And those are all good things for me to be happy about.  So even though I'm upset, you still got to be happy.  I just want the world to be a little bit different sometime soon.  Amen.  Yes, man.

Have some cool Apple products hanging out in the background.  You can check out the nice beautiful rose gold, but relatively useless MacBook and just  enjoy.  There'll be music, there'll be bands, there'll be artisans.  You can go there and have a meeting.  There'll be places where you can hang.  This is an area where we can actually deal with community and have Apple products in  the background.  I think it's brilliant marketing and those 42 foot glass doors opening those up so that  it becomes part of it's no longer a store.  It's just an area you can walk in and forget where inside is and outside is.  I think it's great marketing.  That's my thought.

Transcript:  Well, they just had a problem with that out here in Philly  with Philly Jesus went to an Apple store and apparently  he went on there on a day when there was a new manager.  Somebody didn't know what was going on, but he goes in  and charges his phone every day.  He's a homeless guy that walks around dressed like Jesus.  He has a big wooden cross.  Everybody knows him.  He's harmless, but they actually had him arrested,  which did nothing but raise his profile.  And he got to speak to more people about being Philly Jesus.  To your point, I know I was yelling at you,  but I'm kind of joking.  They're doing it all to sell things and to make more money.  Yeah, it's all marketing.  Like I said, they're really great at marketing  and invoking a feeling.  Like I said, if you listen to the way she was talking,  she was pleasant and she was happy and it invigorated emotion.  That's what they do.  And as far as letting homeless people in, they need to,  but I highly doubt they will.  Of course they're not.  I had that incident, my own incident with Apple and Sandy.  Four runner.  Yeah, in LA.  So Apple is, you know, they're going to have to tiptoe around that  because the Philly thing got a lot of buzz out here.  People were upset because again,  it's something that the guy did every day.  And they actually let him go in there and charge his phone.  They didn't do anything about him.  They had to have a time limit or something,  how much time you can spend in the store  if you're not doing something.

I think that it's a nice idea to be able to have a store where it's not unwelcoming  and hopefully it'll be welcoming to everyone.  I doubt that that'll be the case to that.  But yeah, I like the idea of it just being open.  You can just walk in.  You don't have to worry.  It's not going to be one of those stores where you feel like you go in  and everyone's staring at you and you're not, you know, able to enter there  and be able to just chill out.  And I think it'll be great for the brand.  And yeah, they did this for marketing for sure.

So it's already, again, it's just something else to market for them.

Because although I guess you still need Android for a touch device, a phone or actually,  you know, here's what the question is, Clayton.  What's the future for tablets?  My wife was Lisa was asking me this is, well, are they going to still sell tablets?  If you can get Android apps on your Chromebook, what do you need a tablet for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you don't want a keyboard and you don't and you want the touch screen.  You want the portability.  I mean, having a Chromebook is cool and all, but the whole reason tablets are awesome is  because I don't have a keyboard attached to it.  Somebody said I'm going to go.  I take my tablet.  I don't dislodge my laptop.  Even my air.  I got an air sitting right here, too.  Yeah.  I barely even take this thing out anymore unless I'm traveling.  Yeah.

If I have to write, you know, a long email, tap it on glass is just does not do it for me.  And I hate having to carry the tablets like they do have the light ones,  but I liked having a trackpad.  I just want it to be able to do all of it.  I want the touch screen, the keyboard, it all there and to be light and to be able to travel with it.  So now I use my tablet.

Transcript:  Elon Musk.  He has a plan for our future.  Colonizing Mars.  At the International Astronautical,  yes, at the International Astronautical Conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.  He gave a talk.  It was called Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.  And this is his idea for getting to Mars.  SpaceX.  I'm going to break down the specifics because that's basically what Elon did.  It was incredible.  And whenever he does this, when he gets into the nitty gritty  of talking about his absolutely insane plans,  it sort of boggles my mind at how bored he sounds talking about these amazing ideas  and seemingly impossible to execute concepts.  So I will try not to go at it with the same sense of like,  oh, yes, when we go to Mars, boredom.  But let me just try and break this down for you.  So SpaceX would use reusable BFRs.  These are big rockets along with the BFS, big spaceship,  Raptor rockets capable of 680,000 pounds of thrust.  The ship would carry 100 tons of cargo.  Once in orbit, it would be refueled.  Then it takes off from Mars.  He really got down to the nitty gritty in terms of cost.  So right now, he says it would cost about $10 billion per person to send someone to Mars.  His goal is to scale this down, just make it the economies of scale work for him,  targeting $200,000 per person, eventually $100,000.  He's all about reusable parts.  Trips take 100 people at a time.  The spaceship would have movie rooms, cafeterias, entertainment options.  He says it would be a really fun place.  That's his quote, a fun place.  Yeah, I don't know how long you'd have to be on that ship.  That's sort of terrifying.  He's targeting 2022 for these flights.  Public and private organizations are going to help fund the missions,  and a million humans could live on Mars by the 2060s.  Are you guys in?  You going?

I love most of the things he talks about.  But for peace sake, could you just use that big brain and all this money you want to put  into a desert rock planet that doesn't sustain life and fix the planet we got right now?  Can we figure out a way to stop killing all these bees in the ocean so we can have the  planet we got right here for some sustainability?  Can we get $10 billion to just clean up the homeless and give them a job or something  instead of per person to put them on a planet that can't sustain life?  Can we do that, Elon?  I love you so much and I hate the way you manipulate the stock market in my heart.  But shut up about Mars and your little ship that crashes half the time.  That ain't going to be able to land on no...  Just stop it.  We ain't going to Mars.  We ain't going to Mars.  We ain't going to Mars.  Now go ahead and talk about it.

Transcript:  That's a perfect segue to something that I learned last week.  So the same day that Elon announced this,  when I was at this event, Idea Festival last week,  which is an innovation event, but it's like Ted...  Ted cost you like five, $10,000.  This event cost you like 100, 200 bucks.  But it's the same kind of people talking about big ideas.  So the day that Elon was talking his big ideas about Mars,  there was somebody there, one of the candidates for Mars One.  So there's this nonprofit organization called Mars One.  They do a lot of work with...  It's an international-based organization.  They do a lot of work with NASA.  But there's a Mars One candidate.  They've got this down to 100 candidates.  It's this MIT systems analyst named Yari Golden Castiano.  And so she was at Idea Festival talking about the fact.  And I had no idea about this.  I hadn't heard of this, but it was ironically early.  It was that morning.  And then Elon made his presentation that afternoon.  So I knew a lot more about Mars by the time he did it.  So Mars One is this group that they're basically sending  scientists, people who can go and study it.  Because what they found is that we've sent these all of the...  It's not space tourism.  They're trying to get some scientists to go up there  and do the same thing.  And ultimately, Elon's worried about which is  if we trash this planet, what are we going to do?  And so we've sort of reached the limits.  What Mars One posits is that we've reached the limits  of what we can do with robots.  We actually have to send some people there.  But sending them and then getting them back  is the hard thing.  So they want to take a group of 24 people,  interdisciplinary, send them to Mars,  create this colony with these 24 people, these scientists.  And so because of that, they're working on...  So one of the things that Yari is working on  that she talked about, we have a video of this  on Tech Republic.  We got an interview with her afterward.  She's working on this laser-based communication.  Because right now, it takes anywhere from several minutes  to almost an hour to get a communication  from Mars to Earth.  And so this laser-based satellite communication,  basically super high-speed networking,  will send it a lot faster.  But the idea is the stuff...  And she's working on this at MIT.  And with the idea of hoping that she's going to be  one of the candidates on this.  But if not, at least she can develop technology  that's going to help.  And oh, by the way, this technology,  to get at your point, Odakta,  is that this technology could actually help us  here on Earth, too.  And so like a lot of the space technology,  a lot of the stuff that went into the space program  ended up...  Yeah, it was okay, and it did interesting things  for the space program.  But the record of the kind of advances  that they gave to the tech industry is huge.  And so that's the bigger benefit to a lot of this stuff.  I think for Elon's case, he's sort of the showman.  And so his is sort of the P.T. Barnum version  of the Mars story.  But there are other people who are working on this as well.  And it's important not to forget that.  Their goal is they want to send someone to Mars by 2027.  And they are working toward that.  They just narrowed down their 100 candidates.  Next year in 2017, they're going to name the 24 candidates.  And then they're working on working toward this  for over the next decade.

Transcript:  No, I mean, I think eventually.  Yeah, I think eventually I think that  because there is real science happening  and there's real potential for space exploration,  I think we'll get there, sure.  I think not to discount Elon,  because I think that what he's doing is important  just insofar that it gets people paying attention.  It's exciting.  But to Jason's point, he's very much a P.T. Barnum sort of guy.  And I mean, I think making these proclamations like 2022,  like that's so close.  Come on now.  Like, let's be real.  I also really appreciate, I guess,  it's sort of funny to me the way that he kind of phrases this.  He's like, well, you could die on this mission.  So please pay me $500,000 to go on this mission  where you might die.  And I'm not willing to go yet until I know  that someone can take over my company  because this is basically kind of a suicide mission.  And so part of me is kind of I'm intrigued by,  I think what space exploration could do.  But I'm a little bit, I guess, bothered by,  even though I know that fundamentally  what some of the things that Elon Musk wants to do  have broader technology and scientific,  I guess, pursuits at their core.  So much of it does seem to just be about space tourism,  which to me, it's kind of bothersome  because the last thing that at least that I want  in the way it's already kind of seeming like  how it's being sold now is this is kind of being sold  like the modern era of climbing Mount Everest  where it's just rich people who like pay $100,000  and go and climb the mountain because they can.  And this is going to be a thing  where people who are rich enough to go to Mars will go  versus people who are actually looking at  discovering other systems and what's habitable  and what's not and discovering technologies  that might have pursuits other places.  I don't know.  The whole thing is kind of like I'm also,  his whole description of Mars,  all I can think about is the movie Wall-E and be like,  yeah, you're okay.  So we're just all gonna be on this other planet  sitting in stasis, not moving around,  just eating and watching TV.

Transcript:  The chat room says the best place on Mars is,  it was the best place on Mars is worse  than the worst place on earth.  And Elon described, not only is the trip there  on this massive ship gonna be fun  because there'll be movie theaters,  according to Elon, because they have movie theaters  on my plane to New York that I take every couple of weeks.  That's not so much fun.  But anyways, he also said it would be a lot of fun on Mars  because the gravity is low.  But one thing that struck me,  and I kind of feel like a dummy that I didn't,  I'm sure everyone else has thought of this before,  but it really struck me in his talk how,  when we think about all of the space exploration  and all of the technology innovations  that came out of that when we did this through NASA  and the moonshot and how those spawned so many businesses  and so much entrepreneurship and innovation  as those engineers spun out of the government programs  and started their own companies.  But that now it's privatized from the start here with Elon.  And so you've got, he was talking about on the ship  once it's launched and it's en route to Mars  that the solar arrays will deploy.  And I thought, of course, solar, Elon, solar city.  Then, of course, that'll be putting itself,  it'll be storing energy into batteries,  which will be a part of everything he's doing with Tesla.  Then there's just all the engines  that he's gonna be innovating,  that he's doing obviously now with SpaceX,  but there's gotta be a crossover with Hyperloop  or with Tesla and realizing that all of this innovation  and privatization of innovation is gonna be in one,  it's a publicly traded company, but in one company's auspices  and they will own all of that.  And that kind of was, it just dawned on me, wow,  all these pieces fit together.  His brain is really big.

Because I mean, you're pointing out,  he's obviously seeing all these puzzles  and how it works for him.  But I mean, but something like, I think that the travel  to another planet should be about bigger  than just one public company, one private enterprise.

I'm not gonna fight you guys in court anymore.  He seems like a decent enough guy  when he's not being an insane sociopath.  I'm just saying, you told me  that we can run the whole world on solar.  We know that, but guess what?  Human beings can't get together  to go take some land out in North Dakota,  build a solar farm and give everybody free electricity.  We can't do that.  And guess what? Hyperloop?  I haven't seen it.  We got a test track that's probably scrambling eggs  and small chickens brains somewhere out in the desert.

So this like dystopian space phobic didn't want  to even pay attention.  Somehow Elon talking about it and making it sound so boring  and so doable, even in his delusional mind,  I will totally give you that, oh, doctor.  But logical delusional.  Maybe that's too contradictory to be real.  But Jason, what do you think?  Is there a logical insanity here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about Elon is Elon is,  in the truest sense of the word, it gets overused.  He's a true visionary.  Like the guy like dreams in, he sits around daydreaming  and wishes he didn't have to eat.  He talked about the fact that how much he liked the idea  of something like Soylent because then he could take all  this like whatever, 43 minutes a day that it takes  to eat meals and get rid of that and put it  in a more productive time like dreaming about Mars, right?  And solar power and all of these kinds of things.  And so I think that Elon sets these super aggressive goals.  His companies never get there.  But on the way to trying to get there,  they get to things faster than other companies, right?  Tesla's way far ahead in battery technology,  way far ahead in electric vehicles.  They're way far ahead in a lot of these things  because he sets these like crazy, stupid, aggressive goals  that we're going to accomplish this massively hard thing  by this time.  And that's what leaders do, right?  Leaders push, leaders reach, leaders get you to get more  out of you than you thought was possible.  And so I agree with everybody on the panel.  Like 2022, yeah, it's not happening.  Like it is not happening.  2027, this other Mars, one group,  maybe Elon falls somewhere in there.  Like I said, it sounds very PT Barnum to me.  It sounds maybe 20 years off.  But I think that I can't remember somebody said the fact  about how passionate he was talking about this  even compared to some of the other things,  you Becky, even compared to some of the other stuff he does  where he is reasonably passionate.  I think this is the thing that gets him up in the morning.  I think this like this whole Mars thing.  And I'll give you, Owen, the fact that there's some bigger  problems I wish he would spend his time focusing on  because the guy does have some serious brain power.

If you don't know anything about the coral reefs,  it affects the fishing community.  The fish community impacts the people on land  and the food industry because chickens and all that,  they eat fish meal, but you don't understand  how much fish is in it.  And we get, hey, you know, Elon Musk, come out  and tell me you're going to solve that problem in 10 years.  And I'll strip butt naked and run through these streets  not that anybody wants to see it.  But I'd be so happy and proud just like you told me  that we can take this small patch of land and power the world.  Like, I understand about vision.  I got a lot of vision.  I got a vision of a machine that I can sit in  and just lose weight and not do anything.  It just like melts off the fat.  I can envision it.  It ain't going to happen.  It sounds like it's a cool thing.  By 2027, I could be 150 pounds.  It's just saying that he just thinks the fun stuff  doesn't make it a vision.  He sounds like a little kid sometimes.  He gets all hyped up on this stuff.  And he moves mountains with his words.  If he told you he liked cookie dough,  the stock market would triple within the next half hour  after a tweet.  The man's got too much power.  Fix the planet first before you start going to a red desert  with nothing on it.  I'm not going to yell about it anymore.  It just makes me really upset.

Transcript:  We have had so many great people on this show.  And I want to thank Becky Worley for filling in for me  when I was on vacation.  One of the nice things about the friends and family  that Twitt has gathered around it is that when I take vacation,  I know we're going to have a great fill-in.  And Becky is one of our absolute favorites.  She'll be back, I promise you.  Our show today, we're going to have some fun with the...  I don't want to give it all away,  but some more stuff coming up in just a second.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  On New Year's Day, you're probably not planning  on doing much cooking.  You might be planning on relaxing.  But when it's time to get back in the kitchen,  you'll be very glad to see that blue apron box  sitting there waiting for you.  Problem with cooking, I love to cook.  And I like to make healthy, nutritious,  delicious meals for my family.  But at the end of a long workday,  the last thing you probably want to do is plan a meal,  go shopping, buy the ingredients,  go home, cook them and serve it.  Blue Apron takes half of that work out  and makes the rest of it lots of fun.  See, what you do is you go to blueapron.com,  you look at their menu plan for the week,  you pick some meals,  then they come to you in a refrigerated box,  fresh, never frozen, even the meat and fish,  with a recipe card, exactly the ingredients you need  to make that recipe, no more, no less.  They have plans for couples.  In fact, if you're single, it's great too,  because you make a dinner  and you got a lunch the next day.  They also have a plan for families  and those have more kid-friendly ingredients.  But in every case, it's something delicious,  something you will be amazed you made.  You'll be so proud serving it.  Your kids, your lovers, your friends will go,  wow, you can really cook.  And you'll just go, yeah,  you don't have to say it's blue apron.  Yeah, I'm pretty good.  I'm getting better.  Blue apron, look at the menu,  steak and green peppercorn sauce  with kale and roasted potato.  I hate doing these, my mouth starts watering.  Cod and papayote with frika.  I don't know what that is.  And spinach, that's another thing I like about blue apron.  I learn new ingredients all the time.  And then I can go in the store and say,  yeah, I need some of that frika there.  That was good last time.  I don't know what it is even now.  I haven't used it yet.  I'll use it this week.  Potato and artichoke quiche with romaine and orange salad.  Blue apron, my friends.  I'm going to get, trust me, you're going to love it,  but I'm going to get you first three meals free.  That way you can really appreciate it.  Go to blueapron.com slash twit.  First three meals free, free shipping.  And I'm sorry, they don't deliver to Hawaii or Alaska.  It's at 99% of the continental United States.  And that's because they want it to come fresh, right?  So, but just check it out.  I'm sure it's available in your area.  The best ingredients, fresh, delicious from 150 local farms,  fisheries and ranchers across the United States.  And by the way, it costs less than if you did it yourself.  Less work and less money.  A grocery store would be about 60% more for the same food.  And the reason is blue apron doesn't have a store,  doesn't have a warehouse, doesn't have brick and mortar.  You don't have to worry about waste or spoilage.  So they really can save you money.  And what a meal.  I think of it as cooking up some love for my family.  You will too.  blueapron.com slash twit.  Blue apron is a better way to cook.  We thank them so much for their support all year long this week in tech.  Oh, it just kept getting worse this year for Yahoo!  Worse and worse and worse.  Steven Levy, Georgia Dow and Steve Kovac joined me just a couple of weeks ago to talk about  the latest bit of bad news for Marissa Meyer and Company Watch.  It's just one thing after another with Yahoo! isn't it?  Now they say that one...  And I think it's a story just because of the number.  One billion user accounts have been breached.  This happened a few years ago.  Remember that, of course, earlier Yahoo! had revealed that  half a billion accounts have been breached in a separate hack.  At this point, you got to wonder, is Verizon going to go through with the deal?  What happens to Yahoo! next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_29
Transcript:  We had AOL CEO Tim Armstrong who's kind of helping spearhead that deal at our conference  a week and a half ago now.  This was before the disclosure of the hack.  And we asked my colleague, Ask him point blank, put a number on this.  What's the percentage chance that this happens?  And he wouldn't do that, but he's like, I'm cautiously optimistic that  the deal is going to go through.  A week later, this happened.  So it's either going to be a discount.  You got to think they still want Yahoo!  Well, they asked for a billion off.

Start time: 5453.10
End time: 5487.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They already... Verizon already asked for a billion off for the first hack.  And actually, what's really important is what did Marissa Meyer know and when did she know it?  Did she hide this material information from Verizon and other suitors when they were  selling the company?  And there's some evidence that she did on the 2014 hack.  This billion account hack happened a year earlier.  So it would stretch credulity to think that Marissa Meyer did not know about this billion  account hack from 2013.

And it says, oh, the hackers aren't in our network anymore.  So they say.  I don't know.  What do you think?  If Verizon pulls out, maybe they'll just ask for another billion off.

But here is Robert Scoble wearing the new Snapchat spectacles.  Don't you love it?  If you don't know about Snapchat, yeah, you can take it off the screen, please.  There's multiples of this photo by the way.  I love the fact that the producers here are just so quick to get something off the screen  that's just absolutely abhorrent.  Okay.  Here we go.  I think we just had to put the explicit on the iTunes for this show.  So let's watch the video here and I think we can talk over it.  As people know, I don't know, four or five years ago, Snapchat bought a promising company  that was making video sunglasses.  It was an Indiegogo and a Kickstarter.  It was one of these kludgy hardware projects that you figured,  ah, they're never going to deliver it.  I believe they did deliver their product.  Never shipped it.  They never shipped it?

The way the product works is, if you press a button on the corner,  it lights up an LED circle for 10 seconds, records whatever you see,  and posts it automatically to your Snapchat.  You never have to take your phone out of your pocket.  You never have to authenticate or whatever it is.  And critically, and I think that this is the big difference,  Google Glass resulted in many people getting punched in the face,  beat up, or many arguments and fights started because...  There was three or four.  Okay, whatever.  There's three or four that were well documented.  One by a woman who I think was trying...

And then she would do it in a bar in San Francisco,  which by the way,  I don't think you want to go into a bar in San Francisco or anywhere.  And then especially a dive bar,  then go up to somebody who's drunk and say,  can I record you?  We're not even asked to start recording them.

Where right now somebody is choosing who to focus the cameras on.  It's a shot.  And probably we're on air for five seconds or 10 seconds, right?  While we're talking.  And in Snapchat, that's what you're doing.  You're capturing videos in a small segment.  It builds a narrative about your day.  And you can actually grab the day and store it to your phone  or share it out on other places like Facebook or YouTube, right?

Because I was in the Sahara tent at Coachella and everybody's recording on their phones.  Well, you know.  But there was two guys in front of me.  One talked to the other and said, I need to get away from the Google Glass people.  I wasn't wearing it because I didn't wear it then.  There was two people behind me who had Google Glass on.  So I grabbed these two guys and said, what makes you nervous about this?  You're in a place where everybody's recording.  You're on camera, for sure.  And they said, it just makes me feel bad.  Two reasons I pulled out of them.  One, there's a screen between them that they can't see and they can't renegotiate the social contract  that we have with each other.  If you start playing with Facebook right now in the middle of the show, I'd snap your hand.  Why are you doing that when there's something more important to pay attention to?  And the second thing is they felt that the person who had them on had information about them  that they didn't have about the people that had them on.

That's the better way to do it.  We'll set the line and then make a bet.  Who wants to set the line?  Total units sold.  To explain what it is.  Over or under.  We're going to do over or under.

When I go to Coachella, when Thomas Hawk and I went to Coachella and shot people with big cameras,  the millennials came up and danced for us.  They want their picture taken.

Double GoPro sales in 2018.  Of traditional GoPro cameras.  If GoPro comes out with one of these, I can't say that.  That's like a GoPro anyway.  For sure it will outsell GoPro.  What do you think, Brian?  Where would you set the line?  And the number that will be sold in 2018?

I actually like this angle where if I was thinking about getting a GoPro,  which could cost hundreds of dollars or more, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to get these instead.  But it's only 8 or 10 seconds.  It's not the whole three hours of my mountain climb.  Right?  GoPro sold $1.6 billion in 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Okay, so here's the feature that's missing from this that I thought.  I had just written about it last week because I heard this was coming.  The piece that's missing is it's not a DVR.  And what this really should be is it should always be recording.  I know this will get people punched in the face, but really where this is going,  and I think this will probably happen by 2020.  And I would fund a startup to do this because it's inevitable anyway.  So I'm not going to make a judgment call on it.  But if it's a DVR and at any point in time I can press it and go back on the last hour,  find that clip, right?  And boom.  So I don't have to press it.  I say, wow, that was a funny moment.  Now I'm pressing it.

Start time: 6229.24
End time: 6237.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  No, this is like my wife says it all the time.  If we could just go back five seconds, that thing you said, you say you didn't say.  Yeah.  And like this is like divorce product not happening.  Really?

Start time: 6238.36
End time: 6251.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I didn't say that.  I know.  Yeah, exactly.  I never said that.  My wife is going to wear it.  I know.  I know.  I'm going to wear it while I'm on Snapchat.  Take your glasses off.  Nobody's marrying you, Ben.  I'm not going to wear it while I'm on a date.

Start time: 6251.42
End time: 6260.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  But here's the other thing.  I think you're going to see a big load on 2017.  And it's going to be less, a little bit less than 2018 because it's a two,  every other year kind of product.

Start time: 6261.16
End time: 6289.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The thing we're all missing is there's some real technology in this product.  There's two lenses.  There's a reason for that because with two lenses, you can do a computer on the diff  and you can build a point cloud, a volumetric point cloud.  So I can capture you in three dimensions for VR and AR.  And the algorithms that they're developing for AR, putting things on your face,  are getting really advanced for 2D.  Wait until they do it in 3D.

Start time: 6290.36
End time: 6338.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's fairly clear that this is a step, a very pragmatic step towards augmented reality.  Correct?  Yeah.  I think we all agree on that.  Screens are just too expensive.  The screens are very expensive.  So if people get addicted to this, then I believe the second feature that's missing,  that would be pretty neat after the life DVR, I'll call it the life DVR,  is over people's head, putting their last snap, if you're friends,  who your friends in common are.  In other words, when you walk through the world, you go to a party,  you don't know who you know.  And you don't know who you've met before.  And you may not remember who their wife or their husband is or their kid's names are  or who they dated in your social circle.  You're going to actually have all that information floating on top of people's heads.  And that would really, really, really benefit Snapchat.  They can do a lot more than Bokeh.

Start time: 6339.04
End time: 6363.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  People in the chat room are asking, what does this mean that you can do?  If you have depth information, you can turn this entire world into Minecraft, for instance.  And all of a sudden, Ben is a Minecraft character over there.  And the whole world is bricks, right?  And that helps me make better content.  Most people suck at content.  Most people just know how to do a selfie or a little picture at Yosemite or something.

Start time: 6363.84
End time: 6367.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  They don't know how to frame the shot.  They don't know how to blur the background.  They don't know how to tell a story.

End time: 6390.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I read a lot of Snapchats and look at a lot of Snapchats.  I look at a lot of people's behavior on Twitter and Facebook to understand them.  Most people suck at content.  And this augmented reality stuff that they're doing on the face  helps you tell a better story about yourself.  It makes you more interesting.  It's funny to look at the feed and see Ben Parr wearing drag.  You know, by the way, by the way, I ended up getting those Snapchat spectacles.

Start time: 6399.52
End time: 6609.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And you know what?  They're actually pretty cool.  I actually really like them.  I've been snapping.  And the funny thing is I have two kids, you know, 24 and 22, Henry and Abby.  And I told Abby, she's the 24 year old.  Hey, I just got the Snapchat spectacle.  She said, what are those?  I said, Snapchat.  She said, oh yeah, I'm too old for that.  And then my son, Henry, I thought, well, I know he snaps.  And I said, did you see that?  Look at this.  Look at this.  Your dad's not such an old man after all.  I said, what's that, dad?  Spectacles.  He had no idea.  The last, if you're a parent, you know this, the last person you'll ever impress is your own kids.  Never.  In a bit, we're going to say farewell to our old studios.  Oh, but first I want to thank, I think one of the biggest blessings moving to our new  Eastside studio is our internet here.  Do you know we have 10 gigabit symmetric internet access?  In this studio so fast that I can't even use it on most of my computers because the best  they can do is one gigabit.  It's and it's from the best internet service provider in the country.  And I say that with absolute confidence.  Sonic Net.  I've been a Sonic Net customer for more than a decade.  I've known Dane Jasper, the founder for longer than that even.  I've interviewed him many times.  He's, I consider him a friend.  And when we said we're moving, Jane said, well, you really ought to have the best internet  as it just so happens.  You're in a Sonic neighborhood, man.  If you're in a Sonic neighborhood, get Sonic.  Sonic is an EFF five star rated ISP.  They protect their users.  They don't have bandwidth caps.  They fight any attempt by the government or anybody else to get your private information.  They're the good guys and you will love the price of what you can get.  Now I know it's not everywhere, but Sonic, I think this is important because Sonic is  the best internet service provider in the world.  But Sonic, I think this is important because Sonic is showing you can do this,  set a standard for internet access so that others around the country can see it and appreciate  it and do it.  So even if you can't get Sonic, and I'm sorry if you can't, you should be thrilled that  they're around.  Here's what you get.  I almost, I'm embarrassed even to tell you this because it's just going to make you unhappy.  Sonic's mission to bring internet freedom to all with unlimited, uncapped internet  residential or business fiber to the premise, not to the curb, but into the premise,  gigabit connectivity.  Now it's for San Francisco, California, the North Bay area of California, the East Bay  area, but they are expanding.  So go to sonic.com, S-O-N-I-C dot com slash twit and check, see if it's available.  Because here's what you get.  This is one account, 15 email accounts, a gigabyte of personal storage,  personal web hosting with a new domain.  You get fax line service.  You get a home phone connection.  This is all one price.  There's no add-ons to this home phone connection with unlimited local and long distance calling.  And by the way, you can port your number.  So if you have an existing number, you can bring it right over to Sonic.  Download speeds of up to a thousand megabits per second, a gigabit.  And man, you have not lived until you have a gigabit with no caps, no caps.

Let's see here.  Where did I end?  Would I end with we did the Yahoo?  We did the downfall of the Mac, the AirPod.  Oh, the Snapchat.  Now I know where we are.  I think, you know, it was five years ago, uh, 2011 that we moved into the brick house  at great expense.  And thanks to all of you who bought bricks to help that with that expense, we spent a  million and a quarter dollars to build the brick house studios.  Little did we know that the landlord would kick us out five years later so they could  put a brew pub in there.  Well, the good news for us is we found a new spot.  East side studios.  We love it.  Here's our farewell to the old and ringing in the new.  This I'm sad to say is the last twit we'll be doing in this studio.  I'm glad you all this great studio audience could be here for this.  We will next week be doing the very first show.  There's some question about that since apparently there's an electrical issue, but  we may be in the dark, but yeah, it might be outdoors.

Formerly at the Brickhouse Studios, now here in our new studios.  It's a little rough if you're just tuning in.  I've got to tell you, the engineers were up all night.  They've been up for several days, frankly, money of them,  wiring and moving stuff over because I was mean.  I was cruel.  I said, I don't want to miss any shows.  I want to go as best we can, as we did the last time,  from broadcasting at the Brickhouse to here at the Eastside Studios.  And you know what?  To their credit, they made it happen.  So a tip of the hat, John Slanina, to Alex Gumpel, to Russell Tammany,  and to our engineering director, Bruce Chesim, to you, Patrick Delahanty,  to all the people who work so hard behind the scenes to make this possible.

Father Robert Balasare, the digital Jesuit.  He's on loan from God, but we're glad to have him.  And I don't know if God ever wants you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Brian Burnett was going to be on this table.  He's also one of our hosts.  But he very kindly agreed to bow out because this apparently when they designed the table,  they said, Leo, who's the most number of people?  You would ever want to have on this show.  I said, we would never want more than five people on this show.  And of course, the very first show we do here, I wanted to have six people.  And John said, you said five.  So Brian, thank you.  We love you, Brian.  We'll get you on a tweet real soon.  Thanks also to Alex Lindsay.  Appreciate the 360 degree.  That's awesome.  The wonderful gift.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I hope people watch it.

Transcript:  And of course, my good friend, Jason Howell.  Always a pleasure to have you host of TNT and all about Android.  Thanks to all the people who came out today.  It's been really great.  Thanks to all of you at home who've put up with the disruption.  I hope it hasn't been too bad.  We plan on continuing all of our shows from our new Eastside studios.  You can come and watch us.  Email tickets at twit.tv.  Watch live 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC every Sunday afternoon.  Or get your show on demand audio and video of all of our shows available at our website,  twit.tv or wherever you get your podcasts.  Subscribe and make sure you get every single episode.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Thanks for joining us.  Another twit.  I'll say it one more time.  It's in the can.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Incidentally, just so you know, the new studios are the rents half as much.  The power bill is half as much.  We have all the set.  We lost one set, which we never used anywhere, this guy set.  This set's the same.  My office is actually better.  And the staff is happier because in the old set, they used to have to be quiet.  Now they can talk and be loud down the hall.  So anyway, we're in the brick house now.  And thanks to everybody.  The bricks, by the way, came with us from the old studio.  And we still haven't figured out where we're going to put them.  But I think we're going to put them on the wall outside.  We still have an open studio that we invite you to come by and visit.  You can visit your brick.  You can visit the studio.  Just email tickets at twit.tv.  All right.  Let's wrap things up now with Kurt Wagner of Ricoh, Jason Snell of Six Colors,  and my old friend.  We knew her as Callie Lewis, Luria Petrucci, with a great discussion of live video.  I'm really intrigued by this Facebook live thing.  I think we're going to talk a lot about video today.  Facebook launched, and again, I don't know if this is only on my app.  So you guys can confirm this.  My app has changed a lot.  This is the Facebook app.  And this is, you'll like this, Luria.  Now, in addition to news feed and people, there's a new video button that if I touch that,  it shows video.  Facebook is all in.  Well, look at that.  You're right there.

Start time: 7287.08
End time: 7292.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Facebook is all in on video to the point where they're surfacing it as an equal to the news feed.

Start time: 7292.67
End time: 7309.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out recently and said, I mean, at the FA conference,  he was talking about how important live video is to them.  And they're freaking killing it in the live streaming space.  Leo, you've been doing live streaming for years.  You do it kind of on a more-

Start time: 7316.15
End time: 7333.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But with mobile live streaming, I mean, they're really doing a whole lot in that space.  And so we wanted to make sure that we were kind of in that and killing it in that space as well.  So we actually figured out how to use a live stream HD 550 studio box.

Start time: 7333.56
End time: 7358.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So that's my question, because I know how to do this because, you know, it has a go live  button right here and I can just go live from my phone.  And yeah, that's actually interesting because that's also been  around in this, but it was a little harder to find.  If you wanted to post to Facebook, you'd have to tap what's on your mind and then scroll down.  And then you'd see the go live.  In fact, for a while, I didn't even think this was in the Facebook for Android version, but now-

Start time: 7358.18
End time: 7360.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That just was released like two days ago.

Start time: 7360.47
End time: 7365.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  But now, and they've really, because of this video button.  And so everybody has this video button now.  You have it, Jason?  No.  No.

Start time: 7367.54
End time: 7371.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're rolling it out, I believe.  I think they announced it a few weeks ago, right before F8.

Start time: 7373.23
End time: 7396.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And then-  Probably slow rollout.  Tell me, Kirk, if you have this, because on the bottom of my Facebook, this is new too,  I have categories.  So I have newsfeed, but I also have world and US news, funny.  There's a whole bunch of subject matter and I can even turn it on or off with the settings button.  I'm thinking I must be in some sort of beta test of this.  Sorry, it's so bright.  I should turn my screen brightness down.

Start time: 7397.90
End time: 7415.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're getting this, not necessarily something that's totally, totally new.  I know that people have written about that a few months ago.  But at the same time, I don't have that.  A lot of people I've seen have not had it.  So I do think you're one of the lucky few.  They somehow picked you.  I don't know if I feel so lucky.  To test all of these news.

Start time: 7416.08
End time: 7432.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's interesting though, because what it really tells me,  both this scroll bar at the bottom and the new video category at the top,  is that Facebook wants to be a media company, not a social network.  Right, Kurt?  Is that fair to say?

Start time: 7433.50
End time: 7500.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that they want to do a lot of stuff.  And if you were at F8, you could see that ultimately,  the one thing I will give Facebook is that they really stay true to that mission,  which is about connecting people.  And it sounds a little corny.  It sounds a little cliche.  But everything that they do, right?  The fact that they're trying to set up Wi-Fi enabled cities,  they're going to test something in San Jose, California around that.  The fact that they have internet beaming drones,  it's all about getting people onto the internet,  and therefore connecting them with the different apps that they have.  I think the way that they keep you coming back  is through the media and entertainment part of it, right?  Because I'm only going to log on to Facebook if I'm exchanging a message,  or if I have a comment on something that I posted.  The reason I open the app every single day,  even when I don't have those things happening,  is because there's great videos, and there's great stories,  and all these other things that I read.  I don't know if they would describe themselves as a media company,  but they've married media and communication in a way that hardly,  I don't think anyone else has really done.  I think Snapchat's trying to do it, but that's about it.

Start time: 7501.28
End time: 7555.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll add on to that, Kurt.  Those are very good points.  Because of their ad platform and how prominent that is,  how much money they make off of it, that's a big deal for them.  They have to keep that attention coming back over and over and over  in order to make sure that people continue to have effectiveness with those ads.  Of course, they're putting so much effort into people who use that.  You almost can't necessarily be effective if you don't use it,  which is kind of a negative.  But if you have high engagement, you can kind of get over that.  I saw somebody in the chat room, I'm sorry I missed your name,  a minute ago, who said they're focusing on celebrities.  And they always start with celebrities.  Then they always kind of roll it out to the masses.

Start time: 7555.68
End time: 7561.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Facebook Live is for everybody now.  It's not just for less celebrities.  Well, they're paying.  But they are paying some people.

Start time: 7561.62
End time: 7615.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're paying celebrities, and they're paying some media partners too.  That's something that, as far as I know,  Twitter and Periscope have never been willing to do.  And I think you're going to assume certain things.  Okay, Facebook's now paying for this.  Eventually, they're going to want to pull that back  and figure out another way because you can't afford to pay people for content forever.  But at the same time, you look at all the people  who are broadcasting on Facebook Live in the last three months,  it wasn't even a thing.  We didn't even talk about this at the turn of the year.  January 1st.  Now every single publisher and every single media property around  is going live on a regular basis.  So it's working.  The problem is, okay, now can they transition from,  hey, we've been paying you all along,  to we want you to do this because you want to do it,  not because we're giving you money.  And so they're going to have to figure out a way to monetize it  in a way that keeps that incentive high.

Start time: 7616.04
End time: 7625.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Facebook's not paying you, Callie, right?  This is a platform for you.  But I wonder, do you worry about going all in as you have on Facebook?  Because it's not your platform.

Start time: 7628.90
End time: 7645.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  You never want to go all in on somebody else's platform.  It is risky.  I mean, you can if you have a strategy behind you  to get people on to your own platform, right?  And that's the way we use it.

Start time: 7645.88
End time: 7648.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're using it as a way to promote what you're doing elsewhere.

Start time: 7649.88
End time: 7675.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not fully.  I mean, yes.  So we have that strategy in place  and we always drive traffic to our own properties.  So from a business perspective,  you have to think about that kind of thing.  From a content perspective,  you don't get our content live unless you are there live on Facebook.  We do release that content later.  Well, it stays on Facebook, right?

Start time: 7675.88
End time: 7689.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, people can now see it.  If you're in my feed, I missed the first show,  but I can see it because it's in my feed.  Jason, you're a content creator as much as anybody.  Would you consider creating a Facebook-specific show live on Facebook?

Start time: 7690.08
End time: 7706.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I think you have to consider the power of Facebook  and its ability to reach an audience.  But at the same time, I also think a lot of video producers  are already dealing with a major platform  that is taking up a lot of their oxygen, which is YouTube, right?  But it's different because YouTube, you create a show

Start time: 7707.00
End time: 7731.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  and then you put it on YouTube.  YouTube is a distribution medium for you.  This is why I might disagree with you, Kurt.  I think Facebook does want to be a media company.  I understand that their business is broader than that,  but when you see them paying people,  I think they want to incent people to...  They want to be the place you go for information,  for entertainment, for everything.

Start time: 7731.84
End time: 7734.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  They want to be the platform for internet content for all their users.

Start time: 7734.56
End time: 7749.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And in fact, we know most people now get their news on Facebook.  You said a couple of things that were provocative, I thought, Kurt.  One is that Facebook can't keep paying them.  Why not?

Start time: 7750.96
End time: 7799.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't think that it's sustainable.  They got lots of money, don't they?  Sure. I guess perhaps sustainable is wrong.  You're right. They could continue to pay.  I don't think it's good business.  I think what they're going to be inspired to do or driven to do is say,  okay, now that you've gotten on the platform,  you're comfortable with how this works.  You've seen the audience that we can drive because we're Facebook.  We should talk about the algorithm too,  because that's a whole other thing that I think Facebook has.  YouTube does some of that,  but I think this is Facebook's bread and butter, right?  Is that they can basically show you what they want to show you.  Let's set that aside for a second.  But you get these publishers comfortable going live on Facebook,  and then you say, all right, how can we both make money here  so that we're not losing money on this content project, if you will?

Start time: 7802.24
End time: 7808.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They already said that they're going to start paying producers for that content,  but it's not all that bad.

Start time: 7809.62
End time: 7810.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they're doing now.

Start time: 7811.28
End time: 7819.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, but revenue split for all users as opposed to just paying celebrities.  You know what I mean?

Start time: 7819.58
End time: 7824.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Revenue splits difference.  That's what YouTube does, right?  We're going to put ads on it,  and you get some of that money and we'll get the rest of it.

Start time: 7825.90
End time: 7828.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what Facebook will ultimately do.  That's what they want to do too.  Yeah.

Start time: 7830.39
End time: 7856.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's okay.  So that might be the distinction between a media company and a social media company,  because if you're CBS, you pay people to make content to put on CBS  that you could put ads around.  And CBS can't go to Louis C.K. and say,  we'll do a revs share with you.  We'll put some ads on there and we'll give you 5%.  That's not how it works.  Is that amazing?  Is it a media company if you do that?  Is YouTube a media company?  I don't know.  Yeah.

Start time: 7857.24
End time: 7882.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We may be splitting hairs a little bit or at least identifying how confusing this whole thing is.  But I think the slight or subtle difference that I think about is  traditionally Facebook has preached that it's a platform, right?  It is not the one creating any of this.  Yes, it may be at this point even paying CNN,  but it is not coming out and saying we're going to create a new show.  They don't want to be Netflix.

Start time: 7882.72
End time: 7883.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They don't want to create originals.

Start time: 7884.60
End time: 7920.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they want to host as much great content as they can  because that's where they can sell advertising.  But I don't think that they want to be seen as,  even though we all, again, the algorithm, they choose what we see.  They don't want us to think that they choose what we see.  They want us to think that everything in our newsfeed is there because  it's tailored towards us and there's an almighty algorithm that picks this for us.  Facebook is in control of all that and it's very easy to forget that they have  essentially a say in what succeeds and what fails on Facebook.  Right now, they want live video to succeed and that's why it's doing so well.

Twitch, the first show we started doing in 2005.  We're entering our 12th year this year.  And with more viewers, more listeners, your support has been fantastic.  Every year it's been growing and I'm just very grateful, personally,  and I think I could speak on behalf of our team.  It was also growing quite a bit.  When I started Twitch, it was just me.  I was about 25 people who work here.  And we couldn't do without you and your support and  your listening and your support of our advertisers.  So thank you very much.  I hope you've enjoyed this year or last year, I guess now it is, isn't it?  I hope you enjoy the new 2017.  I promise you lots of great shows all over the network and right here every Sunday afternoon,  3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC for this week in tech.  We'll have a brand new show for you January 8th.  I hope you'll stop by and say hi one week from today.  Thanks for being here.  And now I guess I have to say it for the 595th time,  6th, good, because 5th makes no sense, but the 596th time, another twit is in the can.  Happy New Year.  We'll see you soon.
