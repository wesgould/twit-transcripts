Start time: 307.92
End time: 330.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  LeBron James. No, it depends. What's great about this is that it allows us to cover everything  from technology to pop culture to politics. So it's not just pop culture.  Yeah, no, no, no. It's saying that, you know, our conversations today, if you look at everyone's  streams, they're not one sided. We all talk about different things. We can just as easily talk about  serious Syria and the revolution as we might talk about an internet meme. Well, I like the way you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mashing it up. Taliban retaliates. Ashton Kutcher on Two and a Half Men. That's our daily while you  were sleeping blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 389.76
End time: 415.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  legacy that CBS News has and they continue to have. I've been there for the past two years as  the first ever video blogger really covering digital trends, internet culture and where that  intersects with the news. And so for me, you know, I love blogging and video blogging, but I'm a  broadcast geek. So I would always think and wrap my head around, could we create more of a show  around these types of topics? Do you think that this is CBS's way of dipping a toe in the water?

Start time: 416.16
End time: 418.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How experimental does it feel? You can be honest here. They're not watching.

Start time: 418.82
End time: 465.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honestly, they've been an amazing partner. I think they do trust what we're bringing to the table.  It was never like, we want to do this and you're the right person. I actually created the show.  And so I said, I'm already here. Why don't we do this together? And so that's, I think, what  people need to realize. And, you know, we are very much an incubator. They've been completely  supportive. They realize this is very much, you know, an experiment and we're all trying to figure  it out, which allows us to also change as we continue. I think it's smart.  Yeah. And, you know, we have our team. We're not in a news bureau. We are, you know, we have a loft.  Our studio is, you know, it's different. It doesn't feel like it's in a typical newsroom.  Everyone working on the show is under, you know, 35. Not that it's an age thing. It's more of a

Start time: 465.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mentality thing. And you're on top of it. Look, here's the story. Election 2012. Is this the year  social media adopters reign supreme? And you got a picture of Newt Gingrich and two days later,  Newt Gingrich announces he's running for president on Twitter. On Twitter.

End time: 496.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We knew, we knew that. No, I mean, the fact is that we're all in the trenches of these  conversations that might not get to mainstream media or the news cycle. You know, it gets to  the news cycle a few days later. And who's the audience though? You know, we, we don't, we don't

Start time: 497.46

Start time: 501.60
End time: 516.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, don't you think that technology these days, some of the tech is kind of mainstream  because it's just all coming together? I don't know. Is it?  I do believe, I don't think it's, I mean, it is a niche. Obviously there are people,  there's always going to be niches. There's always going to be people that are the experts.

Start time: 516.84
End time: 524.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all we're talking about. I like the niche. I just don't trust companies like CBS,  frankly, in the long run to do a good job with technology.

If you go to bricks.twit.tv, you can find out about it. There's the plug.  But a number of people have said, oh, can I just send you a brick? I don't want to buy one of yours.  I just want to send you a brick. That's what I'm going to do.  And I think they're unclear on the concept. This is not about because we need bricks.  I'm going to send you a brick. We don't have a brick shortage and  you're buying bricks because we've run out of bricks.

Start time: 838.68
End time: 858.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The industrial design is really nice. It's beautiful. Yeah. I'm not crazy about honeycomb.  I think honeycomb is a good start. I think it's kind of like Android, which started out really  rough. And even now Android and phones, I think needs one or two major revisions. But I think  honeycomb is actually a better start in terms of having a decent user interface. They do lack apps.

Start time: 858.36
End time: 883.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are a handful of apps like this. This is the IMDB app that does try to use the 16 by 9  interface. And I think it does a fairly good job. Although...  I have a honeycomb phone.  You do? Your Nexus S is honeycomb based?  Yeah. Oh, I understand.  They're going to do a merged Android tablet slash phone OS called Ice Cream Sandwich.  That's the next generation.

Transcript:  So the first one was...  It's the first one.  It was Froyo, I know.  There was Eclair, Froyo. Before Eclair, there was... What was D?  Donut?  Donut, that's right.  Donut.  What was C?  Cupcake.  Cupcake.  And B?  Cupcake.  We've got an Android developer in here, that's why.  He doesn't remember B and A is new.  It was, I think there was a B. I think it started with Cupcake. That was on the G1,  which I still have. They've come a long way in two and a half years from that G1.  I mean, the G1 was really a clunker. And I have to say, I've talked about it before,  so I won't belabor it, but the G2X, which is a Tegra 2 base, just like this tablet,  I have to say these are nice phones. I wish the battery life were better.  And that's one thing that this Samsung gets, because it's a bigger form factor than the iPad.  I think it's got better battery life. I've been getting great...  It's got a bigger battery.  Yeah. I've been getting great battery life.  But they just need more apps, and I think there's a little polish missing.  You'd agree, right, Harry?

End time: 998.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is not so great at polish so far. I mean,  Honeycomb feels a little bit more like a computer than the iPad does.  And I think they need to make that into an advantage.  There are people who want something that has like an ambitious status system to tell you all the  stuff that's going on and multitasking windows. But I do think that Honeycomb is already a step  ahead of Gingerbread in terms of being well thought out.

Transcript:  Yeah. They hired the guy who did WebOS for Palm.  Which was quite nice.  Yeah.  Which is the only other mobile operating system that has really competed with  Apple at all in terms of polish. And I think you can see that in Honeycomb. It is better.  There's still this basic question. When do you recommend to somebody they buy a tablet  other than the iPad? I don't think we're there yet.

Start time: 1025.18
End time: 1065.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so. And I asked that question to myself because of course on the radio show,  I'm talking to normal users and I have to decide, do I say it's time to think of something besides  the iPad? And I still have come to the conclusion, not yet. And I don't know if it'll happen this  year, but I'm always gratified to see a company compete with Apple because competition is good.  It's going to give us some choices, keeps the prices down, keeps Apple on its toes.  I think it's unfortunate that Apple has chose to litigate against companies like Samsung  instead of just making a better product.  But I'm an Android fan actually. I think that it just seems more progressive than the iPhone  and I love the choice that I get. What are you looking at me like that for?

Somebody pointed this out that I stepped on your line.  Oh, it's okay.  But I think this is because you've been kicked out of the Apple press list and this is just,  you're just showing your bigotry on the show to just because you hate Apple,  but even though all the products you use are generally apples.

And then never again will Apple even talk to me.  Wow.  That's fine. I don't care. I mean, I really... it's fine with me.  In fact, I don't like talking to... I'm sure, Harry, you have kind of the same feeling.  I don't like to get in bed with these guys. I don't want to know them  because I'm afraid if I like them, I might say... I might be biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google's doing something interesting. When they see a cut, they get the album art.  They kind of add the meta tags. And I guess they're seeing these as three different albums,  even though it's cuts from the same album. But I think that that's kind of cool because  they've done a taxonomy on it. I uploaded 6,000 songs. It took me about three days.  One advantage they have over Amazon is Amazon's limited to 20 gigabytes unless you buy more.  Google for free is giving you 20,000 titles. That's considerably more storage.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I think this is 50 or 60 gigs worth of music on here.  That's amazing.  Is that your collection?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question. And I agree with Harry. I think this is kind of half of a product.  This is great. I mean, I don't have to upload this stuff to my phone.  If I play it, it kind of caches a copy so I can be offline and listen to some of my music.  But it's a pain to upload. It took me a long time to upload all the songs.

Transcript:  It's actually uploading the song.  And so I don't know. I think if Apple comes out with a similar product,  even the Amazon product is in some way superior.  Although, if you're an Android fan, once this is available,  it's still currently in limited beta, but once it's available to everybody,  if they don't charge for it, they haven't said,  it sure is a great way to get music on a phone or a tablet without,  you know, it's on everything.  I mean, it's on my phone too, without doing anything.  I don't have to make any special effort to get it on the phone.  It's just there.

Although there's a hack out that lets you watch it on other phones.  Netflix said they weren't going to be on Android  because they couldn't solve the DRM issues.  Hollywood wouldn't let them.  I think it's big news for Android users.  And Netflix, I love this.  Netflix CEO Reed Hastings says that Internet service providers  kill Web freedom and suck all profits.

Remember, the House prevented the FCC from implementing net neutrality rules.  He also sent a letter to Secretary General of the Canadian Radio and Television Communications  and Telecommunications Commission, the CRTC.  Canada recently allowed wireless operators to impose higher wholesale costs for ISPs.  They're notorious for bandwidth shaping for all kinds of net neutrality.

I'm talking about incremental.  You have to buy the routers.  Once I'm hooked, okay, I've got my Comcast thing, right?  Right.  So I just got a new router.  I got a new DOCSIS 3.  I'm getting 35 because I got the low-end packages, 35 megabits.  Right.  So now I'm told, well, you can just pay the extra money and you can get the-  The 100 is already on the-  Right.

The fact of the matter is these big studios have more money and they have more talent  and they have people who know what they're doing.  And then, yeah, you can throw it over to somebody at Netflix, a bunch of ex-tech tech TV guys.

They're having a whole battle over salaries with actors saying that they want the writer  to kill off actors because they want more creative control.  And then it allows someone like a Netflix saying, no, we respect the creator.  We want to pay you for what it's worth and we'll give you the platform to do it.  So it becomes like the new HBO.

Like, you can't wait five minutes.  But I figured the first thing that'll happen with the microwave  is one of your kids will put a cat in the thing,  and you'll be responsible for pushing the button that kills it.

End time: 3733.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said, I did not violate any ethics rules because I didn't know they were going to  give me a job till mid-April.  And if you believe that...  She said, not once in my entire tenure as a commissioner had anyone at Comcast or NBC  approached me about potential employment.  I have not only complied with the legal and ethical laws, but I've also gone further.  I have not participated or voted any item, not just those related to Comcast or NBC,  since entering discussions about an offer of potential employment.  So she got the job offer and she stopped working as FCC commissioner.  She has signed Obama's ethics pledge, which means she's banned from lobbying the FCC  and its officials through the rest of his administration.  But she can start lobbying Congress right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that's probably true.  What do you think about that?  Do you think it's a bad thing that Comcast now owns NBC?  I mean, these poor guys, they got to do something with their time and money.  It sure gets NBC out of...  The general electric connection to NBC has always bothered me more than somebody like Comcast.  I wasn't thrilled about that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate to see...  Well, you know what this reminds me of?  In the early days of the motion picture industry, the movie companies owned theaters.  And in fact, were broken...  And distribution companies.  It was totally vertical.  It was totally vertical, much like, say, Apple.  And they were broken up.  The courts broke them up saying that is monopolistic because you control not only the movies,  but you control where they're shown.  And I think this is exactly...  Is it not?  I mean, the difference is they had a monopoly on movie theaters.  Comcast doesn't have a...  Well, maybe they do, though.

Start time: 3810.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks to U-Verse and Fios and these other things, you do have more choices now.  So maybe that lets them off the hook.  We'll see.  I hate to see that, though.  And the problem is really that because Comcast is my internet service provider at home,  they have a strong, now a stronger and stronger interest to keep me from watching,  you know, Netflix and Hulu.  Using their cheap data bandwidth instead of paying for premium services.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room asked why I have an objection to GE owning NBC.  And geez, I mean, GE is a giant corporation.  You're never going to see any news that you say one of their jet engines has some problem.  You're not going to see a report on it.  You're not going to see a report on anything.  And the worst part about these big companies, you have one company owning one network,  another big company owning another.  One company won't report on the other company's bad acting  because they're worried about retribution.  It's just you don't want the large corporations owning the media.  It's ridiculous.

Start time: 3892.12
End time: 3902.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyways, the problem is the money isn't in the media,  even though we need it to continue.  And so the only ways to maintain it is to have these big corporations buy it or invest into it.

Transcript:  So a lot of people are saying it's interesting how it's not about someone owning you because  you did it on your own, which is so true.  Exactly.  You still need support.  But you still need support whether it be a sponsor or an investor of some sort.

But my point is I think we need independent media.  I think it's a shame when you see these big conglomerates,  GE or Comcast, own the media.  I think independent media, independent journalism is really important.  I agree.

Start time: 4067.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we tried that.  I won't name names, but there were two big media companies a couple of years ago that  we talked to.  And these guys are so clueless.  They're so stupid.  They ran me around.  They ran me ragged.  And at the end, they go, ah, no, no, no.  We don't understand what you're doing.  They're suits.  They're dummies.  They're nitwits.  Yeah.  So I've learned my lesson.  I wouldn't waste my time.  Crawling with them.  Wouldn't waste my time with them.  But it's not about me.  I'm just, I don't want to make it about me, but I just want to say that I think we need  independent media.  And I think that we have the means now thanks to the internet, thanks to YouTube,  for true independent media.  So let Comcast, let the cable town buy NBC.  Let them enjoy it.  But they're all dinosaurs.  So you've been watching the cable town.  I think there's more truth to that than me.  I love it when these 30 Rock guys skewer their parent company.

I mean, you, you, because you get a ton of traffic when no agenda's on.  Never.

The thing I love about this is every Squarespace site is unique.  You couldn't say, oh, is this right?  No.  It doesn't look like John.  Wait a minute.  Let's, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Supposedly something that's just kind of a small bump rather than any kind of big leap forward.  I've also heard it might have a larger screen, which to me sounds like a relatively big deal.

Start time: 4751.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be shocked.  But how much bigger?

Start time: 4754.66
End time: 4762.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a little bit.  I think the theory is the case is still the same size,  but they expand the screen a little bit.  So it still fits in the case you have.  A smaller bezel.

Start time: 4763.50
End time: 4775.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, there's no...  You know what?  They don't care about case manufacturers.  In fact, one of the ways this is leaking out is that we're seeing new case designs,  which is how we heard about the iPad 2's features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is traditional Apple where they're a little bit slow,  a little bit behind the curve.  Remember the first iPhone wasn't even 3G.  It was 2G.  And they didn't do a 3G till the next generation.  They still don't have 4G.  But I wonder if this is going to backfire on them because already we're seeing Verizon,  AT&T, and even T-Mobile, which doesn't even really have a 4G network,  putting out phones branded with 4G.

Start time: 4812.52
End time: 4831.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What it might have is it might have AT&T's current 4G, which is not really 4G.  It's just faster 3G.  But that would be nice.  But I think that's smart to wait on actual LTE just because battery life is such a huge issue  with the first chipsets for any new network.

Well, that's going.  That's old school.  You know, yeah.  If I'm away from my phone really hard, sometimes with the iPhone, and I need to upgrade,  I'm saying I will.

In fact, it might look a little bit better than the iPad.  Of course, it's a littler screen, but it's an OLED screen.  It's beautiful.  Really beautiful.  I'm hearing rumors or not rumors, but I'm hearing from people in New York City.  This is why I asked you with Verizon 4G who are getting 20 megabits down pretty consistently.  I don't know what you'd do with a phone in 20 megabits down, but that sure sounds sexy.  I don't know why.  I just think that's...  I mean, what can you really...  Would you really need more than a few megabits a second on a smartphone?

You know who made money?  eBay.  That's amazing, isn't it?  They paid 1.7 billion for Skype.  They paid way too much for it.

In any event, it turns out Meg made a pretty darn good deal.  They doubled their money because they still have 30% of Skype.  Right, and they still have a piece of it.  They had 30%.  They made...  What is 30%?  It's like 2.5 billion.  They made a billion bucks.  It's a way to do it.  Unbelievable.  So, Harry, what's your theory?

Transcript:  Well, nobody is ever going to be excited  about any large acquisition Microsoft makes.  The initial response is always going to be doom and gloom  and the proof is going to be in the pudding.  I mean, I don't quite see how it's worth $8.5 billion, though,  except as a defensive move.

Start time: 5182.08
End time: 5199.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, I guess in a way that's a measure of the maturity of the industry.  That companies like Twitter can spend $40 million on TweetDeck  to keep it out of the hands...  Just to keep it out of the hands of Uber Media  or that Microsoft can spend $8.5 billion on Skype  just to keep it out of the hands of Google.

Start time: 5200.72
End time: 5211.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we are talking about Microsoft here.  I mean, $8.5 billion for them is chump change.  If this thing...  You know, if they have to write the entire thing off eventually,  it's not going to be a disaster for them.  They'll still be okay.
