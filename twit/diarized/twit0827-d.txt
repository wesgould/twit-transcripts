Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm here.  I'm getting I'm getting a full studio.  Am I creeping you out?  It's been like a year and a half since I've been here.  Something like that. It's good.  Good to make the drive. So nice.

Transcript:  Well, you just down the road.  Yeah, I know.  But there was like this invisible barrier preventing your visitation.  So we're glad to see you.  It's good to be here.  Also here, managing editor of Tom's Guide.  First time on the show, but I'm thrilled to have Philip Michaels here.

Start time: 200.32
End time: 245.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you mean this is the outcast table?  The one I usually sit at?  Yeah.  So I'm going to...  The people that Craig FaceTime's...  Elephant in the Room time.  Apple.  Well, it's funny because John Prosser was absolutely adamant.  Apple rumor monger.  There will be new Mac laptops on Monday.  He's already shaved his eyebrows.  I don't know what else he can shave, but love to dream Monday morning  before the keynote said no new hardware.  So it was like a battle of the rumor mills and I love to dream one.  There was no new hardware.  But then something interesting happened.  Apple posted the keynote on YouTube.  And among the tags, M1X and MacBook Pro M1X.

Transcript:  Are they are they messing with us?  Are they messing with us?

Start time: 251.34
End time: 271.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're trolling.  So who does those tags, first of all?  Do we know?  Is it some...  Is it somebody he called well?  Is it somebody...  No, it's not Jaws.  We know that for sure.  It's some guy, some peon, right?  Someone in the marketing department.  Sure.  Why would they have put those tags in?  They must have thought at the time...

Start time: 271.22
End time: 274.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got a new book on SEO and they're just itching to try it out.

Start time: 275.68
End time: 317.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's entirely possible that at some point they thought that those  products might ship at WWDC or at least be announced.  Talking to developers, Pro Max, the developers love Pro Laptops.  But not only is it a...  It would have to be a brand new chip.  They've only done the M1 for Apple Silicon.  So are they ready for that?  And there have been so many supply chain constraints across the whole tech  industry, and they said specifically that the Mac has been constrained.  That like, is it surprising that perhaps a lot of companies are not able to ship  these products when they want?  We will never know probably whether they were really planning.  It would have been a good time, but I'm not surprised they didn't have...

Start time: 317.08
End time: 326.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steven Hackett on Six Colors, your blog, said 65 percent, he did the math, very  enterprising of him, 65 percent of WWDCs have announced new hardware.

Start time: 326.70
End time: 338.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the last 20 years and in the last 10, it's about 50-50.  So it's the people who say there's never hardware at WWDC, that's not accurate.  It's sort of a...  I'd say these days it's a 50-50 shot.  But what happened?  Did somebody...

Start time: 340.84
End time: 347.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's very puzzling to me because this is a pretty well-run company.  Somebody forget to send a memo down to the basement that we didn't...

Start time: 348.38
End time: 351.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or to John Pachowski, right?  So that Buzzfeed could say don't expect any new hardware.

Start time: 351.78
End time: 383.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't release the laptop, so take those tags out.  They obviously did the tags before the keynote.  Sure.  Right.  So, and by the way, the last keynote, Alex Lindsay, who has an eye for this on Mac  Break Weekly, said there were two edit, jump cut edit points, which I think were  something that was snipped out, that they had...  It was in, because they didn't have time to do those fancy transitions they did everywhere else.  I didn't think to look for jump cuts in this keynote.  But I think it's credible at this point that they had something in there.  Remember, this is all pre-recorded.

Start time: 384.42
End time: 390.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they cut it out.  And it was 15 minutes shorter than two hours, Leo.  That's the other big conspiracy theory.  You can go all the way to the end of the hour.

Start time: 390.88
End time: 420.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Apple cuts things at the last minute from its keynote all the time.  I remember that one Macworld Expo keynote in New York, I want to say 2002, was one of  the last ones there.  It felt very brief.  And apparently they had cut something at the last second.  So I wouldn't be surprised if they were pushing it right to the moment when they thought that  they could have the hardware and have a ship date and then just decided, no, we can't  include that.

Start time: 420.68
End time: 426.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very possible.  In fact, a lot of people predicted that they would announce it and say, but you won't be  able to order it till August or September.

Start time: 426.58
End time: 468.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it would be entirely possible that what they want to do is they want to have  a limited amount of time before the pre-orders and then a limited amount of time before it  ships.  And they've been playing a little bit more loosely with that and saying, OK, maybe it's  three weeks and maybe it's four weeks after that.  But they want a timetable.  And I think if you're Apple and you're looking at, even if you're already making them, but  you're having supply problems and you realize you're never going to be able to fulfill  demand, maybe you just say, well, let's wait.  Our developer conference gets enough focus.  Literally, Apple doesn't need hardware in order to make people pay attention to them.  And they can always call another event and do another event, especially now when they  just have to play a video on the internet and that's all they have to do.

Start time: 468.90
End time: 470.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It almost lends itself to that kind of thing.

Start time: 470.98
End time: 482.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a moment where I think it was Craig Federighi mentioned something and said, we'll  have more on this later.  There was this weird forward promotion of something.  And I thought at the time, oh, well, that's because there's going to be hardware later.

Start time: 483.74
End time: 486.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we did, too.  We were sitting there saying, oh boy.  No.

Start time: 487.94
End time: 489.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So much expectational debt.

Start time: 490.00
End time: 497.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And honestly, that's the problem I have because I told a lot of people do not buy anything.  You know, Apple's going to announce something in June.

Start time: 498.06
End time: 526.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We always do that.  Like never buy before an Apple.  Just standing wisdom is no matter what you might want to buy.  If it's like a couple of weeks from an Apple event, just on the off chance.  And especially now, to your point, they are fine with leading edge silicon because they  just bought all of the five nanometer process that that is.  But the trailing edge silicon, all the big stuff like the controller chips and everything  that their suppliers are using, those are horribly constrained.  And if you can't get like one old chip to make the whole new laptop work, then  it could just be a little display controller chip.

Start time: 526.22
End time: 544.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, or Bluetooth or Thunderbolt or like what did Tim Cook call them?  Legacy nodes.  The idea, which is a term of art that I had not heard before, but it's the idea that there's  old crap that they still put on their computers.  And that's the stuff that's in short supply.  The stuff that everybody is using.  Apple's got it locked down when it's stuff that just Apple is using.

Start time: 544.36
End time: 553.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you if we were able to see the secret top secret Apple roadmap for Apple silicon,  this would be a lot dead now.  We'd be dead.

Start time: 554.06
End time: 558.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One tattooed on Johnny Saruji's back.  Right.  We'd be shredded.  Even he can't see it.  We'd all be locked in Canada.

Start time: 559.04
End time: 568.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but it would be perfectly sensible that this would be the time you'd release those  kind of.  And by the way, I like the name M1X.  That makes a lot of sense.  That follows the naming convention.

Start time: 568.70
End time: 573.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One year anniversary of the announcement of Apple silicon to be the perfect time to show  off something big and flashy.

Start time: 573.52
End time: 601.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, you want to get laptops out right about now.  People make buying decisions for the fall for school.  Right.  So it wasn't at all a leap to think that Apple might announce them here.  And it's also because of chip shortages and covid not at all surprising that they  couldn't.  But now what happens?  Does this push the whole roadmap back?  Do they announce a lot of stuff in September?  They're not going to do anything in July and August.  Right.  That's the dog days of summer.  You don't announce anything.

Start time: 601.52
End time: 612.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  But if they're redesigns, they wouldn't.  Like if they're not redesigns, Apple just drops Mac whenever they feel like it.  They've done it in July.  They've done it in August.  They've done it in November.  But these are supposed to be redesigns and they need like they want to strut.

Start time: 613.18
End time: 630.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they could do August.  And if that's what ends up happening, then great.  Or even July.  But it's more likely that, yeah, they'll they'll make it into a fall thing.  And remember how many events they did in the fall last year?  I mean, we could be headed for something like that again.  Yeah.  So nothing.  So it's like a Disney plus show.

Start time: 630.38
End time: 631.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably done for the summer.

Start time: 632.18
End time: 658.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, if they want to get it out in three weeks, they could.  I mean, they could do it at any point.  I think maybe we overthink this a little bit.  Like literally, if Apple gets enough that they can put it on sale and it's brand new  MacBook Pros, people are going to love that Apple Silicon MacBook Pros.  They're going to be really excited.  They're going to sell a bunch of them.  Nobody's buying the existing MacBook Pros now.  Right.  Because everybody who would buy a pro laptop knows what's coming, which is Apple  Silicon versions of those.

Start time: 658.12
End time: 660.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another reason why you're in a hurry.  So, yeah.

Start time: 660.60
End time: 675.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So on one level, you'd be like, you don't want to do the Osborne effect by pre  announcing it, but like they kind of did the Osborne effect already by saying  they're going to transition away from Intel.  So at this point, you know, if, if you feel confident, you could start selling  them late July or sometime in August.  Maybe you do.

Start time: 676.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  My nephew is a graphic design artist, just graduated from the Rhode Island School  of Design.  Congratulations, Will.  Very talented.  Congratulations.  Going to his first internship, his first job, probably.  He needs a new laptop.  He's got the 2015 MacBook Pro.  I got him when he went into high school.  My mom and I were going to buy him this 16 inch.  His future employer or at least intern guy said, oh, you really want a  Radeon 9,500 MX.  I said, no, you don't because that means you'd be buying the Intel i9 MacBook 16.  Or do you?  I think that's dated information.  Is it, can we assume that  That's what I'm using right now.  Well, it's yeah.  And we have plenty of them.  I have, there's one across the hall.  I gave mine to my son who's using it for video editing for his TikToks.  That is right now the fastest MacBook, I guess.  Although with Adobe coming out with native M1 software.  It's the biggest MacBook.  We can say it safely.  It's the biggest.  Will the graphics capabilities of the M1X rival that of the discreet graphics of the  top of the line MacBook Intel?  Well, keep in mind, we don't actually know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like we don't know exactly what that chip.  Wouldn't Apple have to aim for that though?  But yeah, I think so.  I think that they're going to want to have a lot of GPU cores in there.  And then the question is just how well does Apple's graphics performance scale  when they increase the number of cores, right?  If they go from four to eight or eight to six cores, right?  If they go from four to eight or eight to 16, what does that mean?  And the rumors are that it could be quite impressive, but it's their first take on it.  So we don't really know.  I don't know.

Start time: 775.46
End time: 785.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Adobe with the WWDC stuff because they were talking about ray tracing on Apple.  In general, they were talking very philosophically about ray tracing and other high end  graphic functions in some of the sessions.

Start time: 785.44
End time: 791.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of implying that.  Yeah, don't worry.  You're going to be covered.  I mean, I don't think they're going to do an eGPU that'll run.

Start time: 791.28
End time: 796.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine this on twice the cores, four times the cores.  Just imagine.  You know, don't think about it too much, but imagine.  Yeah.

Start time: 798.24
End time: 851.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are this I'm sure Apple didn't want to do this, but there are as a result of this,  there's there's a whole bunch of unanswered kind of things floating in the air.  But I think we're going to have to wait till the fall.  However, I don't want that to overshadow the fact that they announced a lot of really good,  interesting stuff.  That was a very jam packed hour and 45 minutes.  I joked last week, we can't even cover or I guess it was on Mac Break Weekly.  We can't even cover in our two and a half hour podcast everything Apple talked about  in an hour, 45 minutes.  It was a jam packed episode.  I or a keynote.  I don't really even know where to start on this.  So let me do this with each of you.  I'll start with you, Renee.  What what were the I'll give you two.  I was going to say, what's the most important thing Apple announced?  But what are the couple or three, if you need to things that Apple announced on Monday that you  think are important?

Start time: 852.40
End time: 899.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, just personally, my favorites are, you know, and beyond the accessibility stuff that we  saw come out before WBC, but just the privacy stuff, the way they continue to push forward,  much to Facebook chagrin, things like divulging all the URLs of every app that's trying to, you  know, put hook your data into some other source, doing things like intermediating email,  intermediating IP addresses, all of that, I think is as an option, you know, is absolutely  terrific. And then I've been a longtime fan of extensibility and continuity.  I think those came out with iOS 8 and those were think one of those transformative things that Apple  has done in terms of mobile software.  And just to see them continue to push the possibilities like the interface possibilities of  continuity with things like universal control.  I think that's terrific.  And the more stuff they can do like that, the more value they just bring to people who do have  multiple parts of the Apple ecosystem.

Start time: 900.24
End time: 921.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was it made me happy that I spent so much money on that iPad Pro, which was really a  speculative purchase of hoping that the iPad Pro would justify its cost.  And the fact that I can move the mouse from my iMac to my MacBook, to my iPad, and then take a file on my iPad and drag it back across is phenomenal.

Start time: 922.84
End time: 931.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a clipboard, but made in a way that's so easy to relate to, just so like intuitive to use.  So they're putting like really nice front ends on all of this geekier technology they've been

Start time: 931.56
End time: 934.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they give us more information on that in the sessions?

Start time: 936.62
End time: 956.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so basically they had all these ideas for like acoustic modeling, like you put out low tones on the iMac and the iPad would identify where they're coming from and know where they are.  Google does that a little bit with Chromecast.  Time of flight.  Yeah, where they'd use time of flight, but they're just like, no, you're going to drag the mouse in the direction that you think that you know the computer is, so why should we even bother?  Users are going to pick it up, you move it.

Start time: 956.68
End time: 963.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it does require Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to be on, right?  So it's obviously using that.  Is it using UWB?  No, probably not.  No, it's not.

Start time: 965.92
End time: 977.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like Renee said, it's user intention.  If your iPad's on the right and you drag to the right, it says, okay, the iPad's on the right.  And then it puts that little gray bar up.  But how does it know the iPad's on the right?  I mean, because you put the, because you dragged your cursor that direction.

Start time: 977.64
End time: 998.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it could be, okay.  So if you had an iMac, a MacBook and an iPad in a row, how would it know?  You could fool it if you want to mess with yourself.  You could fool it.  Don't try to fool it.  Put the MacBook on the left and the iPad on the right.  Okay.  Most people use it with two devices.  It's basically Sidecar without, is there, do you have to turn it on, configure it?  It sounds like it.

Start time: 998.82
End time: 1028.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's exactly Sidecar.  It uses the same principles and the same devices that are compatible with Sidecar.  Like it's doing a Bluetooth low energy handshake to see what's there, make sure it's logged into your Apple account.  Then it'll connect over Wi-Fi direct.  So it's a much, much faster technology.  And it uses things like time of flight so people can't intercept it or relay it or do any sort of those kinds of attacks.  That's amazing.  It's a really good security model.  And also like you have to be in proximity to it so that you're not doing something on your iPad locally.  And then someone at school sees you doing it.  You know, there's like all sorts of really good safeguards in there.

Start time: 1029.18
End time: 1036.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, the first thing that people say and the first thing came up for me is this is a great ecosystem play because of course you can't do it with any other device.

Start time: 1036.90
End time: 1075.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think the right ecosystem play in a way you mentioned Sidecar.  Sidecar is this idea where you basically can turn an iPad into a Mac display.  Right.  But it's still the Mac display and you're still controlling it and running your Mac apps and you can use the pencil and stuff.  But mostly it's just using it as a third party display.  It's just like extra monitor for my Mac.  And this is not that right.  This is you're still using your keyboard and your trackpad.  But when it's on the iPad, you're using the iPad and the iPad's apps.  And when you're on the Mac part, you're using the Mac and you're using the Mac's apps.  So I think it's actually a much better approach than just saying, well, what if your iPad turned into a dumb monitor for your Mac?  Which is what Sidecar was.

Start time: 1075.76
End time: 1082.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is what you can do now too with the Mac with AirPlay to Mac.  Like they've made everything clear.  You can take over your iPad, you can take over your Mac, you can take over.  You can just use both.

Start time: 1083.48
End time: 1141.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is there's got to we got to make up a term for what Apple does all the time.  Maybe it's synchristic, but which is a little obscure.  But the idea that Apple is constantly adding features that at some point are going to merge into a larger, more powerful hole.  Do you see what I'm saying?  For instance, the keyboard and trackpad on the iPad sort of made sense.  But now it really makes sense because you're using a mouse and keyboard on your Mac and it works with your iPad.  It's things like that that Apple's really good at.  And this is why I think there's a secret, very detailed road map because you're planning to fight inflation.  And I know at the end of the line of the road map is some sort of weird AR spectacles in a car.  But but but you can see it kind of happening bit by bit.  And I love it when you actually when a plan comes together.  I think I love when a platform comes together.  You use that line. Yeah.  Yeah. That's exactly it.

Transcript:  They have big plans and pants to match, I guess.  And they that's a reference.  And I think like one of the stories of this event, if the same question to me that you asked Renee.  Oh, yeah, we haven't gotten to each of you.  What we're seeing, Renee, is the idea that as a Mac user, especially, I'm so used to Apple product announcements being,  here are some features for the iPad and the iPhone, and here are some features for the iPhone,  and here are some features that and this feature will sort of be on the Mac, but not.  And then, oh, let's talk about the Mac.  Here's a totally different thing.  We're playing catch up over here.  And then we we've implemented this thing, but not all the way.  And those days feel like they're completely over.  And it's because Apple has spent the last few years unifying these platforms to the point where  now when they roll out a feature, it just rolls out to all of them.  Like the FaceTime stuff is on iPhone and iPad and Mac.  So many of these features, they're 100% on the Mac, just like they're on the iPad and the iPhone.  They move in lockstep.  And you know that was their plan five years ago.  And they looked at their platforms and they said, we can't do this yet.  We like we're not even running some of our base software has drifted so far apart that we can't even do it.  And and they seem to have gotten there this year.

Start time: 1212.38
End time: 1229.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny because they threw a little misdirection in by naming their each device as its own name for its operating system,  even though they're all iOS or Mac OS, but it's iOS, iPad OS, watch OS, TV OS.  But when you say platform, you're saying the Apple platform.

Start time: 1230.46
End time: 1244.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the super platform, the over right that this is especially for their three main  primary computing device platforms, the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac.  This is they're all moving together as this kind of like overarching platform.

End time: 1272.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, what they really should have done in the keynote is just rerun all the announcements like three times where it's getting it yet.  And now and now we're doing now we're doing FaceTime like we were doing with the other platform.

Start time: 1272.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the parts that's so interesting, though, is they got their own custom silicon.  Now, like one of the things like they merged a lot of the software teams years ago, like the messages team is now a Mac and iOS messaging team.  But because they were using AppKit on the Mac and they had different frameworks and all these things and they had to use Intel and AMD or Intel, Intel integrated.  It still took a long time.  It was extra effort to do everything on the Mac.  And now they have M1 on like Apple silicon across all these platforms.  We got things like live text using a neural engine to in real time go through and make all your text editable, all your text selectable, all your text actionable.  And they can just put that on the Mac.  They don't have to rewrite that for Intel for six different years of Intel chipsets and Intel integrated GPUs and AMD, potentially GPUs offloading all that, which is a considerable amount of effort.  And to Jason's point, we would get that next year, maybe the year after, maybe never on the Mac.  And this year we just got all of those neural engine features for free on M1 Macs because it's the same chip that's in the iPad and the iPhone this year.

Start time: 1327.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll throw out a super nerdy one, but I think maybe listeners of Twit will appreciate it, which is shortcuts on the Mac.  Very interesting.  There's so many.  I mean, first off, it's just what we were talking about, which is this is an app that's existed on iPhone and iPad and bringing it to the Mac.  It's an app they bought, by the way, right?  Yeah, they bought it.  It was called Workflow.  It's a third party app that we couldn't believe was even allowed in the App Store.  And then they bought it and they made it a part of the Siri team and they rolled it out as shortcuts.  But they rewrote it this year in SwiftUI, their sort of new cross-platform interface development environment.  And that goes across all the platforms.  So actually, the interface is new on the Mac, but that same interface is also now on the iPad and the iPhone.  And what they said was this is the future of user automation on the Mac.  And if you haven't been paying attention to Mac user automation, most people haven't.  Sal Segoian stood up on stage when they launched Tiger.  So that was what, 2005?  And they introduced Automator.  And since then, kind of nothing out of Apple in terms of user automation.  That team got disbanded.  And so what now we see is that they incubated the shortcut stuff on iPad and iPhone and are taking that step to the Mac.  And it's not the baby version of automation.  It runs shell scripts.  It runs Apple scripts.  It runs JavaScript.

Start time: 1413.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it OSA script compatible?

Start time: 1415.14
End time: 1432.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because it's running scripts, it will run the OSA, which is the open scripting architecture that's running on Apple's platform.  So Apple script and JavaScript, basically.  It will run those, but it will also run a Perl script, a Python script, anything else.  A shell script.  All the stuff that you could do on Automator.

Start time: 1432.96
End time: 1441.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what you do on Automator or Apple script before.  You can call out to any script to run it.  That gives you infinite capability, basically.  It really does.

Start time: 1442.06
End time: 1451.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Obviously, that won't work on the iPad because there's no command line and there's no shell access there.  But on the Mac side, they've replicated all the features of Automator.

Start time: 1451.30
End time: 1457.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want to fork this.  So what you'd like to do is have shortcuts have the same capabilities across the board.

Start time: 1457.30
End time: 1483.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the idea there is that the platforms are different.  So some of the ideas like opening windows on the Mac is not a thing you do on the iPad, but you can open multitasking instances on the iPad.  And you can't do either of those things on the iPhone.  And one thing that I haven't played a lot with, but one of the blocks in shortcuts is device name.  So you can write a shortcut that says, is this a Mac?  If so, do this.  If it's an iPad, do this different thing and write one shortcut.  It syncs across iCloud.

Transcript:  AppleScript?  I wonder about the future of scripting on Apple's platforms because AppleScript is really old.  It's from System 7 era.

Start time: 1495.22
End time: 1499.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1500.24
End time: 1553.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem, the challenge is AppleScript allows a level of detail that I'm not sure shortcuts is providing access to in individual apps.  The moment that shortcuts, if they make a drive towards saying, no, no, no, we want everything that you can script.  And that goes down to like a line.  You move the cursor one character over in a text editor, stuff like that, that you can do in AppleScript.  If you could do that using shortcuts, I think they would probably feel just say, I say it's a multi-year transition.  I think that's why is because this is step one of a whole lot more.  But it's very exciting because in doing that, they also brought over everything that Automator was capable of doing and built a version of that so that they could import Automator workflows on the Mac.  All those functions also run on iOS now.  So you can do all sorts of stuff on the iPad using shortcuts that you couldn't do before because they wanted to bring up parity with the Mac version.

Start time: 1553.72
End time: 1573.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be smart to learn shortcuts at this point, it sounds like.  You know, one of the problems, and this is because we're old Mac, old timers, go back to 1984.  So we remember all this.  But with AppleScript, the idea was applications would provide a dictionary of capabilities and AppleScript could hook into that.  But fewer and fewer applications do that.  It just died off.

Start time: 1573.44
End time: 1585.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And instead, what you've got on iOS is something called Intense, the Intense framework.  And it's the same idea.  It's what can you do with this app?  And then you can furnish that out for someone else to do things with the app.

Transcript:  I have the same problem because I love Android, especially what Google's doing now with Android 12.  I'm using Linux right now.  I love Linux, but there is a lot of disincentive.  There's so much incentive to use an iPhone and iPad and a Mac.  There's so much benefit to that.  But I don't think it's good for the overall, for the technology ecosystem to have a...  You know, that's like bananas.  That's in the sense of it's a monoculture.  You know what I mean?  It's actual bananas.  It's not just crazy bananas.  It's actual bananas.  Where there's a problem with bananas because there's only one strain of bananas that's still surviving.  And it's being attacked by a parasite.  And that means we might be out of bananas.  It's a bad idea to have a mono.

Transcript:  We have the choice.  Like if you want them, if you want like the all-in ecosystem, you know, curated experience,  you can go with Apple and get your iPhone and your Mac and your iPad and be perfectly happy and not have to sweat any details or configure anything or do all those things.  Like if you're just...  You don't care about the technology.  You just need tools to get a job done and you don't want to fuss or must.  You have this option on one side.  And if you do, if you're like a hobbyist, if you're a tinkerer, if you're somebody who wants to have a wide variety, then you can get Android and Windows and Linux and all of these things.  And I worry that, you know, people will prosecute this idea of Apple being a monoculture so much that the people who do benefit from it will have it taken away from them.  And they'll just be stuck with a bunch of hobbyist tools that they really hate.  It's much worse for them than it was having something easy to use because they didn't care about the technology.  And for people like us, I have an Android phone and an iPhone, you know, and I have a Windows machine and I have a bunch of Apple machines.  And I get to do that.  And I know that's an indulgence and a privilege, but I get to do that sort of both the theme park and the flea market.  I love that. That to me is the best solution.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and I'm like you.  I mean, that's a hazard of our trade as much as anything else.  It's a bugger of a feature.  Well, yeah, I have mixed feelings about this.  You know, we'll talk a little bit later.  Congress has passed now on Friday has introduced five new bills to regulate the tech industry, one of which I'm all for is an interoperability bill that would require companies to provide data portability so that you wouldn't be stuck in their walled garden.  I think they don't define data.  Yeah. Well, it's common.  Yeah, I don't think Congress is really going to be the right person to figure this out.  But but it's obviously not in companies interests to do this.  And so they're going to have to be forced to do it if it's ever going to happen.  But it's definitely in consumers interest to have this portability.  A walled garden is not good in general for the ecosystem, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the challenge with Apple inventing some of these things that work best across its devices is that there's a question of who's going to do it if Apple doesn't do it.  Right. It is certainly kind of innovation.  So this universal control where you've got a laptop and you've got a desktop and you can move the mouse back and forth and it all works magically.  Like if Microsoft step up and said, we really like this feature, we would like to also implement it on Windows.  We want this to be a standard.  Well, here's the thing.  Like there are two responses Apple could have.  Apple could have the response of like, great, that's great.  Why not? Or they would say, no, no, we made this ball.  It's our ball. We're going to take it and go home.  And that's where the dividing line is, because I think the argument is if you wait around for an industry wide consortium.  These things aren't going to get invented and they do make Apple's products better.  I don't think the primary intent is to wall Apple off, but they know that that's the secondary effect.

Start time: 1854.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not bad for the bottom line.  Although there is an example, a counter example, which is Project Chip now called Matter, which did appear on stage a few times.  That was an industry wide consortium that was really responding to the fact that consumers were not using home automation because it was a tower of babble.  Nothing interoperated.  You had to buy a base station for every different device.  It wasn't a good experience.  And companies realized, well, we're never going to be able to sell products in this sphere.  So Apple even, they don't make a security camera, but they're now offering unlimited storage on iCloud Plus for HomeKit security cameras.  This is an example of sometimes the right thing to do is also the right thing to do.  For consumers, a good thing for the bottom line.  And sometimes you just have to.  I agree with you, though.  You wouldn't have the innovation you're getting from Apple right now if it wasn't an ecosystem.

Transcript:  They even went to the extreme of making FaceTime work on Android and Windows.  Yeah, exactly.  There's certain values of working, but yes.  Values of working, yes.  So it was very interesting.  I think at least the first half hour to hour was catch up.  Was, yeah, we don't do this, but we're going to do it now.  You know, Microsoft has Lens, Google has Lens, both have the same names, which is weird.  And now Apple has something not called Lens.  Well, it was kind of interesting.  But I don't want to, I'm finished yet.  Philip, I want to give you a chance to mention the top line things that you think are worth paying attention to.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 1964.98
End time: 1984.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We mentioned FaceTime.  The thing that really struck me there is the API that Apple plans to put out so that developers can actually work with SharePlay to integrate that into their apps.  The first thing you think of, of course, is sharing video, sharing music and what have you.

And they've lined up partnerships with your Disney's and your Hulu's and your whomever's.  But I really see a lot of developers taking that tool and running with it to integrate SharePlay into their apps.  I can see dating apps having a field day with that sort of thing.  My goodness, a date.  An extra feature in their application.

But now I realize the pandemic may be over, but people still are going to stay in their houses over in the U.S.  And that's true. It's a worldwide phenomenon that continues.  But everyone else is using the whiteboard.

Transcript:  I'm not sure people are going to go back to dating in real life.  I think there might still be a lot of virtual dating, virtual schooling, virtual work, because a lot of people realize, hey, this isn't so bad.  I might want to keep doing this.  In fact, this is going to be a bit.  I foresee this being a big problem for companies with employees who don't want to go back.  In fact, Apple employees wrote a letter which got leaked out saying, we don't know.  You think we all want to come back to work, Tim.  We don't. You said you're not listening, Tim.  You're writing lines in your in your company wide memo saying we're all looking forward to getting back together in the same building and we're not.  I don't know how widespread that revolt is at Apple, but I hear from other companies people are quitting rather than going back.  And it depends on the universe.

Start time: 2085.94
End time: 2130.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends on what the job is.  Right. Like, obviously, there are jobs at Apple, especially if you're building products that are probably only really well done in person.  But there are also jobs that are marketing or writing or documentation or things like that that you could do a distributed workforce and it would probably be fine.  The problem I had with Tim Cook's announcement was it seemed very one size fits all.  That doesn't necessarily mean that's actually how it was inside Apple.  But it seems like maybe it was perceived that way.  And there is a little bit of a fallacy in saying what we learned from the pandemic is that you can work at home two days a week, but you still have to come in to the office the other three days because not everything we learned from the pandemic was it's nice to work at home.  Some of it was it's really expensive to live in the Bay Area and I can do my job from somewhere else.  And that wasn't addressed in the memo.  So it's going to be a challenge.

Transcript:  It's funny that they phrased it in that way, because what they really did is sort of announce Apple ID reform, but they did it in a very terrible way.  They've been, you know, Apple ID's were iTunes ID's and they were really just there so that you could buy DRM music on iTunes.  And it's evolved into this passport for their entire ecosystem.  And there's still parts of it that have been way behind and really kind of broken.  And those announcements about not just your legacy.  So if you die, you can designate somebody before, not in that order, by the way, you can designate somebody to take care of your account after you die.  But also that you can if you lose access to your account, you can have designated somebody who will be able to get you back in.  And these are problems that have been huge in terms of supporting people who are in Apple's ecosystem for years now.  And it all goes back to the fact that it really wasn't designed to be this system.  And they have those are major reforms that are going to stop a lot of people from losing their data, their photos.

Transcript:  They had a big problem a few years ago where like around the iOS seven time, the InfoSec nerds won.  They won everything. They ran rampant through like two factor was everything was fail secure.  So if any problem happened, you were just locked out.  Apple couldn't help you. Anybody can help you.  And a lot of nerds love that, like, you know, literally just because we know it's secure, not because we love how it works.  But but it's not. Well, but the thing is that for most people and I learned this from Dave Nanean.  He sat me down and said, please stop this because this is not how humans work.  Right. You know, when you when it comes to backing up important things, most people's fear isn't, you know, someone's going to steal this photograph is that I'm going to lose photographs of my of my wedding of my children.  And you have to have fails like fail safe.  Like his whole thing was don't encrypt your backup your backup drives, please.  And Apple had this sort of moment where they had to realize and they've done that with health to that.  You can't be absolutist about privacy.  Yes, there are some people who are zealots or some people want everything locked.  But you have to be compassionate for for people who just who need their data.  And that's why we got the new version of two factor that had like you didn't have to keep that recovery code printed out.  And if you lost it, that was it. All your stuff was gone forever.  Now there it does create a risk because maybe people can subpoena it, but they can help you recover it.  And now one step further, your legacy, your recovery contact.  So the info sec nerds are going to be super, super angry about this.  We'll see articles about it. But I think the humans sort of won this one.  It's a pendulum.

And one of the things Bruce pointed out is that a lot of stuff fails insecure,  that that's not at all unusual for firewalls and other corporate enterprise security features to fail insecure.  They'll save. That's not good.  But on the other hand, failing safe every time is also hard for users.  So it does seem like you need to find a happy middle ground in Apple.

Transcript:  You need to pick your data types.  Like some data types should fail secure. Absolutely.  Like that information is better lost than made public and some should fail safe,  where that information is better for you to be able to recover it than it is for it to be gone.  Like again, it's an encrypted backup drive.  If that fails secure, you are never getting those photos back.  If that fails safe, you can take it to a recovery company.

Transcript:  I had a guy called yesterday.  He said, I just, my wife's iPhone was full and I wanted to get some, get her stuff off on an iCloud.  So I logged into it with my iTunes account and bought some iCloud and then locked it out.  And kind of the bottom line is never use your Apple ID on anybody else's device.  That's always a bad idea.  It didn't work as predicted, I guess.  It wasn't exactly what he thought was going to happen.  We have a lot of related stories to go into, including by the way,  Apple revealing that the Trump administration DOJ got a trove of information  about Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee,  or ostensibly in an attempt to find leaks, but really to target them.  Bob Woodward said, this is Nixon on steroids.  We'll talk about that Apple revealed because the gag order was lifted, a bunch of that.  There's a lot more to talk about those five, five, count of five bills to cut big tech down to size,  introduced in the House.  This is going to be fun.  We have, if you thought it was going to be all Apple, no, there's a lot of other stuff.  Did we get everything? We didn't, obviously.  You know what? I'll tell you, I am excited because and I already kind of alluded to this  because I spent an ungodly sum of money on the new 2021 M1 iPad.  I bought the top of the line, which is $2,400 when you add it all up.  On the premise that, well, Apple must have something planned.  So I was very relieved to see the new multitasking, which until I use it, I won't be sure.  But it looks like they've kind of fixed multitasking on iPad OS.  There's some new features in iPad OS.  And I think to me, the one I want to watch, you wanted to watch shortcuts.  I agree with you. I think that's going to be interesting shortcuts on the Mac.  For me, Swift Playgrounds on the iPad able to make Apple apps is fascinating.  I don't. And again, this is one where I'll have to try it to see, can you make a real app?  At least you could put it on the store.  But will it really be something somebody will want? Or is it a low code, no code?  Renee, did you get any briefings on that? Because I think that's really interesting.

Start time: 2525.34

Transcript:  Yeah, it's really a Swift UI experience.  I think it's meant at this stage to be an alternative to people who would otherwise  begin their coding with some web-based tutorial on the Mac in full-frame.

Start time: 2554.86
End time: 2568.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do all of that and you can submit it.  The problem is that most apps that you would submit these days have things that aren't  Swift in them. They still got some legacy, Objective-C, stuff like that.  You can see why Apple wouldn't want to get rid of all of that.

Start time: 2568.48
End time: 2580.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want you to write Objective-C.  They want you to write in Swift and Swift UI entirely.  So this is a way to do that.  That's going to be the challenge is, can I write a useful app in Swift and Swift UI alone?

Start time: 2583.96

Transcript:  There are a lot of interesting developer stories. Yeah.

Start time: 2597.50
End time: 2639.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think this one is particularly interesting because we've all been wondering  about how Apple is going to bring Final Cut or how Apple is going to bring Logic or how  Apple is going to be bringing Xcode to the iPad, which has a very different set of interface  realities around it and also the amount of RAM, the amount of storage you can get on  those are very different than the Mac.  But if you suddenly have access to Xcode cloud and you're typing away on your Mac and then  you pick up your iPad and you go to the sofa, but your true store, your sync is all still  on your Mac and still in the cloud, that enables a whole different kind of workflow.  And collaboration, which Apple has not been great at with any of their pro apps historically,  but it opens up to not just a port of an app to an iPad, but a whole new paradigm of using  all of your Apple stuff on any of your devices.

Start time: 2640.16
End time: 2682.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really interesting. It's also, this is another one of those where it's parity  with existing platforms. A lot of enterprises do continuous integration development and  they need that.  And now you can do that with Xcode.  Concurrency.  Concurrency. Well, you could still have concurrency, but now they have a nice safe way to do concurrency.  Yes.  Yeah, there was a lot of stuff. I thought I'd be interested to find out more about iCloud  Plus and the, it's not exactly a VPN, but the iCloud relay. That's going to be very  interesting if you have to use Safari. But if that looks like it's on by default, that's  going to really...  That's too.  Pardon me?

Start time: 2683.66
End time: 2692.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's both. Safari is doing the IP screening as part of their desire to reduce  the amount of personal information that you give to everybody.  That's basically DNS security.

Start time: 2692.90
End time: 2700.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Full on service. Yeah. Full on service.  If you are paying for iCloud, will you automatically get iCloud relay and it'll be on automatically?

Start time: 2700.94
End time: 2720.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got asked, yeah, I just got asked. It popped up and said, do you want to use it? And then  I said, yes. And the same with the mail. And the mail one is fascinating to me too, because  they're not using machine learning to try to guess what the tracking pixel is and then  remove it. They're opening the full mail encrypted on their side and then giving you a picture  of it. So like every mail client everywhere is going to think it's a hundred percent open  rate for every email they send to any iCloud user from now on.

Start time: 2721.78
End time: 2732.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Many, many email clients, including plenty available for iOS and Mac OS, don't allow  tracking pixels. That's an easy thing to do. My client doesn't allow images of any kind,  but this is going much farther. I didn't realize we were doing that.

Start time: 2733.76
End time: 2737.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So all the mail client gets back is Apple. They don't know that you did it or  where you are.

Start time: 2738.36
End time: 2768.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a shot across the bow for mailing list people, for marketers. This is going to be  a very interesting battle because basically Apple and Google's doing this too, are saying,  Well, first party's fine, but anything other than the first party information, it's not  going to be allowed on our platforms.  Facebook's going to have a whole new newspaper ad.  Well, Facebook's doing it too, believe me. If you have a Facebook account, they got everything  they ever wanted to know about you anyway, right? They're just adding more, but they  know plenty about you. Same with Google and truthfully same with Apple.

Start time: 2769.52
End time: 2783.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Apple is disclosing every link to every, like if you go to apps now, it's going to  show you every SDK that they're linking out to from that app, like that has any sort of,  not even just marketing apps, but anything that that SDK links out to, you're going to  get a nice list of URLs showing you where your activity is being logged.

Start time: 2783.92
End time: 2810.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's clearly giving people what they want. I mean, there's no question at all that Google's  only doing it because they have to, that Apple's doing it because it's good for business, but  it's giving people what they want. But at the same time, I don't know if it's a good  thing for the general internet ecosystem. This could be disaster.  You know, you're, for instance, you, Renee are on YouTube. So you don't have to worry  because YouTube tracking the hell out of everybody watching your videos.

Start time: 2810.64
End time: 2845.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there is a concern. So like, and I have been talking to people about this. So for example,  if somebody is using this and they're logged in, it won't matter because YouTube has perfect  Google, anybody that you're on their platform, they have perfect knowledge. But if you're not  logged in, like if you're just open a web browser, it's not like you're in incognito or private mode,  because that would just hide, like that would just not index your search queries, but this is  actually obfuscating your IP. And Apple is smart enough not to completely obfuscate it.  Like it's still going to show that you're in Petaluma because there's a whole host of  internet information that's useful to you. If they like for deliveries or for where hotels are,  like knowing where you are in general is good. Not just, not just, not just

Start time: 2846.06
End time: 2862.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a little switch that you have. I understand. I'm play with it. You have,  there's a little switch that says, yeah, I want general location information passed along.  Yeah. Right. Because otherwise there's no information. It's not your IP address. It's  not even Apple's IP address. Some third party IP address like Cloudflare.

Start time: 2862.82
End time: 2883.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They encrypt your information on your end. They send that to an Apple relay, which then  gives you a temporary IP address, which tends to be regionally based, then forwards that to  a second relay that's not under Apple's control, which then decrypts it and sends the question off  to the internet for resolving. And that means that neither side of that has your full picture.  Like there's zero, there's nobody that has perfect knowledge of you in that exchange.

Start time: 2883.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is the goal. How fast is it? Is it responsive? Zero slow down as far as I can tell.  That's the theory. Tor uses at least three nodes. So it's, and it's going to be faster than that.

Start time: 2912.54
End time: 2938.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have you looked at the third party? Well, we have Cloudflare. I'm assuming it's going to be  the same in China. It's not going to be the same. And maybe not in France, like any country that  has big data, probably why they're doing it that way. Isn't it come to think of it? Well, I mean,  it's going to be a big problem. I know China is like an easy one to identify, but there are so many  countries that are really interested in data repatriation at this point. Like they just don't  want America involved in their data. And Apple's going to have to start like the internet, which  was this international thing is going to be incredibly provincial and regionalized over the

Start time: 2938.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  next few years. Also, when you're doing that two step thing and Apple's giving you the choice of  being sort of very narrow or a little bit broader with your location in the United States, that's a  little bit different, especially if you're someplace like California, it's probably like,  are you in the Bay Area? Are you in California in individual countries? It's probably going to be,  are you in this very specific place in this country? Are you in the country? And that probably  means they're going to need to have country specific relays because, because the fact is so  much of the web is based on geo location, not for privacy issues, but for, yeah, but for laws and

Transcript:  iCloud relay turns off as soon as you turn on a VPN because that would get in the way. Exactly.  Yeah. It's very, it's, I think it's, it's, it's, I'm going to say it. It's an interesting land grab  from Apple. It's a, it's subtle what Apple's up to, but if you put all the pieces together,  it's a very aggressive play and it's giving people what they want. And that's interesting,  you know, I guess you can't go wrong giving people what others are going to be driven right to Google  well because they don't like it. Yeah. And if you're a marketer or if you have a newsletter,  there's lots of people we're going to go, Oh my God, what are we going to do now?  No. Go back to brand advertising. They'll do surveys. They'll figure it out. And they'll  figure it out. A lot of, a lot of the, Casey Newton wrote that in platform. Yeah. A lot of

You  need to look at your subscription numbers and see if you're serving that audience that way.  Day to day. It is like crack day to day open rates. You don't need to know that nobody feels

Transcript:  good when you read it, doesn't it? I do want that. Like, so that is one point of concern I have  because I do, I don't need to know, like Jason watched my video or opened my newsletter,  but I would like to know what percentage of my audience is enjoying my content because if I go  the wrong direction and even though like they haven't unsubscribed yet, but less and less people  are, are like reading it or watching it. I want to reverse that trend and I want to do it before  people start unsubscribing. So I'm a little bit on the border here. Like I would like general  knowledge about how happy my audience is. I don't need to know specifically, but I would like to

Transcript:  know if people are actually reading it. There's a really interesting thing going on. And you know,  the other example of this is Amazon's sidewalk where people are almost knee-jerk against tracking  and ignoring kind of the benefit. I mean, the reason we have a free internet with tons of great  content is because we have an ad ecosystem, because we have tracking. Sidewalk is an attempt by  Amazon to create something that I think has a real public value. Yes, it's from Amazon and yes,  Amazon will gain value from it, but I think we all could a mesh network over the, all of our  neighborhoods with low power, not high speed, but low power connections has real value. But people  are so anti-Amazon, but also so anti-corporate and anti-technology that they're kind of throw. I feel,  I worry that we're throwing the baby out with the bath water. Amazon was kind of sketchy with a lot

Start time: 3190.30

Start time: 3199.10
End time: 3213.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bad stuff. But there's also, I think a knee-jerk reaction and by the way, I know it well because  anybody who listens to our shows, chances are nine out of 10 that you are on that side of the  equation that you're really pro-privacy, anti-tracking. Listening to Steve Gibson.

Start time: 3235.70
End time: 3246.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 3274.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you already signed off. That's the thing is there's a perfectly good argument to make here,  but Amazon with its reputation then kind of sneaks it in and says, yeah, we're going to be  giving your neighbors access to your wifi just for bandwidth. But nevermind. It'll be fine.  I think there's a better argument. I mean, I don't like it when Comcast wants to offer free  wifi hotspots out of my house either. I turned it off. I agree. But again, there's the argument  to be made. I think that that's something like sidewalk. It is good. It is clever.

Amazon, I think really this is something  that is, it's an open API. It's probably 100% privacy forward. Anybody can use it. Bandwidth  is capped so that they don't steal everybody's bandwidth. There's a huge community value to it.  Maybe the issue was simply positioning, but honestly that's too bad because we're going to  miss out, I think, on a lot of things that could make our world better because people are so knee  jerk afraid of it.

He said, Jeff Bezos has  paid over 20 years billions of dollars in taxes. There were sure there were some years where it was  zero, but those were offset against losses. And he paid taxes in the other years. And it's really  not fair to cherry pick those years where he didn't pay taxes because he paid billions on other years.  And he says it's unfair. But I haven't really looked into it. And if you guys have an opinion  on that, we could bring that one up too. But I do need to take a break because I don't want to be  like John Gruber. We're only an hour into the show. Your shirt fully buttoned.

Transcript:  We're it's happening right now. Our show today brought to you by guess who? Amazon. Oh, perfect.  This is something I have used because we had PillPack was a sponsor for a long time.  Really great idea. Using technology to deliver prescription medications. In the mail, they used  scanners to check to make sure you got the right meds at the right time. It was really brilliant.  Amazon bought them and they've incorporated this technology into something brand new, which is  Amazon Pharmacy. Now a lot of us are still staying home going to a pharmacy seems like if it has  seemed all year like the most dangerous thing in the world you could do. Amazon Pharmacy solves  the problem. It saves you time. They work with your doctor and delivers medication to your door. You  get the meds you need without leaving the house. One less errand, more safety for you. And it  really is an amazing technology. So it's absolutely easy to use. Your doctor's office could just send  you next prescription straight to Amazon Pharmacy. By the way, they do something extra that your  pharmacy may not be doing. Amazon Pharmacy coordinates with your doctor to make sure it's  accurate. They're really focused on getting you exactly the right medication and the right dosage.  You can use your insurance. Of course, Amazon Pharmacy works with almost all insurance plans  nationwide. Of course, it saves you time because you don't have to go to the pharmacy. Honestly,  I haven't been to the pharmacy in years. I love this idea. No more waiting in line. Just have it  come to your door. And if you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll love this. You get free two-day  delivery and you save on prescription medication when you pay without insurance. Now, as I mentioned,  it does take insurance. But what's great about Amazon Pharmacy, and this is something no pharmacy  does, how many times have you gone to the pharmacy, filled a prescription, you don't know what the cost  of it is until you're at the cash register and they say, that'll be $554, please. That is really  scary. With Amazon Pharmacy, everything is upfront. The pricing is completely clear and understandable.  They will tell you what the cost of the medication is, what your insurance copay is. And if you're an  Amazon Prime member, what you'll pay without insurance and you choose what you want to do.  Your privacy absolutely always protected the medical information that you give Amazon Pharmacy  is never shared outside the pharmacy. You can always speak to a pharmacist, and I mean 24-7,  always speak to a pharmacist, whether you have questions or need advice. This is exactly the  service I really got used to with PillPack. And I'm really thrilled Amazon acquired them and they've  introduced Amazon Pharmacy. Amazon Prime members can save on prescription medication when not using  insurance.

Next year, we're going to go to Alaska. We'll have a lot of events and cocktail parties,  the kind of things we did on the geek cruises. You stand on the bow of the ship in Glacier Bay  and watch the ice floating down. Watch the glaciers calve. It's really incredible. Ketchikan,  Sitka, all of the fun places. I did a geek cruise to Alaska, but it was a chess cruise.  Interesting. Yeah. They were like Larry Evans and the US champion, had all these grandmasters on  board. It's a weird thing because you're looking out the window as the glaciers go by. But meanwhile,  there's 15 chess boards and we're doing a simultaneous and that's much more important  than those glaciers. Who cares? So it was really fun. Were they all cosplaying as castles and  bishops? Yeah, it was great. It's a very nerdy experience. That's the nice thing about a cruise  ship. You can be as nerdy as you really can be as nerdy as you want to be. Find out more at  cruise.twit.tv. Five, count them, five bills.

Transcript:  Nobody could see him. They all testified. This was part of a 16 month long investigation  by the Antitrust Committee of the House Judiciary Committee. And now on Friday, five bills  introduced in the House as a result of this investigation. Now, the problem with saying  that anything has been introduced, they're bipartisan, but the problem with saying anything's  been introduced in Congress is the House is one thing, the Senate is completely another. And who  knows if any of these have a chance to win? They have different lobbyists, right? Totally different  lobbyists. You don't know who's getting money from what. So Dave Cicilline, who is the chairman of  the committee said in a statement, our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest,  most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us. I think that's a giveaway,  that word wealthiest, because I think some of this punishment is because they're too successful,  not because they're too powerful. I'd like to hear powerful be the first word, not the second

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  word in that sentence. Do you remember that when the testimony though, like it started off with him  saying we have to investigate whether these companies need to be broken up and then nothing  in the entire hearing had anything to do with breaking up the companies. It was mostly concern  over competition about whether they were mean to partners and competitors from the Democrats and  then like suppression of conservative speech from the Republicans. And then at the end, he goes,  thank you all for coming. It is now evident we have to break up these companies. I mean,  it's the thing. It was like there was zero conversation about breakup in the entire session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then trial. Yeah, exactly. So here are the five bills. Again, who knows? Some of them I think  are not a bad thing. One empowers the Justice Department or the FTC. Two, this one is going to  never pass. Break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their business that could  create a conflict of interest. That's like YouTube from Google was the example. That's  really challenging because you approved these mergers. You said Facebook could buy Instagram.  You said Facebook could buy WhatsApp. You said Google could buy YouTube. It was all approved.  And now you're going to say, oh yeah, take back. I think they can't list them in search, right?

Start time: 3859.92

Start time: 3863.28
End time: 3905.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  different bill for consumers. This is a bill that would bar company. It's hard. It's confusing  because there's five of them. There's another bill would bar companies from giving their own  services preference over their rivals. And of course, Google got in trouble for shopping in  the EU. I don't think it's ever successfully demonstrated that Google was favoring shopping.  It looks like if you do a search, Google favors YouTube and its search results. Maybe.  It's very hard to know and be even harder to enforce. But since Apple doesn't do search,  Twitter doesn't do search, Facebook, I don't know if Facebook favorites his own services  in search results. I think it's really bad. They all actually do. If you put a video from

Start time: 3905.92
End time: 3917.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an out of platform service into any post you make on that platform, whether you put a YouTube video  on Twitter, you put a Facebook video in it. Yeah, they're not going to favor it. They're going to  down it. Well, they actually decelerate it. They will not show it to people because they don't want

Start time: 3917.72
End time: 3972.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you leaving the platform. Yeah, they're doing their business. Anyway, you could make that illegal.  I think that's really the purpose of antitrust and Congress in general is to force these companies  to do something that may not be in their best interest, but it is in the national interest,  is in society's interest. That's the point, right? That's what laws are about. You want to kill  somebody, that might be in your interest, but it's not in our interest. We don't want to let you do  that. Another bill would block companies like Facebook. This one, I think, has a better chance  because it's looking ahead. It would block companies like Facebook from buying up  nascent competitors. So it's pretty clear from the testimony and the email and discovery that  Facebook knew that Instagram and WhatsApp were going to be a threat to its business,  bought them. They tried to buy Snapchat for the same reason, to keep them from being competitors.  So this would outlaw that. That one, I think, is reasonable. If only the government had some

Start time: 3972.80

Transcript:  They're still approving those. Literally this year, they're still approving those deals.  Here's one that is uncontroversial because it raises government fees. Always a good thing.  It actually already passed the Senate, Senator Klobuchar's bill that would boost merger filing  fees. So if you were going to get government approval for a merger, you have to pay filing fees.  That those fees would then go to having more antitrust enforcers. So that's good. Fund the  antitrust enforcement anyway. And then the final bill would force platform. This is the one I think  we need, but it's going to be challenging. And you brought up something, Renee, on this one. It would  force platforms to make data interoperable so you could go from one service to another. So if you  had, Google kind of does this with takeout, but the takeout formats, unless the other service  understands JSON, aren't that easy to import. They're a lot easier to export.

Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a bigger argument. I forget if it was Benedict Evans or Benedict, one of the  Bens was bringing it up.

Start time: 4057.28

Start time: 4068.52
End time: 4095.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  photos or vice versa? Yeah. And as Casey Newton, as you mentioned, pointed out this week, it seems  like the big tech companies already know this is happening because they're already implementing  these features. And I think that's, yeah, absolutely. You shouldn't say, oh, well, if you want to get  your photos out of our service, you have to drag them out one by one. You've got to, there's got to  be a button that you can say, I need to cancel and I want all my stuff back. Like that's, I think  that's not an unreasonable thing. That's an easy one. I would hope so. They did it for GDPR, right?

Transcript:  they, these companies knew this stuff was coming for years and everybody's pointed out, Jason's  written about it. Everybody's written about this for years and they were just flying closer and  closer to the sun saying those governments are too, you know, the EU might try this, the DOJ might  try that. And they were fearless. They raced as far as they could to the line and showed no signs  of slowing down. And I think if they'd done just a little bit better risk mitigation, they could have  stopped a lot of these problems in their tracks. And now they're doing the worst thing imaginable,  which is allowing the most tech unsavvy, self-interested, easily bought off people in  the world. The people who, while trying, again, like while trying to make a browser ballot to  save Slepnir and Fenris, they destroyed every web rendering engine that we had. Like everybody now  uses some flavor of HTML. That's how good they are with these laws. They're doing the same thing  to everything else. So I wish these companies had been smarter five years ago or more prescient  five years ago and been a little bit humble. Yeah, they're kind of not wired that way,

Start time: 4159.60
End time: 4194.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  are they? I think that they weren't paying attention for a long time. And then they also  figured that they're so powerful and that they're so far ahead of law drafting, right? Like any law  that gets drafted is going to be playing, it's skating to where the puck is and not where it's  going to be. And I think that that may still be true. I think that they have some reason  to have this confidence level that even these suggested laws, I'm not entirely sure a lot of  them will do what they think it will do or solve the problems they think it will solve.

Some of them were like, are speeches being suppressed when the top 10 articles on Facebook  are exactly about you and the things that you were complaining about? You have zero suppression  going on there. But they argued that over and over again. And then very briefly, every once in a while  that veneer would fade and they would become the sharpest, most sincere, most accurate,  best attorney in the world and completely deflate one argument after another. And then they'd go  back to their circus act. So it's not like they actually believe this stuff. They're doing all  this theater to the detriment of actual regulation because they know it's better for their personal  power when they're fully capable of actually reasonably and rationally prosecuting these things.

End time: 4392.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  conversation speaking of John Gruber. I think it was John Gruber and Ben Thompson's podcast.  And they were talking about the power of these platforms, Facebook and Twitter, is that they  build these algorithms up and then they walk away and they sort of say, well, we're not really  responsible. It's just the algorithm. But they wrote the algorithm. And one of them said, well,  what happens when somebody who is potentially a malicious intent can control that algorithm  and can control what people see? And they didn't say it. And I'm sitting there listening to this  thing like TikTok, right? Because that's the argument here is that you get a source like TikTok  that's completely algorithm driven and is through the Cayman Islands or wherever else run by a  Chinese company that's essentially under the auspices of the Chinese government. And, you know,  whoever runs that algorithm can control what every TikTok user sees and what they don't see.  And it's really powerful, isn't it? And it's super powerful. And it knows about human nature  and about human psychology. And the danger isn't just an unrestrained and unconsidered algorithm.  The danger is that somebody says now we can use this.

And you have people who are bird colonels,  star generals, special operators, medical professionals, board certified medical  professionals, doctors, lawyers, all these people espousing incredibly extreme fringe theories  on YouTube, like in videos that are convincing people of outlandish counter facts or made up  stories. And YouTube takes those videos down and they go on Twitter and say, you know,  I'm this person, I'm this, I'm an expert. They're not letting my video up. And YouTube's like,  we need a hundred of you to agree before we can let that be. Like how do they determine veracity?  How do they, like a lot of things, an algorithm by itself can't really determine for you,  except popularity and their nightmares are derived from.

Transcript:  I don't know if TikTok struggles with this, but I think Facebook struggles with it,  trying to figure out how to do this right. They created that oversight board,  partly as an exercise to, you know, brush off responsibility, but they said they're going to  adhere to it. The oversight board said- And they wouldn't give them the data.  Yeah. Well, but okay. So I think this is an example of the oversight board working. They said,  okay, it was okay to ban president Trump, but it wasn't okay to do it without a limit on how long  the band is. So Facebook came back and said, all right, the band will be two years. And now this  is going to be the tricky part, pending on whether we consider him an ongoing threat in, on January  7th, 2020, what is it? 2024? No, 2023. We will reinstate him. Of course, that little middle part,  whether he's an ongoing threat is going to be very challenging for them. But at least they  responded to perhaps legitimate criticism for the oversight board and said, okay, you say we should  have a limit. This is what we're going to do. Right? That sort of worked. That's a kind of governance.

And now there's apparently another higher power. You can get rejected three times if you  want. I thought, you know, yeah, but in the end it's all people at Apple telling you whether you  could, your app, like on one level, it seems very weird. Like perhaps Apple should have an internal  system that allows weird things to bubble up to instead of using some sort of formal appeals  process. But regardless, it's not like you're going to a neutral arbiter here. You're just going to  somebody else who works the next cubicle over and asking for a different opinion.

Actually,  it's terrible by the way, the decryptors apparently, the colonial pipeline, they paid  millions of dollars to the ransomware authors, Darkside, got the decrypter and it was so slow,  they threw it away. They said, we can't use this. We're going to do it ourselves.  Visual basic or something?

They don't care, right? They know how to do it.  The US did get money back. This is actually an interesting  mystery. We don't know exactly how. Law enforcement recovered $2.3 million in Bitcoin,  paid after the colonial pipeline attack, money paid by the colonial pipeline to the ransomware  hackers. It's not completely clear how they did it.

And I think that the smart people are thinking,  so when you do Bitcoin, you can do it one of two ways. I foolishly decided to manage my own wallet  and of course I immediately forgot the password so I can't get into it. Or you could even more  foolishly, in my opinion, go to somebody like Coinbase or Mt. Gox and have a custodial wallet  where they have access, they control your wallet. You can move stuff in and out of it. They can move  stuff in and out of it for you. The problem with the custodial wallet is you have to trust these  people. In the case of Mt. Gox, that was a mistake. They took the money and ran. So I decided not to  do it. And they could also get subpoenaed. And they could get subpoenaed.

You'll join me. We'll stream the launch of when we don't know what the name of it is,  but it's getting more and more clear from the little tweets and stuff that it's going to be  windows 11. Uh, and then we'll do windows weekly shortly after that. We'll give Paul and Mary Jo  time to file their stories and then we'll, uh, gather, regather for windows weekly. So that's  moving not next, not this week, but next week it's moving, uh, to Thursday right after the  Microsoft announcement. Weird. Do you cover windows, right? Philip? These guys don't know

Well, so we, if you really care about this stuff, you should be  watching windows weekly on Wednesdays with Paul and Mary Jo, but apparently Microsoft never said  this is the last version of windows. Just some peon said it and Microsoft never corrected it.  It was somebody from Microsoft, but he said it in like a, some meeting somewhere and,  and it suddenly spread as wildfire, but it was never really, so Microsoft never officially said  windows 10, that's it. It's all over. Um, it is kind of right on the timeline. It's been about  five years since windows 10 to release a new one. But the real question is what it could possibly be.  Uh, and Paul and Mary Jo keep telling me, calm down. It's not going to be anything great.

Is that unfair?  I mean, apple announced macOS Monterey. It's not a huge difference from, but apple does this kind  of every year at Microsoft's been updating windows every other, you know, twice a year, every six

Some of them will have  weird names. Some will have like very pedestrian, like windows 11, at least we can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's getting back to the basics. Yeah. Just give it a number and move on.  Yes. The real creator, creator release. So they, they announced shortly before this,  they were not going to do windows 10 X, which was an interesting kind of rethinking of windows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're right. That story has gone on for years and did they not suspend the device that they were

Start time: 5419.20
End time: 5434.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to primarily the Neo. Yeah. The Neo. Yeah. Which is the dual screen device. They did the duo,  but instead of putting windows on it, they put Android on it. And then they initially said 10  X is for two screen devices, put Android on the first one and then killed the second one.

Start time: 5435.16
End time: 5439.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So then they killed 10 X. I think they still have that, right? They didn't discontinue that.

Start time: 5441.38
End time: 5488.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't follow it that closely. So 10 X is not going to happen,  but Microsoft says features of 10 X will make it their way into windows.  I really thought windows was due for a kind of revamping to be more secure, get rid of wind 32,  really lock it down a little bit more. You know, I don't think it's fair. MIT technology review says  that the problem with ransomware is a governmental problem because we ignored it for four years under  Trump. Steve Gibson, I also don't think it's fair said the problem with ransomware is windows period.  It's such crappy bug ridden insecure software that, you know, if we didn't have to use that,  we wouldn't have the problem. I'm not sure that's completely if all of these are some slightly true,

Start time: 5488.56
End time: 5492.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right? They're running windows 98 still. That's the issue. That's exactly it is the challenge is

Transcript:  that it's not Microsoft security profile today. It's Microsoft security profile 20 plus years ago  that's still running software in places that are important, which is just bananas, but not the  metaphorical bananas, not the real bananas, the Okinawa bananas. Well, and also, you know,

Start time: 5512.28
End time: 5608.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  every patch Tuesday, there's roughly on the order of a hundred fixes. And if all of them were for  legacy code, I'd say, okay, great. They're just going through the code, fixing it. When there's  a problem, they fix it. But they are introducing new flaws as well, unfortunately. So that's not  it. I don't know. I feel like so what Paul and Mary Jo said, and I hope this isn't true. I really  hope that windows 11 is as Microsoft has said every time the most secure version of windows ever,  just like Apple says, the thinnest iPad we've ever made. Well, you wouldn't want this one's  not as secure as last time, but you know, it's, it's secure-ish. You don't want them to tell the  truth. But I think the real point of this, according to Paul and Mary Jo, and this is very  disappointing to me is that to juice PC sales, the, the, for years, the only reason people  upgraded windows is when they bought a new PC. That's how you get the new windows, right? Most  you and I, we tech enthusiasts, maybe we go out and we get the next, the new version of Windows,  but most people, they use the version of Windows that came with their PC and they only get a new  version when they get a new PC. So Microsoft, according to Paul and Mary Jo, who probably  should know better than anybody, Microsoft says, well, we had a good year in PCs last year because  of the pandemic, but it's going to be a terrible year. Everybody was going to buy a PC for their  kid, got one. We got to do something about it. I know a new version of windows, everybody would go  to the store to buy a new PC. Is that credible? Maybe they should get a video with like the

Transcript:  Leo, I mean like the ransomware is an economic crime. It just becomes so lucrative that they  can afford to put resources behind making the ransomware and any security system that involves  humans is flawed in some way or another because they can make it really secure and then you'll  get somebody to, Oh, I'm going to remove all this. There's always, if there's incentive,

Start time: 5645.46
End time: 5666.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it'll happen is what you're saying. Yeah. Well, I honestly, if you want to blame something  for ransomware, blame Bitcoin. Ransomware was around before cryptocurrencies, but remember  they would say, go down to the seven 11 and buy some, uh, what do they, what do they call those?  A little iTunes gift cards, gift cards and send them to us. It was, it was really a, you know,

Start time: 5666.88
End time: 5675.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a kind of a minor problem at that time. One step above like drop the money in a bag in this trash  can at the corner of the park. Cause there was no good payment scheme. And as soon as cryptocurrency

Start time: 5684.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Blame Bitcoin for everything. It's all Bitcoin's fault. Uh, no, the Bitcoin bros are  going to hate me now. I'm in deep trouble. They hate you. It's not safe, right? I can't blame  Dogecoin. Uh, anyway, we'll find out June 24th, windows 11. I remember when windows seven came out,  Microsoft set out party packs. I got one. You remember that John, you were supposed to have  a launch party in your home and they sent out like streamers and balloons. And I had playing  cards that said windows seven. It was like, I don't know if it worked, but it was really,  did you know? Was that windows XP? 95 was start me up. That was the last windows launch that I  think people really got excited about. And that was for good reason. 95 was a big leap forward.

Start time: 5733.06

Transcript:  I think I went to the windows 2000 launch and they had Santana there to play. That's pretty good.  The matchbox 20 songs that everyone was again, no greater stars in the galaxy.

Transcript:  Yeah. Did they give people free you two songs for the windows?

Start time: 5750.38
End time: 5789.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the other thing that's happened is Microsoft in the days of windows 2000 and windows NT had  really two versions of windows data, 98, 95, the consumer version, which was, yeah, on insecure.  You know, if you, if you forgot your password on windows 98, no problem. Just hit return and you're  in. And then they had NT, which was designed for enterprise and was much more secure with XP.  Microsoft kind of unified those. It's kernel, right? We hope it's all going to be NT from now on.  Now I'm told again by the experts, Paul and Mary Jo, that we're going to have another fork in the  road where we have windows 11, a consumer version of windows and windows 10, a business version of

Start time: 5789.84
End time: 5884.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  here's okay. Hey, Apple guy is going to talk about Microsoft. So everybody just gather around.  The challenge Microsoft has is not that they're not smart and not that they're not creative and  not that they don't want to do good things. I have seen over the last decade plus so many really good  products come out of Microsoft, get announced by Microsoft. The problem is that Microsoft has  such market share and such legacy and has to maintain this existing pool of users that every  time they try to escape their own gravity pulls them back. Like I was at the conference  when they announced their touch interface that was Metro at the time. Right. And I thought,  oh my God, they got it. They figured it out. They're going to, they're going to blow the iPad out  of the water. This is going to be amazing. And like a year later, they're like, no, forget it.  Forget it. Actually in that demo, they're like, no, no, don't worry. If you press this button,  it's just Excel. It's like guys, you were right there, but they can't. And so I,  I feel for Microsoft. They had a phone. Windows Phone was a great phone. I really liked Windows.  It was a great operating system. The people at Microsoft are so smart and so good at making  this stuff. The challenges that they've got their existing support channel and sales channel and  their legacy hardware partners. And that actually Surface being such a good product line. Surface is  an example of, of Microsoft almost at Apple. Microsoft breaking out and saying, what if we  made our own hardware? And it's like, yes, and it's good. Yes. Be, be more like Apple,  Microsoft, but they can't, they kind of can't. And Paul says this all the time. They have Apple

Start time: 5889.06
End time: 5900.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  advertise against their own OEMs. So they advertise against Apple and people just look at it going,  but I don't want Apple. I don't care if it's an iPhone or I'm buying Windows. Like why should  I buy you instead of Adele? And they can't say. I think it's more of a tragedy than a point and

Start time: 5900.98
End time: 5908.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  laugh. I'm not pointing and laughing. No, it is a tragedy. I think it's a tragedy because I think  that they have done some amazing stuff and it's almost like their customers and their partners

Start time: 5908.72
End time: 5951.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  won't let them. I've said this before and I really think it's true because such an Adele came from  the Azure division. He is very much a cloud guy and he's already kind of repositioned the company.  Ultimately you want to fix ransomware. You want to fix security. You want to fix this legacy problem.  You don't run windows on prem. You run windows in the cloud. And I think ultimately that's going to  be what happens. It's going to be Windows virtual desktop. It's going to be Windows from the data  center. Let Microsoft handle it. And they actually offer this as a product that's expensive right  now. They have supposedly been talking about launching something this year that's Windows  desktop in the cloud. And I think that that's really- Or they could make Christina Warren CEO

Start time: 5951.46

Start time: 5954.96
End time: 5963.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at all. She doesn't care. No, legacy is definitely the millstone around their neck that's always  kept them from- And that's what's been always been great about Apple is they're willing to say to

Start time: 5964.02
End time: 6003.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their users, sorry, it's over. Get out of there. Microsoft was desperate to keep Windows. Microsoft  made that classic blunder of thinking Windows was their business and not their product where Apple  was like, we don't need the iPod anymore. We have the iPhone. We don't need the Mac anymore. The  iPad. Oh, well, we'll let them fight it out. That's fine. And Microsoft, especially under Balmer,  was so- Everything had to be Windows and nothing could challenge Windows. And he scuttled three or  four amazing- From the courier to the experiment- I forget the name of that, experimental operating  system. He just kept killing every bit of beautiful innovation that came out of that company  for a decade. And we thought that we escaped when Nadella took over and when Panos Panay took over  more and more things, but to Jason's point, they still have that gravity. They can't escape their

Start time: 6003.64
End time: 6033.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  enterprise Windows legacy. Yeah. And if they did cut the cord and make a brand new version of Windows  that did everything they wanted it to do, but wasn't really backward compatible, what would have  happened is that nobody would upgrade to it and everybody would use old versions of Windows that  are broken and insecure forever. So they can't force their users. It's just a fascinating thing,  but I think what's amazing about it is they keep trying to be as creative as they possibly can be.  And I give them full credit for that. It's a struggle for them.

I just started watching it, but somebody told me that season two,  in fact, I'm wishing I could find a synopsis for season two, involves the FBI coming up with  a, an encrypted messaging program that they convinced the bad guys to use.

Start time: 6094.38
End time: 6302.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  them get coffee. Yeah. It could have been one or the other. They were close with both. So the,  apparently it was over drinks with the Australian federal police. They came up with this idea of,  they conceptualize, according to Enam was the result of like-minded and passionate,  passionate individuals in the AFP and FBI thinking differently to solve the common problem of the use  of encrypted communications for criminals. The individuals did conceptualize some of this over  a beer from there. They worked on a plan. They could work in was legal and resembled,  strikingly resembled a show on crackle, which had been aired the year before. No, I added that part.  So Enam is a fascinating story though, because the trick was how do we get the bad guys to use  these, this encrypted messenger? How do we get them to trust it?  By the time they pulled the plug on June 7th, last week, 9,000 encrypted devices were in  circulation. They, hundreds of arrests were made. And it turns out that they did a couple of things,  which were brilliant. For one thing, they charged $2,000 to use this every six months. They made it  really expensive, which apparently if you're a bad guy, you go, wow, this has got to be good.  It's like a gold encrusted iPhone.  Yeah, it's got to be good. The other thing they did is they made it, you can't get an Enam  unless you are referred, invited by somebody else. Just like Clubhouse, you got to get an invite.  And so it was one drug dealer inviting another drug dealer, again, reassuring the crooks,  oh, this must be good because Joey Grenade Balls, Greta Flouy says this is the best.  But the best thing they did was they got a quote, significant crime figure in the Middle East,  an Australian born guy who's now in, by the way, he skipped bail in Cyprus. He's now in  Istanbul. They can't get him. Named Joseph Hakan Ayik. He was patient zero with Enam. They got him,  I don't know how, they got him to use it and recommend it. And hey, if Ayik's used it,  Ayik's using it, it's got to be good. The funny thing is they're now saying,  apparently he's leading a lavish lifestyle in Istanbul.  Should he use Borat? It would have been way safer.  The Australian police force spokesman Ryan says,  Ayik's use of the device was perceived as an endorsement and the platform grew exponentially  from there. Now the Australian police are saying, Ayik, everybody thinks you set them up.  So you should turn yourself in because if we don't get you, they're going to get you.  For your own safety, you should give yourself up. I would be celebrating this. They arrested  a lot of people. They broke up a lot of rings of criminals of all kinds.  It was a real success story, except that key line, because we can't break encrypted communications,  we're going to do our own. I'm really worried that this is going to become the proof that the  FBI and Australian federal police and others want to say.

Apparently this all happened because there was a tip given to  somebody on a blog who said all that Anam stuff is going through the US and they verified it.  That blog post has since been deleted. Apparently that is when the arrests began.  Yeah, because why not? They had to keep doing it forever.  Exactly. They had to pull the plug at that point.

Transcript:  Interesting. Anam, this is from a story on Computer Weekly, began spreading slowly in Australia.  The phones were sold through word of mouth recommendations passed on by a network of  criminal distributors set up by the FBI's informant. We don't know who the informant was.  Probably was not Ayik, but maybe. Sales took off during the summer of 2019 as demand increased  both inside Australia from other countries. It's a viral hit.  This is like an episode of The Wire.  It's so great. Users in Europe paid a fee of around a thousand to fifteen hundred dollar euros  for a six month subscription paid in Bitcoin. Here's an example conversation of an encrypted  message on Anam. I have a cargo ship with the captain on side too. They want to throw overload  as they leave. So once the tugboats release the pilot boat guides them out to sea once  the pilot boat leaves, we message saying throw. They'll throw right away. Can you do this? If so,  what's your fee? Oh yeah, they could definitely catch it. They charge twenty dollar door fee,  twenty percent door fee. So these are the kinds of conversations. They were just wide open.  Imminent threats resulted in automated alert to investigation teams within the AFP and law  enforcement partners to start those arrests. Wow. What a story. In one way, it's just a  really great sting. Well done.

They couldn't monitor you, but the Australian federal police could.  So that's interesting. They use the telecommunications and other  legislation amendment, the Assistant and Access Act of 2018 to allow these law enforcement  agencies in Australia to order technology companies to assist secretly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we couldn't tell you then because that's how the law works in the United States. There's a  gag order. A federal judge said, you cannot disclose the subpoena. I guess that makes sense.  You don't want to tell the bad guys that they're being observed.  Apple said we complied, but once that gag order expired, May 5th, they told everybody,  including Don McGahn, Eric Swalwell of California, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and  others in the Intelligence Committee, ostensibly looking, it was a federal grand jury that issued  the subpoena looking for leaks. Although I don't know why you would surveil the President's

Transcript:  Apple said we regularly challenge warrants, subpoenas and non-disclosure orders and have  made it our policy to inform affected customers of governmental requests about them just as soon as  possible. In this case, there was a non-disclosure order signed by a federal magistrate provided no  information on the information of the investigation and it would have been virtually impossible  for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users' accounts.  Consistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to account subscriber  information and did not provide content such as emails or pictures. So it's metadata. But we do  know that metadata can be very useful in this. Who's talking to who when? You know, you could put  together a lot. It believes other tech companies received similar orders. Microsoft told CNBC that  they had received a similar subpoena from the DOJ in 2017. The DOJ's watchdog is currently  investigating the probe to see whether it was politically motivated, which it might have been  and might not. Might not. But anyway, this is going to happen all the time. Apple has to obey  the laws of the land it's in, including, by the way, China. Sure. It's weird to me. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple has to do what it has to do with subpoenas and they disclose them when they can. At the same  time that you're doing the privacy as a fundamental human right, it's a little contradictory. I feel  that they need to put an asterisk in there somehow or some sort of caveats.

Start time: 6670.24
End time: 6706.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  extent that federal laws allow. I think the challenge is, and you saw this in the San  Bernardino shooting, right? They did a good job fighting it. Apple can engineer... They could try  to engineer more and more of their product to be unreachable by subpoena, but they also know the  further they go down that path, the more they risk laws being passed that demand that they not  engineer their products to be that level of security. So that's part of the challenge here,  but it's true. We value your privacy, but if a judge doesn't, then there's your asterisk  is in there somewhere. If the judge says no, then we have to give them all your stuff.

Transcript:  It's hard for any... I'm not going to give Apple a pass, but it's hard for any multinational company  to exist in this environment. Perfect example, Apple just released its supplier report in which  they said, you know, we're really doing our best for making sure there's no child labor, blah, blah,  blah. Information just had a story came out on Tuesday that some Apple suppliers in China are  telling ethnic minorities, don't bother applying for jobs. If you're a Muslim or a Uyghur,  don't apply for jobs. We're not going to hire you. Of course, then there's also the accusation that  they use Uyghur slave labor in some of these suppliers as well. So I'm not sure. You know,

Start time: 6742.42
End time: 6759.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this is tough. And I feel like I'm going to believe Apple when it says that it's got a  set of standards. I think the challenge here is that they're playing whack-a-mole.  Yeah, a whole bunch of suppliers that they cannot tear themselves away from. Plus it's the suppliers

Start time: 6760.12
End time: 6764.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6764.22
End time: 6783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they're like, oh, okay, well, I guess we'll have to tell them not to do that too. And then there'll  be something else that happens. And I think the big picture here is just that Apple is producing  so much of its product line in China at this point, and it doesn't really have very many  alternatives. And so it's kind of stuck. It's hoisted by its own petard here.

Transcript:  Here are a couple of examples from Wayne Ma's article in the information. One April job ad  from Beale Crystal, a company that makes iPhone cover glass, says, quote, Tibetans, Uyghurs,  Hui, Yi, Dongxiang from Tibet or Xinjiang regions not accepted. Another example for Cathay Tat Ming,  which makes stamp metal parts for iPhone said, minorities without dietary restrictions are  accepted. Uyghurs excluded and on and on. The information said more than 30 of the 100 online  job ads, most of which were posted within the last 18 months, explicitly mentioned the posts  were related to Apple work. But because some of the suppliers work for other brands besides Apple,  they left out anything that didn't mention Apple.

Start time: 6831.16
End time: 6844.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. So it may also be that Apple has certain standards. And what that means is they're like,  okay, you know, over here is the Apple stuff. We'll follow the standard.  Yeah. And then the rest of us have a factory. We're still going to run our factory with whatever.

Transcript:  Yeah. And Apple is responsible for such a huge part of the economy in southern China. Like when  you go through Shenzhen and all those states that it's, it's non-trivial for the Chinese  government to manage that relationship as well. Right.

Start time: 6855.32
End time: 6887.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not a one-sided relationship. I think that that's something that's easy to lose sight of is  China benefits greatly from having all of Apple's business there, but Apple also benefits greatly  and has so much of its business there that it kind of can't get out. And there aren't really  any alternatives. And so there is a push and pull. And this seems to be one of the places where  this story notwithstanding, it seems like Apple has done a better job of identifying abuses and  trying to change the culture in these places to the best of its ability. But how much is that

Transcript:  really? That's, you know, this is U S policy in general, which is you want to promote democracy,  liberalism and freedom, but at the same time you have to live in the world and not everybody  believes the same way you do. And you, you know, there are plenty of people in the United States  who think we should just put up walls and, and, you know, leave the rest of the world out.  Apple's point of view is we think we bring up the, and I think a lot of people in the, in the  West believe this as well. We improve situ the conditions wherever we are by participating as  opposed to engagement, engage, you know, Google didn't, Google said, we're not going to deal with  China. We don't want to deal with it. We're not going to sell to China. I think both of those are

He made some smart investments.  The problem is how do you get that deal flow? How do you know where to make those smart investments?  I want to tell you about our crowd. If you wish you were in early on some of the best performing  IPOs of last year and the year before, our crowd investors were, and now you can join them in what's  next. It's a really interesting idea. Our crowd has accredited investors who have access to invest  directly, easily, and most importantly early in some of the most exciting new companies that are  going to have big exits. They're going to get acquired. There's a really big opportunity here.  And because you're working with real VCs who are getting the deal flow, by the way, VCs who put  their own money into it. So you're a partner with them. You're not like somebody they're going to  bring in. Our credit investors have benefited from our crowd companies IPOing like Beyond Meat,  or being bought by companies like Intel, Nike, Microsoft, and Oracle. Plus it's fascinating  to learn about these new companies. So our crowd starts with investment professionals, real venture  capitalists who have an extensive network. They do in-depth due diligence, include meeting with  the management teams, and generally comprehensive vetting of deals. They decide to make part of  their own portfolio. So they're putting their money in here. They're investing too. Once our  crowd has selected a deal, they offer accredited investors the opportunity to invest alongside  with them on the same terms. Now I should tell you, you have to be an accredited investor.  What that means varies in country to country. You can go to our crowd and join for free and read up  on whether you're eligible. The requirements in the US are different than other countries,  but you should read up on that. But if you're qualified, you can join our crowd for free,  ourcrowd.com slash twit. You can take a look at the current deals once you're a member.  You don't give them any money. You don't have to until you decide this is a deal I want to  participate in. As you review deals, you'll have access to the investor relations team too. So you  can talk directly on the phone to people about what your goals are. They might say to you that  this would be a good one for you. This might not be the right one for you. They've already reviewed  thousands of companies and that's key. They call it deal flow, getting access to these small  startups, private companies no one knows about yet and finding out about them so that you can  invest. They've already invested hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money.  They have closed investments in over 200 companies. They've chosen dozens of companies that have made  exits. So if you're an accredited investor, you could participate in a single company deal for as  little as $10,000. That's how much to get started. You don't have to put in millions to do this. This  is actually a great way for you to become part of something that's very, very exciting.  Or you can get into one of our crowd's funds. They do funds too for as little as $50,000.  This would be, I wouldn't say this is your only investment. This is a way to diversify. That's  why they're looking for accredited investors because they want to make sure you understand  what you're getting into. Minimum of $10,000 required to invest. Investment terms are going  to vary depending on what country you're in. Of course, all of this is explained when you go  to this site. Just put the country you're investing from in there and they'll tell you exactly what  the requirements are. I think this is really interesting. So let me give you an example  right now of an investment they're getting into. It's called Moodify. You can join right now our  crowd's investment in Moodify. It's radically altering the multi-billion dollar fragrance market.  How are they doing that? Digitizing scents. This is the first company that have done this. They  develop software that enables function specific scents. So things like improve mental performance.  This one I'm going to get eliminate the perception of bad odors and much more. Before people come  back to the studio, I got to get that. You can get in early on Moodify and other opportunities.  There are many more at ourcrowd.com slash twit. And if you're interested in investing,  you have to join first. You have to be accredited. There is a minimum investment. I want you to know  that all upfront. But the ourcrowd account is free. O-U-R-C-R-O-W-D.com slash twit. I want you to know  about this. I think it's a very interesting opportunity. I've sat by on the wayside while  so many people I know have become very, very wealthy investing in companies that I'm looking  at going, I know this is going to be huge. I think of people like Kevin Rose who got on Twitter  in like 2007 at the very beginning. This is an opportunity to do that. So if you're in a position  financially where this makes sense for you, I think you really should check it out. Ourcrowd.com  slash twit. Not for everybody. I understand that. But for people who want to diversify their  portfolios and have the money to do so, this is a very interesting opportunity. Ourcrowd.com slash  twit.

But the goal of all of these startups is to create something  that's not affordable, but actually extremely expensive, but they can land sort of anywhere.  They're VTOLs. They're a virtual vertical takeoff and landing.

He conceived and built  the initial versions, but was fired in May by Sebastian Thrun, who's the CEO of Kitty Hawk and  Larry Page, former founder of Google and money man behind Kitty Hawk. Because they disagreed,  sources according to Forbes said Vanderland thought the risk strategy that Thrun and Page were  pursuing was too risky. So who did they hire to replace him? The former editor of Wired magazine.  Chris Anderson.  Chris Anderson, who probably is a great engineer. I don't know, maybe not. He was the co-founder of  3D Robotics, which remember tried to make a drone to compete with the DJI.

Transcript:  It's more like Patreon.  It's interesting.  And they've, they've confounded it with a newsletter service, sort of just bake that right in there.  And it's, it's interesting because we're watching Instagram sort of try to find its way by doing  affiliate revenue for creators and TikTok and Snap have creator funds.  YouTube just does direct payments through AdSense and now they're adding applause and they have  memberships and they're all trying to figure out ways to sort of share the money, but not  really share the money.  And I don't think it's not democratic enough because  people are giving them vast amounts of data and unless you're a creator, you're not getting  anything back from those platforms.  So it's like half a step diagonally in one direction that might be slightly forward.  Happy anniversary to the 8086.

Start time: 8237.74
End time: 8268.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  42 years ago, Intel's 16 bit architecture that actually created the X86 architecture.  We're still using the designers at the time.  Extreme Tech had a great article on the 42nd anniversary.  The designers at the time thought this is just a temporary chip, just a temporary,  the according to Stephen P Morse, who led the development of the 8086, the new CPU was  quote, intended to be short lived and not have any successors.  42 years later, we can't get away from X86.

Start time: 8270.66
End time: 8285.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what made that architecture succeed was that it was in IBM PCs or things like that  at the time.  And that's, and then everybody wanted all their software.  Standardized on that and then escape the gravity.  That's when the gravity started for Microsoft.  Yeah, right then.

Start time: 8285.48

Start time: 8287.96
End time: 8340.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did make decisions that made it easy to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier  Intel products.  So even the X86 was wearing the Milstone of legacy.  Wow.  The designer Morse notes that had he known he was inventing an architecture that would  power computing for the next 40 years, he would have done some things differently,  including using a symmetric register structure and avoiding something that still gets me  something called segmented addressing, which is clearly a kludge.  When I first, I had been programming for the Mac for the 68,000, which had a flat memory  architecture and was beautiful.  It had a uniform registers and had all the things the X86 didn't.  When I started reading the documentation for the next 86, I said, what, you can't address  all the memory at once.  You can always.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it won.  68,000 was the beta max.  Sad to say the X86 was the VHS.  And then finally, well, actually two more stories.  One very interesting.  I'll be watching with interest.  El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender.  It was using the US dollar, but it wanted something less stable, I guess.  So, so yeah, you can now pay your taxes in El Salvador and Bitcoin.  You can buy stuff in Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's crazy.  I don't.  Yeah, it's just so volatile.  It seems like it might be a bad choice for a national currency.  But the part of the problem is about 70% of the El Salvador population doesn't have  access to banks or any other traditional financial services.  So this way they can they can create an jump, skip the bank thing and go straight to the  crypto thing.  Skip the copper.  Bitcoin is is kind of it was up 230% over the last 12 months.  So it's very volatile.  But now it's back down a little bit.  It's just crazy.  And finally, I will end with this because this is our comedy segment.  Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas.

Thank you all for joining us.  We do This Week in Tech every week, believe it or not.  It's hard to believe something this wonderful could be on weekly, but it really is.  I'm just kidding.

If you're doing that, the chat room is live at irc.twit.tv.  There's also a kind of another room going on in our Discord, which I really enjoy.  Renee, I saw you were in there.  If you are a member of Club Twit, you can, which is something we just launched recently,  and it's been going great, by the way.  Thank you everybody for participating.  Seven dollars a month gets you ad free versions of all of our shows, ad free and as a result,  tracker free.  But you also get access to the Discord, which was we thought we're just going to throw this  in and turns out to be really wonderful place to hang out.  We've been having a lot of fun in there.  We do a Linux show on Saturdays.  There's stuff we can do thanks to Club Twit that we really couldn't do before.  We also have a twit plus feed of stuff that didn't make it into the podcasts.  Additional stuff.  We're actually going to trial a new show in there for breaking tech news.  So that'll be something to watch for.  And there's also this, the ad free versions, the Discord and Club Twit, twit plus feed,  all of that for seven bucks a month.  I wanted to give it a plug because we'd love to have you in the club.  It shows your support for twit helps us keep doing what we want to do and provided enough  people show interest, we could do even more.  We're looking at going back to CES and things like that.

There's one for every show.  So you can watch our shows there on YouTube.  There's also a link to a variety of different podcast clients,  but you can use any podcast client with the RSS feed.

A five star review would be much appreciated if your podcast client allows that.  We also have our twit forums for people who are watching after the fact.  It's a little less live than the chat and the discord,  but it's really a great place for conversation.  twit.community www.twit.community  We also run Mastodon, which is a Fediverse,  federated version of Twitter at twit.social.
