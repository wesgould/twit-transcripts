Transcript:  This is twit this week in tech episode eighteen for August fourteenth two thousand five.  So ladies and gentlemen it's time for this week in tech the number one podcast.  No I'm sorry the number two no we're not number two no we're number two number four.  The number one podcast in the nation according to iTunes.  I'm Leo Laporte joining me in the studio Mr. Patrick Norton on Skype today.  David Prager, Steve Gibson, Robert Heron and Roger Chang and via phone.  From the engine room of the good ship Dvorak it's John C. Dvorak.  We had to put him on the phone because those diesel engines can really kick up quite a lot of noise John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well you know I think that's the way they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The pocket of pocket of machines.  So you're running biodiesel down there John?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  French fries everything smells like french fries.  I smell like chicken fat.  Everything smells like chickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey you know what normally we'd start the show with what we thought was the top story of the week.  But I think we're gonna toss it to John because John's a little upset about Steve Gibson's spam filtering solution.  I hate to use the word solution because it's like the total evil marketing phrase.  I think it works.  I like saying solution once in a while just because it feels so naughty.  But John you're a little upset about Steve's email management system.  Steve what would you call it? Your filtering tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wouldn't know because he doesn't get this mail.  Let me explain what he's got here.  Steve let me get the message up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait a minute you're talking about the fact that we don't allow HTML here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah listen to this.  There's a message going around everyone out there should know that kind of the inside baseball here when it comes to this show.  Everybody sends a memo out on Saturday and Sunday goes all over the place.  Check this link out we're gonna talk about this that and the other thing.  As if we plan this show.  Well you know there's actually better plan than what Leo used to do.  Anyway so you send a thing out reply to all and then you get this message back because Gibson's email being the Mickey Mouse system that it is.  Instead of actually doing some real work or getting a spam filter.  You get this message back that says your HTML email was refused by our server.  Hello your email to GRC.com was not delivered because it contains quote HTML formatting.  HTML stands for hypertext markup language.  It is the language used by the web pages on the world wide web.  Listen to this one.  It says nearly all unsolicited commercial email spam uses HTML.  This is bull by the way to create the what about those Nigerian letters.  I've never seen one of those in HTML.  Okay so it goes on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I send it back to them and be saying what is this BS.  And I get it back again because apparently there was a link in there.  So this is to me is just basically an insult to anyone trying to send Steve an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My email goes through fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because once Steve approves you because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't send HTML mail.  I agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well I know but you can send Steve HTML if he approves you to send it to him.  Hey HTML mail is not going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be happy to whitelist you John.  There is no way that HTML mail is disappearing.  We'll just put some grease on your email and it slides right in.  What's wrong with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve what's wrong with HTML email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh they hide tons of garbage inside of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I mean it really is the case that we're phenomenally buried by email unless we do that.  And we've tried it as an experiment to remove the HTML filter and it's just a phenomenal difference.  I think it's got to come out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Black Berkel over at computer time over here in the peninsula has a bunch of high and elaborate.  I would think you.  I get no spam at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who would say email should just be text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now wait a minute John do you get no spam because you have a minion of evil helpers that sort through your mail for you so it all shows up without the spam.  Or do you actually not get any spam.  It's GRC automated security.  I do not get any spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you do that.  Yeah John tell us.  How do you do that John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't do it.  Who does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Berkel he's like a genius.  He runs his little service called computer time which is the he's the guy.  I've known this guy for 25 years.  He started off being like a net wear guy and had a thing called Mark's Menu back in the 80s.  Is this something we can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah we could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could we use this.  You just have to go through his system with your mail and it'll just get cleared right out.  Does he offer this as a commercial service or do you have to be a friend of his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it softwaretime.com is that his website.  It's www.ctyme.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use something similar.  I use server side email spam protection from mail route which does work very well.  Cloud Mark same thing works very well.  Bright Mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right this actually works better than Bright Mail.  But I mean he actually has my server.  I mean he does the whole thing for me.  But he can do just the email part of it.  And I get no spam.  None.  None.  I even get I mean I still get 10 or 15.  10 or 15 a day.  One thing will sneak in a week.  And then you send it back to Mark and you'll never see it again.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the URL.  Ctyme.com.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't get there but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because it's blocking you Patrick you're using HTML.  Well it's computer type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay so this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now why do you John why do you say HTML email is not going away.  I mean it is a blight.  The bit mail is bloated.  It hides stuff.  It's ugly.  You don't think in credit mail is a good thing surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually you know what.  Wait so this guy.  HTML based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's email service is HTML based.  Yeah but you can turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's true.  But I mean by default.  Well all web mail is going to.  It's not going away because the general public doesn't know what the hell anybody would what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Gibson is talking about when it comes to this like refusal to.  In fact I think most people if they were writing to Steve when they got that memo they'd go  I don't know what he's talking about.  Well then that's why he explains it so clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He explains it and it doesn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I talk about all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been saying on the radio show for two years don't use HTML mail.  I don't know if it's sinking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John not going away.  John you're now whitelisted so you can send me any crap that you want to and it will come  right in.  From now on you're getting spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All from Dvorak.org.  So Computer Time is your web host John and they're using spam assassin to filter your  email.  Oh he's a spam assassin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No spam assassin is only one of the many mechanisms he uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay well according to his website he's using spam assassin and xm rules.  Spam assassin is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think spam assassin is excellent.  And many people have it.  They don't know it.  Their internet service provider would turn it on if they asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in your case John.  We also know in many instances where spam assassin falls positives and like blocks people who  have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what I do with spam assassin.  First of all turn off all real time black holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we should point out that spam assassin runs on your email server.  So these are all server sized issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So turn off the black hole stuff because you're right.  Maps and orbs will have lots of false positives.  So I turn that off.  The second thing you do is you set the setting fairly high.  You set it to 8 where the default is 6.5 I think or 6.  You set it to 8 and that way only the really most egregious stuff gets stopped.  But that's 80% of all stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay well let me tell you another thing that he does which is not mentioned there.  He uses a three stage filtering system and maybe spam it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You sound like you're advertising vodka John.  Does it have a micronite filter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I thought that was really good.  That's what made Kent so smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what if you guys don't want to hear about it it's fine with me.  I get no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three stage filter John.  Three stage filter.  My web based email does me just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay tell us about the three stage filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I'm not talking about it anymore.  I've already given enough publicity for this.  People out there just go check it out.  Seatime.com. Good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John's quoted on Seatime.com on the main page.  Well of course it says good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I plug the C-flight.  You know I don't plug John.  This guy's going to be so busy after this podcast goes public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one's going to be able to get an account.  Yeah well yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See that's when it's time for him to franchise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can we talk a little as Lawsmore said the said the word podcast.  We do a little inside baseball podcast issue because iTunes really screwed the pooch this week.  Did you guys see what happened?  No.  We're going to get Mikey on the show a little later on.  I'll get a little interview with Mike Lazazera who works on Call for Help with me.  Mike and Amber were preparing a segment on how to subscribe to a podcast on iTunes.  In order to do that as you know in TV he had to do it a few times to tape it and so forth.  He noticed he clicked maybe 10-15 times on the subscribe button.  This podcast was rising up through the iTunes ranks.  To try it again we got some third party people to verify it and he published it on his blog.  By the next day the weirdest podcasts were number one, two, three, four on the iTunes podcast list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait so our number one listing is faux?  I wouldn't get all excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got something to throw in on this.  What's that?  I didn't want to mention it but I might as well.  There's some mechanism out there that somebody buys.  It's one of these rating mechanisms.  It seems to stem from Amazon.  When we first came out with the Dvorak online, the book, we started noticing the same phenomenon.  If you start pounding the site within a short duration it jerks the numbers up.  In other words those values are all broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently what's happening is that iTunes is counting clicks on the subscribe button.  Not actual subscriptions, not downloads, which is stupid, but merely clicks.  There was a Spanish language podcast that only has one edition, released 8-6,  that was number two on the iTunes top list for most of Tuesday.  It's just nutty. A Spanish language. It's just nutty.  There are a lot of Spanish language speakers.  Dave's Ipak podcast, which by the way is a fascinating podcast all about Ipaks,  I should play you a little bit.  Let's not get snarky.  I know Dave, he's fine, nice guy.  A lot of people love the Ipak.  Come on, number one, the number one podcast.  It's not sour grapes, we've been in the top five for weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't we just create a bot and bang this thing and drop ourselves way up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't have to, we were number one.  The Mugglecast is now number one.  Okay, see what I mean?  See what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should have a bot, somebody write a bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, everybody while you're, oh there's my phone, while you're talking on the show right now,  just click the subscribe button a few times.  Exactly.  You just subscribe, you backspace, you subscribe, you backspace, that's all you have to do.  And I bet you we can be number one before the show's over.  That's anyway, Apple, you would think Apple would have fixed this.  Businessweek picked it up, I mean it's been all over the place and Apple has apparently not.  So just one more reason, look, it's the easiest way to get a podcast.  I'm not complaining, we're number two on there.  We've been high up on the list for a long time.  But it just shows you all of these polls, all of these numbers are nuts, they're worthless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John's been selling for a long time.  However, we do enjoy being number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under any circumstances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no matter what.  Pound it, pound it.  Yeah, we're clicking it right now.  Well that's the thing, I mean Chris Perillo was number one for a day and I think it was probably the same thing he just mentioned on this podcast.  I'm surprised Apple hasn't fixed it.  I'm sure they will by the time you hear this.  It's been a few days, hasn't it?  Yeah, it has.  But one good thing, this has proved that the iTunes New Music Tuesday doesn't have to be the number one podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, let me say something, as soon as Nielsen or somebody that really does this stuff properly and they actually charge money to get these numbers,  there's going to be no question in my mind that this will be the number one podcast in the country, or the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well we know just for the number of downloads that we're...  No, no, he's right.  And we know for the number of downloads we're getting on AOL that it's, you know, I mean I suppose there are other people with 300,000 subscribers but I find it hard to believe.  And these are based on downloads, not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would anyone want this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what baffles me, frankly.  I can't understand it.  It doesn't, it's baffling.  Alright, let's get to some tech news.  That's enough Inside Baseball.  Roger, you clearing your sinuses there?  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that.  Okay.  Can we get you a decongestant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's one to Lob and everybody's direction.  Intel's announcing a new architecture.  Yay!  So at the IDF forum, basically Intel's going to be offering the deets on their next generation of multi-core processors.  August 23rd.  At IDF.  What's new about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean I looked at the roadmap like a year ago and I couldn't...  What changed?  I mean what is it going to be now?  It's all Pentium M's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny you should mention that, John, because that's the exact same reaction I had.  Oh, they're moving to a new architecture.  Oh, big news.  No, they do this every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have to.  They say they haven't in five years.  This is the equivalent of a Pentium 4 announcement or...  Which, a Pentium 5 even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I think, I mean it's part of it.  Patrick, you probably thought...  Because I actually, to be honest with you, kind of cheated.  I sent a memo to AMD having them explain to me what their intelligence...  And the guy was on vacation.  So I couldn't get in yet.  Oh, cruel irony.  But irony.  But the question in my mind seems to be that is this new architecture actually Intel's  true dual core?  Because the dual core that they're bringing out initially is really a fake.  It's really two chips kind of on one...  Die.  One die.  And then the true dual core, which is a separate type of architecture, I believe maybe what  this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How is dual core different than two chips on one die?  Well, there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh boy.  It's actually, the dual core is kind of two chips on one die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the phony one is actually two chips in one chip package.  There you go.  There's a subtle but important difference between pretending your chip is two chips to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the operating system and actually having two chips on the same core.  So you could have two chips that's on the same plastic.  That's different than having the equivalent of two chips worth of transistors on one die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or one chip.  One die.  One plastic package.  Right.  Okay.  It's faster?  You know, the demos of these things is astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this what Apple was thinking of when they...  Obviously, if Intel's going to announce it August 23rd, they knew when they were talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to Apple.  Well, Apple may or may not have cared about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple's been stymied on making their...  They had no choice.  IBM was screwed up.  Yeah, their portable is faster for the last year.  I agree with Pat.  This is all about the...  The...  The...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The...  The...  The mobile stuff.  Yeah.  For Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, and the G5 on the desktop was less of a concern.  But basically, what's supposed to happen at IDF is they're supposed to announce the new  code names for the future platforms, what's going on with the upcoming chips.  And it's going to be interesting.  A lot of it's...  They're going to be pushing a lot of the stuff we associate with the Centrino platform, which  is the chip and the chip set and the 802, the wireless.  But it's...  There's going to be a single and what's going to be really cool is dual core Pentium M processors  are supposed to be announced.  Or basically, the Yona stuff is supposed to become official, the details on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't there something pointless about announcing a secret code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there is and there isn't.  But if you look at...  And this is an interesting thought.  Being a PR person is complicated enough, right?  Being a PR person for Intel while in a battle for the enthusiasts over the gaming market  while dealing with the fact that AMD is finally getting it together on mobile parts after  a number of years of making really interesting things and putting them in notebooks.  It's in the way they're just hounded from every different direction for information.  They probably are...  There's information, there's leaked information, there's leaked information that comes through  the vendors they work with and the suppliers.  It's probably important for them to officially say, this is the roadmap and this is what's  moving forward.  And the other thing is they're talking about 2006, getting the information out there.  I don't know, it'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting timing because they're saying it's going to come out right at exactly the  same time Apple said we'll have the high-end Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Intel's performance is kind of flat-lined on the desktop processors.  So it's going to be the successor to the Pentium 4 and the architecture...  What is it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pentium...  Isn't there a Pentium 5 or no?  I don't know.  Pentium 6?  Pentium dozens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At this point, like, at this point...  Pentium the 13th, part 2?  I don't know.  Can you imagine?  There's got to be at least a half dozen companies in the United States, much less the rest of  the world, that are just copying bizarre combinations of phenomes to create, like, future product  names.  Plaxo.  Oh no, it's T.V.  Actually, the Plaxo guy wants to talk to us because he claims it's big stuff.  We're going to have him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Don, you got me in a heap of hot water.  What?  We were complaining about Plaxo last week.  I wasn't complaining about it.  You were.  I was.  And Patrick was.  Do you like Plaxo, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've used Plaxo.  I find it somewhat annoying in various iterations, especially when you get these memos constantly.  But I've gone over and visited with the guys over there.  They seem honest.  I like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're honest.  I don't blame them.  I just think that this is a bad time to be asking for people's personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I did get somebody's reminder on their birthday the other day, and it was  like someone I knew very well.  I didn't know it was their birthday.  I'm going to note they're very pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Plaxo works.  Well, we'll talk to Todd Misannas at some point about Plaxo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they do have an extensive listing of their privacy.  You know, their pledge to privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got to tell you about it.  And again, I'm not maligning them, but anybody could say anything about privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I agree with you, Leo, but let me give you one other thing, which I actually  mentioned to these guys and I mentioned to all these guys who have these highfalutin  privacy things.  By the way, if you want to read a good one, read mine in my blog, by the way.  It's very amusing.  But I mentioned to some, yeah, this is the way you think right now, but what happens  when you sell the company to somebody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it always says somewhere in there, you know, subject to change without notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is what bothers me the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's also an issue here on this.  Did you see this AOL giveaway?  They're doing, they won an award against a spammer, New Hampshire spammer, 20-year-old  guy that got his Hummer 2 and $85,000 with the gold bars.  They're having a little giveaway, right?  And you sign up.  So you go to the site to sign up.  What do they want?  Your email address, your phone number and your home address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  What are they going to do with that?  Give you a gold bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm still like Scott Richter and his company paying $7 million to settle the suit with  Microsoft over spam.  That's the one that's still, you know, part of me is like, yeah, and part of me is like,  if he's got $7 million, how much does he have salted away in, you know, the Bahamas and  Swiss banks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a 20-year-old kid with a Hummer 2 and $100,000 in gold bars.  Not Scott Richter.  No, this other guy.  So as long as we talk about OS X, I suppose we should bring up this issue of the OS X.  I mean, I was at a meetup on Thursday and two kids sidled up to me and they said, here.  I said, what's this?  They said, OS X.  On a CD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On a CD.  For the PC?  For the PC.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have a copy?  I turned it down, John.  You what?  Holy mackerel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What, did you think you were going to get, sorry, it was some Canadian plant and they  were going to nail you at customs?  Never say no to a free seat.  Well, actually, the truth is that they probably could put some really nasty stuff on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I figured if they got it, I could get it.  That you couldn't get rid of it.  And anyway, it required VMware, so I didn't want to bother.  That's kind of lame.  A number of these OS Xs do, there's apparently some that don't.  Some are running natively, some are running on VMware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, the same image that is set up to run on VMware can be installed on a  hard disk and it boots native and it works just perfectly.  There are sites now that list all the different chip sets that are supported by this.  It took about a week for the TPM's code to be removed from the kernel and it's now out  and you can get it with BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting because they removed the code.  It actually was just an extension, which they deleted.  So, does that mean that Apple didn't...  Yeah, how serious is Apple at protecting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just not freaky.  Aren't there like a bunch of rumors flying about that maybe it was Steve's way of showing  how ineffective TPM...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would he want to do that?  Actually, what we're probably going to find out is that each of these individual installations  of the operating system have a specific identity code in them and there's developers that are  receiving knocks on their doors right now.  Are you in Canada?  Not you, Leo, but whoever released it is going to have a knock on their door from Apple's  attack lawyers.  That's why I turned it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would have never turned it down.  Well, I'll get it for you next time.  You know what I'd like to do is put it on a tablet PC and see if we can make a tablet  Mac.  Wouldn't that be cool?  That would be so fun.  I think it should because it's got Wacom drivers.  Where is it, Scott?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Almost as useful as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right, it'd be just as bad as it...  But at least we'd have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that'd be cool.  Also, the reports are when you run this thing not on top of VMware but natively, it blows  the socks off of any OSX running on TPM.  That's what I found interesting.  It's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've heard that?  It's way faster.  Everybody's agreeing on that, that it's super fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Well, maybe it's been optimized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's a better kernel than what's on their Windows XP.  Well, maybe it's been optimized, whatever.  I hope that's the one they sell is the optimized version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it is.  The full version isn't like some stripped down beta or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's apparent.  Now, there's videos on the net.  And it looks pretty much like the full OSX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this is the most sinister thing that's ever happened to the business.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as you have an SSE 3 machine, one of the later P4s, it will run all the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, what does this mean?  Does it mean that Steve Jobs knew this was going to happen?  He had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have a whole theory in my PCMeg.com column this week, if anyone wants to go check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd like to hear it.  Why don't you just give us a preview?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was exactly what you're saying.  I think the whole thing is a scheme, you know, to make it look like, oh, no, we're trying to protect it.  We're trying to protect it.  We're doing everything we can.  You know, we don't want to compete with the – we don't want to hurt the feelings of our regular Mac users.  We don't want to, you know, step on Microsoft's territory.  We're trying to protect it.  Meanwhile, you know, they do a crummy job of it because they're going to really roll it out eventually.  And eventually – and the end result is Steve's going to come out and say, well, you know, this thing is in such demand,  people were stealing it left and right, we had to release it to the general public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what's the percentage in doing that, maybe to convince the board, maybe to –  I think it's a publicity stunt.  Publicity.  But what you've done is created a whole bunch of hackers who figured out how to crack this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a publicity stunt for a very narrow section of the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although – yeah, I know, but once it – if it becomes a scandal and he starts to threaten to sue people  and he wants to do this and that and the other thing, it could get a lot of ink.  And the general public, the regular PC user who maybe doesn't care about the Mac, would say, huh,  I wonder what the fuss is all about.  Maybe I should go check this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why are people working so hard to do this unless it's something better? Yeah.  Well, it also – he probably loves hearing how much faster it's running, right?  Well, and you know how Gates loves all this, too.  Oh, Bill's got to be having nightmares.  He's got to be having nightmares.  Yeah, there's got to be a nightmare.  That's wonderful.  This is not a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I actually haven't seen any of those sites, but has anyone actually tried running normal Mac OS X apps on top of –

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got this Rosetta built into it, right, Steve?  Exactly. So PowerPC stuff will run on this natively also.  How well?  Well, through the emulation layer.  So as well as Apple was going to make it available for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Rosetta's a pretty impressive piece of software from what I've heard from people that are playing around with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just curious as to how all their content creation software will run and whether or not they – whoa, it runs faster on this –

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The big thing they did at the announcement was they had the guys from Mathematica up.  And basically like three days – and take it with a grain of salt – three days before the conference, the president of Mathematica gets a phone call, says,  could you bring your code, a compiler, and a tech and meet us in Cupertino?  And he's like, why?  And they're like, there's something we really want you to see.  We'll get you a plane.  So he flies out the tech, the code, on a hard firewire hard drive.  They recompile it, and apparently with some minor tweaks.  And this is – basically their code was in the right configuration.  They weren't using the older code base.  But they recompiled it in a couple of hours, and it ran fine.  And it ran great.  And they didn't have problems.  And Mathematica's got a lot of older algorithms.  Now for the – gosh, somebody help me out here.  Leo, there's Cocoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Carbon, Cocoa are the two different kinds of native.  And then there's the compatibility, the OS 9 compatibility, which nobody's using anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, a lot of people, a lot of smaller vendors are still using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the time, if you're running on OS 10, you're running as a carbon application.  Even Final Cut Pro is carbon.  If you've been written from scratch for OS 10, you'll be using Cocoa.  Mathematica was probably carbon.  I would be surprised if it was Cocoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the idea is that all the older software, it's time to get on the Cocoa or Carbon.  And the newer stuff should recompile with no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I should have taken that disc, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the – John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just sent you email that gives you the string you can Google for.  You can find the BitTorrent and the Cirque du Soleil installation instructions all over the place now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But John, if I had taken that disc, crossed the border, brought it into the United States, and then handed it to you, who would have gone to jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think – you know, the point is – well, for one thing, it's silly to think that anybody would go to jail.  But the point is that you're actually writing for Wired magazine.  I'm a journalist. I write for public – I'm not like a phony journalist.  Well, just like –  I mean, doing research on this kind of stuff is just common to do. It's an investigative thing.  Thank you.  I don't see that there's an issue here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the only problem is the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good thing I'm not writing for the New York Times. I could be in jail right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what? The DMCA, they're not going to push it when it comes to something like this because this is already out there all over the place.  And were they going to make an example of the wrong people? I just don't see it happening.  Not us. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, Valerie Plame, CIA agent.  What about Bob Novak? I know this is completely off the point, but –  Why didn't he get indicted? Why didn't he get –  No, just I love the way that he got thrown off CNN. Was that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't he just get up and storm out because he got an argument?  He got an argument with –

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he first swore in a way that you can't on public TV. This was a live program.  And then took his microphone off, stood up and stomped off the set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All this to avoid being asked about.  Exactly.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was avoidance behavior.  Yeah.  Because he was going to get – Carville was going to ask him about the situation with Plame, and then he got wind of it from somebody.  And then so he decided to walk from the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you ever do that, John, if I were to ask you about skull and bones or something?  No, I'd laugh and then I'd accuse you of something.  See, that's the way. Take the offensive. Take the offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, having only seen about 30 seconds of Novak in my life, I'd like to say on a scale of 1 to 10 in intelligence and sophistication,  I'm pretty sure Dvorak knocks him well into the lower percentiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really doubt it, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a smart guy, but anyway. Hey, how about this mobile phone, the cabbier virus, spreading through the world athletic championships? Did you see that?  No.  No.  Okay, 19 people got it. But still, it's a proof of concept.  It's a lot. And of course, it's a mobile phone virus that spreads via Bluetooth, so you have to be in proximity.  So what do you have? Well, you're in Helsinki, the mobile phone capital of the world. Everybody's got Nokias and Ericsons, right? Everybody.  Well, it's Europe. They all have those GSM-y phones.  They've all got phones. And this cabbier virus is a Symbian, I think it's Symbian-based virus. Anyway, it requires Bluetooth.  Apparently, at least several dozen people caught it in the stadium because they were in proximity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. In Europe, they say in Europe, there's about 19% of the phones are Bluetooth enabled. In the states, it's about 7%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go. So there's more, higher penetration. The problem is you have to say to Bluetooth, accept files, which is not the default.  I don't know why you would do that. To get those games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to download those ringtones. Or the wallpapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I can't remember what cabbier... That's not the one that turns all your icons into skull and bones, is it? There's one that does that.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It infects smartphones running Symbian Series 60 using Bluetooth.  It's a Series 60 phone. Yeah.  It drains the power of the infected phones as it tries to propagate, but otherwise relatively harmless, according to an article on the register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It drains the power because it's always looking for other Bluetooth phones.  Hmm.  All right. We're going to... That was Robert Young on the phone, the man who started Red Hat.  I think we had him on the screensaver. He gave me a Red Hat, which somebody snagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no. I remember it very well. You gave it to one of my guests. What's his name? The guy who invented Fuzzy? Logic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. The guy who invented Fuzzy Logic said, oh, that's it. Well, here's what happened. He's sitting there. I can't remember his name. He's the guy who invented Fuzzy Logic, right?  And he says, wow, that's a nice Red Hat. I'd sure like that Red Hat. Boy, I wish you'd give me that Red Hat.  Oh my goodness. So I had to give him the Red Hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd say give it to me. I think you're exaggerating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's my guest. I'm being a good host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was a great guest. He was a good host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to get a couple of Hawaiian shirts off of you. You never coughed them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should have let me know, John. We have ways of providing Leo's wardrobe.  A lot of people had keys for that wardrobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm resurrecting those Hawaiian shirts now that Call for Help is... Oh, I can't tell you. I'm so sorry. I wish I could. It's a secret. Until somebody puts out a press release.  It's like, you know, why aren't they putting out a press release? Think of all the publicity they've missed out. I could have mentioned it on my radio show. We could have mentioned it on Twitter. Can't say a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's all about control, Mr. Laporte, and who has it. And apparently you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We definitely don't want to prevent it from happening.  So I'm not going to say anything. That's exactly right. I don't want to... They win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've already said, guess what about Call for Help about six or eight times so people might be able to guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's being translated into Chinese.  Yes!  Leo's finally my major pace off. That's right. You can actually speak Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's more Chinese than anybody else.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the penetration of PCs in China is high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, is there anything you want to talk about? Because Bob is going to unfortunately have to use his phone lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just the one thing. There's a thing out there called the Job Destruction Newsletter that's done by Rob Sanchez.  I love this.  And he got killed by AOL. They blocked him. And apparently these other people have been having trouble with AOL and some of their spam filters.  I notice that this is going on with a lot of these different systems. AT&T has a blacklisting strategy where you get on this blacklist for 30 days, whether you like it or not. You can't get off of it. They don't figure that there's any reason.  I agree. It's a real problem.  And so he's lost like 85 of his subscribers just because of some unknown reason or his host or God knows what.  And I've decided, in fact I'm writing about this for the magazine, there's something onerous about these two trends.  One is type of email blocking and the other one is I think the consolidation of all these services where we're only going to have maybe one or two major backbones in this country.  And if somebody wants to do some IP filtering, you can pretty much control the way people, you know, what they can say out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got blacklisted by one of the, there are a number of the orbs, maps, but there are a number of other black hole, real time black hole services where if your IP address or range or your domain name is perceived by some mysterious black cloaked figure as being a spammer, they put you on this list.  And anybody who subscribes to this list, and I think it's probably what happened with AOL, they probably subscribe to a black hole list, will just automatically dump your addresses.  And Leoville got on one of these lists and it was a real problem because my ISP started subscribing to the black hole list.  And I said, get, you're blocking everything. So I think that the problem is there's no appeal.  These black hole lists, yeah, they're effective, but who's the one, who makes these decisions?  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All you have to do is say no HTML on you.  And yes, we've come full circle, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all Gibson's fault.  John, it's great to talk to you.  I'm going to sign off. I'll talk to you guys later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dvorak.org, that's the blog. And catch them in PC Magazine and back again next time on Twitter.  And by the way, I think it hasn't been firmed up yet, but we're hoping to do the show.  We're going to start doing the show live, as we've mentioned before, September 18th at Noonan's.  But we're hoping to do a live broadcast from the Apple Store in San Francisco on Labor Day weekend.  So we haven't confirmed that yet. We've been invited by Apple once we work out all the details.  We'll host a rave there.  Wouldn't that be fun? Well, I think the store closes early Sunday evening anyway.  So we would, it would open just for Twit.  Maybe we could grill.  Barbecue everybody.  Is Labor Day weekend when you have to stop wearing white shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. And white belts.  Although one might say that they're really out of fashion, plus you're impossibly hip.  Do you have a white belt?  No.  For any number of good reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to get Bob Young on here in just a minute.  And also, as I mentioned earlier, Mike Lazazaro will join us.  He is the guy who discovered this hole in the iTunes Music Store's top subscriptions.  Keep cooking, keep cooking.  And Patrick, what have you found there? That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to talk about some PSP hacks later on.  Wow.  I'm fascinated by the PlayStation Portable.  Steve, if we can figure out a decent way to put e-books on it, it could be a perfect e-book platform.  Oh, it's a very nice screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What kind of battery life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A little over four hours for the single battery, I think.  Is it four hours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, we had it on the flight to France in April, and it lasted the whole flight.  Hey, there's Bob Young, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's say hello to the man who started Red Hat, and now he's a real Lulu.  Bob Young, thanks for joining us on This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, it's a pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good to have you on.  You were on the screensavers, weren't you?  Sorry, I was into screensavers.  Were you ever on our TV show, The Screensavers?  Oh, golly, I don't think so.  Somebody from Red Hat gave me a red hat, and we were talking about that.  How long ago?  Oh, it would have been five years ago, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, okay, well then that might have been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've forgotten everything from that time?  I have. I'm very focused on this Lulu thing.  Well, we'll talk about Lulu in just a second, because I think it's a wonderful idea.  But let's talk about... you're from Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I am. My outs and abouts will give me away, if you'll point it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, don't you own a CFL franchise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, but I'm not admitting to that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell them. It's the Hamilton Tiger Cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very good.  How are they doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm not admitting to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When did you found Red Hat, Bob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Back in the spring of 93, we founded it as a quasi-publishing thing.  We were doing both newsletters on the East Coast, New York Unix magazine,  as well as running a little mail order business for Unix products.  And we got into Linux, and my customers started telling me about this Red Hat thing.  So I contact Mark Ewing. We go back and forth.  I end up ordering 300 copies from Mark's when we're chatting on the phone, dead silence at the end of the phone.  Turns out, Mark was only thinking of manufacturing 300 copies.  You just bought his entire run.  Exactly. But I knew how little I was paying for these 300 copies.  So I knew this kid was starving to death. I needed a product that I could put a brand on.  We had a marriage made in heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, of course, it was really the definitive, it still is, I think, the definitive Linux installation.  Very successful for many, many years.  We loved it. We installed it.  And we installed its derivative Mandrake several times on the screensavers.  I'm pretty sure, you may not remember it, but I'm pretty sure you were on the show.  In fact, I know you were on the show.  Yeah, he was on the show. Where do you think he got the hat from?  Where else would I have gotten a Red Hat, a Red Fedora?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If it was five years ago, that probably was me.  I remember being on the show. What I didn't remember is that the show was called Screensaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, well, you're not alone.  A lot of people have forgotten that.  So now tell us about Lulu. You're doing something, I think, that's, in fact, it's too bad that John C. DeVorek had to get off the line to make room for you,  because he was one of the first people that said, to me, that print-on-demand was the next big thing.  It is the next big thing.  Tell us about Lulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the whole point to Lulu, it was really twofold.  One, I had done a book when I was with Red Hat.  I called into the radar, and it was really trying to get a Red Hat version,  why Red Hat was doing open-source software the way we were doing it, and why we were not like Microsoft.  A lot of people, this is 99, you know, we're trying to give Red Hat a hard time.  I had this constant line about Red Hat was the Microsoft or the Linux business, and I'm going, hold on, guys.  Our whole brand relates to open-source, i.e. we give away our software under a license that allows you to do whatever you want with it.  How can we be the Microsoft of the state?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're more like the goodwill of the software industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly. So that was sort of the point to the book.  The book, for all that we sold, like 20,000 copies, didn't make any money because they printed 30,000 copies,  and they ended up sending 10,000 copies to the landfill.  And then on top of that, the publisher both kept the vast majority of the revenue and refused to let me make any changes to it.  I still owe apologies to half of the folks in the Linux space because the publisher rushed it into print,  and didn't do any fact-checking. So things like Jamie Zawinski's last name, there's no resemblance to his actual last name.  Oh dear.  And so I looked at all of those. Then we also looked at the phenomenon that with all this expansion of IP, you know,  copyright going from 20 years to 100 years, we thought there's got to be a better model for publishing  than the current publishing industry model where the publisher is in control of the author's content.  And worse than that, the publishing industry works as a bottleneck. The vast majority of good books never get published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what you do is you don't print the book until somebody buys the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's exactly right. These are these giant, best way to think of it, what Xerox and guys like Kodak and others are building,  is you know how your office printer can print a file, you know, the first file might be a letter to the editor,  and the next file is a marketing brochure, and the third file is an invoice, but the printer doesn't actually care,  whether it's four-color or one-color or, you know, how it's formatted.  Think of that office laser printer blown up into a room-sized piece of machinery where instead of the file being a letter or two or three pages,  the file is a 300-page book that goes in one end and plops out the other end as a book into a shipping, a UPS shipping envelope ready to go to the customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds like it's really cool to watch. What kind of printers are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry?  What kind of printers are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These are the big Xerox iGen and DocuTek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many pages per minute are we talking about here?  Oh, yeah.  Or is it pages a second? It probably is pages a second, you know.  Exactly. It's a book per minute is what we're talking about.  That's quite amazing. Does it bind them? Does it also do the full make-a-book thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes. What we're working on is turning them into hardcover books as well.  Oh, cool.  Right now these things are exactly like, say, an O'Reilly softcover manual.  Same type quality?  Very much the same. You could not tell the difference.  That's really amazing.  If you were not trained in the printing industry.  You know, the printers get their magnifying glass out and they go,  Aha, this was laser printed versus offset printed.  But the rest of us cannot tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that would have solved a number of problems.  You wouldn't have printed 10,000 more copies than people wanted.  That's right.  There's profit in it.  And you could have fixed that last name as soon as you saw it was a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right. Jamie wouldn't. I was a flake.  Jamie Zawinski, by the way, was the guy at Netscape who was in charge  of open sourcing the Netscape browser.  Oh, well, he did a good job.  Back in 98. Yeah, it's since gone on to great fame, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I really like it. It's at lulu.com.  And initially you might say, well, it looks like a vanity press,  but really it's really much more sophisticated than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right. Because what we're creating is a marketplace.  The other piece you didn't catch is that the economics of it  are the reverse of the existing publishing industry.  You, the author, keep 80% of the revenue.  I like that.  A typical contract, if you can get one from a traditional publisher,  is maybe 10% of the revenue.  And that's after the publisher has deducted all of his expenses.  So if we can create a marketplace,  if this thing turns into an eBay-like phenomenon where people,  you know, they first go to Amazon to find Harry Potter  or find a book on send mail,  but they then come to lulu if they can't find the book they're looking for on Amazon.  If we can get ourselves to that stage,  we'll have really created something interesting.  In the meantime, it's of huge value to anyone who has a book in them  and an audience who would benefit from that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many books do you have so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  About 30,000 spring titles.  That is growing by over a thousand titles a month.  Oh, that's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  David Prager has a question for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The quick question is, if I publish a book through Lulu  and I want to sell a lot of it and get like an Amazon ranking,  is that possible?  Since people are used to looking at rankings like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, is the short answer.  We are tied into Amazon,  so you can buy our books through Amazon.  It's just not as profitable for the author to go through Amazon.  Of course, by going through Amazon, he addresses a bigger market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You also offer these books as a download,  so you don't even have to kill a tree to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  We have some key books.  One, a Cisco book by Matt Basham,  where the number of downloads...  He offered a free download,  because Matt Basham was interested in getting a better Cisco training manual  out into the marketplace for all the students who needed to learn Cisco routers.  The cheapest thing they could buy was a $50 book,  so he was trying to get a book out that was competitive.  So he offered a very, very inexpensive download.  I believe we're in the tens of thousands of electronic downloads  from the Cisco book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, one thing a publisher would say,  and this is the same thing the movie companies say  and the record companies say,  is, well, yeah, but we provide distribution and marketing.  I guess you've got distribution handled, but what about marketing?  You're not getting it on the bookshelf in the bookstore.  How do people market their book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All the most successful authors to date on Lulu  are authors that we think of as having both content and an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Already have an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you, for example, Leo, wrote the definitive book on podcasting,  you would just have to tell your audience that you've written the definitive book on podcasting.  Go to Lulu and for $29.95, you too could be an expert in podcasting.  You would be very successful on Lulu.  On the other hand, if you wanted to become JK Rowling with Harry Potter or John Grisham,  there's no question Random House provides a very valuable service  that we're years away from replicating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But at some point, I imagine, I mean, look, JK Rowling came out of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And she also suffered from 15 rejection letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if she had gone to Lulu and found an audience?  There's no reason why eventually people wouldn't just go there and buy me.  At some point, I guess it won't look much different going to Lulu than going to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, of course.  I'd love to hear you say that, Leo, because we've got a long way to go from where you are today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I remember when Amazon was just a little hole in the wall.  You sell more than books. You sell calendars and other things too, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we're doing DVDs.  So you can sell your book either as a printed book, an electronic download, or as a DVD.  But now that we do DVDs, you can also sell your software package through Lulu.  You can sell your videos through Lulu.  You can sell your movie through Lulu, for that matter.  So we're trying to do for the next generation of movie makers, you know,  a Blair Witch project with something that, you know,  a couple of bright kids out of movie school could create.  But how do they get it to market? And that's what we're trying to provide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want to try it out, there are some free downloads.  I know there's some free video downloads on the site, so people can see what it would be like,  the experience of buying something on Lulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I would encourage everyone just to bookmark it, simply lulu.com.  And don't hesitate to tell me, I'm Bob at Lulu, what you liked,  or better yet, what you didn't like about the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't, I don't normally put people on to market stuff on this show,  but this to me is a key part of all of this explosion of content,  people creating their own thing.  Well, you can create your own radio show, you can create your own TV show now,  and now you can create your own book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think you guys are on to the right point.  And the point actually is, how mature is the Internet?  And a lot of people think the sort of, you know, you go to MBA school,  and the kids coming out saying, hey, where is going to be the next big thing?  And everyone's going, well, it's not the Internet anymore.  You know, Google and eBay and Amazon have cornered the Internet.  And I'm going, no, the Internet is still the wild west.  You know, there's lawlessness, there's a lack of measurement.  I mean, it looks like the wild west.  And the next generation of interesting things, for example, your show,  podcasting didn't exist, what, six months ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's quite amazing, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a very exciting time still on the Internet.  I agree, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bob, it's great to talk to you.  I don't suppose you have any more red hats, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I'm doing orange hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll look for them on Lulu.  We'll be happy to send you one, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  LULU.com, Bob Young, the man who put red hat on the map,  is now looking to put print-on-demand on the map, and I think it's very exciting.  Bob, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm trying to put authors on the map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a better way to put it, isn't it?  Yes.  It's not about the technology, it's about the people using the technology.  That's exactly right.  Thanks, Bob, I really appreciate your time.  Cool, take care.  Thanks for telling the story, guys.  Yeah, take care.  Isn't that neat?  See, I think that we're really in some sort of revolution here,  that technology's given everybody the chance to publish,  whether it's a book or a podcast or whatever.  One more story, I just love this story, and I'd love to hear your comments on this.  Apple goes to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  You know where I'm going here.  It says, hey, we'd like to patent the iPod interface.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says, oh, gosh, you're six months too late.  Microsoft has already patented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  When you start reading into it, it's a little...  It's not exactly the iPod interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hierarchical menus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically the ability to track stuff and create in a portable multimedia device,  a method, apparatus, and system for providing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But read between the lines. It's clearly they.  Microsoft said, hmm, if we could only patent this, then Apple would have to pay a license fee.  It's not even that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this happened back in 2002.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Apple released the iPod in 2001.  Precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've got prior art, but this is also a lot of...  But this is a case of the patents.  I mean, this is like what a friend of mine always reminds me.  This is about the law. This isn't about reason.  They're two entirely separate things, you know?  And it's like you look at some of the patents that are out, are so spurious  and so far in advance of any physical object that's going to exist in the real world.  You know what I mean?  The people are patenting nanotechnology concepts.  And I mean, this is...  It's not like the physical iPod interface is what they're trying to patent here.  It's my understanding that it was the system of noting basically what items go into your playlist  and whether or not you can eliminate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  However, if Microsoft decides to enforce this patent,  Apple would have to pay them a license fee for the iPod interface  they invented a year before the patent.  On all the 21 million iPods sold?  No, just on...  Well, that's a good question. No, I think it would be on future.  I mean, this is all...  Apple says we're going to court.  They said, well, look, we've got prior art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get this over with.  Apple also owns the patent for the cup holder for the iPod, the iPod automobile.  You know what I mean?  Well, and this is...  DLO claims they have the right to...  They have a patent on anything that involves a power plug,  a 12-volt power socket in your car, an FM tuner, and it...  You know what I mean? It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Microsoft's quote, though.  You saw what Microsoft said.  They said, oh, well, we frequently license these patents to other people.  We'd be glad to license it back to Apple.  Oh, my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be pretty scary, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they must have some sort of a blanket cross-licensing agreement from the old...  They do. This is what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a quote from Microsoft's director of IP licensing, David Kiefer.  He said, quote, in general, our policy is to allow others to license our patents  so they can use our innovative methods in their products.  Microsoft and Apple have previously licensed their respective patent portfolios to one another,  and we maintain a good working relationship with Apple.  They're basically...  This is a shot across the bow saying, and by the way, pay up.  Pay up.  I just think this is wild.  I wonder if this...  As soon as we can buy it...  What does it say about Apple, though, for not patenting their own interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that was dumb.  They did. But it was later, six months later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, here's the other issue.  You know, as a consumer advocate, I should really be in Microsoft's tent,  because what does this mean?  Well, it means that other companies could produce MP3 players that are as easy to use as an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, actually, it doesn't, because a lot of the elements that I've...  There's more than just this.  It's a lot more than just this.  You can take everything that's in this patent, implement it, and have a worthless and ugly interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You make me feel better, because I do feel like this is kind of a rotten thing to do.  It still amazes me, though, that patents, in general, are even used to cover such things as an interface.  It's like saying the play-pause button is patentable or...  Sure, it is.  Or one-click shopping.  One-click shopping. It is.  That's what patents are for, though.  A patent protects a method.  That's exactly what a patent is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except part of the patent law says that you're not able to patent something that would be obvious to someone trained in the art.  Yes.  And so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess a pause play would be obvious, yes.  It might not have been obvious in 65.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or a system that allows you to keep track and manage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Say, 10,000-plus multimedia files on a portable device.  That's not obvious.  I don't know.  It just seems like there's so much more room for improvement that decisions like these within the patent community...  Well, it stifles innovation.  It does. It stifles innovation. That's right.  Its goal is to protect you and allow you to make some money for a limited period of time on your innovation.  Well, the idea is that it's actually designed to encourage innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The idea that you can create something and it will be protected under the law so that other people won't stand your design.  But is it doing that?  You know, it's so much more complicated than it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, remember that the alternative that companies used to have was to keep things as a secret.  And so, for example, like the formula for Coca-Cola.  They've never patented that because the patent that is to publish it publicly...  And the idea was that by publishing publicly, then other inventors could work off of your ideas and build on them.  But what we're seeing is a real subversion of the process because someone who patents a menu system for a multimedia device...  ...never had the opportunity to make that a trade secret.  It's already in the public domain by the fact that they're using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or you could say that only the most obvious techniques and methods are the ones that are patented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  I think there's one solid lesson here though.  If you're going to introduce a product, even if you don't think it's going to be revolutionary...  ...and I find it difficult to believe Gates didn't...or excuse me, Gates Jobs.  That's a scary thought.  Patent right away.  Patent early, not late.  It's actually kind of mind-blowing that they waited almost a year to file the patents on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mentioned earlier in the show this really weird hack to the iTunes Music Store.  It explains a lot about why the positions are jumping around.  They're so volatile in the top 20.  On the phone with us right now, the guy who discovered it...  ...and actually, Roger, he's the Roger Chang of Call for Help now.  Oh, geez.  Mike Lazazara. Hello, Mike.  Hi there. How are you guys doing?  Colin from Toronto.  And I say that, Roger, because you were the guy who kept Call for Help running.  And that's what Mike is.  And just like you, he does free files.  And maybe someday he'll have a Google ad that says,  Mike Lazazara says, I've been using it for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still see that Google ad, by the way, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's funny. That's like two years since I actually said that.  It says, Roger Chang said, I wouldn't be caught dead without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said I used it once and I can't stop using it.  But that was over a weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the ad's running two years later.  What is it for? I don't even remember what it's for.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  But it's good for you, Roger, because your name is out there.  So, Mike, tell us, what happened that you discovered this kind of hack to the iTunes music store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was producing an online demo for our IPTV kind of show called Command M.  And I was clicking on the iTunes several times trying to get the demo correct for putting it on the web.  And I noticed after about an hour or so, our ranking had jumped up.  I thought that was kind of weird because we kind of hovered in the same position for weeks.  So I went back and I clicked it a couple more times, like 20 or 30 times, and we jumped up again.  I was like, what's going on here?  So I contacted one of the guys I work with down here from TechFile.ca.  And I had him just do it.  I said, just click on something a hundred times, something like that.  He clicked on it and came back and he said, you know what?  It works. It bumps up your ratings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you published this on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we published it.  We essentially said that what you can essentially do is click on the spot button in iTunes 50, 100, or a thousand times.  And it will put you higher on the ranking system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, when you click it, don't you have to then go back?  I mean, isn't this kind of a tedious process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just one click in the iTunes music store to go back to the podcast main menu.  And you have to click it. So it is a little tedious.  However, if it's an indie podcast or someone who doesn't have high rankings,  you can essentially take yourself from 200 to number one over a weekend kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked to somebody at the meetup on Thursday and we were talking about this.  And I said, well, look at this one, this French language podcast that's so high.  He said, yeah, I did that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Vive la Québécois.  I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It isn't that difficult. Actually, I'm doing it right now.  And it is pretty simple.  And I hope you guys have all been doing that.  So you're not actually subscribing, you're just pressing the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're just pressing the button.  And I can do this counting the amount of button presses as opposed to the amount of downloads  or actual subscriptions people are subscribing to in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was picked up everywhere.  And I think, I'm guessing just by the volatility of the list that a lot of people heard about it and did it  because the list has been jumping all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's been Italian podcasts that have been jumping to the very top in Canada and the United States.  There have been French podcasts.  And although I don't doubt there's a large Italian or French population in North America,  I can't imagine them being more popular than some of these big, big podcasts out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, definitely.  It's pretty funny. So how is Command End doing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we jumped to the very top initially.  And we've settled back to our normal position, which is about 22, 23 kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good podcast. Amber and Mike do it.  Sorry?  Hey, I just moved us to number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so heartbroken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, a couple of days ago Patrick sent me a screenshot.  Look, we're number one on the iTunes music.  Well, it was last night. I've been offline for 48 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been moving furniture in my house. Haven't been online for 48 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the lead hacker.  I'm the lead man. I'm so lead. I just hacked it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I hope Apple doesn't ban us forever from the store.  Now another thing happened.  Now Kevin Rose isn't with us right now, but you probably know the inside story on this.  Dignation rose very quickly.  That's Kevin and Alex Alpert's podcast.  It rose very quickly and then disappeared completely.  What happened there? Were they getting punished?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, actually it was a completely different part of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin thought they were getting punished, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we all thought. I thought I punished Kevin and I was hiding from him at the meetup  because I thought he was going to kill me or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he didn't do it, but the story broke on dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. It broke on dig and there was like 700 digs on it.  So I was assuming that people were doing this quick, quick, quick thing,  and then they said, okay, enough with Dignation. Off you go kind of a thing.  But it turns out that someone actually in iTunes, all you do is click on, report this podcast,  and you can say, you know what I mean, you want to take it off because it's profane  or because it's your own and you don't want it listed anymore.  And you don't actually check the email address that you're sending it from.  So they'll take it off without anyone even calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So somebody asked that dig be taken off and Apple did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they just did it. They took it off completely.  They took it off the main banner in the center and they took it off the whole listing.  And then Kevin was having a freak out, I'm sure.  Well, I don't blame him.  Yeah, of course. And then it got worked out that this was what the issue was and it was put back online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to spawn a whole lot of dirty tricks among the podcast community now, don't you think?  Definitely.  We're number one right now, but how long before you think somebody calls up and says,  hi, this is Leo. Hi, this is Leo LaForte and I don't want my podcast on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wouldn't surprise me if someone had already tried that, maybe, perhaps.  I don't know, maybe they've already learned their lesson about being careful about not pulling things off,  checking email addresses, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't know if Apple learns lessons. They still haven't fixed the subscribe button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not even a hack, it's just a flaw in the way they programmed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should count downloads or they should at least count real subscribing.  Look, they own the client, they own iTunes. They could do it better, don't you think?  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple learns lessons. They have a two button mouse now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, sort of. It's more of a one button, two button mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of a three button, one scrolly thingy mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that doesn't even work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we get booted off iTunes, I'm blaming you, Mike Lazazara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't bother blaming me, I can do anything I can wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger Chang says, I tried Mike Lazazara and I couldn't stop.  That sounds so dirty.  I'm looking for that on my next Google ad.  Mike, thanks for joining us on This Week in Tech, Mike.  Thank you very much for having me.  Congratulations on all the coverage you've been getting.  Thank you very much. Can I plug something here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Should I plug Command N?  Anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Plastictrees.net, Command N.  Yeah.  Command N.TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Those are the two best places to go for your web news and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the best site, the best site on the internet, NakedMike.com.  Alright, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's enough of that.  The whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here comes our profanity suspension.  The whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was taping in Toronto last week, and every five minutes he'd come running up to me with his...  Look, another track pack.  He was so excited. He was getting all his coverage on it.  Where did the name Plastictrees come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. I just hung up on it.  Radiohead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  Plastictrees.  Roger's a walking encyclopedia. I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what's really fun? It's Roger in one of those trivia games at a bar.  Oh, I bet. Is he really good?  You can make money with Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger, which flies faster? An F-18 Tomcat or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That thing is an F-18.  Oh, look at that. He's good.  Yeah, it's an F-14 Tomcat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  F-18 Hornet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright, I'm going to plug a couple of things and we're going to wrap this thing up. Hornet.  Steve Gibson and I have decided to start doing a security podcast.  Steve is so good at reading the heavy duty, high end security manuals about how stuff works and then boiling it down so that you and I can understand it and protect ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think about the name Security Now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Security Now with Steve Gibson. I love it.  I was thinking something like safe and sound, you know, because it's...  I like Security Now.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like both senses of it. It's like, you know, like what's happening in Security Now and you need security now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you want to host, Steve, the website for it? You really should probably. That's your thing.  We'll figure that out.  Alright. But we're going to start feeding that. I'll tell you what, we will start feeding it on the Twitch feed initially just so that people know that it's there and then we'll move it off onto its own feed once it gets some legs of its own.  So look for that on Thursday. Dvorak and I are also going to start doing a Wednesday shorty.  What I'd like to do is have kind of five days a week, little short podcasts that updates on...  What are you looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm just waiting to see what it does to the Twitch podcast when that undermines it.  Oh, it's not going to undermine it. It'll support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, I promise I won't. This is our bread and butter, baby.  This is our ticket home, man. This is the future of the Internet, don't you know? We're number one on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Click faster, click faster.  Faster, Damien.  Until the thrill of the rankings overcomes the carpal tunnel syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to once again very much thank America Online and AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this.  We really couldn't provide the number of feeds that we do provide without help from AOL.  It's music.aol.com. And we are, I think, very soon going to start appearing on their podcast channel.  I don't know if they've gone live with that. I think it's imminent.  But you'll be able to listen to the podcast on AOL Radio if you subscribe to AOL Radio,  as well as, of course, in the usual methods.  And of course, don't forget, November, I'm sorry, September 18th, live from Noonan's, we begin our live broadcasts.  I think we're ready for that.  And I'll let you know, guys and gals, about the Apple Store thing.  You know, if the Apple Store thing goes well, I think we could do a tour.  Do you want to do a tour of Apple Stores around the world? Paris? Soho?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I quit my job once and for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's it, Roger. You don't seem to understand that we'll be paying our own way to get to the Instagram.  Oh, yeah. You guys, I understand, but I can't... Don't destroy my fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger Chang says, I used it once and I couldn't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Roger, there are a number of restaurants that are hiring right now in the San Francisco Bay area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger is very happily and gainfully employed, I must say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree. Who have you been talking to?  I know. He's ensuring Roger Chang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, all right. I thought he was. So what do I know?  I'm gainfully employed.  Okay, we'll leave it at that then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's bitter. He's angry. He's kind of...  Roger's always been bitter. Roger's never not been bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is true.  This is just Roger. He's just... He's one of those guys. He's just...  We love him. It's not a bad thing. He's just... He's just... He's Eeyore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I see the dark cloud through every silver lining.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. On the other hand, Robert Heron, who can see through any skirt...  I mean...  Hey now.  I was listening to the previous podcast and you were talking about me being misogynist.  Yes. Well, that's not quite right.  No, it's not true at all.  I had a beautiful time in Mexico.  Did you?  I did.  Did you meet some fine foxes?  Signoritas.  Beautiful women from around the world hang out down there.  See what I'm saying?  That's not misogynistic.  Not at all. He loves women. What am I saying?  Of course.  I love women.  Steve Gibson, who is the king of security and will be back Thursday on this channel.  Anything you would like to plug besides GRC.com and the fabulous Spinrite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That pretty much covers it, Leo.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spinrite is the disc recovery software par excellence.  I used it once and I couldn't stop, says Leo Laporte.  It's true. I have it on my... I'd say it's on my recovery disc and I do frequently use it.  It's a great program to save your data and your drive.  Roger is on GameSpot.com.  Patrick, this week was setting up... Can we talk about that?  Sure.  Getting PC Magazine's video department.  Actually it's...  Is it all ZD or ExtremeTech?  It's all Ziff Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to be doing... Well, you know, basically Tuesday we're launching a live half hour online television show that's going to be available for download.  Well, yeah, if it works.  You know how Devar is always like, I've got to get you guys a TriCaster.  Right.  We're actually using a TriCaster.  Awesome.  The TriCaster folks are kind enough to FedEx a replacement since we had what they...  Did you fry it?  We did fry it with the software, ate its own tail, parts of it.  It's an amazing machine, so we're working out some developmental issues with it.  Yeah, early, early days.  Yeah.  So it's...  So Tuesday that'll go live at ExtremeTech.com or...  No, I'll post the...  We'll put it in the show notes.  ...in the show notes.  Okay.  Because we're still... It looks like we're either going to be on a sub page of PC Magazine or...  That's exciting.  ...there's going to be another link.  It's exciting.  Will you be on camera?  I'll be on camera.  Yeah, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick's return to television.  Yeah, it's a scary thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick's return to video I think is a more accurate description.  IPTV.  Oh yeah.  IPTV.  You can catch me on Call for Help now worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Details to come, stay tuned.  And...  And places around the block.  We want to thank our Mark Blasko for our opening theme.  What a great job.  And the incredible Ashley Twitt, who is our composer for the closing theme, doing the  twit.  He is amazing.  And the twit itself, the twit logo from Dorothy Yamamoto.  And of course, don't forget our website this week in Tech.com.  And we'll see you next time.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Isn't that cute?  I want to make a little...  It actually is a cool logo.  I like it.  Isn't it?  You know, and when you...  What I want to do is when it's...  Want to get a cool title too?  You can be anything you want.  I just said I'm the host.  I said managing editor, but that's not just for this week in Tech.  It has all my other jobs.  I would have said Chief Twit, because that's my real title on this show.
