Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna leave that to us to you at the end of the show we can decide terrible or terrific  What what was this turmoil?  Turmoil and I've been techie teens Mary Jo and I both observed that this was a very busy decade, especially the first half it was  Lots of stuff changed in the first half of the of the decade  we can start in 2010 and I remember 2010 vividly because  Well, first of all, we were still in the cottage  we didn't have the  Fantastic production values we have today and I remember in January 2010 Steve Jobs introduced the iPad and  We decided we wanted to cover that live on lawn chairs in front of  Musconee Center  I wonder if I have I hope no I did in fact that was the last time I had  Because that is the infamous  Moment when I'm sitting not this I tell it my way it's different from how Steve told me I tell it my way  I'm sitting in the iPad announcement. This is perhaps I think so you're not on a lawn chair  I'm actually inside I got this is the last time I got a badge  Launchers came later. Gotcha. I'm sitting inside and I'm looking and I'm thinking this is the most important hardware announcement of the decade  Actually, even ten years later, you might say it was one of them. It wasn't the most but one of them  Okay, and  We're covering it kind of because they didn't stream it at the time by  Blogging it and typing it in  So dopey and I'm looking behind me and there's Bloomberg and TV and all the cameras behind me gone  We're you know, it was so long ago. They actually had to turn the crank and I'm looking I'm thinking well, they're gonna  broadcast this  so I took my laptop I  Launched Skype I called the studio and I turned it around. Oh wow  Wow, this was before vlogging. Oh, yeah. No, yeah. Yeah you weren't it as it turns out  I learned later you weren't really allowed to do that. Everybody else is recording it, but I guess live-streaming Steve didn't want that for some reason  Steve gives me this stink eye  I know he saw me and actually we looked later in the video of the event and there's a you can see Leo  Roll out clear holden of his iPad. They didn't kick me out. They didn't do anything  It wasn't an iPad. It was a laptop. They didn't have one yet. They didn't kick me out. They didn't do anything  Had it had I you know, I don't know and so I went out then we sat in front of the lawn chairs  Colleen our engineer at the time had made a live  broadcasting rig  Glass and glue and and we did we did the show from there. So I think that was a pretty important  Way to begin the decade. It really was I think it was the very first  It was in January as a Macworld Expo. So it was a very big

Start time: 710.52
End time: 713.84

Start time: 714.04
End time: 718.54

Start time: 719.96
End time: 729.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know a lot of people debate that I mean, it's not like it was a throwaway gadget  But it didn't it didn't change the way we compute it wasn't as big as we probably thought it was

Start time: 730.92
End time: 806.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because because right now I mean we're just sort of getting to the point where some people well  I should say that should be careful because there are people out there who will  Live and die by the fact that they use their iPad for everything or their tablet for everything  But there are for the most part. We're just now getting to a place where Mike my grandma for example  I started her out with an iPad mini that was mine that I gave to her and she used that and then I was happy  To get to upgrade her to a more recent iPad Pro with the keyboard that comes with it and the Apple pencil and she uses  That as her computer. That's the computer. That's all she needs and I think that you're jingling  I think that for the most part we are just sort of in that space in terms of tablets  But Microsoft is doing pretty well with with the sort of yeah the go-between or the all-in-one kind of device  That's portable so in terms of what the iPad hoped to do in providing a more mobile  Computing platform. I think that it certainly didn't start out that way it was definitely  consumption versus content creation, but we really have seen overall I feel the  the whole tech sector kind of  Digging into that idea and creating products that do that

Start time: 806.84
End time: 812.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think even Microsoft would agree that the iPad was a big deal  I mean, that's remember when they ported office to the iPad

Start time: 1109.20
End time: 1125.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is. Yeah, it came out of a lot of the technology came out of their  Deal with danger. I think they acquired danger  Yes, Andy Rubin's right.

You probably don't remember this  Some people you're only 12, but some people remember it  That you used to pay typically $200 for a phone no matter what it cost  And then you would spread it out the rest of it over you'd have to sign a two-year deal with it  Yeah, and it's about midway through this decade that AT&T said we're not doing that

Start time: 1167.58
End time: 1177.80

Transcript:  so  The funny thing subsidies ended but as the prices of phones went up, but they continued locking the phones  Because the whole point of the locking was what we subsidized  Our phone and that but even if you buy it out right they still lock it and  although the FCC has started to weigh in on that and  That deal where you know, we're gonna add a little to your bill every month to pay for the phone  They never eliminated that charge  So it worked out great for the phone company.

Transcript:  another very very big  Thing that happened that probably none of you remember in 2010 was a exploit called fire sheep  Now you don't know this one  But Steve Gibson and I talked about this an awful lot because it allowed somebody sitting in a Wi-Fi open Wi-Fi access point  With you a coffee shop to hijack your Facebook and just start posting stuff on your Facebook  because fire sheep because  You didn't have an HTTPS connection with Facebook at the time. It was unencrypted  So when you first opened Facebook on your laptop, you would send the cookie that said I'm Mary Jo Foley  Out through the unencrypted channel the hacker would be able to grab it  Put it on his laptop and then be Mary Jo Foley or be Stacy and so but the reason it's important besides the fact that  It was a kind of a shocking thing is now thanks to that HTTPS

Transcript:  Support that's right. So you can that started in 2010?  You can thanks to the sheep that was on fire  The other very big story was this was when WikiLeaks really came to the foreground because they released  Those US diplomatic cables. They also released the Bradley Manning material now Chelsea Manning  At the time she was an army specialist who released video of a drone footage. Mm-hmm  Killing innocent civilians and journalists and that was a real shocker and this at this time WikiLeaks was really considered a  Do-gooder. Yes, not a front for the Russians. Yeah, and I don't know if they were at this time  Yeah, the material was obtained by WikiLeaks 220 cables  Some redacted at the time WikiLeaks cared a little bit more to protect diplomatic sources  It put out the first installment on November late November  Lots of embarrassment the White House condemned it in the strongest terms  It was the beginning of a decade of revelation about what the US government is up to

Start time: 1627.86
End time: 1668.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that and I'm wondering too if you folks think it was also the beginning of a  little bit more cultural awareness of  of sort of the role that  Technology and and especially someone who you know is working with classified documents in this way  How that all works like instead of just traditional espionage where we think of James Bond now  we're talking about cyber espionage and I feel like it entered into the public sector a little bit more and we became more aware of  it because of this and  Now even more so today we have to think about that whenever we think about what the CIA is doing to protect us the FBI

End time: 1703.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Etc the other thing that's different. I'd word Snowden. We're gonna get to him was very careful about how he released the information  WikiLeaks  Eventually you started dumping it in this case the Times which was given more than a quarter million cables  Withheld a lot after consulting with the State Department with a lot of the information from the articles and from the documents to protect  diplomats people who would be at risk intelligence agents and so forth  The White House said that the WikiLeaks would make several hundred thousand cables  available Sunday night, but 220 were first posted in that first

Start time: 1714.30
End time: 1741.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well in there and there there are ways to it that helps protect him to from right there  But I would say that I think it was actually Snowden's revelations that really started people thinking about  In because I think the NSA was tapping into you know phone lines and that sort of thing even though prior to that  We had the AT&T revelations, which I don't know if those were in 2010 whistleblower.
