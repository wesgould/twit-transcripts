Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, it's a little Easter egg in the book.

Start time: 199.38
End time: 209.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of neat because every chapter has a QR code leading into it that you can  then with your smartphone, I guess, take a picture of and then it will bring you to the  forum where you can comment on that.

Transcript:  And I didn't mean to insult you when I said this before the show started, but it seems  like that's the kind of thing like fins on a car that will seem appear dated in some  time in the future, maybe not so far distant future.

Start time: 236.48
End time: 241.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 257.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's these things, there's one technology, I forget the name of it, where you can take  a picture of a series of words and it recognizes what it is.  And but even that you have to have a certain type of phone and certain app and your camera  has to be pretty high res.  And so some of the codes seem like the best, the best solution.

We can barely handle the, barely handle the past.  Well, let's talk about this week's news.  That was one of the stories, of course, was that the 6502 hit its 35th birthday.  You know, it's fun.  I mean, 35 is not that old.  Look at Gina.

Transcript:  But for a computer that's ancient, isn't it, for technology that's really, really old.  It feels like that was the dark ages of personal computing.

Start time: 454.18
End time: 476.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty old.  Our cycles of upgrade and our expectations have accelerated along with time.  So, you know, if you have a three-year-old computer, that's a pretty much a stretch.  A 35-year-old computer is just sort of an artifact that belongs in a museum, really.  So to think about what that could do in the upper limits of those times versus what we  expect now is a big disconnect.

Start time: 477.22
End time: 479.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, I did write for Ahoy Magazine.

End time: 500.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to write for an old Atari magazine.  So, you know, those days really were long ago.  It's funny.  And now, where things move faster than ever, don't they?  Right.  And there's no magazines.

Start time: 501.06
End time: 503.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's no magazines.  There really aren't.  There are magazines.

Start time: 504.18
End time: 509.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nick, what is it like in the New York Times newsroom these days?  I mean, you are the future of the New York Times, the website.

Start time: 512.06
End time: 535.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun.  I mean, you know, it's pretty interesting.  There's a new culture of journalists that is coming in.  I'm part of that crew and people like Brian Stelter who writes on the media desk.  And, you know, we're just trying to experiment with real-time reporting and tweeting as we're  researching and asking people questions and, you know, and the blog format versus the print  format.  And it's fun.  I mean, we're having a really great time.

Start time: 536.61
End time: 557.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would say of all the newspapers, and this would be kind of the last thing you'd expect  of the gray lady, of all the newspapers out there, the New York Times has in fact done,  I would say, a great job of moving into the future.  Although you look at something like USA Today, which we would also say may be another press  effort to be futuristic, and they're talking about putting the print paper to bed basically.

Start time: 558.02
End time: 569.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's fascinating.  In the newsroom, there's a group of hackers that they hack code all day, you know, and  they look at documents.  Really?  Wow.  And yeah, it's pretty impressive to see the way that that's transitioned and that's happened.

Start time: 571.08
End time: 580.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't get bit by, let's be honest here, anybody get bit by the tornado Twitter picture?  You know what I'm talking about?

Start time: 581.08
End time: 585.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 586.18
End time: 601.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Time Magazine people got bit.  Time blogger.  So there were what?  There were some minor tornadoes in the Queens and the Bronx.  Is that right?  And Brooklyn.  Brooklyn, yeah.  How does it we have three people from Brooklyn in on Skype today?  That's just a weird coincidence.  Brooklyn is just dominated.

Start time: 601.96
End time: 603.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just how it works.  It is.

Start time: 604.86
End time: 608.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it was a city on its own, it would be like the, I don't know, the fourth largest city  in the States or something like that.

Start time: 610.11
End time: 621.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  2.3 million incredible people live in Brooklyn.  It's bigger than Manhattan by far.  It's a massive city.  It's a planet, if you want to be honest.  How many un-incredible people are there?  We don't like to talk about them.  Thanks, Sean.

Start time: 622.12
End time: 622.86
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Start time: 623.08
End time: 624.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do not appreciate your insightful journalism.

Start time: 625.96
End time: 635.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's by the way, that's a new Pixar film, The Un-Incredibles.  Coming to the theater near you.  So there was a, I mean, come on, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, it can't have been a tornado.  It was like a funnel cloud.

Start time: 636.46
End time: 652.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was two tornadoes.  It was pretty insane.  There was trees on top of cars and cats and dogs.  It was actually, in all seriousness, there was a guy who took photos of actually video  of some crabs in the park.  Great.  2 million people with all those phones.

Start time: 653.10
End time: 659.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's the movie?  Where's the video of a funnel cloud of any sort?  This was a burst, a microburst.  It was bull crap.

Start time: 659.96
End time: 684.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what happened because somebody found a 25-year-old picture of an actual tornado  near the Statue of Liberty.  Twit picked it.  Actually, it might have been a blogger from Time magazine.  They just Photoshopped it.  You could have, but it wasn't.  This is a real photo.  Somebody found it on the NOAA site.  And it took over Twitter.  Everybody said, oh my God, this is a tornado.

Start time: 685.12
End time: 687.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The NOAA blew over the Statue of Liberty.

Start time: 688.79
End time: 694.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of embarrassing.  But see, that's in the age of instant journalism, Nick.  That could happen to anybody, right?

Start time: 695.20
End time: 699.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true, but it was quickly realized that it was fake, and that can happen too.

Start time: 701.26
End time: 705.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your point being, yes, news breaks fast, but it also gets corrected.

Start time: 707.04
End time: 708.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also rectified very quickly, I think.

Start time: 708.98
End time: 711.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of the Wikipedia style of a fact.

Start time: 712.67
End time: 713.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true, yeah.

Start time: 714.25
End time: 746.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that's fair.  Do you find, and this is a newsroom question for Nick, which we've never talked about,  kind of not on the show, but do you find that corrections are closer in volume of reach  to the initial mistake nowadays than they were in the past?  Because I always worry that that first tweet or Facebook update or email or blog post goes out,  and that establishes a certain fact.  And then when you later find out it's wrong, now with the high speed communications we have,  the correction comes out sooner.  Does it have a larger effect on the impact of the original because it moves so much faster now?  That's a very good question.

Start time: 746.98
End time: 794.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a good question.  I think one of the things that we struggled with in the technology section is that, let's be realistic.  Okay, so Apple puts out a press release that they're releasing a new iPad, right?  Most tech blogs, the goal is to get it up as soon as possible, right?  So what they'll do is they'll write one sentence and they'll copy and paste the press release.  At the times, we're not allowed to do that.  It's part of the standards that we can't do that.  We have to report the story.  So we have to, as quickly as possible, get something together that's a story and get it up.  And it can take 15, 16, 17 minutes sometimes.  And that's a pretty big deal when you're looking at this, especially the technology bloggers for space.  And we go through the same thing with other breaking news.  And I think we just have to be really careful that we don't put something up  unless we've actually done the research and the reporting to say, hey, this actually did happen or this didn't.

Start time: 795.98
End time: 803.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the stuff post does have a video, supposedly of the, it has a video of the event,  but there's no tornado cloud that I can see, just a bunch of rain.

Start time: 804.10
End time: 825.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was definitely more, I mean, one of my friends showed me a photo from the,  there used to be a roof over the hallway of his apartment building.  And he showed me this picture. I'm like, oh, that's a beautiful skylight.  He's like, no, the roof got ripped off.  Whoa, skylight. That's a hole.  At first I thought I was jealous of him for having so much natural light in his building.  And that wasn't natural.

Transcript:  John, I actually, I was, I thought it was BS at first. I thought that it wasn't a hurricane,  but actually yesterday the Times put out a news alert that the National Weather Association said  there were two hurricane, two tornadoes, sorry, that did strike Brooklyn on Thursday.

Start time: 851.16
End time: 865.65

Transcript:  That wasn't a tornado. That was a heavy wind.  Let's talk about, well, as long as we're talking about fast press.  Mike Errington publishes a story this morning on TechCrunch saying Facebook's doing a phone.  Mike probably figured that Facebook wouldn't get around to correcting that till Monday,  and he'd get at least a 24-hour news cycle.  Facebook, apparently wise to TechCrunch's tricks, immediately says, that is so not true.

Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I saw the rumor go up.  I read, actually, there was an extensive piece by Jose Vargas in New Yorker this week  where he profiles Mark Zuckerberg.  That's a good article.  Great piece, actually. Anil Dash did a really good follow-up on that.  They're both very long pieces, but if you have time, I think they're both quite worth reading.

Start time: 979.96
End time: 999.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I Instapapered that and read it on the iPad.  The idea that Facebook would do a phone, it seems actually a little bit troubling, but also quite logical.  I mean, there's so much of your world that's in there.  There's your posting photos, you have all your contacts in one place.  I'm not a fan of it because I imagine that a Facebook phone would default to speakerphone mode or something highly public.

Transcript:  But if you didn't have those trust issues, I think the concept of an entity that knows who you communicate with  and what frequency and manages a lot of your media already to have more than an app,  but actually a device that puts you totally in sync with that, does make some amount of sense.  Google did it. We have higher trust for Google than Facebook.  So I'll throw that out there as a logical possibility.  When you add the controversy around Facebook, it's very troubling.

Transcript:  Oh, sorry. I just saw those Facebook credit gift cards in Target last week.  I was surprised. I had never seen them before.  And then when I heard about the phone, I thought about it.  If I'm a junior, senior in high school or even college and I'm getting my first cell phone,  the Facebook phone just makes total sense.  I mean, I'm not that person, but it makes a lot of sense.  I feel like marketing-wise, it would be a smart move.

Start time: 1060.06
End time: 1090.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? OK. See, I looked at that article. I thought, that's not true.  Facebook immediately says, well, we are in the business of making sure that every phone that comes out has Facebook on it.  But the last thing we want to do is make a phone.  What do they need to make a phone for? Every phone has to have Facebook.  In fact, we talked on Windows Weekly this week to the guy responsible for evangelizing Microsoft's Windows Phone 7.  And this week they announced, you bet, a Twitter app, a Facebook app.  You don't ship a smartphone without Facebook on it these days.  It's usually built in, right?

Start time: 1091.37
End time: 1133.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  They get 100 million people that are accessing the mobile site and using their mobile apps every month.  So, you know, it's a lot of people using it.  But, you know, about them working on a phone, I worked on a story that a blog post I posted earlier this month about Amazon has been discussing their Lab 126  about building other devices beyond the Kindle.  And one of the things that they actually discussed internally was the idea of doing a phone.  They're not, as far as I know, they're not moving forward with that right now.  But that was a discussion in a meeting that I got from a couple of sources there.  So, you know, if Apple's moving into, if Apple and Microsoft are moving into their turf, why wouldn't they move the other way also?

Start time: 1134.92
End time: 1150.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's true because I kind of mocked the idea that Amazon would do hardware.  I thought that was a very strange thing to do.  And obviously I was wrong about that. They've had a huge success with the Kindle.  Even in the face of competition from the iPad, they continue to sell very, very well.  So maybe it is.

Start time: 1150.96
End time: 1166.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've taken a pretty amazing approach with that.  I mean, I originally thought that as soon as the iPad came out, why would someone spend $250 on a Kindle when you can get almost a full computer?  But their approach with going the other way and saying, you know, we'll sell you on for $140, I think has worked pretty well for them.

Somebody called the radio show the other day and said, well, you know, I've heard about this, what, I was a pan digital and and, you know, there's all these other ebook readers.  What should I buy?

I want to talk a little bit about GoToMyPC from our great folks, our great friends at Citrix,  the guys who do remote access at the highest level, the remote access for the enterprise.  They also do great consumer products.  And if you've ever tried remote access and said it's too complicated, it's slow,  I've got to get around the firewall, I've got to do port forwarding or DMZing,  you've got to try GoToMyPC.  Built in that traversal, 128-bit SSL, absolutely secure.  There's never been a remote exploit.  This thing works, is rock solid, and is easy to use and absolutely fast.  GoToMyPC. You don't have to take my word for it.  You can try it right now, 30 days free.  Just go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit, G-O-T-O-M-Y-PC.com.  John, are you caught in your wires there? Are you stuck?  He can't get out. He's trapped. He can't get out of here.  He's trying to run.  He locked me in.  You're stuck. No more leaving than the commercials, Dvorak.  GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for your support and invite you to give it a try.  Today, other big news in the world.  Intel says anybody who tries to copy a Blu-ray is going to hear from our lawyers.

Transcript:  So Monday, it's surprising that it took so long.  How long did it take high school student DVD John to crack DVD CSS protection?  Like a week? Like a month? It was almost instantaneous.  It was a while.  Part of the problem is that in order for a player to work, it has to have the key.  These technologies are always going to be flawed because if you can just figure out where the key is stored,  there always has to be a copy of the key in the clear in order to play back the DVD or the Blu-ray.  Apparently, this is kind of interesting.  It was found on Monday or appeared on Monday in Pastebin.  Gina, you must have used Pastebin. You know about Pastebin.  I do know about Pastebin.  It's just a place where you post stuff.

Start time: 1361.42

Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me see.  I'm looking at a Wired article from 1999, which announced the DVD crack with the title of it.  Why the DVD hack was a cinch.  It talks about this issue of the code being stored in the clear.  Jan Johansen, the founder of Moore in Norway, the high school kid who's now known as DVD John,  he's got actually a pretty good little product now called Double Twist.  He's gone straight.  DVDs came out in 1995.

End time: 1473.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Blu-ray's been out longer than four years, so it took them a little longer.  But you've got to figure the MPAA and the motion picture folks and everybody said,  they broke CSS so fast, we've got to find something.

Start time: 1475.49
End time: 1480.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blu-ray's been out for a long time, but this protocol is fairly new.  The HDCP.  Oh, you're right.

Start time: 1481.06
End time: 1497.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HDCP isn't the Blu-ray protection.  It's the protection that keeps you from playing.  Yeah, it's what comes out of the Blu-ray player into a TV.  In order to watch a Blu-ray player on a TV, both devices have to HDCP compliant.  So that you can't use the analog hole.  So I guess you're right.  It's not as old as Blu-ray.

Start time: 1498.04
End time: 1514.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, HDCP, I mean, that's what they claim it's for.  But the fact of the matter is HDCP was invented just to add one more feature to a flat screen TV  to make you have to buy a new generation of television.  They've done it just about six times and they got a new one coming up.  This is a scam.

Start time: 1514.96

End time: 1533.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

It could have to do with the fact that you're going to have to buy a new generation of TV  and then you're going to have to buy a new one.  So I think that's what copy protection could have to do with requiring you to buy all new crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's another round of this coming too.  I can't remember exactly what it was.  Maybe one of you guys know it.  But it's some other thing they're going to add to these TVs, which would make you have to buy another TV.

One of the greatest things about the Xbox is you can download any video format, put it on a USB stick,  plug it into the Xbox and it immediately recognizes it.  And if it doesn't, it goes and it gets the right format for it.

I do have a cable service, but I don't until very recently, I wasn't actually watching much cable.  I recently decided I'm going to start following British soccer football leagues.

And and the one thing I said was that you can't you can't get sports on your computer.  And and the way people were doing it for a long time was actually illegally through Justin TV,  where somebody would broadcast their channel.  But you're still you're still really I mean, you can get MLB dot com.  You can pay ten dollars a month for that, which is actually pretty good.  And then you can get ultimate wrestling.

So I don't know if that happened, and probably not, but in the Four Chan MPAA case, is there  a stage two other than shutting down their website, or is this just flexing your muscle  for 24 or 48 hours?

Somebody says there's no official anonymous website.  This is that anonymous website, which is the Scientology anonymous.  Not the most distinctive name.  Who is anonymous?  Why do we protest?

One man.  ...a site so powerful, 500 million people, you know, inspired accidentally from their perspective  by the limitations or beliefs or ideas of one person is truly amazing.

Transcript:  God bless you.  So here, I want to go back to this idea of technology companies strongly influenced by  a single personality.  Please, thank you.  Someone in the camera pointed out...  Please.  They're like, well, Steve Jobs is that person.  I can't remember the name of the man who founded Real Networks.  You brought the site down, Leo.  The site is on Amazon.  Is that really?  Shut up.  We often hold up the Internet and the web, it's subset, as this area where anyone can  make a difference and we all have a say in the future of our world.  But if you look at Robert Moses' influence on New York City or the Rockefeller's influence  on philanthropy and money, how much has the world changed in the age of the Internet,  which was supposed to empower anyone, when the tool that 500 million people use is still  highly defined just by one person, when Apple is still heavily micromanaged by Steve Jobs?  Well, I would submit that there's a difference between Facebook and Apple.

Start time: 2332.04

Start time: 2338.58
End time: 2370.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do, but it's not so much of a choice because all your friends are on it.  There is this social compulsion component of Facebook that's still a little different,  I think, than Apple.  And that's, I think, where it's scary that Mark has so much power.  It's a peer pressure business model, yeah.  Yeah, it's more than even peer pressure.  It's a reason people used AOL and couldn't leave.  It's because this is where you were.  This is where your friends were.  Facebook, I'm convinced if something like Diaspora came along, I don't think it's going to be Diaspora,  but maybe Google Me came along and offered a choice, it wouldn't be the issue that it is.  But there isn't a choice right now, is there?

Transcript:  Well, Twitter is the closest thing.  But I mean, that actually brings up something else.  I got an email from Twitter today about some new updates.  And this went out to their 150 million people.  And they're talking about OAuth and you are all rappers and things like that.  They're not reaching the mainstream audience that Facebook is because I think it's still programmers talking to people like their programmers.

Start time: 2397.49
End time: 2490.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love new Twitter.  I blogged about it.  I turned it off.  I linked to Gina's blog about it.  Yeah, Gina wrote a nice post on that.  Great post, wonderful, beautiful screenshots.  I'm a fan for a couple of reasons.  I think there's some shortcomings.  I think part of there are multiple Twitter windows on your iPhone, on your Android, on your iPad, on the web.  And they don't all do the same things.  Some support new retweets only.  Some don't support old retweets.  Some show you how many retweets you've had.  Others don't.  So they haven't synced the functionality across all these platforms yet.  But I was like, I love when people...  I love when people do beautiful things on the web and don't force you to download some proprietary platform-specific client.  So I saw this as a real win for people who are fans of the web and not just the internet.  People who are fans of non-apps.  So like, yeah, I can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate this.  Like in Gmail, that was one of the gist of Gina's posts.  I didn't even know about those.  I know, JK works. I can't believe it.  That was a beautiful thing.  So the fact that I can move at nearly as swiftly and have these embedded media experiences through a web browser just reminds everybody,  like, yeah, you guys are all programming specifically and putting publishers through this burden of upgrading and sort of itemizing their development plan for platform A versus B versus Z.  When we have this universal platform called the web and the internet that is capable of so much.  So I thought it was an investment in a more open platform and a more open experience.  And I really do applaud them for that part of it.

Start time: 2499.82
End time: 2550.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. I think it's just a beautiful, well-executed web app that you get in your browser for all the same reasons.  I think they did a really, really nice job of creating this sort of like new.  I think there's this new generation of web apps that are very influenced by the kind of by the iPad, actually, which is kind of ironic.  You know, with that, you know, the flow, being able to scroll down the infinite scroll, the tap and expand panels, even the screen resolution.  You can tell it just was I don't even have an iPad.  I can tell that the Twitter web app works really well on the iPad.  And, you know, I don't think that we've seen a really innovative web app since since really Gmail and like that.  And when I looked at Twitter, I was I was really excited about it.  But, you know, Alex Payne, who used to work at Twitter, is no longer there, wrote a great post, which is in the show notes.  And he noted this is something I hadn't noticed.  He said that he felt like the new Twitter is great, but that there's there's a lot of room there for ads.

Start time: 2551.64
End time: 2556.52

Start time: 2557.60
End time: 2575.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, I think it really surfaces a lot of metadata that you get in tweets, the people that are mentioned, the location, the links that that really were hidden before.  And the keyboard shortcuts are awesome.  The keyboard shortcuts I mentioned in my post that they're like Gmail.  Those actually originated in V.I.  And that's why Gmail uses them now.  Oh, no. It's the new thing.

And they're becoming a search company.  I mean, they're they're completely.  As they should, by the way.  That's the best part, isn't it?  That's the best part.  Yeah. I mean, that's what you find.  Where you find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to throw out a curveball.  Then I think it's a bad idea because why did Twitter succeed?  In fact, where Twitter's growth is happening, by the way, almost entirely now is with unsophisticated younger people.  You know, look at the VH, the video music awards of VMAs last weekend going, oh, there's a million tweets now about Lady Gaga.  That's what I think that's where most of the new traffic is.  These look, we maybe not John, but we like this new Twitter, but they're not going to like this new Twitter.  You think isn't it?

Transcript:  I don't think they use it.  I mean, I think that, you know, they're using their BlackBerry's a lot of, you know, part of the reason that there was I forget where I read this.  But part of the reason that you're seeing this rise of if you want to call it unsophisticated tweets is because it's partnerships as Twitter's done with BlackBerry's and Sprint and so on.  Where, you know, low income people are getting, they're getting BlackBerry's and it comes on there and it's like a part of the package that they get automatically.  And I think that that's kind of changing things a little bit.

You get the country and in certain cases you get the world.  You see different languages starting to show up and go, oh, this isn't the place that I found that was like home.

Transcript:  Back to the Twitter redesign.  One of the things that I noticed that was incredibly frustrating is with every app,  like as Barton, they said, with every app and every website that Twitter puts out, it's  got a different UI.  And it's got to be a tremendous amount of work for them to have an Android, a Blackberry,  an iPhone, iPad, website, mobile site, as we're all trying to do these days.  When are we going to narrow this down?  When is this going to let up?

Start time: 2838.43
End time: 2841.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  When is what going to let up?  All the third party apps?  No, all the different fields.

Start time: 2852.06
End time: 2865.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure this is why Twitter is taking this huge risk of pissing off the third party  application developers who made Twitter in the first place and saying, we'll take it  from here, guys.  I mean, that's got to piss them off a little bit.

Transcript:  Here's why I don't like the new Twitter.  Why, John?  It takes up the whole screen.  It throws a bunch of crap at me I don't want.  I use Twitter casually.  I'm not wed to Twitter like people who are on Facebook 24-7.  And that's what this says to me.  This is what I'm saying.

Start time: 2881.14
End time: 2903.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm sure Twitter, you know, Evan Biz know this.  It's a little bit of a risk to take something that really succeeded because if it's plain  simplicity.  Simplicity, yeah.  And make it so complex.  And I think that they may have been listening a little bit more to the geeks like us about  design and content than they ought to have.  We'll see.  We'll see.  I've been wrong about Twitter before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm very interested in what's going to happen, especially since YouTube this week tested streaming as well.  Video streaming is going to, and something we've been doing for a couple of years now,  is suddenly going to be, I think, a very big deal.  Yeah.  But before we do that, ladies and gentlemen, I'd certainly like to talk about my friends at Carbonite and Carbonite Pro.  You do backup?  You do backup, don't you?  If you're a business, this kind of stuns me.  How many businesses, small businesses, do not backup their data?  If you're a business, think about what it would mean if all your data, all your computers got lost, all your data was gone.  How long would it take you to get back online?  A mighty long time, you might even be out of business by the time everything got rebuilt.  Where are you going to get that from?  The paper spreadsheets?  This is why I think it's so important to have a good backup strategy,  and a good backup strategy has to have a couple of very important features.  One, I think it's got to be automatic.  If you're not backing up automatically, it's not going to happen.  You can't trust your employees to always do those backups.  If you are not backing up in the cloud, you're running a risk.  Because what if the business burns down?  Carbonite's been used, in fact, by a lot of businesses because it's an online automatic backup system  that's very reliable, Windows and Mac, 128-bit SSL, so even on an open access point it's secure.  Plus, they have AES 256-bit encryption.  In fact, what happened is Carbonite found out that several hundred thousand of its consumer users were small businesses.  They said, well, maybe we ought to do something for business.  That's where Carbonite Pro came from.  Carbonite Pro, right now for Windows only, it is a truly amazing solution which we use here.  We looked at all the other ways of doing offsite backup.  There was nothing more affordable, more effective or easier to use than Carbonite Pro.  I'm very happy to say.  You pay only for the storage you need.  You don't pay for seats.  You can have as many users as you want.  It starts at $10 a month.  That gives you 20 gigabytes of storage.  Let's say you've got eight desktops in your office, small business like mine, eight desktops,  and you're storing about, I don't know, five gigabytes worth of storage.  That's $25 a month.  Automatic backup.  There's no individual licensing fee.  There's no setup fee.  There's no hardware to buy, no training.  You go around, you put it on all the computers, they start backing up from then on.  Users can restore their own files if you set it up that way.  I like that feature.  It's just simple.  You have a centralized dashboard so you know exactly which computers are backed up.  Works for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 32-bit, and 64-bit.  Windows Server 2003, 2008 as well.  And I just think this is a great solution.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  Go to carbonitepro.com.  I'm a big supporter of Carbonite.  They just got named the fastest growing IT services company in the U.S. for this year.  The ninth fastest overall.  They privately held companies overall in the U.S.  And there's a reason.  It's good.  Carbonitepro.com.  Give it a try today.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.

Transcript:  So it's actually like these, uh, differently abled jelly beans I have here.  He belly flops.  They call them.  Are you doing dental work on the show?  She'd never.  So, uh, so Nick, yeah.  So started with some guy.  Was it Justin?  He was like, he wore a camera all the time.

Start time: 3335.70
End time: 3337.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He used to wear the camera constantly.

Start time: 3338.04
End time: 3383.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He used to, he used to have a Sony, uh, uh, laptop in his, uh, one of those super thin  ones in his backpack.  And then he had a little camera on his hat and any videotaped everything and some pretty  mundane things that you probably wouldn't want to watch.  And, um, and then there was the pranks too, when people were trying to mess with them  and they sent, uh, parties to, and the cops to a, uh, pizza, sorry, to the cops to a  party and things like that.  But, but, but then what's happened really recently, which is fascinating, which doesn't  TV is they've been trying to, um, they've been trying to fight piracy.  And what you have is because there's no live TV on the web yet and it's still, everyone's  still working that out is that people will stream, you know, the VMAs and the Emmys  and, and sports shows.  It's become almost like a game of whack-a-mole for the Justin TV guys where they have to  try to put these, these, these shows out before, uh, before they rise up.  Really?

Start time: 3384.48
End time: 3397.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I don't want to interrupt you with that.  It reminds me, I think there was some, some guy, I can't remember who it was, but he was  at one of the Apple announcements and he had his laptop and he was like shooting pictures  of the Apple announcement.  The next thing you know, they threw him out.  They did not throw me out.

Start time: 3397.98
End time: 3417.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's you.  And it wasn't the illegal.  There was nobody said not to do it.  There's no sign that didn't say, you've been blackballed.  There was no, there were cameras.  There was a row of cameras behind me doing it.  So I thought, well, what the hell about my laptop?  And now I can't get invited to an Apple event to save my life.  Who cares?  Did you go ahead?  Nick forget it.

Transcript:  So the thing that's interesting, so, okay, so they, you know, people have been doing  this, you stream so on and, you know, we've seen Scobal run around with cameras streaming  everything, birthday parties, tech events.  But I think the thing that Justin's trying to take advantage of is the community.  But what I think is really fascinating is it's going to bring up a whole slew of copyright  questions as more companies do this, because let's just say that, of course, I can't stream  directly to the VMAs, but let's just say that Baratunde is standing next to my TV and the  VMAs are on.  What's the rule there?

Start time: 3543.30
End time: 3587.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has come up in a number of situations.  Remember, athletes were instructed during the Olympics, the Winter Olympics in Vancouver,  to be very careful about tweeting results.  It's certainly not streaming video even from behind the scenes because the rights to this  had been sold.  And even a Justin TV backstage stream is an infringement.  Yep.  I think, you know, you ask me, fantastic.  It breaks down the whole, it breaks down the whole CD structure of, you know, back, backroom  deals.  It opens up everything to the public.  So breath of fresh air.  And this is why I love doing what we do.  Now, do you think Justin will be shut down by people who don't like it?  That this ability to stream via phone is in everybody's pocket?

Start time: 3589.09
End time: 3602.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

I think that that's just, you know, that's practically here.  But you're right.  I mean, if I walk in the room as I have, by the way, I've done this, Nick, not as a cyborg,  but to cover stuff, I walk in the room with cameras in there.  You definitely get a mix of reactions.

But, you know, maybe that's generational change in the next few years.  But I think what's scary for me, and I'm all for the internet in the future and I'm extremely  positive about everything as I've written in my book and on the Times blog, but the  fact that you can't delete that.  Once I spoke to Steve Mann, that was it.  It was there that I spoke to him.  There was no way for me to take that away.

Transcript:  You know, the Chargers game was blacked out here in San Diego and people were really upset  this weekend.  And one of the things that the local news actually recommended was like pointing your  Skype, you know, pointing a Skype video camera at the game where it wasn't blacked out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  out within a 75 mile radius.  It's like, if you know somebody in the outer county, have them turn on the game and then  point their eyesight at the game and Skype them.  That's awesome.  Isn't that so funny?  And I think sites like Justin TV kind of let people do the same thing, you know, for sports  events and blacked out content.  And how do you, well, I suppose in the case of Justin TV, it's easy to get that stuff  pulled, right?  But in a case of like a Skype, a private Skype video call.  You can't?

Nick, I mean, this is obviously what's happening.  Yes.  And I think that it's one of those things that I'll tell you what I, I have a really  interesting challenge with this show.  Last week, for instance, we were talking about Tina Fey and Justin Bieber.  And I ran, it's a news show.  I ran a small clip from Saturday Night Live off YouTube of Tina Fey and Justin Bieber.  We posted that show on YouTube this week and it was pulled.  YouTube's automatic content discovery system flagged it as a copyright violation.  It was a fair use.  I believe it's fair use.  There is, in fact, we have an article if you look on the rundown about this.  You know, there is a process, but it's, you know, it's not a very good process.  We've talked to our lawyers.  I don't know exactly what to do.  How many lawyers do you have?

Start time: 3919.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so here's a, this is a perfect segue, Leo, to another story in our queue.  Hooray.  From codinghorrors.com.  That's it.  We have a great story about, the title is YouTube versus fair use.  And essentially, you know, this blogger did a really interesting job of sort of documenting  when YouTube got popular, a lot of it was on the backs of copyrighted material.  And they said, look, we have a lot of legitimate material as well.  So you can't shut us down completely.  But they also promised to copyright holders that they would be working on a solution.  And they did.  And they released a system called Content ID, which allows them to very quickly identify via audio or video or both  when someone else's work is being uploaded by a random user.  And then the publisher has the choice of, you know, block it altogether, track it to just get usage stats or to monetize it.  But this writer who was, I can't get his name off the side, she's at Coding Horrors, Jeff Atwood.  Yeah, Gina.  Jeff Atwood was writing in detail about, you know, first of all, he didn't think they could actually build it.  He thought that they were just like a delay tactic for the courts to like, yeah, yeah, we'll monitor this.  We'll give you reports, blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.  But it turns out that it works.  And so within an hour of posting something, you'll find, you know, as a YouTube user that they flag your stuff and have warned you that you need to take this down.  So you found that out, Leo.  I mean, you got, you know, we talked about this with the Onion a couple of months ago.  That's right. Same thing happened with the Onion.

Start time: 4011.84
End time: 4014.18

Start time: 4015.44
End time: 4044.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And we didn't, you know, we weren't, you know, it's a YouTube system where they said we're going to go out of our way to be friendly to copyright holders and send warnings to users.  And hopefully they'll meet in the middle somewhere that isn't too onerous.  But like, you know, Gina, you're this week in Google.  Like, what do you think about the fair use versus YouTube?  I mean, YouTube is supposed to liberate all of us, but also seems to be shackling us with maybe a mild bit of overreach in terms of the fair use implications of clipping audio and video.

Start time: 4045.04
End time: 4047.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Well, remember Napster was told by the courts, this goes way back to Napster.  They were told by the court, you need to come up with a way to flag copyrighted content.  And Napster's defense was it can't be done. YouTube's done it.

Start time: 4062.74
End time: 4069.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, because we haven't heard yet.  The onion thing.  So here's the deal. The content flagging happens automatically.  Right. That's just done.  And then as you said, Baratunde, the copyright holders have three choices.  I don't think the one with the onion was pulled down. Was it, John?  I don't think that one was pulled down.

Start time: 4088.56
End time: 4116.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we wouldn't set, you know, and for those who are just tuning in, we didn't get this.  So my job there is as web editor, digital dude.  So in theory, I'm supposed to know about these things, but there's a lot of stuff that happens in the world.  But in general, we wouldn't have a default setting of like block you from citing us.  No, it's just good publicity. I ran a show.  The origins of the onion is not to like stop people from talking about us.  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  And it drives traffic.  It'll be the track or the monetizer.

Start time: 4118.06
End time: 4149.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So in that case, it wasn't obviously NBC has a blanket setting saying yank it.  And we got yanked immediately. I don't know if we've appealed.  I think my attitude is I want to appeal as as a news organization.  And now maybe there's some debate over what a news organization could do in this coding horror blog.  He does talk about the three tests for fair use, all of which I believe for tests, all of which I believe we satisfy.  Why don't you read them so people know?  Do you have them in front of you, Baratunde? Because I don't.

Start time: 4150.92
End time: 4177.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he asked four questions. I have them.  OK.  Is the use transformative?  Is the source material intended for the public good?  How much was taken and what's the market effect?  Those are the four questions that that Jeff Atwood, this programmer, outlines.  Yes, one or four.  I'm sorry.  Do you have to meet one or four?  He says four guidelines. So I think I think the court would look at those.

Start time: 4177.70
End time: 4182.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say was he used transformative in the sense that we change it in a way so that it's not the same?

Start time: 4182.88
End time: 4195.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, no, I think transformative in this case, because I've heard this lecture a million times.  It means that you're using it for a different purpose.  You've transformed the reason for its use.  In other words, you're mocking it or something.  You're not merely rebroadcasting.

Start time: 4197.66

Start time: 4199.70
End time: 4207.75

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the source material intended for the public good?

Start time: 4211.35
End time: 4218.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so it's a new show.  Well, even if it's humor, humor is the public good.  So you can make fun of something.  So I think it's pretty clear we satisfy those tests.  So what was number three?

Start time: 4219.73
End time: 4220.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 4220.98
End time: 4224.56

Start time: 4269.04
End time: 4284.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we have actual damages because we that video was the  Twitch show from last week was taken off of YouTube, not aired on YouTube.  That's tens of thousands of.  Because of the SNL clip.  Yeah. And that's tens of thousands of views that we've lost.  So it's like a two hour show and for five seconds you got pulled.

Start time: 4284.56
End time: 4285.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically. That's crazy.

Start time: 4285.82
End time: 4316.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's Adwood's point. He's like, look, I wanted to quote this  movie in a blog post about a whole bunch of things.  It's not my intention to rebroadcast the film.  I'm not trying to damage sales of the film.  And as a media personality, as a journalistic function, even if you're  not a journalist, you're performing a journalistic function that should be  allowed. And so YouTube's his fear was like, wow, YouTube built this thing  and it actually works really, really well.  And that has frightening implications.

Transcript:  Well, ironically, the technology has swung and this is the Justin TV story  has swung very much in the favor of public because, yeah, you know, the  law is supporting and YouTube's technology is supporting the copyright  holders. But the frankly, the fact that I could post you tweet everywhere  and it's whack-a-mole to keep it down in the long run, technologies are on  our side. So it's a very interesting situation.

And what actually put YouTube, and I've heard  this from several people that were inside the company at the time, what put  them on the map was the SNL clip from the, it was the...  Dick in the Box.

And if you're looking for a very reasonable priced car that's cute, fun to drive,  gets great gas mileage, has the Ford SYNC in it, I got to tell you.  There goes John. It was good you did that quickly enough.  And actually, as you say that, I'm going to change the lower third because it says  DIRV1 today and I don't mean it to be DIRV1. I mean it to be DRIVE1 today.  There you go. You could DIRV it. You will love it so much you'll want to DIRV it.  The Ford Fiesta. Take a look at it at your local Ford dealer.  The new 2011 just came out. An EPA estimated 40 miles to gallon on the highway.  No other compact car is more fuel efficient than the 2011 Ford Fiesta according to the EPA.  It's that great 1.6 liter Duratec TI-VCT I4 engine. It's peppy. It's fun to drive.  It has things like my Mustang has this too and I love it. The easy fuel capless filter system.  So I never have to open the... I just pop open the thing and boom, put the gas in, close it.  The 4 inch multifunctional display with LCD screen and that's where the SYNC is,  which means you can talk to your Ford. You can tell it's a play of the pocket.  Play TWIT 266. It plays it for you.  You can check the weather movie listings. Get turn by turn voice directions without having to purchase additional hardware.  911 assist is great too. It will automatically if the airbags are deployed call 911 and feed it your GPS coordinates.  This is kind of weird but it happened to me. The first time it happened to me it was strange.  I have the new Droid X and I'm many Droid phones. It will read you your text messages.  So a little alarm goes off and then in a very nice female voice my text messages are read to me,  which is a little weird but great. Exterior design that just looks...  Well you can see the image on the screen. It's just so cute. Very kinetic. Feels great.  Interior that looks cool has great features including optional heated leather trim seats,  the power shift 6 speed automatic transmission, intelligent access with a push button start, which is great.  I want you to take a look at the new Ford Fiesta. It is a hot car. I just really love it. I just love what Ford's doing.  They have really brought the pride back to Detroit. Drive one today. The new Ford Fiesta at a dealer near you.  And now ladies and gentlemen, John C. DeVore.  It was a wipe. I should have switched when you did that and it would look just like a wipe.

You look like one of the you look like a guy going through a middle age. What's that called?  The midlife crisis. It looks like a crisis.

And they just, they went after DVDs and people walking the stores and blew it.  Bye bye.  And I think what's even more fascinating that I haven't really heard anyone discuss is I believe that Netflix is going to be the next kind of cable distributor to a certain degree.  They're going to replace your cable company.  I mean, you see, you know, they've they've cut interesting.

With Felicia Day. Yeah.  They've got, you know, interesting release windows through podcasts, through the web, through Xbox, through Netflix.  Netflix is certainly such a prime distributor of digital content.  I think they're going to run into trouble.

Transcript:  But I think there's a challenge ahead for them because for a couple of reasons.  Now Hollywood may like this because streaming movies can't be easily pirated whereas DVDs can.  So they're probably promoting streaming.  But I can tell you who hates this idea is the Internet Service providers, especially since they're also in most cases in the TV movie business.  I'm saying Comcast to a lesser degree Verizon, AT&T with you first.  They also want to sell movies to you.  And so I think that they're actually they're not going to be very happy about this.  And I see a flaming war coming between the Internet Service.  Flame war. Flame war.  Flame war. Call out the LOL squad.  Call out 4chan between let's just say Comcast and Netflix.  And this is why the net neutrality battle becomes very important.  Oh, yes.  Now Google's going to Google.  You know, it was interesting that they did this deal with Verizon because I think they also with Google TV really think that streaming TV is the future and a la cart TV and not, you know, cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this actually goes to it to another point, which I wanted to point out earlier about the Apple TV and your cable television and so on.  Steve Jobs stood up on stage when he presented the Apple TV and said, you know, customers only want, you know, Hollywood professional content.  They don't want amateur hour, which is not true.  The numbers show that people are actually consuming billions of videos on YouTube and Facebook every month that are created by people using their mobile phone.  And I think that that same concept of like not having a time slot with the things that your friends create and your loved ones and so on, and then trying to put a time slot on this Hollywood content is just…

Start time: 5111.94
End time: 5144.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's the irony. I'll move in the opposite direction. We started doing podcasts, which you would download whenever you wanted.  It's weird to find that peculiar, don't you?  Yeah, whenever you want it. And now I think the problem with podcasts and all of this downloadable content is it's too hard to get.  You have to figure out where it is. You have to subscribe. You have to download it. You have to find a device to put it onto.  And it's way too complicated. So we started doing real time live streaming because we thought it was easier to go to a website and just push the button and it's on.  But numbers…  Numbers are much, much lower for live.

Start time: 5145.56
End time: 5147.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5149.04
End time: 5151.48

Start time: 5152.99

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and in fact, what we really want to do is make it available in every form.  It's not like we'd give up the downloadable version. We want to give you any form you want.  But I do think, and I think this may be a little bit of a backlash to downloadable content, is that people also want live. They want a community.  The interaction.

Start time: 5207.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The community part is big. I mean, I'll tell you like the twit app is and not to just, you know, be nice to you because I'm here right now.  But I got the twit iPhone app and it's pretty amazing.  Like you log into it and you see the schedule, the day partying, if you will, of all your content.  And I'm like, oh, it's 2 30 p.m. And so this show is on and the audio immediately kicks in.  And there's a way to jump in the chat room and hear what people are saying.  And there is something about that water cooler connection that solo podcast listening and viewing doesn't provide.  Well, now that you mentioned it, you connected to other people.

Transcript:  This thing about people coming together around their shared video experiences or shared experiences period, but video is a very important part of our lives.  I saw kids in the Apple store on 14th Street in New York.  They would just come there to share videos of one another.  They're all on YouTube.  And they're watching videos and laughing and playing and rhyming and doing all this stuff.  And it's a highly social like people have this fear that technology disconnects us from one another, that it's unhuman, that it makes us more like machines.  But in so many ways, it can actually strengthen the connection that we have to one another.  And when you see kids who don't have any dogmatic view of these things, this is very natural for them.  And they come to a computer and like, I want to watch this video with my friends in the same physical space.  That's a beautiful thing to watch.  And so to the extent that Apple TV, Google TV, Boxy, etc.  Allow that to happen in our homes where this started.  I remember the 80s when music videos were a new thing and people coming over to watch the latest Michael Jackson video or the latest Prince video, the latest Kumo D video.  That was a big deal.  And I think it still can be a big deal.  So long as we maintain the environment that encourages that and don't lock things down too much.

Transcript:  I think that with that respect, I think, you know, one of the things I'm not even I'm not trying to plug my book.  I'm just saying like one of the reasons why I wrote this is because I think that all these articles that say the Internet is bad for us and it's ruining our brains and all these things.  You're essentially taking away literacy from this next generation of kids.  That is growing up in this world where it's a changing society.

Transcript:  So I'm building this open source application.  It's called Think Up and you can install it on your web server.  And we've come a really long way, really fast.  And the beta is actually to get released next week, early next week, like Monday, Tuesday.  But we've got a simple five minute web based installer.  You literally you unzip this file onto your web server and you click through three steps.  You install it. It gathers all your tweets and Facebook posts and all the replies.  It gathers those posts and your friends.  And it lets you search and export and archive and organize your conversations on various social networks.  And in fact, Baratunde has been a test user for quite some time and he's been one of my best test users.  Baratunde, I would love for you to talk about your fishing nets metaphor.  But he's so good at sort of crowd sourcing information and getting new ideas from his from his readers, from his onion readers and just his personal Twitter followers.  Anyway, so just kind of a pre plug.  Think Up is going to be in beta next week.  There's a pre testing zip file out there now you can download if you just follow Think Up app on Twitter.  And when the beta is out next week, you'll know about it.  I'll talk about it on Twig as well.  It's very simple PHP MySQL app.  And so we're looking for users and coders.  Thank you for the plug, Baratunde.  I want to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll tell you the practical use from my perspective is, you know, especially all of us on the show have a decent Twitter following.  And I think a lot of us use it as a research tool.  You ask people, I'm looking for an app that does this.  I'm looking for a person that knows this.  Reporters use this constantly.  Does anybody know somebody at company X?  The problem is with Twitter, there can be such a high volume of communication and replies that fishing goes out a day later or three days later or seven days later.  It's just a real pain.  And so what they, you know, the ThinkUp app allows you to do is attach to the node that is your tweet.  See how many times that tweets been forwarded, quote unquote, or retweeted and what the replies are to that tweet.  You know, if you look at the Twitter dot com interface, you'll see people replying to you.  They have an in reply to and it links back to that original tweet.  So their architecture, you know, supports linking back to the original, even though they don't support threaded conversations natively.  It's sort of built into the architecture.  So when you're as a media organization, especially posting comments or posting a call for input, it can be very useful to go back and say, oh, here are the 40 replies I got to question A.  Separate from here, the 40 replies I got to question B.  Separate from here, the retweets I got from statement C.  And so that's been quite useful for me personally.  I'm using it on a couple of other accounts.  But I think as a research tool, it makes Twitter much more usable in the way that Facebook kind of natively supports.  You can just look at the timestamp, click on that and see all the replies in line.

Transcript:  I think it's really cool.  I really love it.  I want to try it.  You do have to run your own server to do it.  But I imagine at some point, Gina, people will run this as a service.

Start time: 6283.85
End time: 6322.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if you set it up, you can open up registration so all your friends can register.  And maybe at some point we will host an official single place where everyone can sign up.  But that's not in the cards right now, but maybe eventually.  And Gina, where can we go to get it?  We're working on the website.  Go to thinkupapp.com, which is very sparse right now.  Next week when the beta release happens, we'll have a much prettier website.  Actually, the expert lab site, there's a link there.  And download it.  We're going to have a much prettier download link next week.  So right now we're still in testing.  Our official release is next Monday.  But if you're an early adopter and you're feeling adventurous, grab the zip file and try it out.
