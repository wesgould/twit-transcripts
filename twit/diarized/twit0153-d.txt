Because guess who's on?  My sworn enemy, John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog  Hello John  I'll get you, Leo  You son of a bitch!  Mr. Kevin Rose  Hello, hello  Who is always cheerful because he lives on tea  I have, by the way, two of your teas here at the cottage  Are you drinking the ginger tea? That's quite good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a little bit crazier stuff  This is some aged pu'erh tea  Ooh  Please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did that go through a civet's butt too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it did not, but you know, some people drink coffee  This is my vice, this is my caffeine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is vice  Also here, Mr. Patrick Norton from Tekzilla and System on Revision 3  Hey Patrick

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just still trying to get over the fact that Kevin's vice is so cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like him  Come on  How many Dr. Peppers do you drink a day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, like none  What?  No  No, actually I stopped drinking Dr. Pepper, started drinking Diet Coke  and gave up Diet Coke for the better part of a year before I started working in Revision 3  So what do you drink now?  Did you sell your Dr. Pepper stock?  It was always in Coke stock, selling mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody should sell, you know, short Dr. Pepper  Yeah  So tell us Patrick, what do you drink now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mostly coffee, and with the occasional Diet Coke  and I'm trying to cut the Diet Coke back out again  Basically there's so much, I want to say phosphoric acid in both Diet Coke and regular Coke  It's true, it eats your gut  Phosphoric acid is not the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the problem John C. Dvorak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is John C. Dvorak because what it does is it basically sucks the minerals out of your digestive system  before they can get to say your body

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you give me a brain tonic?  Because I'm just, I'm thirsty as hell after all that  Yeah, that's what we drink over here at the Twig Cottage Patrick  and if you would come to get your copy of Anithem, the new Neal Stephenson novel  I'll be up there  Only available to a select few before September 9th  And by the way, wow, I loved it  He's back to sci-fi  Oh really?  Yeah  Interesting  There's aliens in this one  And we don't drink Dr. Pepper, Coke, tea or coffee here  We drink brain tonic with an IQ at the end because it's good for your IQ  No caffeine, no guarana, just carbonated water, organic agave nectar, natural flavors and ulethra coccus extract

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds almost like an advertisement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It almost is, if I were getting paid for it, it would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you at least have a free sip of brain tonic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to shut up and not say anything  I'm like, oh he's reading an ad right now  We're just that close

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was so smooth  The deal was that they did want to get on Twitter Live on the live thing  And I said, well, I've never had it, I can't advertise it  So they sent us a case and everybody here has become addicted to it  It's kind of creepy  People come in and then I give it to the guests and they get addicted to it  You notice I didn't try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, did you not have some?  I refuse  I'm like Kevin, I'm a tea drinker  You are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what he did  He said, well, no, but do you have any Geverts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we said Colleen had to get some Geverts-draminer wine  So he drank that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually that's not actually accurate  I never said do you have any Geverts  We said, do you have any wine?  And they said, what wine do you want?  And I was thinking it was so boiling hot  Because we're out in the middle of boiling hotville  And it was like it seemed like a good idea to have something refreshing and kind of, you know, white  And so I thought Geverts would be cool because I know they grow good ones up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do and it was a good Geverts actually  You're all invited anytime you want to come by the cottage  You can have any beverage you want, you do not have to drink brain tonic  Although it's surprisingly delicious  That's my motto  It's surprisingly good  It doesn't suck  Yeah, it sucks less  We have a lot of news stories to get to and I want to get to them in a second  But we can't put Kevin Rose on the show  And I promise not to do this to you every time, Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wouldn't be a problem if you'd show up more often  Sorry, sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He sent me a note saying he'd like to be on Twitmore  So I'm going to take him up on it  Kevin, you're always welcome here  But I know how busy you are because DIG is a big deal  You've got DIGnation, you do that every weekend  Sometimes you have to fly around  We were in Chicago this week doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a DIG meet up out in Chicago  And yeah, that was fun, it was crazy  It's good to move around and go to different cities  And have people come out and meet the community  And get their feedback

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish we could do that  It sounds like Obama

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you have 200,000 people in the victory column in Chicago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not quite that many

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you were in London it was 1,000, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like 1,500 or so, it was pretty crazy  Amazing  That's really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what Kevin, we all josh you a lot  But we're really, well I'll speak for myself  I'm really thrilled at your success  I think it's really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we totally hate Kevin for his success

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I hate him when he's not here  When he's not here, I hate him, I hate this guy  But when he's here, I can't help it, he's so cute  And he loves the tea  Well, thank you, Leo  No, I really, and I'll be honest with you  Every time Mike Arrington makes up this rumor  That you're going to get bought by Google  I'm going, yeah, because then Kevin's going to be worth like  You know, the last rumor  Yeah, he'll be buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll be buying  Back it up a minute and tell the listeners out there  What's going on with this rumor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, so this rumor has surfaced  Mike Arrington has published this same rumor  At least to my knowledge three times over the last six months  And it has not once come true  The rumor that Google was going to buy Dig  And at one point they said Marissa Meyer said no, we don't want it  Then she did  The latest one, and I'm starting to  I'll be honest with you  I think it's hurting Mike's credibility  But the fact that he keeps bringing it up  He must know that it hurts his credibility when the thing doesn't happen  He must have a source somewhere  Who is so credible that Mike has to publish this  Otherwise, it's just a dumb thing for him to do  So the latest one  And by the way, Kevin, you could just go silent  You don't have to say anything  I know that if, you know, you don't have to confirm it  You don't have to deny it  I don't want you to feel uncomfortable  But it would have been whether you were here or not  It's a big story  The rumor was that Google was doing due diligence on a possible $200 million acquisition of Dig  Mike publishes this  It's the same rumor  This time though  Instead of just letting it drop  He actually comes back and said no, they changed their mind  Which as far as I'm concerned he could be making up to protect himself  Who knows  But it didn't happen  So I guess Kevin, here's the point where I would say to you  You want to confirm or deny? You want to say anything about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean about, I don't know, a year ago or so  We decided to as a company  Just like when any of this stuff comes up  Just to never comment on anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now Jay denied it once  Like vigorously denied it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did, he was really pissed when that came out  And we did a blog post about it  But, you know, it's funny because these rumors can come about in so many different ways  I remember one time I was on the Yahoo campus  And I was just there doing some biz dev kind of work  And forming a partnership with them  And someone sees me on the campus  And all of a sudden they have an ear with whoever the tech news publisher is  And then all of a sudden there's a rumor that we're going to sell the company  So, you know, we have, I'm friends with Marissa and everyone over at Google  I think they're a great group  And we're always working on stuff together  So that's all I can say  Is Allen and Company shopping you around?  No, they are not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, there you go, that's all I want to hear, that's great  That's it  And I'll be honest with you, I've even said on this show  This is Mike again, this is the same rumor  I don't know if I buy it, I keep hearing this rumor  Nothing ever happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I would say that, you know, we've worked with Allen and Company in the past  We're friends with them as well  And so it's like, I see how all this stuff comes together  You know, it's not crazy that people would speculate  Right  But, yeah, we're just happy continuing to work on Dig  Oh, come on  Wouldn't it be fun if somebody wrote you a big check and you could just work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you would get what, 50 or 60 million dollars?  I'm guessing, I don't know what your percentage still left is  But you could just walk away, what would you do?  If somebody gave you 50 million, what would you do, Kevin?  With the rest of your life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I honestly don't think that I'm at the place where I want to be yet until  You know, we have so much more building to do  I don't think now is the time to just  The only time we've entertained any type of acquisition type stuff in the past  Has been if like, the two companies combined are going to create something even bigger  And, you know, I'm happy working at Dig  Like, I don't, when people say like, oh, you'd have, you know, 20, 30, however many million dollars  What would you do with it?  I think I'd be doing the same thing I am today and that's continuing to work on the product  Like, I'm not going to retire, I'm too young  I enjoy working too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You like what you're, you enjoy Dig and you like what you're doing  It doesn't feel like work, you know, like I can work in the office every single day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know exactly, yeah, exactly, like we're all doing what we love  And when that's the case, as crazy as it may sound, like you want to get up in the morning  And you're excited to go into the office  I'm basically doing this for free as seven days a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing I get paid to do is the radio show, the rest of it I'm doing because I love it  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I hope to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you wake, well let's stop a second now, I want to get this quote straight  When you wake up in the morning, you're excited what?  To go into the office  Huh, interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't buy that, John?  John's office is three feet away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My office is not too far away from where I live so it's easy for me as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know because I watch you on Twitter and you say I'm walking away

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm never really excited to go into the office  I mean, I hear this all the time from guys like, oh, Kevin, not so much  But you hear from Michael Dell and Gates, they're excited to go into the office  Well, you know, when my office is like two doors down from my bedroom  Even then I'm not excited  I mean, I might be happy that I don't have to go any further  I can look out at the freeway and see people  Oh my God, these poor guys are sitting there for hours on end to get into San Francisco or whatever  But I'm not excited necessarily  I'd rather have some breakfast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that I could get excited about  I will say this and I think this is more because and I bet you, Patrick, you would agree  Well, maybe you wouldn't, Patrick  I know Kevin would  But maybe because I'm more of a performer  I miss not being on the air  So I do get excited about coming in here, turning on the cameras and performing  That's really fun  So but that's a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, it's also there's a, you know, do you miss being on the air or do you miss being on the air five days a week doing live television with a full studio crew?  You know, I don't miss that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I really enjoy what I'm doing right now because I am the full studio crew

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And I'm sure you don't miss that old commute you used to have to take down to Tech TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, I do miss  Did any of you go to the the anniversary party at CNET on Thursday?  It was my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I wasn't even invited by the way, despite the fact that I was there  Everybody was invited

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, you were invited  You're just not on that Perillo's Tech TV mailing list  You got to get on that list  I was not invited  You were invited  I fact I almost forwarded it to you knowing that you would say that everybody was invited  It was you didn't forward it  It wasn't free  You have to pay 30 bucks  Why didn't forward it to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My God, what are they trying to kid us?  CNET's got no money. They're owned by CBS. Why are we paying 30 bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. First of all, first of all, Gillespie put it together because he wanted to get a bunch of people together  It was $15 to cover the drinks  And why should CNET or CBS pay for a, you know, a party with a bunch of Tech TV people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gillespie could  I would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gillespie's loaded  I was gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna, I was gonna two years ago  I was gonna and we just it fell through  I was gonna foot the bill at  Because it was like a $5,000 advance  I was gonna use twit money to foot the bill  But then it kind of fell through

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I do parties all the time  And I've done them for years  I don't do as many as I used to  But I have never required anybody and I never will to put up money  But you had sponsors, John  Hey, you got five bucks for gas?  You had sponsors  It's lame

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares? You know what? Who cares?  It was a bunch of people getting together  So you went? Did you go back?  No, it was my wedding anniversary  No way in hell I was going to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why I didn't go? Because Revision 3 was having a party  So nobody from Revision 3 was gonna go  And those are the people, I really wanted to see you guys  Of course we see, I talk to you all the time so I guess it's not really that silly  But then I watched David Sparks video, right?  On his blog  And I was sad  Because there was Allison Tom and Dan Kerman and just all these people  And it made me sad because I wish I'd gone  You guys have no nostalgia whatsoever, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually went back to Chicago that day so I didn't have a choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have nostalgia but I do not, and I don't care what Patrick says  I do not appreciate being charged money to go to a party  And it's the principle of the thing, Patrick  Not that I can't afford the $15  Yeah, I can give you the $15  It's the principle of the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's saying I'm unprincipled, John  Yes  He's saying Joe Gillespie is unprincipled

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If anybody should be pissed it should be Patrick because he's the one that doesn't drink  Yeah, I know  He's paying $15 to pay $15

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For black coffee  That's a lot for black coffee, you'd have to drink a couple of gallons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not just charge for the drinks? That's normal, right?  You walk into a party, you pay $5 for a beer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what we would have done  I would have put up whatever the $5,000 minimum  And then the bar would not be open  And then if the bar didn't make back its $5,000  Then they keep whatever the difference is  That's what I was going to do  Anyway, who cares? It doesn't matter  It's beside the point  The point is why do you go to a party and charge people to come to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking though about nostalgia  Actually, we were talking about loving our work  And I think that that's one thing about doing live television  That's the thing you love  But I can see, Kevin, that you would say  Look, you in a way, you are performing  You've got 27 million uniques a month that go to dig.com  You have an audience  You're creating something that a vast number of people use  That probably has somewhat similar kind of buzz to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he also does a weekly video show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're saying you like to go in the office, right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that when people look at dig  It's not just because of the stories or the digging or all that stuff  It's kind of the stuff that we're doing in R&D that gets me so pumped  Right  You know, when we rolled out that story suggest feature  The recommendation engine last month, you know, digs were up 40%  We had friends adding activity and go up like 20x or something like that  And it's just that kind of thing where we're connecting people to each other  They have similar interests  Like that gets me really excited about the future of news  And kind of what we're building and what we can eventually provide to other sites  So, you know, that's what gets me pumped  I get excited by the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this streaming video that we're doing now, live streaming video  Oh, I love it  I think it's fascinating, isn't it?  I love the stickum stuff that you guys are doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that they I wonder why isn't CNN doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why isn't MSNBC?  And then I realized it was the same deal with tech TV  They have contracts with the cable companies that keep them from doing it  So now I'm wondering where is the Ted Turner of the 21st century?  Maybe it's you, Kevin, who comes along and says  Why aren't we doing a 24 hour news channel on the Internet?  Well, you also got to be careful, Leo, that you're not trading

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is one of my favorite phrases on the internet  One of my favorite phrases from somebody at one of the big networks  Is trading analog dollars for digital cents  You know, and in terms of you got to remember something  They're not looking to recreate the television experience  They're looking to generate advertisements

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And new revenue, not steal revenue from the old medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let's make a note of what Patrick said, which is dollars for cents  Because that's the ratio

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  On the other hand, the costs are so low for what I do  The costs are virtually nil

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're being eaten by like Stick AM and other companies  They're paying these extremely crazy bandwidth bills for you, right?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how long that's going to last

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because to do it yourself costs a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I just did the math on the 24 hours of iPhone  And we were, you know, well even right now when we have  I don't know what it is, 2,600 people watching  It's more than a gigabit per second  Right  I couldn't afford a gigabit stream and sometimes it spikes up to five or six gigabits

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly  I don't know how much that would cost  It's not just about the raw line either  It's about the fact that you have to have a cluster of servers  Yeah  That's going to be able to spread this out and handle that load and those spikes  And you know, that hardware is extremely expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The financial term that you're looking for, Leo, is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so am I just skating on somebody else's charity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course  Yeah, but the cool thing is we can jump around  Like, one will go out of business because they'll run out of money  And then you jump to the next free video provider

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all over the place  But by the way, you know, the thing that's called most favored nations  Which is the thing that restricts certain companies from streaming on the internet  While at the same time selling to cable  Right  And it's really, I thought at the time that the Tech TV was in business  They probably could have made a business out of it if they could have done a deal of some sort  Although it was apparently impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we were desperate to get on cable and we couldn't make that  We didn't have the strength to make that kind of deal  But I always said from day one, why are we building a brick and mortar business in the internet era?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's where the money was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the money for the cable companies  How many hundreds of millions of dollars do we pump into the pockets of Comcast and the like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and how much audience did you really have?  I mean, you have an audience now just on this show alone  That is probably 10X what you had on screen savers  Well, I don't know about that  I'm telling you, I looked at those numbers when they came through  If you have a half a million right now, you're 10X what you were getting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do, last month, 3.6 million views  So I think we're getting close  And the main point is that Tech TV was spending however many tens of millions a year to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the staff to support just one show  How many people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I counted once, it was like 22 people to do the screen savers behind the camera  And I have zero people behind the camera to do this  You got two people back there, give them credit  I do, I have Dane and Colleen and Tony

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that number, 22 people, that number went down a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hair and wardrobe alone, I had four people doing my hair  And well, they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all that was gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a message for you, Kevin Rose

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alright everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk from Wine Library TV  And what's really interesting is that I shaved my head, right?  And I think when you do something like that, you need to do some worthy cause behind it  So I'm starting the Shave Your Head for Charity Challenge  Here's how it works  I am going to give $200 to my favorite charity  If the person I call out right now shaves their head  And then they will do the same thing  You've got to give at least $100 to charity, that's the rule  I'm going to give $200  I'm going to give $300  Ready? So, the person that I'm going to call out right now  I'm going to post this video  Anybody who sees this has to send it to that person  Pressure that person  And then they've got to shave their head  Then they give charity to, you know, give a charity  Give some money when they call somebody out  And we go on forever  So the person that I'm going to call out  Kevin Rose, shave your head  Oh, he's sitting right there  I like my hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's sitting right there  So I guess you already heard that  I did, and I don't know what to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking about it, but  If I do it  I want to call Leo out  I want to call Leo out if I'm going to do it  Oh, I have to shave my hair? I can't shave my hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now do it, Kevin, do it  If you agree to do it, Leo, I'll do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll do it if Dvorak does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, well you've got a loser there  Because I figured this is the last head of hair I have before I'm too old and bald  Forget it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's children dying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? He didn't even say what charity  I'll send him a check  What charity?  He didn't even say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy is  The guy is a promotion artist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's face reality here  Let's face a couple realities  One, a one inch by one inch button on the twit homepage  Or a small little bitty dinky ad on the dig homepage  Would generate probably  Tens of thousands of dollars for a charity  And someone's going to shave their head for a one or two hundred dollar call out by some unknown guy  Who we don't even know is going to give them money  And who cares? It's only a couple hundred bucks  You have two guys who can generate hundreds of thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Gary Vaynerchuk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gary's pretty well known  Well I'm just saying  Let's say we get a bunch of founders and a bunch of tech celebrities to do this  This could generate some decent press  I'll shave my Vaynerchuk  That's oversharing  If you shave your Vaynerchuk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And send them hair to China to be made into wigs, I'm in  That's not that much hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry I missed all that  How would you know?  Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am so sorry  Edit this out please  Okay so we're going to move on now  It was the brain tonic talking  Oh man  Anyway I thought that  You know it's an interesting idea but  Let's face it Kevin, two hundred bucks, three hundred bucks, that's not enough  It should be thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see, I'm going to think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to do it? You're going to think about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice to have a change every once in a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're young guys  I'm with Dvorak, I may never see this hair again  I can totally see shaving it off and it doesn't grow back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, they're telling me in the chat room, and I'm looking a little closer at the picture  It does look like the Tesla was rear ended  And then went into the back of a Mercedes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a pretty heavy...  There's no evidence of that, I don't see anybody  It's a bit bent in the back of that Tesla  Yeah, it looks kind of messed up  No, but the other car, yeah you're right, looks like  Well, actually it does look pretty good for the Tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he doesn't  He hasn't gotten his yet, has he? I don't even know for a fact  that he's on the list  I think Calacanis is a big blowhard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he is number 16 on the list  This is actually probably the four guys  who hate Jason the most right on this show right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I don't  I like Jason  I'm just teasing  Calacanis is like everybody I went to college with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of the guys I went to college with are from Brooklyn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a Brooklyn kid  No, I think  To me, Jason grows on you  Same with Gary  Gary grows on you  It's that brash East Coast thing  They're brash  We're not going to talk about tech stories, right?  That was kind of a story  That was the Tesla story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was kind of a tech story  Yeah, wait, Dan Goldin is a senior producer at Twit  Yeah, he's the president of Twit  That's Dan, the guy I've seen him  Oh, he's the one who owns Hay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  That's his retirement account  I don't give him a 401k  So let's talk about Steve Jobs  Because we did quite a bit on Steve Jobs  And the Whipple procedure that he received  And now the New York Times has finally said  Told the truth  John Markoff and Joe Nocera and the Times  Writing the story that  That's why Apple stock tanked last week  Despite having the best quarter it's ever had  And then Jobs calls Nocera  You know, it's kind of funny  Because Joe, I would have led with that  At the top of the story, but Joe buries it at the bottom  Thursday afternoon after I've gotten my  Final Steve's Health as a Private Matter  From Apple PR  And much to my amazement, I'm reading from  Joe's article in the Times  Mr. Jobs, that's how you know it's the Times  They call him Mr. Jobs, called me  This is Steve Jobs, he began  You think I'm an arrogant bleep  Who thinks he's above the law  And I think you're a slime bucket  You're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong  Steve Jobs talking  That sounds like  What a great way to start a conversation  With a reporter, you're a slime bucket  Who gets most of his facts wrong  Then he offers to tell him the story  But only off the record

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he told him the story off the record?  He did, he said after that arrest  Did they tell you anything? Because I know the story by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well good, I'm going to ask you in a second  You're not off the record, are you?  You heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go tell me everything you know and then I'll tell you the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can confirm or deny  This is good, we're going to call this show  Confirm or Deny

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great, and name for a show we should do that show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that's great  That could be the successor to the ill-fated triangulation  We're good at names, John

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and I can come up with names, that's all  We should just be a naming company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just name shows, don't do them  Or do one  After that rather arresting opening  No, Sarah goes on to write  He went on to say that he would give me some details  About his recent health problems  But only if I would agree to keep them off the record  I tried to argue him out of it  But he wouldn't talk  If I insisted on an on-the-record conversation  So I agreed  Boy, that's a tough position to be in as a reporter  I would never do it  Well, yeah, but he's going to hang up  So?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tough position

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't you want to hear what happened?  Yeah, you would  It's a tough position  Okay, so now Sarah knows the story  But he's off the record  In fact, I'm surprised he could even say that  That call happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, I think that's a mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what he goes on, he says more  Because the conversation was off the record  I cannot disclose what Mr. Jobs told me  Suffice it to say  That I didn't hear anything that contradicted the reporting  That John Markoff and I did this week  Among other things they reported  That Jobs had had another procedure earlier this year  That the procedure was a success  There was no cancer  So that's confirmed apparently  While his health problems  Amounted to a good deal more than  A quote, a common bug  That's what Apple said after Donald Trump  They aren't life threatening  And he doesn't have a recurrence of cancer  After he hung up on the phone  It occurred to me  That I had just been handed by Mr. Jobs himself  The very information  He was refusing to share with the shareholders  Who have entrusted him with their money  So what was the point of that commentary?  Well I think he's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What he's saying, I think it was probably Steve's intent  Is he doesn't have cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he's not going to have cancer  He's going to have cancer  He doesn't have cancer  Because that's why the market went down  By the way after this article came out  The market started to resurge  The Apple stock price started to go back up  People really were worried  That Jobs was off the  Would be leaving the company  Now Apple has said consistently  Jobs health is  Not a matter of public record  And we're not going to talk about it  Who's right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in this case  In this case Apple's right and Jobs is right  I don't think, unless it's interfering with his daily activities  As CEO of the company  He shouldn't have to answer to anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you had erectile dysfunction

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not even going to touch that one  No need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us Leo, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No need to confirm or deny  I'm 31, please give me some wisdom in this area

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I agree with you  Kevin, and you see  Here you are  You're a major executive  A major tech firm  So you understand what's going on  It is private  But don't you think the shareholders have a right to know  Since it does have a material impact  On Apple and how  It's going to do going forward if Jobs leaves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes absolutely  But they have the right to know when it's interfering with his work  If he's starting to undergo chemo  Or he has to leave the office  Or he can't attend meetings  That's when the shareholders need to know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I guess you're right  Although in this case they didn't tell the shareholders  That Jobs had pancreatic cancer  Or was having surgery until the surgery was a success  That was several years ago  I mean Apple is not known for their forthcomingness  Anyway, I'm glad  I'll be really  I'm glad that Steve's feeling better  The procedure that he had  Apparently is not uncommon  With people who have had a whipple  To address the malnutrition issues that  Do sometimes come up with a whipple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I've been told by  Yes, malabsorption technically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did you hear John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well now that you brought all this up  I want to make a couple of comments  One, you say well Apple is  Trying, Apple is addressing this  For the shareholders  By saying that he hasn't got cancer  Now I would  Suggest that he probably doesn't have  Cancer or they wouldn't be making a public  Proclamation because they could really  Get themselves into a lot of trouble  In so far as shareholder lawsuits  Are concerned if in fact he did have cancer  But the word is he doesn't have  Cancer, he doesn't, you know, but he does have this  You know, malabsorption, you know, it's a typical  You know, it's like an old woman who can't really  Digest a lot of food and he's forced  To eat, you know, things he didn't like before  Because he's always been a vegan  I'm not going to go into the whole thing because  I want to write this up for Market Watch when I  But I have to get a confirmation on this one  Fact, and I'll kind of beat  Around the bush about it but you'll get the idea  There was a guy  Who is kind of an enemy  Of Steve's at the  Allen and Company meeting in  Sun Valley or Idaho, wherever  It is that they have this, you know,  Yearly confab of all these hot  Shots who essentially is a drinking club  But they get to get, you know,  The Allen and Company thing. You're not allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To say that you went though, right Kevin, if you go you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say that you were there? No, Jay went, I didn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, Jay went? Yeah.  Of course he did. I should talk to him.  Because I need one, if I can get one  Person to tell me this, then I  Because I already have the second confirmation, I just need the one  This one guy  Floating around the thing, everyone who  Would listen, he told, said  That Steve has cancer and he's going to drop  Dead any minute. Oh dear. And the fact  Of the matter is that's what triggered the  Stock runoff because all these  Guys are big shots  And so they all called home, hey, get out of Apple  Steve's dying. And so the  Thing apparently was because of a grudge  By  This one guy who is very famous  And he doesn't like Steve. This is  Why I don't buy stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to tell me when this story hits  Market Watch, I want to dig this. Are you going to name who the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is? Oh, absolutely. But I need the one  I need one confirmation because  I already know who it is, but I  Already have the second confirmation who won't  Give it up unless I have  A confirmation in front of it. It's a real weird  Journalistic thing. You got to prove it.  I mean, I could just go out and do it. But  To do it, because at Market Watch  We have a bunch of, you know, pretty  These guys are sticklers for these rules  And I'm not going to just do  Something unless I have the second  Backup. So I have the two  Confirmations and the guy's name comes out and I  Talk about the whole thing and what and how  You have to be careful with stocks like this and Steve's  Fine. So Jay didn't hear anything because  He definitely would have told me that if you had. Okay. Well  Then Jay's not one of the guys, but I have a laundry list  Of people that went to that thing and I brought the contact  One of them that'll tell me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we'll put the word out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we just did. Yeah, a lot of those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen to the show. John at the Dvorak.org  Can they can they do it anonymously?  No, I need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A name. I need somebody. No, but they're going to be anonymous  In the article. Right. But you but I'm not going to mention  Them. I don't care to mention them. It's not a big  Deal. I just need because I got the  Other guy. I just need one  Guy. Of course, the guy sure  The number of people that went to the  Company, Cod and Fab that listen to  Twitter is like five. That's all  You know, and well  Maybe maybe is none  Whatever the case is, I get the one thing a boom  It's done. I got the guy's name is out there and  Then we say that's what caused the down  Turn on the down that little  Slip. Right. It didn't work.  I thought it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sleazy. It is. Do you guys own  Apple stock? No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's  Scary. Patrick?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know. Because I review products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not we're not we kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't do that. You have to own  Leo. You guys, John, you guys must own some  Tech stocks, right? Actually, right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing. I don't hold them directly.  I may in you know, I have a  401k with with mutual funds, but  I don't even know what what stocks those funds buy  And I don't hold any directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the moment, I have zero tech stocks, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When like Warren Buffett  And the guy that founded like Vanguard  Fidelity basically says everybody  Should be in index funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good. Yeah, that's pretty much what I try to buy is  Index funds. Exactly. Yeah.  Although, you know, Buffett said don't  Buy Berkshire Hathaway. It's not going to do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's also a lot of  Interesting new derivatives. Andrew  Horowitz and I were pretty good friends.  We talk about some of these things.  And there's some wild ones out there. They've created  All kinds of weird vehicles for people  With 401ks. There's one in  Particular. There's an interesting game in particular  That are like  These kind of they're like it trades like a  Mutual fund. It trades as a regular  Stock, but it's essentially  A fund of shorts  Because when you have a 401k and you want to  Short the market, you can't do it. You cannot  Sell into your 401k.  But you can buy long  On a short. One of these crazy  Investment vehicles. Buy long on a short.  Buy long on a short.  And it's like the wild, wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuff. I get really nervous  About that stuff. It seems leveraged.  It seems like a great way to lose a lot of money.  It's totally leveraged. Especially these little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Devices called Ultras, which are  Extremely leveraged. But anyway,  It's not a stock show. We'll talk  About something else. Free Software Foundation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of going off the handle.  Free Software Foundation was founded  By Richard Stallman, who's never been known  For his politesse.  Defectivebydesign.org  Is calling  For geeks to make  An appointment at every  Apple store in the country.  There are currently 217 Apple stores  In seven countries, they point out.  They want to book up every Apple genius  And challenge  Them with the  Ten minute iPhone challenge.  Basically, as  A way to kind of underscore why they don't  Like the iPhone, because it ain't open.  And this is, I have  To say, this is the most childish thing I've  Ever heard of. I've heard worse.  Here are the questions they want you  To ask your genius. Shaving your head is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't hate on people that still have hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John. Hair haters.  You know, I think about shaving my head, Kevin.  Let's think about it. Alright.  It's got to be more money than that, though.  We've got to get Gary to stand up.  The thing is, he already did it.  Right. You know, it's easy  For him to say.  We should give him a challenge. Something he  Hasn't done yet.  You know where I'm going with this, don't you?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, are you  Suggesting that he shave his nuts or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what  You're talking about.  Why do all  Developers have to submit their applications  To Apple before they can be loaded onto an iPhone?  They want to know. And then the genius  Is supposed to answer. This poor genius.  And then they say, why  Does iTunes still contain so much  DRM-laden music? Why? Why?  Why?  Then the iPhone 3G has GPS support  But how can users be sure that  GPS cannot be used to track their position  Without their permission?  And on and on and on.  I mean, it's just  Silly stuff. And what is the  Point? Well, I  All right, I just wanted to call them out on that.  Maybe they should shave their heads.  Or  Whatever part of their body they would choose to find.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might be able to shed a little bit of light on some of this stuff.  I've heard that the reason  Why Apple is doing a lot of this is because  For QA purposes  And for something that had to do  With bandwidth  They're making sure that certain applications don't eat up  Too much bandwidth through AT&T.  Oh, that's interesting.  I heard that, it's really interesting.  I talked to a guy that works at Apple  That shall remain unnamed.  But he was telling me about the  New fix that's coming out in the  2.1 software that's going to fix some of these crashing issues.  Oh, I can't wait.  And he mentioned that  The actual  Firmware that's going in the phone  Has to be shipped to  AT&T first for approval. Oh, that makes sense.  Which I thought was really interesting.  They have to go through it and make sure  That everything they want done on their network.  Oh, that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, it's weird.  It's the old days of, remember the old  Of the phone company, you say you can't attach  Any equipment to our network unless we approve it.  I.e. rent it to you.  And then the Carter phone decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Given the amount of  The number of customers  And the amount of digital traffic  This is generating  I can see where they might be a little uptight about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm loving it. I'd say  I'm going to put four or five pages of applications  And I have to say I love the location  Based app.  Kevin, you have a new iPhone.  No, not yet. Oh, you upgraded to 2.0, I'm sure.  I kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a version of the  Pre-release version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which actually  Was probably a smart thing to do.  I put the pre-release version  On my iPod Touch.  Oh, you did? Yeah, it worked fine.  I had a new iPhone one. There was a touch version as well that leaked out.  It worked fine.  But I have the new phone.  I have to say I have all the same complaints  I had about the old phone except that  Third party applications changes everything.  These are amazing.  Some of the games are fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You use Shazam, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like Midori a little better.  You like Shazam?  These are the programs you get to hold up to the radio  When you want to know what the song is.

Finally, she says, well, you know my address.  Come visit us anytime.  My wife invites  the woman on the other end of the phone  at Travelocity in India to come visit us.  She said, well, she was very helpful.  What if she comes and visits?  Anyway, that's another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  AOL radio even is pretty awesome.  Do you use Pandora, Kevin, on the iPhone?  I use Last FM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last FM, great. Same idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was pleased because I could put classical music in there.  I was looking for a classical composer.  I actually put it in Pandora and all of a sudden  I get this great classical channel.  I thought, oh, it must be Pandora.  I thought, oh, it must be pop music.  But no, they do classical as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we getting paid for this commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I do have a commercial we could get paid for.  Would you like to?  Go for it.  This show brought to you by those good folks at Visa.  With every purchase,  Visa prevents, detects, and resolves  online fraud.  I recently had a little issue.  I know you all know about it.  Where I bought a video camera online.  Didn't use my Visa card.  And now I'm out $2,000.  Wouldn't have happened with Visa.  When you go online to shop,  you should be thinking about,  do I want the  brown clippers  or do I want the Norelco  clippers? You shouldn't have to worry  about fraud.  Am I going to get ripped off?  When you use your Visa card, you don't have to.  All the purchases you make are safe and secure  with Visa. They've got many ways to prevent,  detect, and resolve online fraud.  Including very sophisticated  business intelligence based  fraud monitoring. This stuff is amazing.  We've talked about this, John.  You trigger it by going out and buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they all have these algorithms.  You can trigger a card stop  by making a series of purchases  that match some sort of a typical  series that someone who would steal  a card would make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You buy a pair of Adidas and you fill up two tanks of gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You start with two tanks of gas  and you buy shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that'll do it every time.  Very sophisticated stuff that detects this stuff  so that you don't get ripped off.  And the best part is,  zero liability. You are not liable for  unauthorized purchases. Somebody asked,  is that true for a Visa debit card?  You bet. Peace of mind.  Safe, secure Visa.  That's why I use my Visa and why you should  use Visa too when you go shopping  online. We thank Visa so much  for their support of  this week in tech.  Alright, moving on. Another story.  Scrabulous.  Kevin, you seem like the kind of guy that plays  Scrabulous on Facebook. I do indeed. Love it.  Yeah, it's great. I actually  had to stop when I had like eight games going at once.  What's the most games you've had at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like four or five. It's fun, isn't it?  It is. Especially the multiplayer games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you mean more than two  people? Yeah.  Wow, how do you do that? Have you done that?  The turn-based? Oh, no,  I haven't. Of course, it's just like a real Scrabble game.  Except, says Hasbro.  No, it's not.  I feel sorry for these guys.  Two guys, I think,  they're brothers? Yeah.  Rajat and Jayant  are Gowala.  Their software company, RJ Softwares.  They've been going back and forth with Hasbro.  Hasbro says, look,  we own the rights to Scrabble.  Your game, it's not called  Scrabble, but it's the same board, same rules, same  scoring. It's Scrabble.  And I guess they never came to  an agreement. Finally,  Hasbro's gone to court.  They filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York  City. They took their time. I think they were  probably trying to work something out.  I mean, it's been since January  that they mentioned this. Now they want  Scrabbulous to pull  the game off Facebook  and pay them an undeclared  amount of damages.  You know, this isn't the way to handle it.  I'm actually surprised to hear that they're doing this.  Maybe the brothers weren't  willing to go along, but don't you think the right thing to do is buy  the company? They've got a great implementation  of Scrabble. Just buy the  company and brand it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. It depends on what the brothers were  asking for, though, right? I mean, if you  come in and say, hey, we really appreciate all the work  you've done. You have a huge following. You've wrote a lot  of great code here. You know, here's  a million bucks. Like, those guys should  take it. They shouldn't try and fight and say, no,  actually, this is a different game.  You know, because it is a clear ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. We don't  know that happened, though.  And I want to bring up another example  of this sort of thing. Some years  back, and I don't remember the name of the product, but there was  some company that developed  a methodology to take  Sony PlayStation 1 games  and run them on the PC.  It became quite a popular  little game because you could, you know, put  a PlayStation 1 game in the PC  and you could run it on your PC.  And Sony sued them into bankruptcy.  When it seems to me  that Sony should just get said, here, how much money  do you want? It was a pretty good job you did  here because they did. And here's  you take the money and, you know, or  we'll sue you.  We don't know the story here, but it seems to me  that I'm always  of the impression that these companies  don't do that. They just decide to  sue. Do we  know they ever made them an offer? It's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going on since January. You've got to figure something happened  between January and July between the two of  them. They must have been talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's got to find this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just, you know, they've got  I don't know how. I mean, this is, if not  the most popular application on Facebook, it's  got to be one of the most popular applications  on Facebook.  You would think that that's worth  something. And you're right, maybe the  brothers said, oh, we need a billion dollars.  You know, it's worth a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, that's a possibility, but I would  hope one of them gets ahold of us and tells us  the facts here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they will.  RJ Software's, give us  a ring. I promise not to make fun  of you with strange voices.  Another story, Delicious.  Finally, it looks like Delicious, again  from Mike Harrington, consider the source. You like  Mike, though, right, Kevin? You're not  resentful of the stories that he

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  publishes. No, I mean, I know  Mike. Yeah,  I don't hate the guy.  You wish he'd lay off?  I don't hate the guy. It's his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't hate the guy. There is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ringing endorsement. I don't hate it.  I think that Mike writes,  he's got a lot of really good posts on  and I follow his side as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying in the chat room that  you are very patient with me. Deb  says, you're very patient, Kevin.  Thank you for being so  patient.  No problem.  He's never coming back,  is he? I'm going to chase him away  and he's never going to come back.  You're making his life miserable.  I haven't seen Delicious 2. I've seen screenshots.  You're friends with  Joshua  Schachter who did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just sent him an IM. I said,  what do you think of the new Delicious? I'm on  this Week in Tech podcast. They want to know.  He hasn't wrote back yet. Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let us know what he says. He left  Yahoo just a few weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like a month, month and a half ago, something like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. And what's he doing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's just working  on his own little stuff, just playing  around. I love Delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We use Delicious. I know it's  not really a dig competitor. It's just a very different  thing. We use it for our bookmarks.  Yeah. So you  can actually see what stories we  talk about ahead of time if you know the  show number. This is 153.  By the way, finally, delicious.com. I don't  have to say del.icio.us.  I like the  old one. Just a lot of dots.  delicious.com slash twit slash  the show number, in this case 153,  you see the stories that we're going to talk about.  It's very handy. I didn't get it  until we started doing  twit. And then I realized how valuable and  useful it is. I use it all the time.  What's 2.0? What's it going to be? Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've played around with it about  six months ago. I don't know how much they've changed  it since then. So I don't know.  They were changing some of the navigation.  There was a graphics refresh.  I don't know feature-wise what's changed, though.  What would you do  with it?  That's a good question.  Do you sometimes look at sites and think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, you know, because you always  look at it. All your energy is going to dig. And what am I  going to do next with dig?  Do you ever look at other sites and say, what would I do  with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that delicious has been pretty much the same  for a long time. And it's  a great utility. One of the things that happened,  I know, that slowed things down for them  was that once they were acquired  by Yahoo, Joshua  was forced to port them over  to PHP. And originally it was  all written in Perl. And that  process just took forever.  And I guess they couldn't get the right engineering talent.  And, you know, he  was scaling fine before that  started happening. And then all of a sudden, they  started working on 2.0 once the port was complete.  And now it's just,  you know, three years, fast forward three years,  and he's left and nothing's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the reason for the port?  Perl works fine.  No, but that's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Yahoo, I mean, yeah.  Yahoo does that with everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would make everybody go to PHP  since when? Because PHP is a fairly  new initiative.  When did they start changing over?  Is it some PHP nutcase, CTO?  And what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they've been in PHP for a long time now, for years and years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For at least... Yeah, but they weren't in PHP  in 1994.  Yeah, I don't know. Microsoft does the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing. I mean, Hotmail was running on Linux  before they bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they need to do that because of the  public relations fiasco, if it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  still running on Linux. I don't know, you know,  I just read that Yahoo, I mean, I'm sorry,  Microsoft, just pledged  $100,000 a year to the Apache Software Foundation.  They're actually one of the  platinum partners for Apache.  Oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they can be on the mailing  list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For them, it's nothing, is it? Here's a  100 grand kid, go away.  Don't bother me.  They get more than 100 grand worth of PR  because they're supporting open source.  I mean, I think  that's a good thing they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's where the money for all the guys that are going out to  assault the Apple  geniuses is coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, ASF is not related  to FSF. They're different  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Yahoo should buy Dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have to say this with  Kevin's behalf. For a billion.  When you look at what happens to  companies like Jaiku and  Dodgeball when Google buys them or  Delicious when Yahoo buys them, it's very  common for these innovative, small,  nimble companies to get eaten by these  big guys and just languish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should make Kevin  stay there for three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly what they do. And then just like  With 산

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's Our main  Now here's the deal, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine Carl Icahn comes along and says, I'm going to take over dig and you know, threatens rattles his sword.  August 1st, you're public.  You're not public, so you have to worry about it.  But let's say you were and he rattles his sword.  So we're going to go to the shareholder meeting.  We're going to do it.  So Yahoo says, OK, fine.  We're going to give you a board seat and three others or three board seats.  Now you got to deal with Carl Icahn at every board meeting.  Imagine that's a deal.  That's got to be hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, these are the challenges that well, I don't have to deal with that because we're not publicly traded.  So that's very nice.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you do you don't have to worry about you have board meetings though because you have investors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's we have two other board members besides Jay and myself, Brett Bullington and David Z.  It's pretty small.  Yeah, it's very small board.  And, you know, it's it's it's great.  We are board meetings are fast and pretty pretty painless.  Yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And an agreement. It must be tough when you have a happy would you ever consider going public with thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I think that, you know, we will be profitable very soon.  And, you know, we're just happy kind of growing it the way we are right now.  You know, when you go public, all of a sudden you give up a lot and you have to answer to a lot.  A lot of people and, you know, it's just a pain in the ass with everything that needs to be filed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Wall Street's kind of cruel and fickle and random.  Yeah, people beat their estimated earnings and Wall Street punish them because they wanted them to beat their estimated earnings by even more.  It's like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know.  The only reason I really see to go public is if you need to raise an insane amount of money, you know, and we don't need that cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You took investments because you needed a lot of servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I remember that.  Man.  I was running the entire company off my own personal life savings and that ran out.  And so I needed to take some angel funding.  So I took, you know, 50 grand from a friend and then some cash from a few other angels.  That kind of ran out.  And then we did a series A with Greylock and Pierre Omidyar's Omidyar Network.  And they invested $2.8 million and that helped us, you know, buy a ton of servers and people to help scale the site.  And then that happened again with our series B. Just to buy more servers and add people.  I mean, you need several DBAs.  You know, what if one goes on vacation?  Right.  You need a backup. You need, you know, a whole slew of developers.  And people that have the experience scaling, you know, large websites, which is hard to find.  It's easy to find a lot of PHP developers, you know.  We get applications from all types of people with varying degrees of experience that have worked in PHP for, you know, years.  But you sit down with them and you say, OK, what large websites have you worked on?  You know, what do you know about sharding a database and writing very specific code to help you scale to hundreds and hundreds of servers?  And that list is very small.  And when you do find those people, they're very expensive.  And they work for Google, half of them.  Exactly. They work for Google and Yahoo.  And so you have to be able to pull them out of these companies.  And that's hard to do.  So it's getting easier with Yahoo.  We do have a lot of resumes from people over there.  But yeah, it's difficult to find talented people.  Joshua just got back to me.  You want to know what Shakhtar said about just said, I quote, I hope this new system puts them on a good footing for moving forward.  This is why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. He must have like a special non-disclosure thing or a contract that you could probably generate.  He loses like a million.  You can write a generator for this stuff.  Tell him to tell him to get lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem you have with this show is you can never get somebody on.  Nobody's going to ever say anything because people are diplomatic and careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not diplomatic.  Everybody's after the almighty dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have friends that are still working there.  And I'm sure there's a lot of stuff involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's political and it's corrupt and there's all these bad things.  It's horrible. I think the whole thing should be torn down.  We should just shut down the Internet.  That'll take care of most of this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My problem is I can if I think something it comes out of my mouth, I cannot be diplomatic.  I'm really bad at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we haven't noticed this, but you haven't noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.  I think I say things I get in trouble all the time.  Well, I'll give you an example.  No, I'm not going to give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's say Leo says we're talking about, you know, big main, you know, these guys who are running these systems like Kevin was describing.  Do we what is the story behind that guy in San Francisco?  That is a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's and now there's more to it.  Okay, so we'll take you back rewind a couple of weeks.  We talked about this on Twitter, I think last week or the week before.  Guy is a sys admin.  He's hired by the city of San Francisco to set up a very important wide area land for the city.  This is how administrators and others are going to be able to, you know, civil officials are going to be able to log into the city's network remotely.  The guy is apparently a brilliant engineer, maybe a little cranky as many sys admins are.  By the way, belated happy sys admins day.  We love sys admins.  He won't give up the passwords to, you know, I guess a new guy comes in to monitor the security and the sys admin says, no, I'm not.  Who are you? I'm not going to give you the passwords.  They arrest him, put him in jail, five million dollars bail.  They're afraid that he's kind of holding the system for ransom.  In fact, they tell the story.  Well, he was worried about losing his job and this was a poison pill and they're afraid that he's got people who are going to call, you know, call a special code in and blow the whole thing up digitally.  Mitnick all over again.  Yeah, none of this happens.  In fact, you go on InfoWorld and you and you and he's really got a champion on InfoWorld who's telling this story.  And apparently this guy's actually kind of just trying to protect the network that he created and he's worried about, yay, who's getting in there and messing the whole thing up.  Well, he finally gives up.  I mean, wouldn't you you're thrown into jail.  He finally gives after a while.  I mean, he holds out for days.  He finally gives up, gives the passwords.  And by the way, if you want to read about this, the series of articles by Paul Venezia in InfoWorld is what to read.  So he gives up the passwords.  And what does the city do?  It puts all the passwords in its complaint and publishes them.  My God.  The San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris publishes one hundred fifty user names and passwords used by various departments to connect the city's VPN as Exhibit A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, was it password or password hashes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, according to Robert McMillan writing in InfoWorld, it's the passwords.  That's a good question.  They place the passwords into the public record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't want some of my passwords to be seen by the public.  Well, this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's a good point.  What do you use kind of like ex-girlfriends, things like that?  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  We're not talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, no, you're right.  I wouldn't want people because passwords are embarrassing, you know, kitty poop and stuff like that.  You don't want to use, you know, anybody.  But nonetheless, I mean, it actually proves if I'm the defending attorney, Terry Child's case all along, these guys are bozos.  They don't know anything about security.  They shouldn't have these passwords.  Apparently, the DA's office did not say what the passwords were used for.  But a source familiar with the situation says they're for logging into the VPN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that had been fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're phase one passwords.  You do need a second password to access the network, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the things embarrassing passwords, one of the password tips that I picked up on, which I never thought about before,  but somebody on one of the Cranky Geeks shows brought this up, Farmer, I think, said really a good password, you know, is something like,  say you have a New York Times account and your password should be, this is my New York Times password.  You know, so there are actually sentences and thoughts that you remember and you make that your password,  because who's going to ever dream, you know, think that, well, my password is going to be something as, you know, birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to guess something like that, even though it's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  Unless you did it every time, like this is my dig password.  This is my New York Times password.  This is my, that wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, then it would be, yeah, you have to come up with like different phrases or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you guys use random passwords?  Do you use like one password for the Mac?  I actually do.  I use a hash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love one password.  Yeah.  And that's, you don't love it or you don't use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't use these things.  I have a series of passwords that I use for different layers.  I have like the hyper secure password I use for certain things and I have the password.  I don't care that I have it, you know, at all.  It's just like some crap password for these stupid sites that ask for passwords when you shouldn't really need a password like, you know,  the Cincinnati Inquirer or the, you know, some newspaper that wants you to, you know, to subscribe, you know, to register.  I don't need a fancy password for that.  It's something like password will work.  Who cares if they get into your account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, who cares?  John S.  I'm so, so happy about Firefox and how they changed the password authentication.  You know what I'm talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't secure before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it now asks you whether you'd like to save the password after you've seen whether the password works or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's true.  They do, don't they?  That's a big improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's so much.  Because you know how many times I've said save password and then you click that then it continues on to the next page and it was the wrong password  and you just saved the wrong password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It pops up that bar now and you don't have to say remember until you get in and then you can say remember.  Remember that one, not the four others I tried.  Right, exactly.  John S. is saying in the chat room that the Dvorak's password is get off my lawn.  And then when he goes to another site, it's you too.  Get off my lawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I got to change it.  That was a nervous laugh.  I was going to say.  Now I've got to change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get off my lawn for the times.  I use a actually really clever and it's probably I don't know.  I think it's secure.  Really clever web bookmark lit that a guy wrote in JavaScript is called Super Gen Pass.  You Google Super Gen Pass you'll find it and what it does is you give it you have a master password that never changes and then it makes a hash based on the master password and the and the TLD of the domain you're on.  And so it's unique for every site, but you can always recreate it because you know your master password is so it's very and it's just a bookmark lit.  So it'll feed it in.  I really love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Can you send that to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Super Gen.  Well, it's just Google Super Gen Pass, but I'll send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super Gen Password that is just Super Gen Pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really smart actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's you know, he's been he's done a few iterations.  This is the most recent.  It's Super Gen Pass dot com.  So what you do is you you you can enter your master password in permanently so you don't have to enter it or you can have it have to be entered each time.  You can say the default length and you make a bookmark out of it, which I use and it actually works on the iPhone, which is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, is it taking it's taking your your master password plus the URL of the site and hashing the not the full URL, but because you don't want that because it uses just the top level domain.  And then that's how it creates the unique password for every site that's unguessable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's using a strong hash.  It's awesome.  And then you don't so and the most important part to me is it's recreatable.  So I have to remember I just go back to the site.  All I have to remember is my master password.  That's great.  And it's not reversible.  You can't, you know, reverse it and get the master password out of it.  And it's hooked and it's specific to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  So, I mean, I can't go to the know you'd have to know my pastor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you knew my master pass, you could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  It would it doesn't vary.  It doesn't have some salt or something.  It throws in there each time some new guy comes along.  So I'm not Leo Laporte.  I'm John C.  Devore.  I don't know.  That's an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the same master password.  You do.  Do I get the same hashed passwords?  Not right.  So it has to be based on one other iteration of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very interesting.  What would that be?  Because it can't be random.  Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to recreate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be my username at the super password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you don't have a username there.  You don't.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't show up like a like tiny URL and you throw it in and boom, you get a thing back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you put it in your book.  You're a toolbar, your bookmark bar and it generates a JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still secure though, because you have to know the username of the site that you're  logging into anyway, remotely.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it needs one more.  Not that I care.  I'm using Fred for all my little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy, I don't know his name.  There's a mobile version.  I've been using it for a long time.  It's been really useful and I love it.  That's just a really great way to but I still use Firefox's password memorization and one password.  I use Robo form on the Windows side because you still you know, I mean there are.  Places that I don't use Supergen pass.  You want to remember those passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know a couple weeks ago since we're plugging websites, I mentioned that I my you know,  oldest Eric had developed a website that I was going to plug sometime.  Yeah, is it done?  It was not stolen beta, but I said I was going to do it the next week.  Course I wasn't here last week, but I should mention to people it's actually quite cool.  And you know, he's been I've been you know, he's I don't know if he can handle the was just putting it off a little bit,  but he's got it took him about a year to do this because of the of the block the blocks that Craigslist puts up for challenging multiple sites at once.  But he's got this thing called Craigs finder C R A I G F I N D R no E dot com which allows you to search all the Craigslist sites by checking off the ones you want for whatever product you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really awesome.  But I think they've shut down the last couple of things that they shut his down five times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This one works and they and they don't shut it down.  They're not going to shut it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can't.  He's got all kinds of weird stuff going on in the back end.  There's never the same IP address twice.  All I can tell you is that they've not been able to catch him on this one.  And so now you can multiply you can look at all the Craigslist sites you want search for stuff and find it and they're not going to raise you know, they can send the cease and desist order to you John.  Now, why would they not do it?  I mean, I Craig and I are friends.  So I don't think he's going to do that.  I mean, they're they'd rather fight it with technology, but I don't think they're going to be able to manage it.  Besides that somebody should have a site like this anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Patrick, why would they want to shut it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've shut down.  They've shut down basically like let's say I'm looking for a part for my truck, right?  And I want to search every Craigslist in the, you know, in the lower West Coast.  Yeah, the West Coast, you know, right now I basically have to go in and log in separately to all the different sites.  They basically from what I've seen in the past, they want to keep things local and and the you know, beyond that they really haven't gotten too much into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, there's not their philosophy on this is kind of half-assed and the fact of the matter is when you're in San Francisco and Sacramento, if you're looking for a part like what you're describing is local.  It's a 90 minute drive.  But still there's something I really need.  I want to search.  I don't want to have to log in and log out and log in and log out of one, you know, Craigslist after another.  So he's got it.  So you can you click these little check boxes you type in, you know, rear differential, you know, 75 Corvette boom and it looks at all these things.  The problem of course is that if you check too many boxes, the list of hits is astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's depending on what you're looking for.  But exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eric is wondering in our stick am chat room why Craig doesn't do this himself.  Why don't they offer that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they should buy, you know, my son's code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they believe that they should be encouraging, you know, local communities and not, you know, allowing people to say scavenge nationwide for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what it does though, Patrick, which I think is interesting.  It allows you to really spot scams.  Oh, because they'll be on a lot of sites at once.  You search for something and you do it a bunch of different sites and you start to see this exact same, you know, thing and it's always this worded the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody selling a Toyota Prius in Houston and 13 other states and the response address all goes the same email.  Right.  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff like that.  What's a Prius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prius.  Sorry.  What did you buy, Kevin?  Did you buy a Prius?  No, I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bought a Hummer, didn't you?  You bought a Hummer too.  No.  I got an Audi A3.  Oh, that's nice.  An A3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But sensible.  Not a crazy car.  Not a convertible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a convertible, no.  Not a TT?  Not a TT.  Although those are nice.  They're small, work well in the city.  You have an automatic or stick?  It's automatic, but it has a triptonic shifting so it has a paddle shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I have that on my Lexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Having a stick shift in San Francisco is crazy.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sucks.  I have a stick shift in my truck.  It sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's so manly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's actually, it's mostly, it's just, it's easy.  It's cheap and it's easy to replace and it's really hard to break it.  But believe me, I'm looking forward to going back to having an automatic transmission in my life soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys just dig use S3 at all, Kevin?  No, we do not.  I know Pounce does for, what, images.  Storage, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For all the files actually.  So any media that's sent around on Pounce.  Any type of file, MP3, you name it, pictures, all stored on S3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon.  How's Pounce doing?  Good.  It's doing well.  Can I ask you a philosophical question?  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what you're going to ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to ask the same question.  Yeah, I knew you'd know I'd know that you'd know that we would, yeah.  Anyway, why are you even using Twitter, let alone pushing poor Leo off the top of the heap?  When you're the Pounce guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Pounce is for where I use it all my media.  Pounce isn't a mobile experience.  Like you can't send a text message and see where your friends are at or if you're at a bar.  Twitter is very much like what you're up to, what you're doing.  And anytime I'm going to post a video or a file or a song, I can't do any of that on Twitter.  So I do it all on Pounce.  It's just used for different use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I actually use both of them and I use them kind of that way too.  I know what you mean.  And I still post on Jaiku for kind of old time's sake.  Although I don't know why.  I like the commenting system on Pounce.  I really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to get better soon.  We've made some improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to point out that Barack Obama has now pushed me down even further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did he jump up again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's number two.  Huh.  He's beating me by, you know, like 50 people and Kevin's got like a 2,000.  We're the three people over 50,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you should be able to jump ahead of Barack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you gave away that iPhone, right?  It's over now.  Yeah, it's over.  So you can all stop following Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, if I were you people, I would, I would, I would not follow him.  This is like fourth grade again.  Go to the, not follow him.  I'm on Leo's side with this.  I just want to point out.  Why are you guys hating?  We can all be followed by the same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are we hating?  Because I want to be number one.  We drag haterade.  No, I want to point out.  I gave away 10 iPhones on that 24 hours iPhone, 10 iPhones.  But did I tie it to any, you got to follow them?  No, I just gave them away.  Just gave them away.  Wow.  10 of them.  That's because I'm a moron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who does Dvorak have his sights on now?  Veronica is ahead of him.  Scoble, Calcanis and Alex Albrecht.  So is Alex going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was under Veronica for a while.  I want to be on top of Veronica.  Stop it.  The same old bad joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same bad sexist pig joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What sexist?  I'm telling you.  She's on the list.  What am I saying?  She's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me ask you though.  Is Alex the next one I'm going to have to worry about?  Is he going to start beating me too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's been in the 30,000 range for a little while.  I don't think you have to...  I think we're all slowing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm surprised.  I think Baraka is because of Berlin.  I think he's all these new followers for Baraka from Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't feel bad, at least.  You're like the top 10, Leo.  It's not like you're down in the top 25 or something.  No heaven forbid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seriously, it's all silly.  It's all silliness.  But I think there's some...  I guess I thought there'd be some bragging rights associated  with being the most followed person on Twitter.  And when I found out there actually is nothing.  Nobody even knows.  Nobody watches Twitter-holic.  Nobody pays any attention to that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the people in the top 20 do.  Yeah, we care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Scoble is so funny because Scoble was dominated Twitter  for so long.  And now that he's, you know, he's like, I don't know what he's down  in the number six or seven spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like, oh, I don't care about followers anymore.  It's not who follows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's who you follow.  It's not about the followers.  It's who follows.  It's not who follows you.  It's who you follow.  Anyway, let's talk about S3 in just a second.  But before we do, I do want to mention audible.com, our fabulous  audiobook sponsor audible.com slash twit.  You can go there and get a free book.  And this is the book I'm going to pick today is a little sad,  but I think a wonderful book and I highly recommend it audible  before we get to the book audible has 50,000 titles.  It is the best way to read you just get download it within a minute.  You've got the book you put it on any portable device.  Listen on the computer burned a CD not any there are a few portable  devices the zoom coming soon.  I think next month they're going to have it on the zoom, but it's  on most portable devices, certainly all the iPods and iPhones.  And it's just great.  I just love listening to audiobooks when I'm driving when I'm in the  gym when I'm walking to work.  So here's one I want to highly recommend to you Randy Poush who  just passed away this week professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  A beloved figure.  He actually worked on Alice, which was among other things, which  is an amazing graphical programming language designed to turn kids  on to programming was one of the many things he worked on.  There is there was a kind of a tradition at some schools.  I think CMU had this tradition to give your quote last lecture.  What you would tell people if this was the last class you were ever  going to teach the last lecture you were ever going to give well,  Randy gave his last lecture about what six months ago a year ago,  but it really was his close to his last lecture because Randy he knew  at the time had a terminal illness a young a young guy terminal cancer  and he gave a lecture that is unbelievably moving.  You might have seen it on YouTube.  I put it on my blog when I saw it the first time.  It's just incredible.  I mean everything from how how watching Star Trek inspired him and  how he got a chance to meet, you know, Shatner later and the lecture  was called really achieving your childhood dreams and it wasn't about  dying and I want you to think it's maudlin.  It really is about if you were going to take the essence the distilled  the essence of what you'd learned in a life and that you could pass  along to others.  It was these things that he saw were so important.  So he's made a book out of it or he made a book out of it narrated  by Randy and Eric Singer and it is an audible book the last lecture  and I think if if you didn't even if you saw the lecture,  there's more material in this on YouTube.  This is four hours and 15 minutes.  So it's considerably more I've read the book and I've listened to  the book and it's just incredibly inspiring not sad not maudlin  but tremendously inspiring Randy passed away lost his battle with  cancer this week and this would be a good time to sit down if you're  already an audible member and get this book the last lecture and  if you're not you can get it for free right now by going to audible  dot-com slash twit and we do salute Randy Pausch just amazing.  He also did a lecture which I think is on YouTube on getting  things done.  Now, here's a guy who just has a few months to live.  You can imagine, you know, prioritizing your life becomes extremely  important and I'm told I actually haven't seen this one, but I'm  told that his his time management lecture is even better than his  last lecture.  Both of them.  It's good to see and I'll put a link to his time management lecture  that you actually you can lifehacker has an article about it's  probably best place to go and they have the lecture on the on that  page.  So go to lifehacker and search for Randy Pausch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're doing the kick-ass monster gaming machine or something  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, basically what happened was we were playing around  with we got some requests for a gaming machine and  we're playing around with the idea and Nvidia called up  and said hey you put together your list of parts  and we will give the machine away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they called me but we didn't see we didn't know  we were going to use an Nvidia whether we were to use a  video card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't take calls Leo.  That's probably the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have been on the Twitter on Twitter live every Friday  for the last month and a half.  We've been building the ultimate gaming machine bit by  bit asking listeners.  What we should put in it and then at the end we're  almost done.  We've actually expected almost all out.  We're starting to assemble it and we're going to show it  at the Nvidia's Envision show and this is actually  interesting because we didn't know if we were going to use  ATI or Nvidia until we actually got the viewers to  vote on that but we are going to use Nvidia cards.  So we can show it Kevin Creewell let us show it at the  Envision show August 25th.  But here's what I want to do Patrick because you're building  one of yours.  We're building ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I got I got to say something.  We decided backing off.  Well, first of all, the challenge was just laid.  I haven't had a chance to back off yet John.  So take a deep breath stand back.  But we're not I mean we weren't you know, I mean this wasn't  supposed to be a completely out of control ultimate over  the top gaming machine piss away as much money in as we  can.  It's a it's a hot machine, you know, I mean, but it's like,  you know, I want to see the specs on yours and not stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, strictly speaking.  It's not fair because I already knows ours is fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if you said to me today, let's both build an  ultimate gaming machine.  Yeah, we could go and that would be different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'd end up probably with similar hardware.  We're using we're using Intel QX 9770 quad core.  You guys did not go quad core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to do we're going to core is not very useful  for gaming, but it is expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it is useful and that's why I would love to do  a benchmark with you because it sounds like fighting words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hear it better gamers than you and I who benchmark for  living aren't real thrilled about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bring them in as the judges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, I like like me literally like, you know,  there's people who benchmark for a living that that I tend  to know that's fine Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll tell you what you and I will benchmark these two.  I'll tell you we we we used as our criterion.  We said we're building essentially a crisis machine.  We said what is the most demanding game out there?  We're going to build a machine that will play that that will  be kind of if it doesn't play crisis better than anything  out there, then there's no point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically what this is all about is because you're still  angry that you don't have more followers on Twitter than  Kevin.  You're going to take it out on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a stretch.  I'm not buying that one Patrick.  Nice try though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try to change the subject in the fun.  So we're putting we're putting in not one not two, but three  Nvidia GFX 280 cards for three-way SLI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh great.  So you've already spent like half of our budget for the  machine.  So that's like well, here's the deal Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't have a budget.  We said you the listeners the viewers on Twitter live are  going to choose whatever you choose.  We will build and then we're going to give it away at the  end.  So this is what they chose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gotta be honest with you because we talked about doing  you know, like like in a game a classic over-the-top gaming  machine and we decided it would be more interesting for us to  do just something that we might actually buy ourselves.  You know, I mean like who's going to buy like, you know,  the 280s are fast, but they're not that much faster than the  260s.  You're running three of them.  Yeah, baby, you know, that's the down-paying.  I mean, it's going to be smoking fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30 inch screen with two side 24 inch screens.  Yeah, it's a 790i motherboard.  You're killing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're killing him.  He's like the Iron Sheik in a 1960s wrestling match.  He's backing off begging for mercy.  I said I'd shave my head if he beat us.  Well, obviously you're not going to be shaving your head  anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be fun as if I could figure out a way to beat you  that would really piss you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would really, that would not only would I be bald, but  I'd be bright red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be even cooler if you could beat him by cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I confess I was a little perturbed when I saw, you know,  he'd been doing this is our major promotion for Twitter live  for the last six weeks and all of a sudden Tekzilla is doing  and it's like, oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what Patrick was at one time the master of overclocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Well, oh, I didn't mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no way to overclock around 3,280s.  We've got a pair of 2,60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're overclocking the 9770 to 4 gigahertz plus and we're  running, it's a dual liquid cooled system.  So that will, you know, keep the thing cool.  We are going to use DDR3.  We were debating DDR2, 3.  We decided to go with DDR3 because we want to use a 790 on  the motherboard.  I'm thinking this is going to be, look, it's possible to build  a faster machine, but not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem is we basically we already have, we have  slower graphics cards and we have two and not three.  So, you know what I mean?  Like you want to slower processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forget it.  He's not going to take the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man.  All right.  You would have seen me bald Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you wouldn't.  That's the point.  He wouldn't have seen you bald.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm more than willing though, you know, it'd be fun though  as we could look at the cost versus, you know, cost for  versus performance analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but one of the one of the stipulations I made is bring

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Gartner group in one of the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the TCO on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're an outlier for sure.  One of the stipulations was you choose it.  We'll build it.  We're not going to watch our pocketbooks on this.  Although we have a little bit.  I mean, it's not it's not I mean you could put in another  card.  So what I said was if there's not a real performance advantage,  we're not going to do it.  For instance, we're only going to put in four gigs of RAM  because as far as we could tell, this was the key is we we  talked to a lot of people on the show.  We brought them in fact, we're going to bring a game game  designers.  I think we're hoping to get the crisis designers in next week.  Do we need eight gigs?  Do we need 12?  Do we need 16?  We'll get it if we need it.  But if we don't need and that's why we went quad because  crisis uses quad core.  In fact, there are no surprisingly large number of games  that use quad core.  I was actually not planning to do it, but they convinced me  and so I'm kind of the guy sitting here going.  Yeah, prove it.  Why do I need that?  I don't want to spend the money but they you know, and you know,  here's the funny thing Patrick.  How much did our first Uggum cost?  I think 15 grand.  I think it was this is much less stuff is much cheaper now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think half the cost the original like Uggum was that  monitor.  Yeah, that ridiculous massive 21 inch.  Isn't that a screen?  That was a silly monitor.  That was it was an incredibly expensive monitor is what it  was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you are you already beat us frankly because you got yours  paid for.  You frankly you get the most important element you beat me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you guys are you guys done deciding who's got the bigger  Vaynerchuk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, obviously Leo in this situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick's always said he had a small Vaynerchuk.  I don't think it's ever been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad I turned this into an Irish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to thank everyone for watching this live feed now for  enjoying another fine episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You won't be hearing this on the final cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  We might have to bloop it.  So I completely forgot why Amazon s3 went down for eight  hours and at this point, I don't know if I really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I'm curious.  You're supposed to be bombproof, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they've been down a lot of the cloud the cloud doesn't  did how does when when if I were to say s3 to Leah Culver,  Kevin ish which she kind of turned purple.  No, she'd be happy.  She's been happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We really haven't had any issues.  It's been fast.  It's worked great.  You know, you just have to to write in a little extra code  that if there is a failure, you know, you can make sure to  strip out that stuff and have it so it doesn't break your  site, right?  You know, just always remember when you're designing your  site that you're relying upon a third-party provider for  this hosting and so you can flip a switch so that it just  removes that content and doesn't you know crash crash your  product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you the the short version from a slash dot instead  of the long write-up because there is a long write-up on  Amazon and to their credit.  They were very transparent about it.  But essentially Agnestura writes on slash dot a random bit  got flipped.  I know Agnestura.  He's bitter.  He's a bitter man got flipped in one of the server state  messages that the s3 machines continuously passes back and  forth.  There was no checksum on these messages.  Oops.  And the erroneous information was propagated across the  cloud causing so much inter-server chatter.  No customer work got done for eight hours.  That's one of those things that happens and you can't figure  out what's going on.  I hate that.  You know, does that you know, you just you're in a race  condition or something and there's just you can't figure  it out.  There's no error message telling you anything.  They're just talking to each other.  Did you do anything in Kevin for sysadmin day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flowers.  No, I'm kidding.  I didn't know there was a sysadmin day.  July 20th, July 25th.  Last Friday, we take our guys out to lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would recommend that if you want to celebrate belatedly  sysadmin day, this is our show celebrating it because it's  you know, we don't do a show on Friday.  Read Cory Doctorow's amazing short story when sysadmins  ruled, I think it's ruled the earth, ruled the planet.  Great story.  Very in if you're a sysadmin or you know anything about  systems and systems administration, you'll love it.  Sysadminning.  Sysadminning.  If you're a tech kind of person, it's just a it's just  a really great read and as with all of Cory's stuff, he's  made it open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think you get an audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can't get any of his stuff on audible.  He won't he won't allow it on there because they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he read it and let us listen to it when we're driving

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read it on my iPhone actually because I downloaded  downloaded it with one of the ebook readers because it's  open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's free, but you can get it.  Hi, I am a robot voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I read it out loud to myself.  You know what Cory did?  You know what Cory I remember now Cory did read it on his  podcast.  In fact, he read it as he was writing it people he would  write a little bit read it and then people would write in  say what's going to happen next and stuff.  No, actually he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really cool.  That's what you want to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't you know, if you go to a craphound.com  Cory's site, I'm sure somewhere archived there there is  when siss it just search for when siss admins ruled the  earth.  It's a you know, it's an end of the end of the world story,  but it's just such a great story.  It's such a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only last story that I was thinking was might be worth  discussing is how do they did you guys cover this last week  that spam King who just walked out of jail in Colorado,  you know, we didn't he died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what is it murder suicide murdered or he murdered

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's quite the word used for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I missed that part of the story.  All I know is he walked out of jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he got out of jail and they found him in his SUV and  and he apparently shot himself and killed his wife too and  left his kids in the back or something.  It was horrible story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do the kids do the kids can the kids is that actually true  because or was he murdered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they were too young one died.  I don't know.  He might he might have been murdered.  It might have been set up or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happened?  How did he walk out of jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Colorado, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a minimum security facility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a terrible story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't know the end of that one.  That's too bad.  Well, then the last thing then if I want to bring up one more  thing, does anybody have a hint and what is going to happen  with Microsoft?  They're going to do these anti Apple ads like the you know,  the PC one of them's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of them's out already there.  The first one was on they tried to trial kind of banner on  their website.  They show a ship Columbus's ship sailing off into the ocean  and the title the tagline something like people also used  to think the earth was flat and then 10 reasons why Vista  isn't as bad as you've heard, which is pretty no that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  possible.  There's no way they would do an ad that stupid.  What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did but it was just a trial balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that would kill the campaign if it was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got a 300 million dollar budget to come back and  they've got us.  You know, there's nothing you never would hear me say this.  There's nothing wrong with Vista.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually most people now in fact, I'll probably be singing  the same tune.  It's gotten a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The upgrades have definitely definitely it's also took some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  getting used to and this and that true.  It sure is a lot prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I use it now in all my systems.  It's a lot more secure.  They're going to do now.  I thought I saw and I might be wrong on my friend feed.  A let me see if I could find it and the first ad.  I'd love to play it if there is such a thing.  Yeah, I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess we can start promoting Vista now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been a year and a half.  I think it's time to say goodbye to XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you remember Patrick we had to decide every time  every time a new Windows came out whether we how soon we  adopted on the on the set and generally speaking.  We'd wait a little bit but not a year and a half 98 and XP

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  were easy Vista was so there's still performance issues  though, right?  I mean if you take a look at how fast gaming wise Vista  versus XP XP still beats out Vista is that correct?  Did the service pack fix that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it needs more resources, but that's always been true.  XP needed more resources in 98.  I don't think that that's unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I remember some friends actually Alex was telling me  that he switched back to XP just because when he was running  World of Warcraft he was getting like 10 less frames per second.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's significant.  We're going to put Vista 64 on a game machine.  Here's a chance for you Patrick maybe to beat us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you feel that you like the driver support for Vista 64  at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's been a year and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Everybody's a big promoter of Vista 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not a big promoter because I think the only thing  you get is more RAM.  Well, it is more secure.  Microsoft has you know, they require you know, you have to  have signed 64-bit drivers.  They have the kernel patch protection.  There are things that they did in 64 that make it more secure.  I think that's the number one reason to go to Vista is the  world needs you Windows users stop running crap.  The world needs you to run a secure system and pay attention  because you're polluting the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world needs you to run your updates is what it needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if you look at where the pollution, where the  spam, where the attacks, the worms, the Trojans are coming  from, it's all of them from corrupted Windows machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is, is they're all older corrupted Windows machines  that are probably never going to be updated until they're like  dying or replaced.  They're in the closet somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got to find, I just can't find.  All right, I think we're done.  I thought I saw this ad.  I really wanted to play an ad and mock Microsoft's attempts.  John Hodgman, by the way, is going to join us on Twitter in  a coming episode.  PC.  He'll be playing the part of PC.  Just something to look forward to.  He sent me an email, said I'm a big fan of Twit.  Can I come on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he said he's a fan of Twit.  Yeah.  Hodgman?  John Hodgman.  PC.  I haven't heard from Justin Long.  Yeah, PC.  He's also occasionally on The Daily Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the funniest guy in the world.  In fact, his book, My Areas of Expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  He's coming in to plug a book.  He's got a new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You say it like it's a bad thing, John.  No, I'm a big book plugger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, since we can't get Justin Long, Kenven, would you be,  I'm a Mac if we got Hodgman on his PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have a shaved head.  Are you going to do it?  Are you going to do it?  I might, I might.  I don't think I'll, I think I might do it later tonight.  Really?  No, brother.  Will you quick it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he'll quick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to post it.  I'll post it.  I'll video it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you still quick or are you going to Flixwagon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Flixwagon on, so they're not on the iPhone yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing, nothing will ever be on the iPhone.  Apple's never going to let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the issue I was hearing about as a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quick, quick, because they're trying to build a version for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've used it, but it didn't work over Edge and, you know, they won't allow it over 3G, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a, it's probably, that's probably one of the apps AT&T says no way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will you look like Moby, you think, if you shave all your, will you shave the eyebrows too?  For extra 50 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll throw in another 50 for the eyebrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey guys, my number's a little bit higher.  Don't shave the eyebrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody has a number.  What happened?  Have you done that, Patrick?  Is there something, you get a weird alien look, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people's eyebrows never really go back quite right.  That would be bad.  I've never done it.  I've heard stories secondhand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He can draw the eyebrows on his forehead like those women used to do in the 30s and 40s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, women do that a lot these days.  It's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can get the permanent makeup.  They tattoo the eyebrows on.  I don't like that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  You look like you're surprised all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate that look.  No more wire hangers.  Tekzilla.com, revision3.com slash system.  That's the place to go.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Don't forget, of course, tech five.  No prisoners.  No agenda.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And cranky geeks.  Cranky geeksters.  And PC Magazine and Market Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all of that stuff.  But you know, dvorak.org slash blog has links to all of it.  Yeah.  Kevin Rose needs no links.  All links lead to Dig.  Dig.com and you can follow him on Twitter.  He is at Kevin Rose.  All one word.  K-E-V-I-N-R-O-S-E.  And why not?  Let's give a plug to Alex.  I wanted to get Alex on last week when we did gaming.  Couldn't get a hold of him.  Alex Albrecht and Barack Obama.  He's also fascinating on Twitter.  Go ahead and follow all three of them.  I don't care.  I'm going to...  Don't forget the real dvorak.  Oh, yeah, the real dvorak.  He wants to be above Veronica.  As it were.  So to speak.  Oh, and I forgot to mention, I apologize for last week's tweet.  We had a little editing error.  A wild track got in.  It was actually my computer.  I was looking at porn and unfortunately the audio was coming through  and Dane forgot to take that track out.  He's got strict orders.  Whenever I look at porn not to leave the track in, I do apologize.  I know it was hard to hear our panelists.  If you have that version of the show, please do me a favor.  Delete it.  The new revised version has been up on the server for some time.  It is twit152ha and that's the one you want.  So I do apologize for that.  All right, guys.  Hey, thanks everybody.  I really appreciate it.  Oh, and Patrick Norton is on Twitter at PatrickNorton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why yes, yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why yes, sir.  I think I believe I am.  How's the baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Baby's good.  Baby had his first tooth come in and he's been teething.  Teething is not my favorite baby activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's hard for the little baby.  Yes.  All right, guys.  It was fun to get the old crew back.  Kevin, if you'll come back, I promise not to ask you any more about  any dig Google rumors.  Sounds good.  I'll be back.  You've done your penance.  It's over.  We can move on now.  Another twit is in the can.  Have a drink of tea.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Round the board.
