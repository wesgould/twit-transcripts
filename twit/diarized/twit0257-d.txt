Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's something wrong with the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, I look younger with the new lighting.  You look thinner. You look fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's something wrong with the camera. I think I'm squished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's me. Maybe I've squished you.  Let me ask you this, and I hope you won't take this the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've taken it the wrong way already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you anamorphic?  What does that even mean?  No, you're definitely not anamorphic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also here, yeah, you heard him, Steve Gibson's back.  We're so glad to have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Gibbo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gibby, yeah.  Gibson is the guy in charge at GRC.com.  He makes spin right and has been in this business for longer than mud.  We really wanted to get you on it too, John, on our gray hair edition of Twitter a couple of weeks back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I missed out on that. I think I was traveling or something.  That would have been a good one for me because I think you had Jerry on.  Yeah, Pornell, Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the next one will be the no hair edition.  No hair edition.  Also here, we've got a youngster, a young man, Anand Shimpi, who started covering technology when he was in high school  with a site that has become now the site to read if you want hardcore hardware news.  AnandTech.com. Anand, great to see you once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, sir. Thank you for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks for your joining us.  Big story today and really the big story of the week and for the last couple of weeks is the antenna story on the iPhone 4 and Anand.  You guys did a great job.  We referred to you a number of times last week and the week before with your coverage,  partly because you and Brian were able to hack the iPhone 4 a little bit and give us some actual readings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was actually key to all of this because you'll actually even notice in Apple's press conference,  when they presented data, they still presented it in visual bar format, which is just that doesn't actually tell you anything, right?  Like it's not comparable between phones. And luckily, when the minute Brian got his phone, he was like,  hey, I bet you I know how to enable numeric readouts on signal strength. And that's really what set it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, how did he do that? Because one of the things, and I thought this was kind of a smoking gun that Apple did in iOS 4,  is they took out the diagnostic mode that allowed you to see exactly what kind of signal you were getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so they pulled out field test.  Why would you do that unless you thought the numbers were going to be very positive?  Yeah, I mean, I don't like to go down the conspiracy theory path simply because there are a lot of things that, you know, it can go both ways, right?  But whatever, they pulled it out. Luckily, Brian Klug, our senior smartphone guy, he actually had quite a bit of experience with iOS,  how it stores data, and with jailbreaking these things. And he found that, you know, if you, it actually stores the configuration of that little status bar,  that little status area when you back up your phone. So he thought, well, if I have a phone where I have this enabled on iOS 3.2,  and I use that backup once I put iOS 4, once I get an iPhone 4, and then I restore that backup on there, you know, maybe that's going to be a little bit more efficient.  And if I restore that backup on there, you know, maybe it'll preserve that setting. And thankfully, and luckily enough, it actually does.  And Apple hasn't even pulled that out in 401 or 41 either. So we, and we were, we for sure thought that they were going to pull that out as soon as we published how to do it.  But no, it's still there. So that actually helped us tremendously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and you have a great graph that shows the new way of measuring bars. It looks like they increased the dynamic range of the bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So a couple of things we noticed, and Brian again, was actually the first to pick this out. One, you get more values, right?  So for example, on prior to 401 and 41, you might see negative 113 dB and then negative 100 dB, right?  You might, there are a bunch of values in there that you would just never see. And with 401 and 41, you actually, you just see a lot more numbers.  And that actually helps, you know, really tell you what's going on here.  This is the graph that is very telling that shows movement from 4 to 4.01 in the signal mapping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And yeah, so that was actually sent in by a reader bars. We were working with them behind the scenes and he was like, hey, I put this together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it'll help your readers. And then I sent him the data we got off of 401 and he just made a new one there.  And then the one below that actually shows it's a new one.  And that shows the comparison between 4, 401 and Android.  So you can really see that Apple is being a lot more honest with how signal strength is reported now, which is impressive.  You know, we have to give them credit for that. They're doing the right thing there.  It's almost linear now instead of logarithmic, which traditionally is logarithmic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But even more interesting, instead of going down to 113 dB, you see a lot more numbers.  So instead of going down to 113 dB below, it goes all the way down to 121.  In other words, you'll still get a bar even if you've got almost no signal at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. And it really shows the, it's designed to show the improved sensitivity of the iPhone floor wireless platform in general.  Right. So antenna, baseband, radio, power amps, the whole deal.  It actually does a really, really good job down at 115, negative 115, negative 120, 121.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When we were talking about this, Steve with Jerry Pornell, he made a point which I thought and I've echoed several times was really great,  which is these are digital phones and if it doesn't work, I mean, if you don't have enough signal, it doesn't work.  If you do, it does. It's really a binary situation. What do you need bars for?  And I got a very interesting email from a BBC satellite engineer.  Dave in North Holt, London, which I thought, and he called me out on this.  He says, I keep hearing you say, get rid of the bars, show a binary, you can make calls light.  As a broadcast satellite engineer, I completely disagree.  The phone channel is very much like the satellite signals I deal with every day.  The satellite down links include forward error correction.  The receiver puts the signal back together and either decodes pictures or shows nothing like the phone.  It's binary in the sense that it works or it doesn't work.  However, when it's working, it's able to tell you how hard the error correction is working.  If it says it's not having to work hard, then we know we can take, say, 10 dBs of rain fade before we lose the signal that's being broadcast.  If it says it's near the edge of failure, then we know if there's a thunderstorm, we're going to get a five minute outage in transmission instead of a 10 second outage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, one of the other things that we know is that cell phones do dynamically scale their own power output as a function of the received power from the local cell tower.  So if you have a weaker signal, you tend to drain your battery faster because the cell phone ramps up its own output power in order to compensate for the fact that it's got a weaker incoming signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the idea of just having an on-off light is probably not good.  I mean, it's not enough. The bars do actually have some value.  You agree, Anand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's more of a... I actually agree with the engineer that sent you that email.  It's actually more of a predictive visualization, right?  It tells you the likelihood that something bad is going to happen or that you're going to be able to continue the call.  And that's actually one of the reasons why there's so much of an issue with this antenna bridging or attenuation problem, because it really interferes with the predictive nature of that visualization.  It's no longer a prediction, right?  There's this new variable in play, or at least more of an existing variable in play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other problem, too, is that our head and holding it next to our head is going to change the reception.  And so, you know, you're not actually looking at the bars while you're talking.  You pull it away from yourself.  There is a delay in the bars updating.  But that's also one of the things that is changing is how close it is to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to an antenna engineer on the radio show today.  I asked him, is it a bad design decision to put the antenna external on the phone?  He said, it's a bad design decision like, say, putting square wheels on a car would be a bad design decision.  He said, well, two things are happening here.  By touching the antenna, you're detuning it.  You're giving it... You know, antennas are optimized for a wavelength.  Your finger changes the wavelength that's optimized for you. You're detuning it.  He says the meat of your hand is also attenuating the signal. It's weakening it.  So those two things together really cause the antenna to do a much worse job.  But, Anand, it sounded like your findings were that the iPhone 4 is still better than previous iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and here's the problem, right?  So I don't like to do a lot of armchair engineering because I know these projects, you know, even the iPhone 4, you know, they're worse engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cots. They had cots in there. They were there all night.  There were people in the parking lot at 3 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they were shocked when they found out that the bar was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, their worst engineer is still a lot better than me, right?  So I got to give credit where credit's due.  And I'll tell you the way I look at it.  There are definitely some areas where, especially in situations where there's very, very limited signal or very, very low signal strength, the iPhone 4 does very, very well.  This, I would say, is more of an annoying design decision or an annoying problem than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But now here's where John C. Dvorak gets involved because, John, you and I are media guys.  And the first thing Steve Jobs does, he comes out on the stage and he says...  He starts blaming the media. He calls it antenna gate.  He says, you know, the return rate on the iPhone 4 is far lower than it was on the 3GS this time last year.  Actually, nobody's returning them.  Nobody's returning them. We only dropped one more call per 100 than the iPhone 3GS did.  He said, there's no problem here. The media made the problem.  This sounds, to me, almost Nixonian, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was weird. A lot of people are wondering what if he's losing his marbles.  I mean, for one thing, the media is the one that made this phone such a massive success in the first place because of all the planted stories.  And so then to blame the media for somebody just questioning the situation that we're talking about, the phone antenna attenuation,  it's almost ludicrous. I don't think he should have done that. I think it made him look like an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also, again, in a very Nixonian way, said, well, other phones have this problem. It's not just my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that voice too, I understand.  Yes, he is.  I have a dog named Checkers. I have a good cloth coat. And the media are the problem here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so I would argue that, you know, there were some issues that were caused by the media.  I mean, it was a general lack of understanding of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? Really, Anand? Really? You think that we caused the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. Well, Leo, I'm not saying you caused the problem, but I'm saying this.  When we published our review, right, we went into it and we said, look, here's the situation.  It does drop more than other phones. It is something that impacts all phones.  And you can reduce it by potentially coating the stainless steel with something that's a design decision Apple would have to make.  Or you just put a case on it, right? And that was it. That's all that needed to be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He also blamed us for not buying more cases. If you had just bought more cases, this wouldn't be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, and I think the problem isn't entirely how it was handled in the media, right?  It was also an issue of how Apple handled it, right? They weren't forthcoming with this.  And on top of that, even when they said that they were forthcoming with it in the press conference, they still really weren't, right?  Like it's a downside to the way Apple conducts its secret projects, unfortunately, right now.  But yeah, I think this did point out that this whole education through entertainment way of reporting news,  you know, it's not we're heading down a path that's not necessarily any better than where cable TV news has taken us.  And I do think he's right. I think he's fair in saying that, look, some of the media reports really criticize this the wrong way.  And, you know, I do think there are a lot of there was a lot of fair handling of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what media reports specifically you're talking about that handled this in some unfair way specifically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you look at and, you know, it's not my job to kind of throw my peers under the bus.  And I've never felt comfortable doing that because everyone does a good job at what they do and everyone has their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a lie. Come on, Anon, say it.  No, it's, you know, you really have anybody in mind that some people don't do a good job, Anon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everyone everyone has their own justifications for doing what they do.  And in my opinion, the problems I had were with this.  So who, John, you answer it then. Who did a crappy job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think everybody did a fine job. What job was there to do?  People were holding the phone. They couldn't get a signal and they bitched about it.  I mean, they weren't great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was fine. Right. The issue was characterizing in this light of, hey, it might be a phone by phone issue.  Right. Especially when the hard facts and the evidence were out there.  You know, we published numbers, right. We published numbers.  We told people how to find how to prove the numbers for themselves.  And we said, this is the story. And what continued to perpetuate was this idea that, hey, we might need a recall.  We might need this might be on a phone by phone basis.  And all of that, in my opinion, didn't actually serve any real purpose.  Right. We established from the very start. This is a physical problem.  Like this is this is an issue with physics. There's no getting around it.  If you want to get around it, Apple would either have to.  I don't think anybody was arguing any differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that the pundits who came out and said, oh, there's going to have to be a recall.  I think that's still a valid possibility because the phone is actually defective the way it's made.  And sure, they're going to give everybody a free cover now.  But the fact of the matter is, I don't think that anybody was unjustified in these particular complaints.  I would also say that not everybody reads your report.  I mean, if everybody read your report, they'd be a little more knowledgeable.  I'm not going to argue against that idea.  But, you know, I don't think it was that crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did Consumer Reports misstated or was their testing flawed and odd?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, I think it seems like their testing echoed our testing, which is fine.  And it's up to that publication whether or not they feel that that's grounds for not recommending it.  Right.  Ultimately, from my standpoint, it was a combination of, look, this is the design decision.  These are the design decisions that Apple made.  You have to take that into account with how good your AT&T reception is.  And if the combination of the two is bad, maybe you shouldn't get the phone.  Right?  But it's really dependent on that.  That's what I've been saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my recommendation is.  And by the way, I think that what has happened here is good because there are choices now.  For three years, I put up with really, frankly, bad AT&T service just where I live.  I'm not saying everywhere.  Where I live, where I work.  Oh, it's terrible in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In San Francisco, it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I put up with it because there was no choice.  That was the iPhone, AT&T.  That was the Nexus.  You had to do that.  As soon as great phones have come out on every carrier now, and I'm carrying a Droid X now,  which I love, from Verizon.  And it's like, I'm saying, oh, my God, why was I putting up with AT&T?  That's because you're using it as a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know, but it is a phone, John.  Well, I'm telling you, the whole iPhone phenomenon is more of a, I wouldn't call it a cult,  but I call it an environment that is completely, takes care of its users.  It's a totally different animal than any other phone.  And I think it has to be recognized as such.  But not anymore.  And this is why I disagree.  And this is why I think that, yeah, it was, I would say maybe, and I was right, it's  blown out of proportion a little bit because people kept talking about it for day after  day after day.  I've never seen so much stupid reporting.  And so I'll agree with that.  But at the same time, when you create an environment, it's like Facebook that lives among,  it's kind of its own animal and something is, and it's injured, people are going to  get all worked up about it.  And I don't think you can criticize them for doing so.  So you're saying Apple is hoist by its own petard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would argue that obviously, you know, Leo, you like your Droid X.  I think Android is just as capable of the platform.  The difference here is really a matter of aesthetics and polish.  Right.  Apple puts a lot of focus on making sure the iPhone works like an appliance.  And with Google, you have more of like a portable computer.  And for some people, clearly, there are a lot of iOS and iPhone fans.  And for some people, that's exactly what they want.  And for others, you know, there are a lot of Android devices sold.  I think I agree with Leo.  It's a good thing to have this kind of choice.  And the network isn't bad for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what's changed is now you choose the network that works best first.  You choose your to me what's changed.  So, Leo, let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get this straight.  Let's stop.  So tomorrow, iPhone and actually this probably will happen by March.  iPhone is on Verizon.  Will you?  Does that change your entire perspective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because well, first of all, it would make a lot of people happy because a lot of people  have been waiting for that day.  Maybe it would.  It at least gives you a choice.  My point is you should do what we've done for years until 2007 and the iPhone came out  is choose a carrier first.  Who has the best signal where I use the phone?  Then what's the best phone from that carrier?  The iPhone flipped it on its head.  You chose the iPhone and then you were stuck with the carrier.  That's what changed.  And it only changed for a couple of years.  And I think that window has now closed on that.  I think you can and that's to Apple's detriment because it means his competition.  But now you choose the carrier and then you choose the carrier.  And then you choose the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the position that Apple's in is one of having inertia now because they  were first and had essentially the you know, this whole sort of high end smartphone market  to themselves for so long.  But with Android, this really I mean, it's a game changer.  We're not going to see it overnight.  But over time, I think it certainly will happen.  And I read that the AT&T exclusivity wasn't expiring until 2011, despite the fact that  Bloomberg has said that they expect to see it on Verizon next year.  Well, next year is 2011.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congratulations.  What year is this?  By the way, we want to welcome Lisa Bettany has joined us.  Lisa is the Mostly Lisa blogger and it's great to see you.  Can I blame Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blame Canada?  Sure.  Why not?  Did you come from Canada?  Well, it felt like it.  The traffic.  What is with this traffic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there an event over there today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's Doyle Drive, I think is what bit you right over by the Golden Gate Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All that construction.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, it's nice to have you.  Welcome.  We're talking about the iPhone and Antenna Gate as by the way, Sparky and Corona keeps  correcting me in the chat room.  Apparently Computer World was the first to call it Antenna Gate.  But Steve Jobs picked it up.  That doesn't make him any less Nixonian.  The Wall Street Journal coined the term Watergate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could still say I'm not a crook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I guess the one thing that we haven't looked at and I know I respect Anand's decision  not to be conspiracy oriented, but doesn't it really seem to be the case that Apple did  get caught fudging the algorithm for its bars?  This idea that they were shocked that this formula was wrong.  I mean, the fact is the formula that they originally had ended up showing many more  bars for their normal range of signal strength compared to, first of all, what it is now  and also what other phones were doing.  So from a marketing standpoint, you given the same amount of received signal strength  by the iPhone traditionally with the equation that they had that someone deliberately set  the parameters to somewhere.  It looked better than other phones.  Yeah, that was cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a dirty thing to do.  It really was.  Dirty.  But everyone does that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you look at that graph that we just showed, the one at the bottom of the page  that Leo had up on the screen, Apple's, I mean, they're definitely worse if you look  at 4.0 versus 2.2 on the Nexus One, but they're not that much worse.  Right.  All cell phone companies lie about this.  It's just that Apple now had a situation where the signal would drop more than the  competitors and that kind of exposed this as a problem.  But everyone does this right.  Now Apple corrected it and they corrected it pretty quickly.  And now they're actually more honest than a lot of folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now you could say the bars on the iPhone are the best bars in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll see if I have the testing for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple did say that they were using AT&T's approved formula for showing the number of  bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what they said was we used our own formula, but now we're going to start using  AT&T's new formula.  Right.  Now they're going to use AT&T.  I think the implication was they used AT&T's old formula, but I don't know if they said  that.  There's a lot, I mean, I don't want to spend the rest of the day talking about this, but  there's a lot of stuff to analyze in here.  For instance, Steve Jobs pointed out that maybe they didn't notice this because, well,  he didn't say it quite like that, but he said, a reporter said, how come I'm not dropping  bars on my BlackBerry now?  And Steve said, he said, well, because we have an AT&T tower on our campus, but he also threw  an Andavarizon tower on our campus, which I thought was kind of gratuitous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's overlooked in this entire story, which kind of fascinates me?  What?  As nobody talks about the manufacturer of this phone, it's not Apple sitting over there  in Cupertino cranking these things out.  Let's blame Foxconn.  It's Foxconn.  You think it's their fault?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm wondering about it.  It was designed in California, made in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the basic functionality is designed in California and the components are picked  in California, but when these guys are given a design and Steve says, I want it like this,  I want this thing around the outside, I want a flat screen, I want a flat back, I want  this kind of glass, I want you to do it this way, they're the ones who have to put, they're  the ones who have to micro-engineer where everything goes so it fits in the phone that  Steve wants.  They're the ones who had to put this antenna on there.  I mean, it wasn't like Apple said, hey, you have to put an antenna around outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it really does matter that, as Leo points out, there is an AT&T and a Verizon  cell tower on the Apple campus, so they're all being irradiated by these particular carriers.  And I mean, you could probably hold this thing any way you wanted to when you're standing  in the shadow of the cell tower and never lose any bars.  Good point.  You probably couldn't make it fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so, one of the reasons I've shifted away from the iPhone, I used it for a long time,  is because I finally dropped four or five calls in a two-day period last Friday, and  I said, I'm sorry, this is a phone for me.  I need it to be a phone.  And I got the Droid X, and boy, I love the Droid X.  And you had a good alternative now.  Yes, and that's the point.  Now we have an alternative, and that's the good news around all of this entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it's fair to assume, and again, I don't like going down the conspiracy  theory or the speculation ramp here.  I don't think it's fair to assume that they didn't test this thing in low signal strength.  I think they came out and made the statement that, look, it gets the best reception of  any previous iPhone.  Clearly, they tested this in all kinds of environments, more than we ever had, more  than anyone else ever had.  I think this was just a conscious decision.  They knew this trade-off was there.  And they're on this yearly cadence, right?  So if you look at any company that has to produce a product every six months, 12 months,  24 months, whatever, you do make sacrifices in order to maintain that cadence.  We see it with chip companies all the time.  We see it in all kinds of products.  So it's not surprising to me that, look, if Apple discovered this and they were like,  look, we have to ship this thing in X number of months, usually when you look at the  usually when you come to the end of a project like this, you have a list of things that  you want fixed, but you just couldn't get them in the schedule without slipping it.  So they just get kind of rolled up and put into the next phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we do know also, though, that Steve Jobs loves the design of this phone.  And against some objections somewhere in Apple engineering, he said, no, this is the way  it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They asked him that at the press conference.  That was a Bloomberg report.  He said it was BS.  He said it was BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't like the design of the phone.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, that's a good question.  No, I think what he was saying was we didn't we didn't.  I think what Steve was saying very clearly is we didn't think there was anything wrong  with it.  And we still don't think there's anything wrong with it.  He has to say that now.  We think it's just like every other smartphone.  But OK, if you think there's something wrong with it, we love you.  You're the customer.  So we're going to give you a free bumper case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's my issue there.  Right.  It is technically it loses more signal than at least its primary competitors.  And that's the only part of what he has said that is not totally true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me tell you, the rim guy was pissed.  The Nokia guys were pissed.  They said, what are you talking about?  We don't have the same problem.  This is a unique problem for the iPhone 4.  You agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It's not a unique problem for the iPhone 4.  As we've demonstrated, as everyone's demonstrated, all phones will drop signal  depending on how you hold it.  What is unique to the 4 is that it drops more signal.  Right.  So we measured something like 16 to 17 dB on the iPhone 3GS and Nexus 1.  And then the 4 drops like 24 dB.  Right.  So that's a measurable difference.  That part alone, the fact that it drops more than the competition is what's unique to the 4.  I think we should try to repeat ourselves on this topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I got lots more to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you wear your antenna on your sleeve, that's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I interject for one second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please, Lisa.  Some sanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inject some sanity into this.  OK, so there's all these technical issues, but I mean, what does it boil down to for  the actual customers that bought the iPhone 4?  Because I've talked to a lot of them and it doesn't even matter to them.  People who bought the iPhone 4...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They seem not to care.  Some do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I care.  You care.  Yeah, but you don't even like the phone, Leo.  You hate Apple because they won't invite you to events.  Let's get that out there.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's true, John.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I do like the phone.  I think it's looking a little antiquated compared to Android, but it's still a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honestly, when you look at...  OK, to answer your question, what does it mean to end users?  Like I said, it's really a combination of what's AT&T's network like where you use the  phone.  That's exactly right.  If it's borderline, if there's a good chance that you don't have a good signal to begin  with, this is probably not a good phone for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think, Lisa, that people who have iPhones are willing to put up with crappy  service?  Yes.  That's what you're saying, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I guess, yes, I'm an Apple fan girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you're sitting in front of a 3GS, not an iPhone 4, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, because mine's in the mail.  But I've been testing on one all week.  And for me, obviously, the camera really matters.  The HD video really matters.  But ultimately, when you subscribe to Apple and you have all Apple products, it doesn't  even matter.  And that's a sad thing.  But to me, it doesn't even matter.  It's sad.  It is sad.  But I've been talking to people and people that love the iPhone, they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jean-Louis Gosset, who you might say have an axe to grind.  He was a vice president at Apple under Steve Jobs.  He was there for a long time after Jobs left.  He started BOS.  And now he blogs, and I think he actually does a great blog at mondaynote.com.  And he says Apple mishandled this.  He says, AntennaGate, if you can't fix it, feature it.  And don't diss your customer or the media.  He said Apple basically decided it's not a bug.  It's a feature.  He says, yes, it's a well-known problem.  But he says, this is science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we beat this up to death already, Leo.  In fact, there are those things he just said we just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says, a customer complaint dialogue is structured around a two-position toggle.  It's terrible or it's nothing.  You know, it's not terrible and it's not nothing.  It's kind of in the middle.  I mean, as you said, Anand, if your signal is good and you like the phone, that's fine.  And if your signal is bad and you want a phone that works, then there are other choices.  OK, now I'm going to drop it, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now let's talk about Nokia suing Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are they suing Apple about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a bunch of patent suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, everybody.  Apple is suing everybody.  Everybody is suing Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  But Nokia has got a pretty good case.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Basically, all googling Nokia Apple lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'll tell you this much, the kind of the kicker nobody wants to talk about is, and  I've been in these lawsuits and as an expert witness on different things, and the kicker  is Steve Jobs has publicly said over and over that, you know, if you're going to steal,  you steal from the best and, you know, the good artists always steal and it's going  to be thrown in their face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.  Nokia was not happy, by the way, about Nokia said, we prioritize antenna performance over  physical design, basically implying that Apple did not.  RIMS co-chief executives said Apple's attempt to draw RIM into Apple's self-made debacle  is unacceptable.  Apple's claims about RIM products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public  understanding of antenna design and deflect attention from Apple's difficult situation.  These guys are coming out swinging too.  Wow.  They're not happy.  I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, part of the issue is, I believe Steve said, look, as we become a  leader in the smartphone space, it's our job to educate the consumer.  The problem is whenever I have a company tell me that they need to help educate the consumer,  that's usually like the marketing bells go off and I'm like, hey, that's not your job.  That's actually my job.  And that's the problem, right?  They did this under the guise of educating the consumer, but they weren't totally forthcoming,  right?  All they said were, here's some pictures of bars, look what happens, see everyone has  the problem.  And that's not how education works, right?  If you sit in science class, they don't just show you pictures and then that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think if the media misrepresented it at all, the only misrepresentation was that losing  bars meant you were going to lose calls.  And I think that's a false correlation.  And so I think the media implied that the problem was the bars going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people have said that the reception on the iPhone 4 is actually better  than the 3GS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Apple's saying that.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What we've said conclusively is that in low signal situations, that's true.  As we shared in our second article, it really varies other times.  I mean, you will get either much better signal than the 3GS or much worse in kind of normal  operating situations.  And unfortunately, there's just no real way to draw a thorough conclusion on that without  one of Apple's million dollar, hundred million dollar labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a beautiful lab too.  Do you see the pictures on the Apple website?  Man, that's sweet looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks nice, you know, I wouldn't mind one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the conclusion is it was a mistake to put the antenna on the outside, but we're stuck  with it for a year until they do the next version of the iPhone.  Unless they're going to fix something in a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're going to fix it because September 30th, that arbitrary day where they stopped  in cases.  That sounds to me like they figure Steve kind of even applied that in the Q&A.  We use that day because we think we might be able to fix this by then.  It's not a software fix, right?  Is it a hardware fix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, see, I wouldn't actually go as far as to say it was a mistake to put the antenna  on the outside.  Right.  So in our second article, we pointed out that Brian got his hand on like the perfect one  mil captain tape that fits perfectly around the band.  It fixes about half the problem and actually brings the phone almost in line with like  the Nexus one and three GS.  So maybe the lapse is more in the materials engineering side of it.  They might have just needed a non conductive coating on the stainless steel band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what I think they're going to do.  I think it's exactly what they're going to do.  There has even been a rumor that some people who've gotten newer iPhones, Lisa, tell us  when you get your iPhone, that right now on the iPhone 4 you can feel a little dip where  that black plastic thing is.  By the way, Steve said, you know, the only mistake we made, we put that black plastic  thing and that called attention to it.  You guys, you found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does anodizing help anything?  Isn't that conductive?  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anodizing is an oxide coating and oxide is an insulator.  So insulating it, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And it sounds like that's what they've done.  People are saying it's a little smoother there than it was and it feels a little silkier.  So maybe they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually tested that.  I got a, the idea was, you know, anything made after week 27.  And the way you find out what week you have is you pull up the serial number and I think  digits number four and five and to kick the week.  So we got a week 28 iPhone, something that was bought like a day before our article went  live and we measured resistance across that band to see if it was still conductive and  it was still conductive.  So I think it's too early to tell at this point if they are introducing a fix like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's no software.  Software can't fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can it?  No, no, this is a, this is a physics issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't fix physics with software.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we've all learned something here.  We're going to take a break and come back.  Good news for the PC industry, great news for Intel, but even for AMD.  And I like to hear that.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  Our guest, Lisa Bettany from MostlyLisa.com.  So nice to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So nice to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pete Cashmore was supposed to be here, but he's looking at houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's, it's impossible.  I mean, we've been looking for a place for the last week, but it's just like, we're both  in meetings and we're both doing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the weekend.  This is when you go to the open houses and I thank you for foregoing it.  You know, Pete's going to pick a place that's got like lots of pinball machines and you're  going to love it.  It'll be fantastic.  You know, it's going to be a guy house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as I'm here, I mean, I want to be here.  I think it's, it needs to happen.  Bay area here, you mean?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to have to get rid of that iPhone though.  I'm sorry.  We'll check it at the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been using T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With your iPhone?  Yeah, because I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  And how's that then?  Has it dropped calls?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One more thing, Steve.  Steve, one more thing.  Steve could have blamed AT&T.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the open house.  I'm going to go to the open house.  I was, I felt like Steve in his head is thinking, God, I want to blame AT&T so bad.  And he didn't.  Yeah.  Was that a good, that shows he has a good impulse control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, you know, he's in the dog house with everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why didn't he blame AT&T?  John, should he have blamed AT&T?  Is it AT&T's fault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  It's Foxconn's fault.  Nobody wants to listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's goofy, but okay, John, we'll go with Foxconn.  Danon, should he blame AT&T?  Is that really what he should have said is, look, I'm sorry, but it's AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  I think, you know, he has to, everyone has to work in the realm of the reality that is  reality, right?  And reality is the AT&T network.  He chose AT&T.  Right.  Yeah.  So, and this is the, this is the design they went with.  And I think the best thing to do is just be honest, open and willing to share as much  data as physically possible.  And my only complaint is that they didn't do the latter part.  I was just saying that I am pleased that they're, they're giving out the bumpers at least, which  I, you know, it's, it's the one thing that we asked them to do in our articles.  We said, look, this is the right thing to do other than a design change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.  Make them wear a case.  Make them wear a sheath.  Anon Shibby is here from AnonTech.com.  So nice to have you.  It's your source for hardware analysis and news at AnonTech.com.  Steve Gibson also here, GRC.com.  The guy who hosts our Security Now show.  And it's always welcome in the Twitch Cottage.  More to come in just a bit.  But first, I want to tell you about Carmonite Pro, a backup solution that is perfect for  business.  Many of it, you know, this all came about because Carmonite, which created a great consumer  backup solution.  It's automatic, backs up to the cloud.  It's AES 256 bit encrypted.  It's 128 PSSL.  You know, all the buzzwords.  It's just a great solution.  A lot of businesses said, well, we want this too.  So they were using individual copies of Carmonite on every computer.  Well, that's fine.  But Carmonite said, well, we really should do better for business.  And they came up with Carmonite Pro.  Carmonite Pro designed for small business.  It's a similar idea.  You put the client on all your computers, no per seat charge.  You pay for storage used only.  It starts at $10 a month.  And it backs up automatically into the cloud.  So you never have to worry about the transport.  You can encrypt it once it's there as well.  So you don't have to worry about privacy.  You get a centralized dashboard, which is really nice.  So you know exactly which systems are backed up.  Your users can restore their files, not just on their own computer.  They can restore it from any computer they can get online with.  They can even restore it using the iPhone or BlackBerry applications.  Those are free.  So try Carmonite Pro today.  It's only free for the first month, 30 days free at carbonitepro.com.  Just all you have to do is just do a little thought experiment.  What would happen if our data was lost, if our backups were lost?  Would this business go on?  And you'll realize you need Carmonite Pro.  carbonitepro.com.  Intel had a great quarter.  Best revenue ever in history, according to their quarterly report.  Furthermore, AMD would have actually had a profitable quarter, except for a write-off  they had to take on some factories that weren't so hot.  Anand would be a good guy to ask, because you cover the PC industry very closely.  Is this cost-cutting or is this actual growth in the PC industry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Intel said, and forgive me, I didn't look at the report in great detail.  It's like, you know, how many more billions of dollars did you make now?  I think they accredited to a lot of their success in the enterprise side, which makes  sense, right?  You look at the growth of cloud services and just a lot of stuff going on in the data center.  That makes a lot of sense.  And AMD is hanging in there.  It's impressive that they've been able to do this much and have this big of a turnaround  without a brand new architecture or anything like that, which we'll get next year.  So I don't know.  Overall, I don't see the PC industry going anywhere.  It's still the foundation we need to get things like the Holodeck and all the cool stuff we  see in Minority Report and stuff like that.  You're not going to get that on a smartphone for another 10, 20 years.  Obviously it's just not where the growth is happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need the PC because we want the Holodeck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's true, right?  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  You got to write the software on a PC.  Intel's net income, $2.89 billion, 51 cents a share.  It's the best quarter they've had in 10 years.  In fact, the last time Intel's net income was bigger than $2.5 billion was the year  2000 during the dot com boom.  And AMD's, as you said, AMD's report was also very positive.  In fact, Microsoft will report next week and it's predicted that, well, if this is true,  Microsoft should also have a very, very good quarter.  So I guess that's good news.  It makes you wonder whether...  I'm sorry, John.  I said, eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree kind of with the assessment that the business...  We just witnessed a bunch of pent up demand for replacement products.  I mean, there's all these old machines out there running XP.  Microsoft says, screw that.  We're not even going to support it anymore.  You get SB3 and you'll barely get some support.  You better buy some new gear.  So everybody bought a bunch of new computers that I think that may sit on these computers  for a decade for all we know.  There's no reason to have a quad or an eight core CPU, but we don't have anything to run  on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's really professional 3D work, video encoding, or just writing rights.  I mean, so I did an experiment, right?  I've got like an eight core 16 thread desktop.  Oh, you're just insane.  Well, yeah.  So once Arendale came out and sorry, the new 2010 mobile core i3, i5, i7, I was like, look,  maybe this thing's fast enough where I wouldn't notice the difference.  And part of this is just, I'm crazy, right?  But I seriously noticed the difference.  I was like, this is too slow.  I have to go back to my desktop.  But John is right.  What are you doing on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute, Anand.  What are you doing on that thing that you noticed the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long does it take to boot WordStar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I do all of my writing in WordStar, so that's actually the number one benchmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You and Jerry Purnell.  Are you a gamer, Anand?  Is that why you need that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's not all gaming.  I honestly don't have as much time for gaming as I'd like to.  And well, I'll save that for another time.  But no, it's, you know, I do all the Anand tech work there, right?  So when I'm in the middle of publishing an article, I've got quite a bit that I'm working  on at the same time.  I might be encoding videos in the background while I'm editing, I don't know, two or three  hundred photos have all sorts of data that I'm manipulating and trying to circle around  and browse all these different sites.  And I just, you know, got like a security cam monitor for like seven security cameras  open in the background.  Like there's just a bunch of stuff happening.  So for a user like me, you know, the desktop is still where you can get that kind of best  performance.  But I will agree with John that, you know, the software just isn't that exciting to take  advantage of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a yawn, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is.  And it doesn't get any more exciting with these iPhones and Androids and the other platforms,  but mostly those two platforms, because all the coders that are creative and they can  dream up this stuff are going to put because of the even though the software only sells  for a dollar, they can make like a million dollars overnight, basically, with some nice  little app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, so I'll I take issue with that because so this is the argument everyone made when  Intel and AMD hit a gigahertz, right?  They were like, the software is yawn.  My computer is fast enough.  I don't need to do anything.  And the counterpoint to that is if we just stop there, if that was truly the case, we  would have never gotten YouTube, right?  YouTube was built on the fact that everyone had a certain minimal level of performance  and they could all do flash decoding, flash video decoding on the fly.  And I think that's where we're going to go.  Right. So you imagine a future where everyone's got at least four cores or at least eight  threads or whatever. And it's going to take some really crazy people, but they're going  to be able to do something very cool.  I'm not willing to give up on the hardware race until I have my holodeck.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Curiously, that used to be my attitude until I witnessed what's recently going on with  this, the shrinking platform, the little platform, the handheld pocket platform is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so exciting. I think they're so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, look at the whole half of the show has already been talking about just nothing  more than just one of these phones.  And that's the phone you don't even like, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, in fact, I noticed that not only with my shows, but with the radio show, with everything  I do, most of the conversation now is around cell phones.  I resisted that for a long time, but it is where innovation is happening right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a platform. It's the new platform.  It's taken over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happens to the PC then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The PC is going to become a commodity at some point.  I mean, I can get an extremely powerful machine built or I can build one myself for  six hundred dollars. The thing is like it's like a cray from like the 90s.  It's astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When Anand talks about this, what do you have?  Do you have 12 cores?  Do you have eight cores?  How many cores do you have on this desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eight cores. So it's two quad core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not going to get the extreme so you can have 12 cores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have that, but it's on a test bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the hell are you going to do with 12 cores that you can't do with eight?  That's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the big question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now, a lot of the core race is doing really, really well and obviously in servers,  data centers, stuff like that.  But again, I think all we're seeing, you know, two years ago, the excitement was over  Netbooks. Right.  Yeah, that was a the growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, it looks like an aberration at this point.  It looks like that was kind of a mass delusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so smartphones are particularly exciting and they're going to be more obviously  prevalent than netbooks simply because we're able to cram decades of innovation in the  PC industry into a matter of a few years.  Right. So if you look at how long it took for Intel to go from in order architectures to  an out of order architecture with the P6 and those several, several years.  Right. And we're seeing that kind of innovation in a very, very short period of time.  And we're going to continue to see that going forward.  Right. Like so as as as Intel and AMD Global Foundries, everyone, as they drive these  manufacturing processes down in physical transistor size, you're going to be able to  get. And, you know, the other thing is the innovation has already happened.  Right. People already know the best way to optimally design a single core CPU or a dual  core CPU, whatever. It's just a question of how quickly can we get it into the right  power. And I think that's a big reason that you're seeing a lot of innovation here.  There's simply all the tricks have already been invented.  It's a question of when can we get in the right power envelope?  And that happens like clockwork right now because the more is on.  Did I put everyone to sleep?  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I take it like a slightly less geeky angle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please. Absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, let's let's think of people who have never really owned a computer and all of a  sudden own an iPhone and have the ability to edit movies, to put photos online.  Exactly right. I mean, there's this whole generation, like even someone like my mother,  who I introduced to Mac products like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about iPad? Do you think that that's another place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I've poo-pooed the iPad so much, but I just got one and it is replaced.  Like I had a MacBook Air. I threw that out the window when I got my iPad.  I hope you didn't hit anybody with that.  It just sort of skimmed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many skips did you get? That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be good to skip the iPad in the Air?  That'd be fun. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, it's replaced that for me and it's so zippy.  It's so quick. It's so like it's.  Light. And I mean, someone like my mum who just wants to, you know, surf a few pages,  do maybe a couple of emails, add photos, look at photos.  I mean, there's that whole generation who doesn't care about.  They don't care about computers. They don't.  They don't know from cores.  They don't know anything about cores.  They just want to surf the Internet and look at their Facebook account.  And I think there's this whole generation.  And even you look at sort of teenagers who want to just like put photos on Facebook,  they want to maybe tweet a little bit.  And there's that whole generation.  I think that's sort of where Apple is moving away from power users to, I don't know what to call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just the. The normal people.  The normals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the issue I have with that, right?  So I agree completely for browsing the Web.  You know, smartphones do it well enough.  Something with a larger screen like the iPad does a really good job.  I would encourage you to download pages, which is pages for the iPad,  which is Apple's document creation software and try making a flyer.  Right. Do the things that they show you on the video where you have a flyer.  I did this for my parents a few weeks back.  I created a little flyer.  They were they were trying to sell their house and dragged in the pictures, made it,  you know, did it the way that they do it on the little videos.  And that thing got unbearably slow because it's slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a good computer is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  I think that a really useful way of dividing all these devices we've been talking about is content production versus content consumption.  This is what Jobs was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says the PC is a truck.  Not everybody needs a truck.  Some people will always need a truck, but some people just need a sports car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so our large multi-core desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Internet is your truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our large multi-core desktop machines are our content production engines,  which really do that well with large screens and keyboards and mice.  But you don't need that for for content consumption, which the phone and the iPad both do really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I would I would also caution everyone in making sure we're understanding that we're looking at this as a snapshot in time.  You know, 10 years ago, if we said, look, the PC is going to be your primary TV device and, you know, the set top boxes and TVs in general,  people aren't going to spend much time with cable TV anymore.  People will call you crazy, right?  But because of this kind of because the software and the marriage of the software and the hardware, we've been able to kind of change that.  Yeah, and bandwidth.  And I'm really you know, I think what we're looking at is a snapshot in time where, look, what you want to do today is Facebook and browse the Web and this and that.  And I think these devices are excellent for that.  But I think in the long run, you're still going to see new categories of devices, new usage models.  It's not going to end right now.  Right. Like this isn't the best against.  And I'm telling you, that holodeck, when you get there, that that's going to require a completely different type of device, whether it's a PC.  Whether it's just a big box full of cores that lives in your basement.  There's some interesting things that are being worked on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still hoping for the hoverboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the best part of Back to the Future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I take I take a hoverboard over a holodeck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hit my I'd fall on my head.  So if you wanted a Microsoft Kin and who doesn't?  You better get it now, because according to Electronista, Verizon is going to return all unsold Kin devices to Microsoft tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we got to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All online sales of the Kin one and two have been suspended.  Basically, the Kin, which, according to Electronista, has only sold nine thousand units.  Oh, he's not only so many.  Yeah. John Gruber said five hundred three.  I base that on an anonymous Microsoft source.  The real question is, is this going to end up in a landfill somewhere so that Michael J.  Fox can hoverboard to it and find it and say, oh, look at this, a kin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The kin. I mean, I think their their marketing campaign, because I've been looking at sort of what went wrong.  Yeah. I mean, you look at the success of the Old Spice guy.  I mean, look, we're going to talk about him next.  Yeah. That the success of that versus the kin where they hired all these actors to go out and and meet with their people on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook, pictures of their up shirt, t shirt pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, ultimately, it's just it's just a giant brick of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sasha Segan on PC Magazine said, quote, The Kins are misbegotten, crippled creatures compared to pretty much every other smartphone on the  market. They've been priced as smartphones with smartphone data plans and they'll be sold as smartphones.  But they're stupid.  I did that part at the end.  So it was it was a it was a misbegotten device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just it's just.  I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, let's we should corner the market on Kins.  You know, one of the great collectors item is something.  I think so, especially that kin one because it was so little and cute.  The little round one could stick it right in your bra and carry it around.  Nobody know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I stop wearing a bra.  Leo, what about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've made a big deal of the fact that it was able to synchronize with the cloud, which I don't think anyone really cared about that.  Isn't that interesting?  Like big deal, you know, we want that we want all kinds of apps some months back lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a complete cloud at some point.  And all these people had to get their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a sidekick, the danger sidekick, the sidekick, which is also trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also OK.  So I would say that, you know, the automatic cloud syncing stuff, Brian Kluge, the antenna guy from our iPhone four stuff, he actually did an article called Microsoft's Kana eulogy.  And that was the one feature that he actually said, look, all phones need to have this.  This needs to be in Windows Phone seven.  This needs to be in future versions of Android and iOS.  It's truly like a great example of something that you just that just works that you don't really have to touch.  Now, the other aspects of the can, obviously, that that's why it failed.  But the idea behind this, that, you know, you take photos, everything you do is just stored in your own personal account online that you can access from anywhere.  That is kind of cool, right?  Because ultimately, at the end of the day, that's what we want.  We want all of our content on any device, anywhere, anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the problem is the anywhere, anytime issue.  I mean, I have was up in Port Angeles floating around looking for a specific place out on the peninsula.  And my and I was using a Nexus one and the phone just all of a sudden there was no signal to be had because I was in some area where there's no signal.  If I have no signal, zero signal, what good is the cloud going to do me?  And this is going to happen once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you still had local storage of information, right?  Well, yeah, but then why do I need the cloud?  It's for convenience, right?  So say you're away from your phone or say you're on someone else's notebook and you're like, oh, hey, I took these pictures on my phone.  I don't have to show you on the phone.  I can pull it up on my notebook or on your notebook or on your TV.  I mean, it's just that added flexibility is very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you argue for the cloud.  I just find it to be just something that's going to cost me more money.  Well, yes, the chat room says the Dvorak hates clouds.  I don't hate clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He also hates puppies, kittens.  I hate puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wouldn't argue blindly in favor of the cloud.  I just think you have to use everything to its benefits, to its strengths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the key.  Nobody's saying let's replace computers with the cloud.  It's and it's another thing.  I mean, this. Yes, yes.  Exactly. I was just talking about that.  Cloud backup. It's backup of your data.  I mean, it's not like you give up your data.  You still do.  Do you really need to back up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Using the cloud for backup is fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I like it.  That's because you're not relying on it.  You've got it. Here's another reason to use the cloud.  But Anand, you probably I know, Lisa,  you're the idea that you use multiple computers and anywhere you go,  you can get your stuff is very powerful.  It is. Yeah.  The cloud didn't become a hot topic till people had more than one computer.  That's probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would argue actually that this idea of, you know, where to store the cloud, right?  Whether it's in Google's totally selfless hands or if it's maybe a little,  you know, the home data center, the idea of your cloud is stored at your home.  And that's just like you keep your safe full of jewelry.  That's why I like the Pogo plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I love the Pogo plug.  I mean, that's really what the Pogo plug is, your personal cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the one thing, of course, that we bring up once in a while  when I'm getting anyone agreeing with me, which doesn't seem to be the case today  by any means, is that you can get bounced from the cloud.  I mean, what if they take a dislike to you using Google's all their services?  And then somebody says, you know, we decided you're a spammer.  You can't. Boom, you're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People get bounced from Facebook.  But on the other hand, it's like saying, well, you better not have a website  because what if Google bounces you?  You'll never nobody will ever find you.  I mean, it's not going to doesn't mean you're not going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just don't remind them.  What about my data, my valuable data in this cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's talk.  I think the point is it's a good thing to have,  but it wasn't a feature that would would sell the phone.  It was it's ultimately I agree with Anand that it makes sense  for for future phones to have this kind of cloud based backup, because why not?  The bandwidth is there. They're already connected.  It doesn't cost anything, essentially, because it's data and bandwidth.  They're both now so cheap.  But people are not going to buy the phone for that feature.  It's just by the way, the reason you could call them in market

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  watch about this phone and Microsoft's blunders here that you might want to look.  This phone was was they had no buzz.  This thing was a disaster waiting to happen.  Yeah, it did happen. It took six weeks. Yeah, it did happen.  What am I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it took almost no time at all.  You used a Nexus one. Do you like that Nexus?  Well, I'm a big Nexus one fan.  Google has killed it, by the way, officially.  They're going to stop selling it. Wow.  Which Nexus two. Well, and then they said there wouldn't be.  But now I'm seeing rumors that there will be a Nexus two.  I think it's nice for Google to have one phone that is pure  Google so that you can see what the other carrier with the carriers  and the other handset manufacturers are doing.  You know, the Motorola blur, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what did you like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What did I like about the Nexus one?  It's a great phone. It's got a great screen.  I love Android, by the way.  And one of the things that happens on Android is when you log into your Google  account on a new Android phone, it copies all your settings over.  So it does have kind of that kind of cloud backup.  So I don't my phone, if I move to another Android phone and immediately  recognizes me and puts all my my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you like how hard it is to get your your iPhone, new iPhone set up?  It's part of the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to drag icons all over.  At least the folders, thank God, the folders on there.  I do like widgets.  I think widgets are a very nice feature of Android.  The ability to this is typical.  Apple says, no, no, we want you have a grid of four by four icons.  And that's it.  And with it, with a Google phone, you can have widgets.  You can have a weather display.  You have time to play.  And I think, you know, that's nice, too, especially for, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But by the way, we had a on the last Cranky Geeks, we had a blur on the show.  And I just had nothing but trouble trying to find it because it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, the new my phone.  I was out of focus.  How did they do that?  But you're like, what was that Woody Allen movie with a guy  was walking around, he's always out of focus.  There's just something wrong with him.  I can't focus on him.  I would show you this, but I don't have enough cameras,  but I really like this droid X.  And I'm going to let Lisa look at my droid X  and see what she thinks and compare.  It's big, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stop it, John.  I know what you're thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what she said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Since we got Steve Gibson on, it would be important to mention  the cryptographic attack against OAuth.  Now, OAuth is an authentication and open ID authentication standards  used by many websites and by many users for single sign on for log in.  It makes it very easy to use.  Dig uses it. Twitter uses it.  Apparently, there's something called a timing attack.  You want to talk about what that is, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not up to speed on that.  I know about OAuth, but I hadn't run across any news.  Well, it just happened a day ago, so I'm not surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  By submitting signatures over and over again,  cycling through characters and measuring the time it takes  for the computer to respond, hackers can figure out the correct digital signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's what's known as a side channel attack,  where as a consequence of the design of a cryptographic system,  some useful information leaks out through,  like not the actual decryption or not the success of the process,  but for example, the length of time it takes to compute.  And so it turns out that you have to be very careful  when you design these systems that you're not letting any information out  through so-called side channels.  So what this means is that the algorithm behaves differently,  even when it fails, the way it fails, like the length of time it takes to fail,  gives you some information.  And if you're really clever about what you feed in,  you can end up discerning the internal state from the way it reacts on the outside.  And when you get the internal state, then you're able to figure out what the key is.  So that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to hear more and more of these kinds of things  because Black Hat is coming up later in the month in Las Vegas.  And of course, all the hackers are getting their proof of concepts together.  And this is one of them.  They're going to demonstrate it at Black Hat.  The researcher who came up with it said,  I really think people need to see the exploits of it  to see that this is a problem that needs to be fixed.  Yahoo's director of standards, Aaron Hammer,  Lahav, who has contributed with both OpenID and OAuth, said,  I'm not concerned by it.  I don't think any large provider is using any of the open source libraries  for their server-side implementation.  And this is most important, it's a non-trivial attack to execute,  which I guess you would agree, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, also, I would wonder if it even works over the net.  It does.  It does.  Oh, OK, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of something called network jitter,  they've been able to demonstrate it over the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very impressive then.  Because I was going to say that the uncertainty in packet transit time,  you tend to lose any timing information if it was, you know,  going through lots of router hops.  But it sounds like they've managed to null that out too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Internet developers have long assumed there are too many other factors,  network jitter, that slow down or speed up response time  to make it impossible to get the kind of precise results  for successful timing attacks.  According to Lawson, he's at Root Labs, he and Nelson  tested attacks over the internet, local area networks,  and in cloud computing environments, and found  they could crack passwords in all the environments  by using algorithms to weed out jitter.  Very impressive.  Yeah, that's some hellacious work, even if it's not something  you could duplicate.  That's what's pretty impressive about some of these guys,  I'll tell you.  Speaking of the iPhone, were we?  I think we were.  Sam Mateo.  When were we not?  Yeah, I know.  Well, a couple more iPhone stories and we're going to move on.  I really want to get to the Old Spice guy for Lisa.  Sam Mateo County officials have withdrawn a search warrant  issued for Gizmodo.  Remember, we got all bent out of shape over this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was this, like a perpetual search warrant?  This story has baffled me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason Chen was the Gizmodo reporter who had the stolen  or found iPhone.  Authorities searched his house in April,  and they wanted to keep the information  that they found on those electronic devices  that they confiscated.  Chen agreed to submit information  that was on those devices, but the search warrant  drew heat from critics and me and many people on the show  because they violated shield laws that protect journalists.  Mr. Chen's attorney went to the district attorney saying,  if you agree to withdraw the search warrant,  we will grant you access to the information you are looking for.  Eliminating.  What does that mean?  Well, and this is why there's a shield law,  because you get the computer and, yeah, you're  looking for one thing, but it could be a phishing expedition.  You could find maybe if this is a journalist that you  are targeting, you could find other source information.  So the attorney said, look, you're  going to have problems in court with this shield law.  Why don't we give you the information  you're looking for and protect the rest of the information  on his system?  They said yes, and they dropped the search warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we have any idea what information  they were looking for?  I mean, he's basically, what kind of information  could it possibly be looking for that would incriminate him  for anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I don't know.  I don't say that anybody has been charged with a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This whole thing is sketchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think what happened is that React and the district  attorney in San Mateo realized that they  had a problem with potentially an illegal search,  so they made a deal.  They compromised with Chen's attorney.  I think this is actually good news.  It means that those shield laws do carry some weight.  And I think Gizmodo did the right thing.  They said, look, we just want to protect our other sources.  We'll give you the information about this specific thing.  Would you buy a Nexus 2, John?  A Nexus 2?  Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry.  You don't buy anything.  Would you accept a Nexus 2 free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Old Spice guy and more.  We're Talking Tech with Lisa Bettany of Mostly Lisa  and Anon Shippey of AnonTech.com, John C. Devorak  of ChannelDevorak.com, and Steve Gibson from GRC.com.  We're glad you're here today.  We're glad you're all here today.  Thank you for coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, can I get a plug in?  Yeah.  My Twitter numbers have not gone up much  because I haven't been promoting it.  So I want people to sign on to the real Devorak and get me.  I got to get some numbers.  John, how many do you have?  68,700, something like that.  How many?  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing.  We need more bikini photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that your secret?  That's only half of what Lisa has with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to see John in a bikini.  I saw Odokta in a towel, and I'm still suffering from that.  I don't want to see John in a bikini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you'd look better than Odokta in a towel, however.  Well.  And I love Odokta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So John, what is your Twitter account name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TheRealDevorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But make sure you spell Twitter right,  because I spelled it with two I's and I got a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and you get a Parker site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Parker site.  Here it is.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're, anyway.  Let's talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I want to show your page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There it is.  There it is.  What is it with the clouds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got clouds on your page.  Cloud computing, baby.  Cloud computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only kind of cloud computing John likes.  Wait a minute, let's see who John's following.  All attractive women, John.  Who's Bobby Eden?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the stripper that was going  to give everyone who followed her some oral sex.  If the other teams want the.  Hey, why not take a chance?  What does it hurt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You asked.  Oh, I'm happy I asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, she's got 103,000 followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She started with 7,000 before she made the offer.  It worked, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She is, according to her Twitter page,  number one Dutch poor star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So John, what are you going to do for your followers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  I'm going to thank them profusely.  OK, we've already gone.  With emphasis on the profuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to profuse all over them?  Profusing all over them, once again.  And I'm sure they're very embarrassed at this point.  You asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What am I supposed to do?  Lie?  I can't.  No, I asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You tell the truth, and that's what I love about you, John.  John offers an investment device in solar companies  after attending InterSolar.  You retweeted the guy who's mad at you.  That's good, John.  That's the best way to handle that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That gives me those big numbers I'm looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be real Dvorak.  Follow him, and maybe Bobby will notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be real Dvorak.  Actually, Bobby is the no agenda porn star girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like she's on your show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she's our official porn star.  But she knows to come on the show.  Nobody comes on the show.  It's not a show that has anything other than two guys  yakking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This show brought to you by squarespace.com.  You see, they just got an influx of some money.  Oh, yeah.  Big, $38 million, I think, of venture capital.  That's really fantastic.  They are, once again, just the place to go  if you want to build a new website.  If you go to squarespace.com slash twit,  you can try it for 15 days free.  You don't even need a credit card.  And if you decide to buy, use the coupon code twit,  and you get 10% off for the rest of your life, forever,  which is great.  Now, it's very affordable.  Anyway, they start at $8 a month for both hosting  and, I think, absolutely the best content management  system out there.  You get these great templates that  don't look like templates.  And then you can customize them to make your site look unique.  They've got incredible statistics and content  management.  And talk about cloud hosting.  They are using some very sophisticated Java VPS  technology that gives you instant scaling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great for photographers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you using them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  But I, yeah.  Why not?  We've got to get you on Squarespace.  Yeah, I'm on WordPress, and I've been on them for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think Squarespace needs to reach out  to WordPress users, because Squarespace people,  everybody knows WordPress.  I've been around for ages.  Now that Squarespace has a little money,  I think that they should reach out, because this  is a modern platform in ways that WordPress absolutely is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now that I have my blog, and then I have my portfolio,  and I'm getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go to squarespace.com, look at the examples page,  and then click portfolios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, I need a portfolio that  can be viewed on an iPad, an iPhone.  It needs to be mobile.  And right now, the site that I have is Flash.  And it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Squarespace is just beautiful stuff.  It doesn't look templated.  That's one of the things I like about it.  You can't tell it's Squarespace.  It's not normally a selling point, but in fact, I think it is.  WordPress blogs tend to look like WordPress blogs.  You know, you can kind of, oh yeah, I've seen it.  Seamless importing of all your content from WordPress,  or movable type, or type pad, or blogger, and out too.  So you're not stuck.  You could try it free for two weeks.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  There's a great iPhone app.  You'll love that.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Give it a try.  They really do great stuff.  And we do our Inside Twit blog on there.  We use Drupal for our big site, because we  have all these elaborate things.  And now I'm starting to wish I'd used Squarespace,  because it costs a lot of money for development  and customization.  And it takes, there's delays.  And it's just, yeah, it would be so much easier.  Oh well.  So what do you think of this?  I thought this was a really smart campaign on Old Spice's part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's definitely the best interactive web-based  advertising that we've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we've talked before about the Old Spice ad,  I'm On A Horse, which I love.  It's like one of the-  Swandive.  Swandive.  Well, and then there was a sequel, Swandive,  came out a couple of weeks ago.  Whedon and Kennedy, the agency that did this, just brilliant.  In fact, we did a video dissecting the I'm On A Horse,  how they did it piece by piece with the creatives.  Cool.  I'm catching up with your Barney video, John.  I've almost got a million views on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You better get another Barney video out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People go to the Dvorak Uncensored on YouTube  and watch Barney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's, this is your marketing strategy?  Yes.  So what Old Spice did is they got Isaiah,  oh, I can't remember his last name, Mustafa,  and he's a football player, really hunky guy, right?  And they got him in,  and I think they must have just sat there in studio  and watched people tweet him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it looks like they had him in studio  for about two or three days,  and they were watching any sort of at tweets,  and they would actually do a video reply.  And if you go through, I mean, there's like hundreds of them,  and there's like, you know, Kevin Rose and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we talked about that last week because we know Kevin,  and he kind of said, get well, Kevin,  but there was a wedding proposal there.  Well, he and Alyssa Milano have been going back and back,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  back and forth on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's so smart.  I mean, it's the engagement factor  that really has made this as popular it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isaiah Mustafa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, his daughter, Haley, sent him a Twitter saying,  why is it you look so much like my dad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like my dad.  Well, Haley, the truth is, scientists have discovered  that there's a parallel universe,  and your father must live in that universe  that's parallel to mine.  Unfortunately, I happen to be more successful,  well-known, and richer than your dad.  So just because I'm so rich,  don't expect your father to be rich,  because he's probably a struggling actor  whom no one has ever heard of until recently.  So you'll have to keep playing with those old toys.  But if I were your dad,  I'd buy you anything your heart desires.  You deserve it, monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're kind of sweet.  So it comes up with that on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, obviously they have a team of copywriters  sitting there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the writing, such smart writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find the marriage proposal,  because that is really good.  This is how you do viral marketing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They even did, Reddit did one where they,  he gave them sort of an answering machine,  so you could just like piece together  all the different numbers  and create your own message on your phone.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you could do an Old Spice?  You could do, yeah.  So why does this work when so many other  social media efforts by big companies just are terrible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, obviously being successful on YouTube is huge,  but also just like I said before,  like the engagement factor that people are engaging in this,  and then you get all the retweets,  and then you got all the people on YouTube talking about it.  I have a thought on this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, John.  Every one of these things that's worked has a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, funny.  It's gotta be funny first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And all the ones that are serious never work.  That's my thought for the day.  No, that's good.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  I'll be here all the week.  I'll give you another thought in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like it's just.  Say again?  They're not trying to push anything on you, right?  That's what, you know what?  It's, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They never mention Old Spice in these things.  Well, they do a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they do.  I mean, he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But in a very tongue in cheek way.  Yeah.  Here's the marriage proposal.  I can play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On Twitter, JS Beals tweets,  can you ask my girlfriend to marry me?  Her name is Angela A. Hutt hyphen Chamberlain.  JS Beals, thank you for your tweet.  And I'd be honored to honorably honor your honorable request.  Miss Angela A. Hutt hyphen Chamberlain,  it seems like yesterday that you met JS Beals,  but your love is blossomed from a seed  into a fully grown love plant.  Now it's time to fertilize that plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is part, I like the lights dim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Angela A. Hutt hyphen Chamberlain,  will you make JS Beals the happiest man in the world  and marry him in real life?  The candles roll back out and the lights come back up.  We'll be eagerly awaiting your reply.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Eagerly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eeh.  It's really good creative, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really good creative.  Good writing.  That's what makes it go.  Yeah, the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course we're playing it.  Everybody, yeah.  Everybody's I'm sure retweeting it  and sending it to friends.  By the way, she said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Would that work for you?  I wonder, you know, I think it's...  Apparently not.  Well, I remember reading, you know,  sometimes people call the sports events.  They call the scoreboard and they say,  would you put the marriage proposal up on the scoreboard?  And I was reading, I think it was at Yankee Stadium,  the scoreboard people say,  yeah, we get two or three a week last minute.  Stop the proposal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh.  Please don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whatever.  Oh my God.  I've made a horrible mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I sobered up.  I sobered up.  That's probably what it is.  Anyway, so yeah, I think success  and congratulations to Isaiah Mustafa,  who has now been on every TV show  and he's probably got a great career ahead of him.  And again, credit to really the creative behind this  at Wheaton and Kennedy, because they did a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be interesting to know how it's converting  to sales of Old Spice rather than just...  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very good point.  Ah.  The Old Spice YouTube channel has 75 million total views.  75 million.  How much do you pay for an ad on the Super Bowl?  A lot more for a lot less, right?  Let me see if they say there's any figures on sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes these commercials are so good and so clever  that you completely lose track of,  or if they even indicate what it is they're selling,  you're just transfixed by how fun they are.  It's like, okay, what was that commercial for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and an old doctor makes an interesting point.  He says, nobody uses Old Spice.  This is like grandpa's aftershave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you compare it to say Axe, that's really prevalent.  That's very hip.  It's really out there, and it's sort of like right there  when you walk in the supermarket, people are all about Axe  and their sort of ad campaign.  I mean, it is possible that people could sort of switch  to something. Could be?  To something, because they're like,  oh, the Old Spice guy, he's so cool.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then they smell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on, does anyone actually think the Axe guys are cool?  I just thought that was just a big joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know who does?  My 15-year-old son.  It's not aimed at anybody over 13 or 14.  That was my very last audition that I went to.  You went to an Axe audition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was it?  That turned you on to auditions?  When was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh gosh, I can't even remember.  Maybe three years ago.  And what happened?  And it was a group of girls, and they're like,  okay, we're gonna pretend that this Axe is like,  it's like raining Axe, and you get really, really horny,  and you watch these two dogs having sex,  and you're really turned on by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's when I walked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You actually walked out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I said this.  Good for you.  I have a master's degree.  I'm sorry.  Why am I here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not gonna watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dogs fornicating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in comparison to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they actually have dogs,  or was you supposed to imagine that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was all in our imagination.  So yeah.  But that, I mean, compared to that kind of advertising,  like, you know, the Old Spice guy  will carry a lot more weight, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Leo?  Yeah.  You remember High Karate and the English Leather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing, the High Karate.  Okay, English Leather, wasn't that the one that said,  all my men wear English Leather?  Well, they wear nothing at all.  And then High Karate, the guy had to chop,  he had to do karate.  Chop his way through a bunch of bruisers.  Women were attacking, no, bruisers, women!  They were attacking him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's women attacking him.  That's where the Axe thing comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Axe is just, I don't know what the point with Axe is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's High Karate all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the thing I will underscore in every single one of these,  and Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong,  they all smell horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't want a guy to smell like Axe.  Well, I mean, Old Spice smells like my high school boyfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only thing that could make Old Spice  a little bit of nostalgia, right?  It's because he was 15, he had a buck 50  to spend on aftershave and no taste.  No, he used his dad's.  Yeah, maybe he used dad's.  It smells like grandpa.  It smells like grandpa.  So this is, I think you made a really good point.  Does this sell more Old Spice  or does it just make the brand hip  with no actual benefit to the brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, brand recognition is huge  and I think eventually it does translate.  And if they go-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If something's a crappy product, it's not gonna save it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but we will remember.  I mean, it's the Old Spice guy.  So we've already bought that.  That's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know who's the winner here?  Isaiah Mustafa.  Yes.  Nobody else.  I don't think Old Spice sells more Old Spice.  I wonder about the way they're Old Spice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if it's been reformulated  because I remember when I was a kid  and then I remember the smell of it specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It smelled like black jack gum when I was a kid.  No, Old Spice smells like cheap gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smell like molasses and turpentine.  It was great.  No, it smells like cheap gin.  Really cheap gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Old Spice also does have  a very extensive deodorant line too, right?  So it's, and not to sound like a deodorant reviewer  or anything, but that is a big part of it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's made with gin, isn't it?  There's a couple of people in the chat room  use the deodorant.  Wait a minute, Steve just said something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Say that again.  I think it's made with gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I think so.  I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That might be a little pricey,  but it is a good name for the show.  It's made with gin.  Facebook reaches half a billion users.  It finally happens.  That's all I can say.  Wow.  There seemed to be a little bit of a slow down  and uptake among certain groups,  men 18 to 34 in the US and so forth,  but Facebook is now starting to beat Orkut in India,  which is where Google had two strongholds,  Brazil and India for its failed social media network.  Facebook's even- Orkut.  Orkut.  Facebook's even beaten them in India now.  Apparently we're coming on strong.  Half a billion.  They're now, okay, to put this in perspective,  there are now more Facebook users than Windows 7 licenses.  There are more Facebook users than number of people  in the entire United States.  There are more Facebook users  than the number of daily Twitter posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Facebook movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I want to see that too.  I know.  I want to see that.  The Accidental Billionaires.  Creepy Zuckerberg.  Yeah, Creepy Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When do we think Google Me is going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, all evidence points to soon.  Google says it's announcing its music service this summer.  That could be what?  And through September 21st or something.  And I think Google's going to make a big push  along these lines.  I really do.  But can it win over?  I mean, if everybody's on Facebook,  why would you go anywhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, you're in that network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a beyond critical mass.  It's just rolling out.  And this is the audience that I was talking before  that has no tech knowledge or computer knowledge,  but they want to play Farmville and they want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They want to catch up with their high school sweethearts.  They want to hook up with their former employee,  you know, co-employees, that kind of thing.  I think that that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's being used for business a lot now too.  I see Facebook being mentioned on corporate sites  and corporate flyers and things all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that old spice thing, trying to be hip, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look at LinkedIn and where LinkedIn.  I mean, LinkedIn used to be the sort of business.  And Facebook was like where you put  your embarrassing junk photos.  And now it's like, you know, LinkedIn sort of fallen off  and it's all about Facebook and people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm waiting to feel out of touch  because I don't have a Facebook account.  You know, I killed mine.  And I'm just waiting to see, am I going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could start over to Marlillo.  You'd have your old numbers back in about a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then wouldn't that be kind of embarrassing to say,  so I came back.  No, you have to stay off it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've put your stake in the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't go.  I have my tail between my legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you miss it, Leo?  Is it doing something for you that you really feel  like you don't have now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't.  Well, that's an interesting question.  In fact, when you do delete your Facebook account,  you get this row of people's pictures randomly chosen  from your followers saying,  Lisa Bettany's going to miss you.  Your mother's going to miss you.  So there's this big guilt trip they lay on you.  I don't miss using it, no.  And I don't feel like I'm any less in touch with Lisa  because I don't see your Facebook posts.  I do feel like I'm less in touch with some people  that I don't really care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you really care about them.  Yeah, I mean, ultimately, like for me,  the people that I'm closest to,  I still call and like see on a regular basis, right?  And because Facebook is so public,  but I mean, I do have to be a censored version  of myself there simply because, I mean,  that's how you deal with the privacy issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody here uses Facebook, not personally,  but as a marketing tool, as a publicity tool,  as a, you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm also at the point where I don't call people.  I don't see people in real life.  All my friends are on the internet.  Like, I don't, I mean, this-  Somebody said-  Wait, so you don't have like that one person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that you've known all your life  that you do pick up the phone and call.  You don't have like that one or there's one or two people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's left broken hearts strewn behind her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like being in my little world  where I'm in my dinosaur pajamas  and I'm in my little safe place  and I'm just communicating via the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you like Facebook  because it lets you wear dinosaur pajamas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have to have an outward face.  So you use it personally.  Anand, it sounds like you use it professionally mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I use it for both, but the thing is that like,  so I've got readers, manufacturers,  and my actual friends as friends of mine on Facebook.  But I do the same thing when I'm out having dinner with,  if you and I were to have dinner somewhere,  I'd still watch what I said  because I don't know who's around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you and I might plan dinner on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes?  That's true, yeah.  If we wanted to make everyone else feel really awkward  for not being invited, yeah.  I think we could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, John, what do you think?  You were pooh-poohing all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think Facebook serves a purpose.  I think a lot of people find it useful.  I just have not, I mean, I subscribe to certain things  and I get on board with this and that.  And once in a while you say something and I say,  well, that's a good idea, I'll give it a shot  because you're always, you test everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I miss is that kind of chance.  But I use Twitter that way a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Twitter to get some information back and forth.  I use LinkedIn.  The rest of the stuff I haven't been using,  I've been thinking about Foursquare and Whirl  I'm probably gonna play with  because the CEO is an interesting character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whirl's kinda neat, yeah.  I've played with it a little bit.  Foursquare is where everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is just another thing to do.  And then they say it's addictive for women mostly.  And I see my wife and daughter  and they're on this thing all the time.  I think, geez, I don't wanna be like that.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's too big of an opportunity in the marketing.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I think is, that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've noticed that it varies depending on what you do.  So you're a photographer?  Yes.  And so it actually works really,  really well for photographers.  That's one thing I've seen.  From my perspective, I don't know.  It's a great way to stalk people.  The number one thing I see people doing  is just learning information about other people  that they don't really have the means to get any other way.  That's true.  And in terms of whether or not Google's attempt  is gonna do anything to it,  ultimately at the end of the day,  it's the same thing for any market.  Market share is gained and lost in periods of transition.  There's no real transition right now  for social networking.  So I think things are gonna stay the way they are  until that next big idea comes forward.  And generally speaking, new companies and smaller companies  are ones to kind of get on board with new ideas  before the established players.  And I think that's the only time  we'll see a change in market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google just acquired a company this week called MetaWeb,  which is a search engine that they say  connects data in more meaningful ways than just links.  And some have said that the reason Google wants them,  and they obviously have a very competent search engine,  but they wanna get smarter about the results  they're turning in.  And frankly, John Mello writing in PC World says,  this is actually going right up against Facebook.  This is part of Google's attempt to continue  to keep their dominance against Facebook,  because Facebook, combining the social graph  with search results, gives you all of this deep,  rich information, and Google's afraid it cannot do that.  Google said, we've acquired MetaWeb,  a company that maintains an open database  of things in the world.  Working together, we wanna improve search  and make the web richer and more meaningful for everyone,  which is the kind of silly rhetoric

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Mark Zuckerberg has used about Facebook.  Well, think of all the data they're amassing.  Facebook has more data.  It's ridiculous, and that translates to a lot of money.  Right.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Potentially.  Yeah.  But it's okay to reveal this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Google able to index into Facebook?  No.  Because non-Facebook users are not able  to see Facebook pages, right?  You have to join in order to be part of the network.  Right.  So Facebook has an advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because they have information that Google can't get.  Yeah.  WikiLeaks is in the news.  Of course, the US government would love to get  the guy who started WikiLeaks.  This is bull.  Especially since it released that secret video  of the US airstrike in Iraq.  The site's founder, Julian Assange,  made a rare public appearance at TED, TED Global.  He said, we're overwhelmed by our growth.  The site can't keep up with the volume of new material  because it doesn't have enough people to verify it.  He says the attention that WikiLeaks gotten has helped it  because people are just, great,  I found a place to give this information to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, CIA honeypot.  Really?  CIA honeypot, hello?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying don't give information,  well, if you do anonymize it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you go through a Tor network or something,  but then again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I ran across a rumor about a month ago,  which I was never able to pursue.  I didn't really spend that much time,  but the rumor was that WikiLeaks was formed  by monitoring a Tor exit node  and capturing documents that were coming out  of the Tor anonymizing system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think we gotta look more into this Julian Assange.  Interesting.  I don't know, I think WikiLeaks is actually fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you?  It seems like a very good thing.  It's like a pro internet sort of thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think Assange deserves a lot of credit.  WikiLeaks operates out of Iceland and Sweden,  among other places.  He cannot come to the US.  In fact, he's had to cancel three public appearances  in the US, including one in June  at the Conference of Investigative Reporters  and Editors in Las Vegas because of his fear  of the US authorities.  I don't think it's a CIA, John,  unless they've really gotten clever.  And there's no evidence of that.  I think there's no evidence of that.  All they do is they're clever.  That's what they deserve.  Have you read Legacy of Ashes, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clever.  Totally suspicious too.  Well, we'll get some bonehead things they've done.  But I'm not, well, I'm just not buying it.  There's a whole story,  the whole backstory behind that operation is just doesn't.  That just doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love it.  I love your conspiracy minded theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a conspiracy.  Some guys work for the, what's a conspiracy?  I mean, it's just a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You thought Facebook was a CIA honey pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Facebook might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we know Facebook has an investment  from the CIA's venture farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And you don't think they're investing and then saying,  well, whatever you guys want to do, just go do it.  We'll cash in later.  There's no, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The chat room says I'm naive because I don't believe it.  I'm just naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A whole bunch of people are saying that.  You should shut down the chat room immediately.  I'm sweet and innocent.  Do your Nixon.  Let's get back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm gonna wear my dinosaur pajamas  and do this commercial in dinosaur chammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's time very quickly to talk about  GoToMeeting from our friends at Citrix,  the affordable way to meet with clients and colleagues.  Look, a business trip, it's ridiculous.  $1,000, according to American Express,  the average cost of a business trip.  I used to fly up to Vancouver.  You'd stay at the beautiful Opus Hotel.  You'd have lovely flights on Virgin America.  I would just, it would be fabulous.  But $1,000 later, whereas for $49 a month,  you have as many meetings as you want,  as long as you want, as often as you want,  up to 15 people at the same time.  You show them what's on your computer.  They can show you what's on their computer.  You can pass control around.  You can collaborate together on the same document.  GoToMeeting's amazing.  If you are still traveling for business  or perhaps even worse, spending time on conference calls,  which has to be the single most painful thing ever,  try GoToMeeting.  You try it free right now  by going to gotomeeting.com slash twit, 30 days free.  Gotomeeting.com slash twit, please do me a favor.  Give it a try.  You will, I think, love it.  And it's how we do all our meetings.  In fact, if I could figure out a way to do twit  with Gotomeeting, you'd probably like that, Lisa.  You wouldn't have to go through all that traffic  on the Golden Gate Bridge.  Ah, sorry, but then I wouldn't get to see you.  When Lisa's here, I feel like I'm on my own private version  of the holodeck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, was that a duck call?  Do you actually have a duck call?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do, a real one too, an Acme,  which is one of the world's great duck calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This show brought to you by one of the world's  great duck calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, by the way, these things are very handy.  That's the Acme duck call, made in England.  These things are quite handy in a theater  during when they're showing something very serious  and it's like it starts getting pretty bad.  You just let the duck call loose and you get a huge laugh.  You can't lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a guaranteed laugh.  I went to see Adam Sandler's Grown Ups.  Do not go see that movie.  There's not a laugh in the whole movie  and I could have used that duck call a couple of times.  Lisa, so you played with the Droid X.  Is it too big for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if this can fit in my back pocket.  Yeah, maybe not.  The way I'd like it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want to sit in a phone though.  You really would put your phone in the back pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, well, I'm not a very good girl.  I finally got a purse, like an actual girl purse,  because before I always just carried my camera  in my camera bag.  So I got a girl purse so that I can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I come to think of it,  I have never seen you carry a purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never, I didn't even think about that.  She has her men carry the purse.  Yeah, I carry a purse.  So I guess I'm a very good girl.  That's a merse though, I think.  It's a merse.  So by the way, I carry,  I put my E71 Nokia in my back pocket too  and sit on it constantly.  Do you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not only is it bad for the phone,  but I think it could cause sciatica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, maybe, maybe.  But I haven't been, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't used the word sciatica since I used Old Spice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like I'm grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Turnin' into grandpa.  Actually, you know, Old Spice,  Mentos comes to mind.  Remember Mentos?  This was grandma's mint  until they started advertising on MTV.  That's true.  And then it became hip, the Freshmaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and then they, but they did the Coke, the Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then they put it in Pepsi and it became even hipper.  But, but have you ever eaten the Mentos?  No, they're horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love them.  They're not that bad.  I like them, they're chewy mints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I predict, I predict a resurgence of Old Spice  based on this small sampling of consumers  who think Mentos is hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I said it was hip.  They were, they're just chewy and tasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're delicious.  Now see, I never got the whole like mint  as some sort of a refreshing candy thing.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  Really?  Yeah, you know, I just, I need it for mint purposes, right?  I don't need it for like any other purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How actually one of the-  It's not candy.  I wanted to ask you, and maybe that's cultural, Anand.  Did you, did you grow up in the States  or did you grow up in India?  No, I grew up in Massachusetts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually only my dad's Indian.  My mom's Iranian.  Oh, interesting.  I was curious-  Yeah, but you know, if you have Indian in you,  it just, it kind of takes over any other race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the name is what made me think you were Indian.  Yeah, yeah.  There is a, quite a controversy about this iPhone app  that is an ad for a skin product  that is sold Vaseline face whitening  that is sold in India to literally whiten your skin.  And they made an iPhone app out of this,  which is kind of controversial.  What's the app do?  Yeah.  You transform your face, it whitens you.  Oh, it shows you what you look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just in India back in December  and you know, it's funny.  It's like human nature, right?  You always want what you don't have.  And so everyone here wants to be tan  and everyone over there just wants to be lighter.  You see like billboards, right?  Of creams and stuff like that, that'll lighten your skin.  It's just like, I mean, humans are weird creatures, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just ultimately what it is.  They sell a similar product in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We risk cancer to look more like you.  And then, but go to India and they want this,  there's a Vaseline Men Be Prepared page.  That's a, there's a Facebook app.  I'm sorry, I thought it was an iPhone app.  Facebook app, which will whiten your profile image.  Permanently, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Permanently?  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know what, John, you're not alone  because a Wall Street Journal reporter  tested the Vaseline Skin Whitening Facebook app  and remained unconvinced of its result.  Now that's hard hitting journalism.  Thank goodness.  All right, I don't know.  I just thought I'd bring that up.  I don't know if there's a story there or not.  Yeah, but that killed the show.  I know, I think maybe I should just go home now.  I got nothing else to say.  Anybody else have anything to talk about?  You killed the show, Leo.  I literally killed the show.  Well, it's five o'clock.  It's time to go home.  Oh, so it is.  So it is.  So it is, John C. Dvorak is at Channel Dvorak.  That's the place to go if you'd like to see  what John's been up to and he's been up to a lot.  Mostly no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I still didn't get to my 69,000 followers  with the show here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Damn, all right, last chance.  We can't stop the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only live.  Wait till the thing airs.  When this thing airs,  well, 300,000 people are gonna hear it  and they're all gonna start following you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I like though?  I really like the idea of holding this show hostage.  Like we're gonna stay on the air  until John, how many do you want, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need only 60 more, 59 more people  and I'll be at 69,000.  That's all I wanted to get to today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just, well, that's easy.  The real Dvorak.  All right, let's see.  You have 68,943, 57 people.  That's all we need.  Get those phones ringing, ladies and gentlemen.  We're gonna stay on the air until John C. Dvorak  has 69,000.  Thank God he didn't say 70.  69,000 followers.  All right, everybody, please go to,  you know what the problem, John, partly  is you've probably saturated the Twitter audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  There's, you know, you think so, but how did you,  you have, of course, you have all those other shows,  so that's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're at 68,956.  Let's roll that tote board and see-  Do Jerry Lewis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll never walk alone.  John, we love you.  I wanna tell you, this man, this man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this John C. Dvorak, this man, he does this for love.  And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.  We have 69,009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you very much, thank you very much.  I'll be here all the week.  God, we can cancel this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man, I thought we were gonna be here all night.  Lisa Bettany is at MostlyLisa.com.  That's where you go to find her photography.  Now that you're moving to the Bay Area,  I know that Alex, Lindsay, and I  are both fighting over you.  We both want you to do shows for us, so.  I'd love a photography show with you.  I would love to do a photography show.  And I'm sure, John, I mean,  Alex has probably already come to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I put my plug in?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But now, was that the giveaway,  you think, to put that over the top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the app is great,  so I think it just sort of, I mean,  obviously there's the marketing power behind Tap Tap Tap.  They're amazing and they've made great apps,  so there's that behind it.  And I think just a lot of people are sharing the photos.  Obviously, my great effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's $1.99 and you sold like $200,000 worth?  Well, how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've done a quarter of a million.  In the first month?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Holy cow!  So I think I should get a job with you.  Forget you'd getting a job with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is, I haven't got the money yet,  but it will certainly change my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It will, that's great.  That's why you and Peter are buying a house.  So now it can be a girl house.  Camera Plus, the ultimate photo app.  Go to CAMERAPL.US.  Wait a minute, why am I looking at John C. Dvorak  when I could be looking at Lisa Bene?  There you go, better idea.

Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, they do, good.  But you should order Lisa's product.  People have to realize that this woman  is really a outstanding photographer.  She really is, she's amazing.  I really love her stuff.  And she needs to probably become better known as sex.
