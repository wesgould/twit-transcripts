Transcript:  Yes, from data from our from our data apocalypse that is always seems just upon us.  But I did a personal process that I went through courtesy of these artists and activists out of Germany called Tactical Tech that lets you kind of review your own exposure to data.  And so I did a personal journey and took notes and chronicled it.  And out of that experience, which I've been processing for over a year, honestly, I wrote a humbly titled New Tech Manifesto on ways I think that we could collectively not just be afraid of what the present is, but like write a better future.  My hope is that we don't feel disarmed by all of this or too depressed by it, but that we actually feel inspired.  We're still early days of the Internet in this whole network world, and it doesn't have to be an advertising hellscape where we are all in someone's dossier of us.  So I encourage folks to check that out.  Baratunde.com.

Transcript:  I think the timing is good.  I feel like we're making progress in that regard, aren't we?  Thanks to GDPR and the Facebook debacle.  We were watching the face.  So on the NBA playoffs, there were three, not one, not two, but three apology commercials.  Yes.  Facebook, which has been running for several months.  And I love Facebook because it said, you know, all the things you love about Facebook.  And then something happened as if they had nothing to do with it.  Like it was like passive event that occurred.  They were the victims here.  Then something happened.  Fake news happened.  Poor Zuckerberg, really.

Start time: 297.06
End time: 304.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think a little more.  The Wells Fargo ad was the most annoying ad to listen to, but it was the most honest, I think, in admitting their own flaws.  They said, we lost your trust.  Accurate.

Start time: 305.16
End time: 310.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish Facebook had said, we lost.  Yeah, own it.  That's the only kind of apology that works.

Start time: 311.38
End time: 379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things, one of my favorite, honestly, my favorite line from my little short series was, you know, Facebook has been not just on an apology tour,  but like a corrective blogging exercise where if you go to newsroom.fb.com, which I encourage everyone to do because we probably haven't, they are launching all these new tools.  And they're saying we're going to audit the app developers and we're going to we're going to get them.  We're going to get them for abusing your data.  And it's like, dudes, it was like you open the door.  You left the keys in the lock.  You had signs up that said, grab all this data while you can.  Everything must go.  So, you know, Facebook, you know, auditing and investigating app developers is like Walter White investigating Jesse for all that meth Jesse made in Walter's lab using his scientific knowledge.  And until they not only apologize, but like really come clean and acknowledge that it was part of their corporate growth strategy to let all these folks in and sell us all out.  It's going to be very hard to take them seriously when they ask for our trust back.  I can't even trust you to be honest about the problem you helped create.

Start time: 379.83
End time: 385.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that would require a little bit of humility on the side of Facebook.  And I don't think that corporation has humility built into its DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it goes right back to the business model.  I mean, Zuckerberg has been playing fast and loose with his users data since he was in short pants in Harvard.  And he keeps apologizing.  And it's always the same thing.  He's dependent on his business is dependent on the users sticking around watching ads and whatever.  You know, if you're going to prioritize user engagement, then you're going to have things like the 2016 election.  Did you see the thing that they did on the Daily Show?  The Facebook skit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 641.44
End time: 655.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the thing about real life is there's a natural damper on that kind of stuff, right?  You don't want to confront somebody directly.  There are people, occasionally you'll be in a bar that you'll meet somebody like that.  But they're shut down fairly quickly, right?  Right.

Transcript:  Instead of lighting a fire.  Right.  I feel like Twitter's even worse.  I just want to say, Facebook's getting a lot of heat.  But really, if you want to go into a bar fight, just say anything on Twitter.

Start time: 673.30
End time: 680.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but the argument about Facebook's data usage is pretty separate from the toxicity of the platform itself.  There are similar points, but they are distinct, I think.

Start time: 681.50
End time: 698.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the idea that Facebook knows all these things about us and has been making money the whole time,  all for that deep knowledge.  That is, to Alex's point, more specific to Facebook than Twitter,  which is an uncontrolled space, but not as deeply ingrained in our psyche as Facebook.  Yeah, I disagree.

Start time: 699.34
End time: 722.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no baby pictures on Twitter.  I think Twitter is a more subtly, I think actually Twitter is causing a national psychosis right now.  So Facebook, you're right about the surveillance capitalism and all of that.  But if you're just looking at the effects of a site on people,  Twitter seems to really turn even nice people into monsters.

Start time: 723.58
End time: 733.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when they looked at the numbers about how ideas flowed,  they may have started at Twitter, but the impact was on Facebook.

Start time: 733.55
End time: 751.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when it was the most people.  It's much bigger.  The people who are on Twitter are us.  There's a lot of media people there.  But relatively speaking, there's not billions.  Twitter is 300 million.  Facebook is 1.5 billion.  In the world's democracies or falling versions of those things on a much deeper level.

Start time: 751.36
End time: 757.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And you can sell ads.  You can target content on Facebook in a way you can't.

End time: 770.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think, Baratunde, that this idea of detox is going to go any farther than us?  Do you think general people, the guy with the photo, is not going to leave?

Start time: 771.38
End time: 854.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what I try to consistently argue for, I think it's a both and or yes and type strategy.  I don't think individual action alone is going to fix all this stuff.  It's like just say no.  Yes, just say no, but also don't create an environment where drugs are the only outlet  or selling them is the only economic opportunity.  And so that means we've got to look at the systems.  So individual detoxing to some degree, I think is really valuable, educational,  for us to look into the gapping maw of nonsense that we have opened ourselves up to.  And then we should put pressure on the companies, put pressure on our regulators and our oversight bodies,  get the research in place to give us the tools to better manage.  And the good news, if you look at Apple's announcement last week, if you look at Google with Android P,  they are starting to get the message certainly around the addictive stuff and the sort of mind hacking.  And I think soon around the data and giving us tools to have transparency,  because individually it took me a lot of time to go through that process.  And I was able to recover some of that value by writing for money about it.  But that's my job.  It is not everybody's job to make a full time out of tuning your privacy settings  and reclaiming slices of your life from these massive multinational companies whose job it is to sell us.

Start time: 854.10
End time: 880.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. I had put off this portion of the data detox because I prioritized time with my girlfriend  watching Atlanta and living my life.  However, it isn't easy, is it?  And in fact, as you dig into, in this case, Evernote's terms, 29,000 words,  you found all sorts of stuff that wasn't quite as user friendly as it looked like on the surface, right?

Start time: 880.02
End time: 1005.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. And look, the simplest thing I asked for out of this, and everyone who's listening should know,  we're so early in the show, I've got a bunch of bit.ly links.  But if you just go to baritoned.com, you'll find the whole set.  The most important is that I took the manifesto piece, like my call to collective arms, metaphorically speaking,  and I opened it up. It's an open Google Doc, and people can edit and continue to add to it.  So the most the thing that people have attached the most to is I used an analogy to food preparation,  food service and grocery sales.  And I said, look, we don't individually bring chemistry sets to the grocery store to analyze the contents of our food.  We don't have to because the government has mandated nutrition labels and companies are going further.  You know, Whole Foods has done this whole thing where you understand the sourcing and all of that.  We are in technology is designed to do batch processing.  It's designed to make to surface information at scale.  So if there's one industry in the history of all industries that could inform us at scale more clearly, it is technology.  So to apply that lens not to nutrition, but to how our data is used, I would love to not have to read thirty thousand dollars of a terms of service.  I'd love to be able to compare and contrast who's selling me out, who's, you know, sucking in my friends address books,  who is stalking me across the web with invisible trackers.  And then, you know, the consent becomes informed.  Right now, we don't really have meaningful consent. Right.  We have compulsory consent, which isn't consent at all.  It's like hostage taking. So that's an example.  No one should have to read thirty thousand words for every app you interact with.  That is a lifetime work lifetime of work.  And we can do better. This industry was designed on just making that sort of information accessible, distillable and clear.  So I try to be hopeful and say we can do this as opposed to oh, my God, we're screwed.  Unplugged from the matrix. It's all over. I don't think so.  I don't want that. I like the matrix. It's beautiful.

Transcript:  I like the second point a lot in the manifesto because it ties into what you just said, which is, you know, change data defaults from open to closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if you look at their earnings breakdown of their revenue per user per region, is it going down?  No, but there's certain users that are much more valuable to their investors.  And so if they lose their mind share in certain markets like the US where they're seeing a decline in teen usage, which bodes very poorly for their aggregate North American usage,  those users monitors at a much higher rate due to the other advertisers work.  So they care a lot more about not just number, but also which users they are.  And so if we the United States log off because we know about this and we don't like it, that harms their earnings more than just losing any kind of one user on the world.  Philip wanted to say something.

Transcript:  Well, we read your manifesto on the on the ferry over here.  Oh, it was designed for boat based reading. Thank you so much.  Can you go up to number five? Yeah, we can pull that up for you because it really gets down to it seemed to me you want some new laws.  You want government regulation. Is that the right thing to do?  Well, I'm just asking this. What what are you looking for?  What are the laws that you think ought to be passed and in what priority?

Start time: 1106.92
End time: 1189.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have a complete answer to that. I'll be very straight up.  I approach that call for regulation in the same way that I think we've approached other elements of life that have been regulated, whether it's highway safety, food safety, child labor, I think.  And the call for this manifesto came out of the idea that individual action is not enough.  You look at climate change, right? We can't like paper bag our way out of burning our planet down.  And so we have a facility for collective action is called government in democracies for sure.  And if we reclaim that and exercise our power through that, we have to redesign some elements of it.  But it is one of our most effective, despite all the rhetoric about dysfunction, ways of exercising collective power.  So it's not that I have a list of the top 20 laws and here's the subject sections and all, but I think the principles of managing and using the government to exert influence where we individuals don't have power feel sound to me.  And they include things like ownership of our data.  GDPR is the right is the right direction. Who knows exactly how that's going to play out?  It's way too early. But at least Europe is trying in the US.  We're just like, oh, you want to rob people? Go forth and do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would that be sufficient? I think we all agreed that the market itself is never enough because in a fully market based capitalist society, the poor people get ground to a faint dust and the rich people at the very top do very well.  Some regulations are critical. Now, I don't think about social media legislation much.  I don't think any of us did before 2016. So I don't like like, I don't have exactly a list of things that I would change.  But certainly, if we had some rules, maybe even reminiscent of GDPR, that would be a good place to start because we can't just do nothing.  I don't think that'd be healthy for our nation long term.

Transcript:  The downside, though, is what counts as open, what counts as closed, what counts as a default.  We're going to end up having that battle back and forth in Congress, as we saw during the Zuckerberg hearings, is not well read on this stuff.  So to kind of fully execute what we think we need, I was shooting for understatement for once.  Once I was trying to be British, I admit it does happen sometimes.  But maybe if we can elect a younger group to Congress and we talked about this in the pre-show a little bit, we can actually make some progress here because we can't just let Mark Zuckerberg, who was voting control of Facebook, decide for 2.2 billion monthly actors or whatever it is, what's going to happen with their privacy, their data, their life and their children.  That's too much power in one hand. To quote Kanye, too much, oh, in Africa, the lyric. Oh well, move on.

But I would say in a rare, in a rare, super unpatriotic moment, like I would welcome some British oversight back in the US.  You don't want, you don't want.  Given, you know, if you looked at the questions that the British Subcommittee on Commerce, Sport, and I forgot the full title, like the way they questioned Facebook's CTO versus the way our senators questioned Zuckerberg is clear.  They care more, like they've done their homework more. And on this point, they were better representatives of humanity than the US Senate was.

Transcript:  And yet, I mean, the UK is famous for citizen surveillance. They're famous for, you know, I think maybe one of the things that's going on there is that they trust the government to surveil and they don't trust private industry to surveil.  We're quite the opposite here in the US.  Excellent.  We are in favor of companies not government.

We find our love and our jobs and so much through these platforms.  And so it's not a nuclear weapon.  But as Cambridge Analytica has shown, there is a weaponization possible of these platforms.  It's not a pleasant...  It has real harm.  Right.  And so, you know, if you look like Russia is very excited about the chaos that's been caused and they didn't have to technically fire a shot.  Right.  It wasn't a ballistic missile.  But have make no mistake like this was an attack and we are suffering and paying the price of it in trade deals gone awry in war with freaking Canada.  Like, why are you picking up fight with Canada?  Seriously?  Like, that's how tough you are.  You're going to pick a fight with Canada.  They're like the nicest people.  So I just think we have to be careful that even though it doesn't look like a hard weapon, these soft weapons can do just as much damage.

Transcript:  Well, let's take a break and then we can look at what Apple and you mentioned Android 2, what Apple and Google are both doing.  I think probably because of market forces saying that you better take care of this because the risk is if you don't, somebody else might.  The government will stop that.  The government will.  But I think companies are paying attention.  Maybe not Facebook, maybe not Twitter, but maybe Apple.  Let's talk about what Apple announced in just a second at WWDC earlier this week.  I mentioned that the NBA finals had apologies.  There were three of them.  I didn't mention the third one, which is Uber.  And I have to say, I'm really impressed.  Uber is spending some money to tell people that they are moving forward.  And I am a big Uber fan.  You guys used Uber.  I use Uber.  I never actually did delete Uber.  But I want Uber.  I wanted Uber to acknowledge the issues and do something about it.  And they are.  They're working on how to keep us better protected, how to keep us better connected.  During a trip, they created a safety center where you can learn about driver screening and community guidelines to ensure everybody's moving safely.  You can now.  This is really interesting.  I haven't used the Uber app in a while, but a couple of weeks, I think.  But you can designate up to five family members and friends as trusted contacts.  Did you see that in the app?  Set up reminders to share your trip details with them whenever you ride so they can see you on the map and know when you've arrived.  My daughter, my college age daughter, had her third and final car crash this week.  She didn't hurt herself, but she's totaled the car.  And I said, hey, good news.  It's actually cheaper for you to take Uber everywhere.  And now, you know, I feel safe having her do that.  So I think that's a really good thing.  And I will have her set me up as a trusted contact so I know where she is and how she's arrived.  My mom uses Uber in Rhode Island, too.  She's 85.  She hasn't had a car in some time.  Mobility has been an issue for her to go to my sister every time she wants to go to the store or the doctor has been a real problem.  I'm going to have her call Liza soon.  But no, she's now I set her up with Uber, put the credit card in.  She loves it.  And Uber's updated the app to make it easy for you to verify the details of your ride.  You'll see your driver's name, car license.  You can make sure to get the right car, the right ride every time.  I think Uber's I want Uber to succeed.  I want Uber to solve these problems and move forward.  And I think they're doing exactly that.  You could find out more at Uber dot com slash moving forward.  I think this is an important trust initiative.  And as a fan and a user, I'm really glad to see what Dara Kosarashany is doing and how they're moving forward to re-earn our trust.

And one, you know, it was structured.  OK, here are the four operating systems that are going to update them.

Start time: 1644.02
End time: 1686.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it was totally uneven because they had way more to say about iOS and Mac OS than  they had.  TV OS was a throw away.  Yeah.  And then it was also for two audiences, the developers and the users.  But they've historically had that problem with WDC.  Right.  And for my sense of it was that for the developers, it was the setup, not the punchline.  They were giving them a lot of tools that we're not going to see the results of for months  or years for the Mac stuff.  For the users, there was a lot of punchline.  There were a lot of little improvements from how you control notifications to, you know,  the stuff that you wanted to get into, which is monitoring your abusive, your addictive  behavior.

Start time: 1687.10
End time: 1756.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll get to that.  Let me just say the two things and I'll get out of the way because there's to me, there  were two takeaways that I thought were very interesting.  One, the fact that they've put effort into the Finder and the Mac OS, I found very encouraging.  I was really worried that Apple had just given up on Macintosh and I'm not convinced  that they haven't.  But at least they've got somebody spending some energy, putting effort into a Finder,  which is the main thing you use on Mac OS, which hasn't been changed in years.  They actually put some effort into the Finder.  I thought that was very encouraging.  And they did something that has in some ways been a pipe dream for computer scientists  since the earliest days of personal computing.  And I know, Philip, you'll remember this, you young guys won't.  Document centric computing.  And the idea is right now, we're just used to it.  It's always been this way.  You want to do something, you launch an app.  The app does whatever it is you want to do on the data, on the document.  It's apps and documents.  But even going back to Alan Kay and the Dynabook and the very first vision that started the  Macintosh at Apple, it wasn't Alan Kay.  It was, oh, I've forgotten his name.

Start time: 1757.02

Transcript:  The mouse guy?  Yeah, no, not the mouse guy.

Start time: 1759.02
End time: 1813.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, his name will come to me in a second.  The chat room will tell me.  But the earliest days with the Dynabook, the idea was, oh, you don't why launch apps?  That's very modal.  You're now in the word processing mode.  You're in the shouldn't you just work on documents and whatever capabilities you need just be  available to you in that document.  And it doesn't mean that apps don't exist.  And we're seeing the technology now here, even on smartphones, where you've got the app.  That capability can be present front and center in the operating system.  And so they showed with Finder editing photos, putting a signature in a PDF.  I mean, some really interesting things that don't require you to launch an app first.  And I hope that Apple is sincere about working on Finder.  And I hope that this is a direction that they're going to take, because this is the future.  This could be a really interesting future for computing.

Because when they came out with augmented reality, with the AR kit, there weren't very many usable apps that came out.  And the only one that I liked that I bought was a measurement app.  And it sure locked them all.  And just without apology.  Look what we've discovered. You can measure.

But it felt like there was a lot of moments where they would pause for applause, and then no one would clap.  And then the employees in the room would start the applause track.

We've got Dark Modes in Windows, for instance, and there's always an app that doesn't do it right.  Or there's a title bar that's ugly.

Transcript:  I mean, I see this in line with advertising controls on what you can say to young people.  Right.  We know that the brains of young people aren't fully developed until we're like 70, 80 years old.  Right. We just don't know anything until then.  And sophisticated psychological manipulation on kids to want sugary cereals, to smoke cigarettes, to do this and that.  That is not a fair fight between a parent and a massive multinational corporation with all of science and all of capital at its back.  And so I see this as restoring some balance.  I don't have children, but I have friends who do.  My former high school just decided to shut down a lot of Wi-Fi access because kids are coming to school and just watching television.  Yeah.  Because they're streaming YouTube.  They're having parties with Spotify.  And that's not the point of being in school all day, is just to jam out to some hot tunes.  No, that's the point of college.  Yeah.  That's where you pay money for that later.  So I can't speak to this directly from a parent perspective.  But I just think we know the science and the manipulation that has gone into making these apps as addictive as possible.  And when we think of these supercomputers, not as tools, but as cigarettes, as drugs, as sugar, parents have no possible opportunity to help their children resist those urges.  It is not a fair fight.  And I see Apple and Google trying to restore some power back to us.  I do think it's empowering to let us have our parents don't have to do it.

But I always say to parents, look, I'm not going to judge how you raise your kids because you have your own challenges.  Except I'm definitely judging, by the way.  But I'm going to judge.  No, no.  But at the same time, it's important to parents to understand kids need a place where they can express themselves without somebody looking over their shoulder.  They do need a certain amount of freedom.  But at the same time, if you have a kid who's getting in trouble, whether it's using crack rocks or digital crack rocks, it's nice to have some tools.  So I'm not completely against that.  I think I understand what you're saying.  And you don't want a police state in the house.  Yeah.

Or would you say, no, you can do anything you want.  I don't want to see it.  I'm not sure.  Give them a phone.  Well, first of all, you're going to have to give them a phone.  I have the password.  I have the password.

Transcript:  You'd have to have the password, right?  Do you know the horrible...  I'm going to keep this as tight as possible.  There are nefarious, bad people out there trying to hack our kids' minds.  There are white supremacists trying to recruit folks.  There are violent folks trying to get access to our kids.  There are people who are just using the algorithm to hack their attention so they can make money.  That's really the problem.  Look at YouTube.  Look at the YouTube recommendations, right?  Yeah, and it's like I literally saw a video for kids that was like Hitler in a bikini dancing next to a burning car.  And I'm pretty sure that's psychologically damaging for me, much less for a 10-year-old.  So no, there's no way some kid who's 10 and is in my stewardship...  What age?  ...will not have access to a supercomputer with no supervision.

Transcript:  You know what's really interesting, Baratunde?  For a long time there was this stranger danger thing, this epidemic.  And the National Center for Missing and Exploited Kids was focusing on stranger danger.  And it turned out that most kids were abused and or abducted by people they knew, mostly relatives, family members.  There wasn't really any stranger danger.  It's one of the reasons we don't let kids out on the street anymore.  They have to stay at home all the time.  Now you've got the new Nazi stranger danger.  You've got white supremacists.  Yeah, but they're real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I think if you look at the way ISIS has been recruiting around the world, it is primarily through social media.  That's terrifying.  If you look at the way some of the white nationalist, white supremacist movements are evolving, they are using social media and video to change people's perception and normalize some of these topics.  I don't like this is a real hypothetical question for me.  I don't have a teenager.  And I was one and I definitely do not like the idea of my mother going through all of my notebooks, all of my diaries, things like that.  So there is a sliding scale of access that I think declines as one gets older and you risk pushing your teenager away further if you don't demonstrate some trust.  But I just know if you're under 12, that passcode is tattooed inside of my eyelids for sure.

So it was just too slow.  Like trouble happened more slowly back in the mid 90s.  Glacial trouble.  You had to really want to do bad things and be like disciplined and persistent.  And my attention span was a bit short.  So I think she had a little less to worry about.  And we had a neighborhood that was not the best one to grow up in.  And she moved us because she didn't want me to get sucked into some of the activities or the surveillance of the police work.  Police work.  That's the nicest way I can put it.  Police work.

Transcript:  That was a really kind euphemism.  The po-po.  By the way, this is off topic, but I was also in Boy Scouts.  And I think that's why you and I were both so unsuccessful with getting girlfriends.  I think it was the Boy Scouts that stuck to us.  They could always tell.  So you had a very strict family.

Transcript:  I was in Boy Scouts forever and we didn't really have TV growing up.  And it was a Christian conservative environment.  Did you feel oppressed?  I felt left out of a lot of stuff.  And now that I've gotten older, some of it I'm glad I missed.  Some of it I wish that I hadn't.  I missed a lot of cartoons, a lot of movies, a lot of pop references.  There's a cultural bit that you don't have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then the advantage though is, back to Brandon's point, I read a lot.  I read so many.  I read Lord of the Rings enough my parents took it away from me because I couldn't read it anymore.  Good.  But I think the children should be given space to grow up and experiment, especially among themselves.  And maybe that's why some phone access removal isn't so bad.  Because the socialization you want children to have is probably mostly happening still offline, even in the digital era.

Transcript:  I mean, if it's not healthy for us, and no one here is going to say Twitter is good for us, back to our earlier point, it can't be good for children.  And so my question isn't just how to spy on their web usage, but when is it okay to say, now you're old enough for X versus Y?  Now with video games, it's very easy to tell.  That's a tough one too.  Hang on.  When it comes to violence and gore and so forth, I don't think it's that hard.  Now when it comes to like addictiveness, I agree it's more difficult.  But social media, I mean, how old would you let your kids start?  15, 13, 28, 35?

Yeah, because that's a synchronous phone conversation that we used to have on phones,  that we now just have on headsets.  Like I do that with my friends, we play Destiny 2, and we stay in touch.

I wonder, for me it sometimes comes down to scale, right?  Is there something categorically different about these networked technologies from the previous sort of broadcast technologies?  Because access to books, access to music, access to printed materials is something very different from access to like ubiquitous communication.  And the ability for everyone to not just download information, but to upload it and to engage in conversation.  And probably amazing magical things are going to happen with the next generations of people who are growing up in this.

Yeah, look at that.  To organize that march.  And they were able to demonstrate a level of empathy that was previously so expensive.  To find someone in another city who would experience the same tragedy as you and to build a coalition with them would have taken so much effort, so much money, so much time.  And it's pretty much free now.  That's an excellent point.  Parkland is the counter example.  I just want to caution myself about so much panic.  I just think we should brace ourselves for a level of extreme good and extreme bad that we haven't experienced historically because the power wasn't distributed as widely as it is now.

I have more in just a second, but first a word from WordPress.  If you know, one thing that's a healthy thing you can get your kids to do that's digital,  and I say this because both my children just this month asked me to help them set up their websites.  Get them a website at WordPress.com.  That's where both Abby and Henry are.  Henry came to me and said, Facebook's he's a photographer and a videographer.  And he said, they're squeezing my pictures.  The quality is terrible.  Is there somewhere you could put images that I said, yes, your own website.  You shouldn't.  Your Facebook page is not your own.  Your Instagram is not your own.  Your website.  That's your own.  So he's at WordPress.com.  Same thing with Abby.  I want to put up my portfolio, my resume.  She's starting to look for work.  And that's the way to do it.  WordPress.com.  Actually, I sent it to WordPress.com slash twit because she gets 15% off.  So that's a good thing.  WordPress.  That's where my site is, leolaport.com.  Everybody I know, when it comes to getting a website up fast and easy, when you want to focus on content, not on CSS,  WordPress.com.  You don't need to do the coding, the design.  They give you all the tools you need.  Hundreds of beautiful templates.  I was kind of touched.  My daughter completely spontaneously picked the same template as me.  There's hundreds.  I mean, it wasn't like she had three to choose from.  She picked, we both picked 2017.  It's a very nice template.  I highly recommend it.  She kind of laughed.  She said, what?  You're using that too?  Yeah.  Now, if you want to sell stuff, and Henry does, he says, I want to sell pictures.  I said, great.  WordPress has powerful e-commerce options.  You can get a buy button, simple, or have a complete online store.  It's up to you.  It's very affordable.  They're just starting out.  $4 a month, great deal.  I have the business plan, which is a great deal for me because I got lots more templates, lots more plugins, help with SEO.  I love the social sharing.  If you're a business or you want others to help spread the word about what you're up to, my daughter's a poet.  She does spoken word stuff.  And she wants, she's doing poetry reading.  She wants to spread the word.  This social sharing is great because it means other people will post about it on their Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.  And that really helps get the word out.  30% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.  That's not an accident.  It's because it's the best.  WordPress.com, you'll get 15% off any new plan purchase.  If you go to WordPress.com slash twit, please go to WordPress.com slash twit to create your brand new website.  WordPress.com slash twit, 15% off.  It's the best.

Transcript:  When Gutenberg finally comes out and is fully released and that comes up on Twitter, I want to come on and talk about it.  What's Gutenberg?  It's the new typing section.  So you know WordPress at the back end, you have kind of the similar interface where you try to type your blogs.  I think Gutenberg is the next iteration of that, and it's supposed to be pretty fantastic.  It's a new editor.  I have yet to use it, but I'm really excited about eventually getting my hands on it because using plugins and so forth to change how your WordPress install handles formatting and options is a pain in the butt.  And this is hopefully going to be what I've been looking for for roughly 8,000, 9,000 posts now.  So I'm pretty stoked.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is the skins.  This is the uncanny valley where it's it's humans are very finely attuned biology to  detect normal and abnormal because somebody who's slightly abnormal could get you sick.  And so, you know, evolutionarily, I think that we've discovered that the people survive  better if they can detect somebody who's a zombie.  And so we can tell.  And it makes us very uncomfortable when it's close to human, but not.  And that's the valley is where it's, you know, in that it's, you know, cartoons.  Pixar looks great, great, great, because they're not trying to look like a cartoon.  But as soon as you get to Polar Express, where Tom Hanks, it's creepy because it's closer.  But not close enough.  You have to get 100 percent or no more than 75 percent.

Transcript:  And maybe you think it's not as big a deal, but the idea of these Siri powered shortcuts.  Oh, that's to me the biggest thing together.  Essentially like automator workflow types of functions to make sure your house is ready  when you get home.  If you have an automated house, which I don't.  Or if you want to fire up some other operation that you can get directions, you can find a recipe  and it'll talk to multiple apps in a sequence to accomplish a more complex task.  I love that idea of if this then thatifying your iPhone and your iPad.

Start time: 3698.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, we'll see, you know, once they implement it.  And I signed up for the public beta, but 12 isn't yet in the public beta channel, but it will soon.  But for the longest time, I've actually made a bifurcation between Android and Apple.  Apple and iPhone.  I recommended to people who didn't want to fuss with their phone.  They just kind of wanted it to work.  They weren't invested in tweaking it or the capabilities of it.  Android is more for people who like to customize, who want power.  They want interact malware.  Yeah, well, OK.  But with great power comes great responsibility.  That's truly unfair.  It's a hand in hand thing.  I mean, the more open a platform is, the more risky it is.  Right.  Apple made a walled garden.  It's not very risky, but it's also not particularly adventurous.  Except to me, this is this is a big leap for Apple.  And this may actually put them in the territory of making a phone operating system that I think everybody will want to use.  Because this is essentially adding programmability to iOS.  Without coding.  Without coding.  And that means you can make it.  And this is where Google had such an advantage with things like Google Now.  Where it would say, well, I see you're going to the airport.  You got airplane tickets.  I saw that in your email.  And that means you're going to be going to the airport.  You should probably leave now because traffic's bad.  That was a very valuable tool.  Apple doesn't want to do that because they don't want to look at your email.  But this is the beginning of that kind of power.  And I think they've done it in an interesting way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they bought an app called Workflow.  And I think 90% of this is Workflow.  Yeah.  Here's the things it'll depend on.  Yes, Siri has to understand you.  That's number one.  Developers have to add this capability to their apps because a lot of it relies on...  For instance, they did an example where Siri knows that this woman stops every morning to get a disgusting-sounding drink called a mint mojito.  It fills coffee.

Start time: 3842.22
End time: 3849.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 3860.06
End time: 3862.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All good mojitos have mint.  You could abuse mojito into not having mint.

Start time: 3863.02
End time: 3890.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, and not abused mojito.  But what's interesting is that it's the Phil's app that is interacting with Siri.  So she has the Phil's app.  The Phil's app knows she orders this coffee because she's ordering it through the app.  Siri communicates with the Phil's app.  Siri communicates with you saying the Phil's app told me, in effect, you get this mint mojito.  Would you like me to order it?  You say yes.  It then contacts the Phil's app.  So if developers do that, that is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If that begins to knit together the various disparate parts of my phone in a way that's intelligent  and helps me do things and is not creepy, then I will be the happiest clam in the sea.  I'm worried about poor implementation.  I'm worried about it being a little pushy.  Of course.  But things will work on.  The details are...  I'm excited about it.

Start time: 3908.00

Start time: 3920.02
End time: 3928.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's be fair.  What Apple's really done is strategically brilliant.  They've said, we'll not collect any information on you.  We'll let the apps do that.

Start time: 3929.79
End time: 3931.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we'll let you be the one who weaves it together.

Start time: 3932.10
End time: 3937.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I mean, the Phil's app knows exactly where you've been, what you're doing, what time of the day is, and what you order.

Start time: 3938.66
End time: 3951.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's kind of cool because it's distributed.  You know, it's not no one has a concentrated amount of data power.  OK.  Phil's only knows my fake Mojito preferences.  Right.  They have no idea about my commute, for example.  Right.

Start time: 3952.00
End time: 3960.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it solves the discoverability problem that Amazon has.  There may be 10,000 things it can do, but how do I know what they are?  Right.

Start time: 3961.54
End time: 3979.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And presumably, if you install a Phil's app and use Phil's a lot, you don't have to do anything else.  Siri will see that and then give you stuff that you can act on.  I think that's great.  I think potentially this is, to me, this might be the single most important feature on the iPhone since it was released.  If Siri.  If it all works.  Can work.

Start time: 3980.00
End time: 4001.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's the first one that'll change the way we actually interact with our phones.  I mean, the iPhone for all its spit and polish over the years is still a grid of apps that do single things.  This could actually bring them together in a way that's going to be.  Precisely.  And fantastic.  Precisely.  And I'm giddy about this.  As a daily iPhone user for a long time, give me something that helps me that isn't just memojis or dark mode.  Those are nice little things, but not really the core of what I want.

And Apple fired him about a year ago.  They said your position has been eliminated.  And here it is, ironically, that exactly the workflow stuff that Sal was espousing at Apple for so many years in iOS.  And I sent a note to him and said, you must be both gratified and sad.  And did he respond?  Not yet. I'm waiting.  But it must be tough for him because that's exactly...  I think he's going to be gratified.  He's got a great job.  He went over to Omni Group and is doing great stuff there.  On automation, by the way.

And so many times we've seen an Apple event where I've gotten really excited.  This is going to change everything.  ARKit is a good example.  When ARKit was announced a year ago, we saw all these toy apps and demos on Twitter.  And everybody was excitedly doing that.  Can you name the great AR app of the last year on iOS?  Measure.  Measure was huge.

Transcript:  That video we just showed of Renee and I, Justine reminds me a little bit of the old Palm Pile days because I was a super cool teenager as we've gone over.  And the Palm Piles had these little IR ports at the top and you could point to Palm Piles at each other and play games with the other person that was there.  And it was it was it was kind of janky.  It didn't really work that well, but it pretty much worked.  You play ping pong and whatnot and air hockey.  And I would say there was with my friend who had another Palm Pilot and we would do this for hours.  And so I think the whole idea of bringing people together in the real world to do a digital experience together is something that we haven't seen for a long time, but it has a lot of potential.  And if it does work the way they're hoping it does, I'm actually I hate to sound positive about Apple, but pretty excited.  That's Alex.

And you have to follow commands, some of which are for people who have controls adjacent to you.  So you'll get a command.  You have to yell it out.  People have to be paying attention.  And the commands are absurd things like fire the endoplasmic reticulator.  And so it's fun.  Clearly played this game many times.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's solid team building skills.  And so instead of being limited to the tiny space of your smartphone screen, you could do it on a canvas of a blank table like you just showed with the idea.

He gets $2 bills from the mint and binds them into a pad.  And his whole game that he plays...  There's the Nixie watch, a little bit better picture of the Nixie watch.  The whole game that he plays is he tries to use these to buy stuff, and he wants them to arrest him.  Yes.  He wants them to say, that's counterfeit.  And so he has them on pads.  Sometimes he'll take them on whole sheets and scissor them.  I guess you can get uncut sheets, if you're Woz anyway, from the treasury.  So he uses scissors.  And he says, no, no, he has a funny phrase he uses.  Like, this is approved legal tender.

And he said, now you guys have been talking for years about you're not going to make a touch screen Mac because it's unnatural to be pointing a finger.  Right.

Transcript:  I wanted to talk about a little line that got tucked in when they were talking about the great apps that they were going to bring to iOS, to the Mac.  And maybe that wasn't the context, but this woman named Susan, they didn't give her a last name, said, you know, we're doing this and we're doing that.  But the very best thing is we're bringing Apple News to stocks so that the Apple News stories are going to be curated by Apple's editors.  And my thought is there's no more business news feed that's more polluted by FUD and fanboyism than Apple.  But and it should be curated, but not by Apple.  I mean, you could be an editor with the best heart and mind.  But there's no way to be in Apple's employ and to treat Apple News, to curate Apple News in a fair and even-handed way.

I worked for Timing for a long time and there was no story you didn't want to be assigned than a Time Warner business story because it would get edited by layers of editor all the way up to the top and then it would get killed.  You know the lawyers are going to see it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I got to say though in defense of Apple News, it is the single best way to find out what's going on on an iPhone.  The Apple curated news thing, they're scraping the right content.  It's fairly well balanced.  They throw in some Fox News.  It turns out...  Really, is that your... that's your definition?  Well, for me, it exposes me to things I'm not seeing by reading the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times.

End time: 4803.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they took the old Newsstand app and they renamed it Google News.  And it's... so what you get is you get a curated five-story for you that's based on what your interests are and your...  Right.  And by the way, they know my location so there's a local news story and stuff.  But then each story has a button on it that is full coverage.  And at that point, it's no longer curated.  They say everybody will see the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish they did because they are after all scraping.  But I think nowadays companies understand that sending them traffic is something of value.  So if you go to headlines, you're getting the same headlines everybody else is getting.  And I kind of like that.  I think that mixes the value of an algorithmic feed with having a common point of view.  Yeah.  You have favorites so you can control it.  And they've kept the subscription newsstand in there.

Start time: 4832.50
End time: 4843.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, Leo, it is mirrored on the web.  I just went to News.Google.com.  It's the same.  And the left rail top stories for you, favorites, saved searches, which I think is the same as your box.  Thank you for the correction.

But mostly Cupcake Twitter is fine.  I think you can find some...  How do you find Cupcake Twitter or dog Twitter?  You find the people that engage in Cupcake or dog...  And you unfollow all the rest of them?  You just build them into your feed.  You know Darth?  Yes, I know Darth.  Okay, so Darth is an example of weird Twitter that you can bring into your life to bring  some light to your feed.  And I think that we could all do that a little bit more.  I just follow 6,000 journalists, which is why my feed's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a lot of news in my feed.  Our tribe is not exactly known for not fighting.  And I just...  First of all, the algorithmic portion of Twitter has really screwed things up.  There is no way to do a chronological feed anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do use Tweetin and TweetDeck I use as well.  Those both still have it.  Actually, one of the tips that somebody told me for TweetDeck,  and does clean up Twitter a lot,  TweetDeck allows you to turn off retweets.  And so a lot of the stuff that's bad on Twitter is the viral retweeting of outrageous...  I'm going to take out the...  My tweets and all this so we can just focus on the one column.  But without the retweets in there,  you actually get a little bit better content.  But I'm telling you, 10 tweets in and I'm angry.  My gut's churning.  I'm going to tweet for you.  You're going to tweet me?  I tweeted.  You're checking to see if I'm following you?  You are following me.  There it is.  Excellent.  But I already am following you.

The first episode is amazing because it's all Trump gets elected  and seeing how The New York Times covers it.  One of the things they do visually is you see Maggie Haberman  writing a story and someone kibitzing her.  The words are actually appearing on the screen as she types them.

Or if I haven't read it, I've got to read it.  But if you haven't listened to it, this is the way to consume it.  Anthony Bourdain reads his own book.  One of the things I like about Audible is when you hear authors in their own voice reading their books.  Some people should not read.  But Baratunde, you read your book, right?  Yes, I do.  And How to Be Black has particular resonance when you read it.  You wouldn't want anybody else to read it, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I reread it, I realized this is why Bourdain was so beloved.  He is great.  He is honest, he's real, he's genuine, and he talks about life without pulling any punches.  And I think I really admire that.  Kitchen Confidential is amazing.  Amazing book.  I'll show you some other things on my...  I'm reading the Robin Williams biography right now.  Fascinating.  And you know, I mentioned this.  I was on a page, there's a site that gives you just the first page of a book without the name.  And I was reading the first page of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  And I thought, what is this book I've got to read?  And I found out, oh, I read that in high school.  But I thought, I haven't heard this in a long time.  Science fiction on Audible is amazing.  Audible is the place to listen to great books.  A great sidekick for your summer activities, hiking or sunbathing.  In fact, I can't read on the beach.  I got a Kindle, but it's so much better.  You get some headphones on, listen to a great book while you're running, while you're road tripping.  There's so many times just commuting.  Audio books, but more.  Audio shows, news, comedy, all sorts of great stuff.  And the new app, the app's always getting better, but it has some nice features.  Send Books and Clips means you can share a book from your library with anyone.  If they haven't listened to an Audible book before, they can listen for free.  I use that all the time because I'm always talking about a book I'm listening to and I share it with people.  You can also share clips, which is really nice.  So I could take that Anthony Bourdain clip and share it with you, which is fantastic.  They have speed control.  I know a lot of people listen to our shows at twice the speed.  Oh gosh, what do we sound like?  Actually, the funny thing is when they come in studio and they listen, they say,  you guys all sound drunk. I'm not used to you speaking at a...  With such slow pronunciation.  ...speaking slowly.  Audible lets you listen faster or slower if you want, so you can tune the narration.  Some people listen...  I want to relish the book. I want to do it a little bit slower.  WhisperSync is awesome.  If you have a Kindle, you can buy the book on the Kindle and listen to the book at the same time.  You can see the text as you're reading.  This is really a nice feature called WhisperSync for voice.  Of course, you can listen to audiobooks on your Echo.  Sonos now supports Audible.  I'm thanking the Lord because that means I could put my book on throughout the entire house  as I wander around, do the chores, do the dishes, and keep listening.  You never lose your place or miss a word.  I just love...  The thing is, there's always times you're doing something that you can't hold a book, but you can listen.  It recovered reading for me because I was so busy and I couldn't hold a book and I'd fall asleep at night.  Now I read a couple hours a day because there's always that downtime, the time in the car, the time washing the dishes.  Audible members get a credit every month, good for any audiobook, regardless of price.  Unused credits roll over to the next month.  So the subscription is really the right way to go.  And of course, if at any time you say, I don't like this book, you can exchange it for another No Questions Asked.  And your books are yours to keep. They're in your library.  I've been an Audible member since 2000 for 18 years.  I have hundreds of books in my library.  And I can go back and listen again and again.  I just love that, including to Kitchen Confidential.  So that is a nice thing, too.  Here's the deal. Get a free audiobook and a 30-day free trial.  Right now, if you go to audible.com slash twit, or you want to do it on your phone and get the app, text twit to 500 500.  That's the short code. Just text.  And you want to send them twit so they know you heard it here.  Text twit to 500 500.  So you'll get the app.  And the other thing I love about this, you get the book instantly.  There's no waiting for it to be delivered. No going to the bookstore.  If you want to hear Anthony Bourdain now, instead of this lame show, you could just text twit to 500 500 and have it.  Audible.com slash twit. It's not lame. It's a great show.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit.

I read it when I was a kid. Not a kid, but I read it in high school. It really is great.  How many pages is that? How many pages per hour can they do?  It's huge. I don't know.  And then the other one I'm reading I got when I was in Japan. Shogun.  The James Clavell novel. 53 hours.

Transcript:  On the Bourdain note, I have an article to recommend.  It's not about the sponsoring thing, but he brought up such sadness.  It was a really tough week.  If you all go to Medium, I didn't write this. Not self-plugging.  But a friend did. It's called When They Leave.  Given our conversations about social media and the internet, how we present publicly versus who we are inside  and whatever turmoil we might be going through, there's often a big gap between that.  And this author does a really good job of reminding us that we don't necessarily know people who we think we know  just from their work and just from how they present in public.  And there's some good tools in there.  Suicide prevention is always something valuable to throw into Google if you're feeling a little panicked about how tough your life can be.  So just a public service announcement on the backs of that.  Because I know that was very hard for many of us.

Transcript:  I pay money for Fast Mail, which is an IMAP mail service.  I really like it.  It has all the tools I want.  I don't want web based mail, to be honest.  I prefer to use a desktop client.  And part of it is because I use PGP signing.  And so I want to sign.  So if you get an email from me and it's not signed, it's probably not me.  Gmail doesn't let you do that.  I feel like I have a little more control on a desktop client than I do on a web based client.  And Gmail, I used Fast Mail with Gmail.  I mean a desktop client, Apple Mail or whatever, Claws is my preferred, with Gmail for a long time.  But it's actually impure IMAP.  It's pseudo IMAP.  And a real IMAP client gives you, I think, a lot more capability.  So Fast Mail.  I used to pipe my email for a long time.  I've been using Fast Mail for a decade, but I would pipe Gmail into Fast Mail.  Because Gmail had the spam filtering, right?  Yes.  But I've noticed I don't need it anymore.  I don't know why.  But I actually get more spam because I have a French name on Gmail.  That's the other reason I stopped.  See, this is all spam.  This is kind of impressive actually.  This is good spam.  This is top quality spam.  This is after the filtering.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Marijuana is now legal.  Time to confirm your email address.  That's news.  Because that looks completely legitimate.

Transcript:  He is great.  So this broke kind of the rumor broke at the end of Twit last week and we all kind of jumped  in.  But it came true.  It came true on Monday.  Microsoft bought GitHub for seven and a half billion dollars.  Yeah, baby.  Any thoughts?  I mean, it's not for Microsoft.

Start time: 6439.43
End time: 6502.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I mean, I think you all shared some good links.  I think the Harvard Business Review analysis was pretty good in that and also bring Thompson  Ashton Teckery, who you have on often.  Oh, he's great.  Yeah.  Needed a way to keep you either lure developers with your access to a tremendous user base  or your ability to make them money or you have to reach out to them directly.  And, you know, under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has been a very different company than under  the screamer that came before him.  And their anti open source vibe has all but gone away.  And so buying GitHub helps ingratiate them to developers, helps position their tools  to be used by them and can encourage some of their enterprise users to start using even  more open source stuff.  So the way the Business Review put it said this is not about the financial gain that  you get directly from a GitHub is about the strategic value of having millions potentially  of developers associated with that.  But that requires that.  But associated with your problem.

Start time: 6503.02
End time: 6530.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That requires that Microsoft doesn't make a mistake of it or hash of it.  I mean, they're out there doing Reddit AMAs and sharing blog posts trying to encourage  developers to not worry that they're going to come in and make a mess of their beloved  development home.  And I think after reading a whole bunch of this, it's actually kind of working, which  I'm a little bit surprised by.  But Microsoft has gone on this, you know, Linux love fest.  They've been contributing to open source for years now.  So they maybe have the actual footing in the market to do this and not scare away all the  developers who depend on GitHub to build things.  But they couldn't do it three years ago.

Start time: 6531.22
End time: 6561.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they've they've changed.  Their leadership has changed.  And a lot of this stuff comes down from the top.  They're acting like a more grown up company with respect to a lot of these things.  So I don't I'm not a hardcore developer like that.  I have a GitHub account because I wanted to own Baratunde everywhere on the Internet.  But I do think that, you know, to your point, Alex, they are they're behaving very differently  than they did in the past.  And I think they have a good shot at maintaining this as they have with some of their other  recent acquisitions over the past few years.

Start time: 6561.52
End time: 6602.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did hear from a lot of open source folks who said, I will never trust Microsoft.  There was a spike at GitLab competition to GitHub as people move their projects over there.  One concern is perhaps legitimate.  I don't think it's going to be a problem, but it's something I can understand people worried  about is that open source developers who are putting their source code up on GitHub  privately for them to collaborate and work on are concerned that Microsoft might peek  at it and and glean, you know, glean some information or, you know, I mean, they could certainly  the old Microsoft wouldn't have put that, you know, put it I wouldn't put it past them.

Transcript:  But the risk of doing that and being found out you destroy all goodwill.  It's a massive media scandal.  It destroys the stock price, which is shareholder value, which is the point of the public company.  So they could.  I mean, there's a lot of crimes we all could be committing right now, but we don't because  the cost is too high.  So I think that's a potential, but it seems really unlikely and super stupid for them  to even enable a system where they could do that.  Like a rogue employee probably wouldn't be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They wouldn't have paid so much money if I think if they weren't convinced that they  could convince open source developers that it was safe to stay on GitHub.  One of the things they did that was right.  They appointed Nat Friedman as a CEO of GitHub.  He came to Microsoft from an open source project.  He and Miguel de Acasa founded Simeon and he was so he's been an open source developer.  Nat has since he left MIT.  He's got good street cred.  He was the guy who did the Ask Me Anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said there will never be ads on GitHub, on public repositories of code.  I'm sure that reassured a lot of people.  Nat is I think well liked in the community.  So I hope it does work out because frankly GitHub I think would not have been long for  this world had they not been acquired.

Transcript:  Well, there was a lot of different numbers out there about their income and loss statements.  And the most recent reporting we had was numbers in 2016 in which they were losing tens of  millions of dollars, I think a quarter at that point in time.  But they raised a total of 350 million that we know of throughout their history and they  were worth at least two billion.  Seven and a half billion.  So they had a fantastic return for their investors.  And if you got in when Andreessen Horowitz did back when they were worth about 750 million,  you got 10x probably on your money, a little bit more.  So for investors, it's a great outcome.  For developers, GitHub will now live.  Microsoft can afford to feed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great resource.  I have to say it is.  But also the Free Software Foundation has long time complained about GitHub because some  of their code is open, some of it's not open.  So there's been some questionable practices I think at GitHub.  There was in the Me Too movement, there were some talk about management at GitHub.  So there were some issues.

But yeah, I mean it's good to see a company that was notorious for not being exactly well  managed to find a home that's going to be of correct base size to support its importance  in the software world.

And he talks about the issue of aggregators versus platforms.  This is one of his hobby horses.  He loves to beat on this one.  So a platform in his definition is something that developers can leverage to create something new.  So the classic platform is Windows.

Transcript:  Windows was a good example of this.  In fact I think the personal computing revolution really owes a debt of gratitude to Microsoft.  I mean there were stumbles.  But by creating a stable solid platform for people to write software on the 90s were powered by Microsoft software written for Microsoft Windows.  I don't think that's a good thing in the overall long term of this.  Aggregators are something a little different.  Google is a classic aggregator.  They harvest already produced content or goods to make money off of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And he's quick to point out that while you might think that iOS and the App Store is a platform it's not.  Apple's 30 percent out of every sale really makes them an aggregator.  Much more so than a platform.  And so I think it's a place he is he is astute and I'm probably not going to be able to do a great job of summarizing this.  But he said that the seven and a half billion that Microsoft paid for GitHub is absolutely critical for.  You know he said the GitHub revenue is not the point.  Microsoft has plenty of revenue.  What it also has is a potentially fatal weakness.  No platform with user based leverage.  Microsoft's betting that the future of open source cloud based applications that exist independent of platforms will be a large and increasing share of the future.  Everything Microsoft's done over the last three years under such an Adele has been all about that.  The transition away from selling software from making windows to becoming what a cloud service provider.

Start time: 6929.32
End time: 6948.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is services provider that has a cloud base to it.  I mean the Azure is a pillar of the businesses you know next 15 20 years and they're trying to build up their developer tooling so they have a huge percentage of that market share.  And they sell services that they've always had like office and windows fits in there as an accelerant but not the core hub.

Transcript:  He says any company Ben does with a platform with a meaningful amount of users would find it very hard to resist the temptation to use GitHub as leverage.  And that's what people are afraid Microsoft will do.  But that's the old Microsoft on the other side of the spectrum purely enterprise focused companies say IBM or Oracle would be tempted to wring every possible bit of profit out of the company.  What Microsoft wants is much fuzzier.  It wants to be developers friend in large part because this is really critical to understanding where Microsoft is today.  It has no other option in the long run particularly as Windows continues to fade.  The company will be ever more invested in a world with no gatekeepers where developer tools and clouds win by being better on merits not by being able to leverage users.  I think that's really astute and very exciting.  That's a future I want to live in.

Start time: 7001.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounds good.  It sounds very developer friendly which means good software which means we the end users will do well.  One thing this brought up though that I thought was really interesting in this article and another one he did on this was the number of developers in the world.  And some numbers that Ben cites including one from IDC that there are 21 million developers worldwide.  But there's way more GitHub accounts than that.  And Apple during the day in DC said there was like over 20 million iOS developers.  So one thing that I'm loving to watch over the last week is who's right?  How many developers are there?  And the answer is I have absolutely no idea.

Start time: 7032.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you could certainly create as Baratunde did a GitHub account just to keep your name.  You can create it if you're a writer.  I know a lot of writers who actually use software like Git code repositories to put their writing online.  Yeah for sure.  So it doesn't have to be code exactly.  I have a GitHub account but I don't put anything up there.

Transcript:  You're using Siri shortcuts.  Congratulations.  Everybody wants some day everybody will be a developer.  Let's take a quick break and then the last thing I want to talk about is Computex.  Big Taiwan computer show where all the new PCs get announced.  Intel announced something interesting and fudged the facts a little bit.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But first a word about my doorbell.  The Ring Video Doorbell which I'm a huge fan of.  You know one of the things we say all the time here is if you're going to get an IoT device,  a device that's connected to the Internet, you better darn well buy it from somebody who stands behind it.  We'll continue to update the software, fix security flaws, and a device that can be automatically updated.  The Ring Doorbell is exactly that.  In fact it was about a year ago that there was a security flaw discovered, kind of a minor one, with the Ring Doorbell.  If somebody took your doorbell they could extract your Wi-Fi login from it.  And before it was revealed in public, Ring was notified, fixed it, and it pushed out a fix.  So nobody was ever exposed to that flaw.  That's what you want. You want a secure device at your front door.  A device that makes your house more secure.  It lets you see and speak to intruders or anybody in front of your house from your doorbell.  When they ring the doorbell you can answer it. You can say, Hi, I'm not here.  Actually, you probably shouldn't say, Hi, I'm not here. You should probably say, Hi, I'm in the bathtub.  I'll be right there with my shotgun.  Actually, I do this all the time with UPS. I say, I'm in the bathtub, I can't sign, but I'll sign tomorrow.  I'll leave it at the front porch. And then you can keep an eye on your package, even if you're across the world, somewhere else in the world.  Mike Elgin, who does, of course, a regular on our shows, and spends a lot of time at Airbnbs,  brings a Ring Video Doorbell with him and puts it on the front door wherever he stays.  He says it's the best thing you could do to keep yourself safe and know what's going on outside.  Ring also makes the Spotlight Cam, which is basically the camera, the HD camera, the speaker, the microphone.  No doorbell because it goes on LED spotlights.  You've seen those on people's houses where you go back around the side where the garbage is, and they sense the motion, the lights up.  It does all that, although I have to say these are LED lights, so you never change the bulb. They're really bright.  And then with the camera, you get a motion-activated camera and floodlight.  It's connecting to your phone. Anybody goes back there, you'll see immediately.  It'll set off an alarm if you want, a 110 dB alarm.  So if they don't run away when you say, what are you doing back there?  Let's push the alarm button, and they're running.  I think Ring has really done a good thing to make communities safer.  They have a Ring neighborhood program.  They gave Ring doorbells to one in ten houses in a town in Southern California, cut crime by almost 50% just by having every tenth house have a doorbell.  Criminals said, we're staying away from, I think it was Oceanside, we're staying away.  We're not going anywhere near them.  Ring is so great too. I love looking at the Ring Twitter account.  Here's a guy, he couldn't figure out how his dogs kept getting out of the front yard.  So he watched. Look at this. This is a magic trick.  They can't get out.  There he goes. Come on, you can do it.  He opened the gate.  Oh, he used his head. He's head got stuck.  He used his head to open the gate. Now the dogs are free.  Free at last.  Ring, let him know that the dogs are getting out.  I love actually revisiting the Ring Twitter account, Twitter.com slash Ring, because they post stuff up there all the time for people with a Ring doorbell and even bad guys running away.  It is really fun to see.  Ring, if you want to, there's a special deal right now actually.  If you go to Ring.com slash twit, you can monitor every corner of your property with a Ring of security kit.  You get the Ring video doorbell and your choice of either one, two, or three floodlight cams and up to 150 bucks off. Great deal.  Stop crime before it happens. Keep an eye on what's going on. Help make your neighborhood safer with Ring.  Save up to 150 dollars on a Ring of security kit at Ring.com slash twit.  Ring.com slash twit. Ring.com slash twit. That's the best thing I've installed. I installed that a couple of years ago. I just love it.

She felt like they were snooping on her. They're hovering.  So it's not just you. Everybody just get out of the house.  I just camped out at Starbucks like a moron.  Anyways, so now you know. You just look at the Ring video doorbell. You'll know when they're gone. You can actually get a notification when they leave, which is even better.  You don't have to watch. So Computex Taiwan Intel announced a 50th anniversary product.  They call it the I7 8086. Get it. It's a five gigahertz coffee lake.  Except, whoa, wait a minute.

That's all right. We're a team. It was cool. Okay. AMD, not to be left out, announced a 32 core processor. They call it the Threadripper.  Just a heavy metal name for a bit of silicon. You know, call it Conan and be done with it. The 32. We don't know how much it will cost availability later this year.  That's as close as they're going to get, but that's pretty amazing.

So I'm not going to charge you for me to learn.  We'll do this together. But that number is 202-902-7949.  And if you send a text with hashtag twit, then I'll be able to know how you came through.  And I plan to use it to announce whenever I have big articles or appearances right now from doing live events in your area.  You can share information with me about you as much as you're comfortable.  I just definitely need a name and an email.  And we can have one on one conversation, which I found over the past few weeks is actually really different and interesting from mailing list,  which is all broadcast or Twitter, Facebook, which is kind of performative.  And so I'm learning a lot. I'm able to talk to people in more of a conversational mode.  So again, 202-902-7949. Just text hashtag twit and we'll we'll play around.
