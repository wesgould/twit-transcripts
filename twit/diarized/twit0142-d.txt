Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  alcorn he was we were talking reminiscing about some weird crap that happened at apple and i got

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a lot of good stories let me tell you here's an here's some interesting stuff you tell me what  this means tech crunch is saying that you cannot find iphones even the apple store has stopped  selling iphones completely saying they're currently unavailable usually when they're coming yeah  usually that means when that happens means they at some point in there they may have screwed up at  some point they decided not to make anymore because a new one was coming they usually try  to time it that they run out right before the announcement i would guess the announcement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  won't be till june all the guesses for the announcement are that it's going to be at ww dc  right to go with the new software and stuff so it sounds like they've maybe you know if it's true i  haven't uh you know tried it for myself i might go into town tomorrow i'll try it i'll try it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  online right now i'll try to but it could be that you know they just messed it up because you'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  expect them to not um you know make it unavailable for a week or so before yeah tricky thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  although get that supply chain just right and i guess they they yeah currently unavailable you  can't buy it wow what site store.apple.com click the iphone currently unavailable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  both that's both the 8 gig and the 16 gig it's available on the at&t

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  somebody better tell at&t

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oops well there was a good um some one of the uh one of the websites i think it was like boy  genius report posted that um at&t employees got a memo saying they're not allowed to take any  holiday the week of ww dc and the last time they for because of a large sales event this expected  the last major event that they weren't allowed to take holiday off for was uh with the iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah no it's i mean apple said that the iphone store and the new iphone 2.0 launches in june  ww dc is in june i mean it's pretty obvious that's when it's going to be so it sounds like they  screwed up the supply chain a little bit that's not till june 9th so they've got another month

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of no iphone sales oops yeah i don't i don't know if i buy that because with apple i mean they just  keep it doesn't make sense they keep booking the sales and they give you whatever the updated model  is oh that's interesting that's what they do with you know that that i just don't think it makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sense that's interesting so you say they should just take your money yeah i mean running the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  running the supply out as much as possible before that makes sense auto release makes sense but i  think apple would still keep unless the apple doesn't sell that many iphones to their website  i think they just keep taking orders and then ship the new phones when they are a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it seems seems to screw up at some point it sounds something's fishy something's fishy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  google's gonna the plus side that you can't uh you can't cheese off customers that buy the phone  like the week before the new one comes out if you can't uh sell on the phone maybe that's it maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  that'll feel it's things like that that fill the 25 hours it's that's what i'm talking about it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right now actually it feels like it's been 25 hours just this show okay we haven't talked about  one thing yeah we have set brunch we've talked about a number of things patrick you said you  had some stories that you wanted to talk about not a thing patrick fell asleep he's under the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  car i was i was quite uh i know it's not it's not quite technology but it is quite geeky  that um the guys from paramount have been talking about the 4k restoration they're doing of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  godfather 4k godfather yeah now so we should explain that movies and high def is about 2k or  two megabits right yeah per image and they want to double that resolution this what the red camera  will do it's so it's so realistic it's it's basically as if you're there so there's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  article in uh in american cinematographer magazine and they were saying that you know the the film  got to such bad quality they've basically restored the film and made a 4k master which is going to  be used to go to blu-ray before the end of the year hey hey leo leo call uh uh patrick back he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got dumped yeah i have to press a button now in this elaborate studio it's now much more  complicated to do everything so i'll put patrick back on that's exciting i uh you know i talked to  somebody who's getting a red camera the an australian fellow camera guy and a photographer  and he his uh his uh thinking was he shouldn't you know you can't play back anything in 4k right now  i mean you know there's no point in playing back your blu-ray is not 4k it's 2k so you can't play  anything back in 4k but he's going to shoot everything in 4k because he figures you know in  a few years he'll be the only guy with all this footage in 4k once we can play it back  all right makes sense yeah com here's one comcast is uh according this is from broadband reports  quoting a comcast insider they're thinking about implementing monthly caps now right now comcast  and almost every internet service provider says unlimited and then kind of implies unless you go  too far and then you can't you know so now they're saying they want to give all users a 250 gigabyte  a month cap ouch is that does that seem low yeah actually that's very low well um 250 gigabytes  updates a few i mean it isn't it isn't it's 10 it's almost what is it eight gigabytes a uh a day  eight or nine gigabytes a day that's a lot of data would you use that much that's a few movies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i guess i mean hey can you explain what a 4k camera is in some detail somebody wants to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh no well it's just it's all about resolution actually if you take a picture with a 12 megapixel  camera you're shooting in 4k basically 24 times per second i'm sorry what if you if you with a  standard digital camera 12 megapixel camera like a canon 5d that's essentially a 4k image it's twice  the resolution of high def so if you were to make a movie exactly patrick if you were make a movie  at 24 frames a second times 12 megapixels that would be a 4k movie it's double the resolution  of high def it's so good they're they're saying it's like telepresence now of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they said the same thing about high def you know every time they come up with these higher and  higher resolutions it changes the way you have to approach white balancing and saturation everything  else because these images get weird looking especially when they're moving well and there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nothing that could play it back right now i mean this isn't exactly new they've been using these

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cami i mean basically sony makes them they've been using them for years it's the highest resolution

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  digital movie making camera available well yeah and hollywood has standardized on it yeah  but it's higher res than a than a 1080p blu-ray though i mean it's yeah but it's it's it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember something they're not trying to do a high definition television standard they were trying  to create a camera that you know basically cinematographers would use that would be upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with the quality right so if you take a if you have a 35 millimeter or 70 millimeter negative  that's probably that high that that much if you scan it at high resolution it's probably that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  data i would think when's the last time anything was shot in 70 millimeter that fad came and went

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  really nobody shoots that way anymore bet the godfather was i think that was that was when it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was the godfather 1977 yeah i bet it was huh i don't know we're ignorant you know we should  all these dinky little screens and these megaplexes you know you don't get that i mean i max uses it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  use it for special effects well and my my megaplex has dlp projection now digital projection looks  fantastic right looks great anyway this is really more for this week in media i don't i don't i  think we're not experts in this but we'll get they they will talk about this in greater detail  yeah cool so it cares so comcast says they're going to go maybe this is according to dsl  reports 250 gigs they're probably floating this to see what people say you'd get one free slip  up in a 12 month period after which you pay an extra 15 bucks for each 10 gigs over the cap  initial testing will begin in a month or two now this is at what speed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh all of them yeah i mean basically comcast has an unofficial or a like basically a 200 gigabyte

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cap yeah they have an unstated cap of around 200 gigabit this is about making it explicit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah which i think is a good thing this coming week i'm supposed to get upgraded to 16 megabits

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh down and the burst megabits up i got the burst right now it's not as impressive as it should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no it's not actually maybe it's maybe it's my neighborhood out here but i'm not sure it's worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the extra 10 bucks a month we've got improved i'm getting it cheaper than what i'm paying now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  really maybe did you did you say you're going to cancel is that why no i bitched and moan in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what i did with twitter this is interesting for anybody i hate to say this because i'm  poor guy's gonna get swamped but i'm gonna do it anyway i was moaning about it on twitter and you  should people should follow me i'm the real dvorak and mainly because you know like anyway i was  go to comcast even he can't plug himself in anymore he's like yeah just yeah comcast cares is  a is a is a some you can follow comcast cares comcast cares is frank and frank set me up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this guy who's deals and you know what can i say do you think if i if i if i twitter frank and say  kill g4 and bring back tech tv comcast will care i don't think they care that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everybody should twitter comcast cares because over here like to have an isp with like a like a  five or ten gig limit is like really normal like almost every package that you're like if you're  an average student you'll go to the high street and you just sign up for broadband they'll it'll  be like 10 gig yeah but you guys if you want if you want unlimited downloads you've got to pay  like double the cost usually but that doesn't really solve the problem because the problem is  not really so much like if the problem is is clogging up the tubes it's not so much like the  fact the tubes are turned on for a long time is the fact that the tubes aren't wide enough you need  more it's the peak it's the peak usage time yeah so i don't see how like stopping people from  downloading loads is going to solve the problem of peak time users well it's partially about it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  partially about hammering the most expensive customers out of the system which is essentially  or or making making additional money off of of of the the customers that use the service and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know that doesn't seem unreasonable basically they're going after they're trying to protect  their network though i mean i don't like the idea of going after bit torrent necessarily but if  somebody is really a hog if you're using more than eight megabytes eight gigabytes a day  shouldn't you i mean don't aren't you eating all of that bandwidth at the expense of everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  else on the network well that they've spent they've spent lots and lots of money for lots  of lots of servers that do nothing but allocate and control bandwidth i know those sand fine i know  there's a really there's a really funny hack out there that that people there's one particular  guy's like you got to show people how to hack their cable modem because it basically takes the cap  off of your connection the problem is is it's almost instantly detectable  servers and then the first thing they do is they basically ban you forever from using

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bye-bye comcast services you will get disconnected after four letters for you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  whatever happens internet too wasn't that space to like save us yeah no that's only for educational

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  systems and it is running yeah it's saving universities so they don't have to soil themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with our bits well it's it's yeah i mean the the problem will is that basically you have a  huge amount invested in infrastructure and companies like at and t who have a lot of money  basically it's it's it's more profitable for them to not upgrade their system and to not deliver  the bandwidth that customers think they're getting i mean the funniest conversation you can get into  is with an at and t rep you know at the corporate level you know when they're like well nobody  anticipated anybody would using you know x megabits per second continuously it's like okay so nobody  you know the you know the next thing you know at and t is talking about how basically if you want  to actually use your bandwidth for more than say a 15k page at a pop you know if they they cannot  afford the infrastructure i'll have to go to a professional account i'll tell you i'll tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  why i care about this if you watch my five hours of day of video streaming it's a couple of gigabytes  right so those of us who create content that eats up bandwidth how about this for an idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  substitute quality content for just a picture of you sitting there watching the television set

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i plan to it is not you are the one who said i'm going to do the perillo thing i am not going to  sit there i am going to put out quality content  25 hours a week of quality content that's 12 and a half gigabytes a week how can you what are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think so let's do it get you back on cranky geeks no no i'm too busy there you have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hey i watched it you know rob enterlee was very impressive i thought he did a very good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so arena slew sky rob enterlee sebastian and you and that was a good show i enjoyed it  cranky geeks dot tv right yeah cranky geeks dot com actually com sorry so let me get back to  comcast the other thing they did which i think is really uh interesting is a core again this is a  source this is a dsl reports this is not official but they are going to start paying attention to  these dmca letters up to now you know the the record industry sends these letters saying you  know uh to they they contact your isp they say this guy's downloading all this stuff  and the isp sends you a letter up to now apparently i didn't know this comcast hasn't been  tracking the dmc late they say eight letters they just forwarded along and they don't even pay  attention so now after four letters you're going to lose your account in four letters in a month  you lose your in a year i'm sorry you lose your account so that's i didn't realize this but  according to this guy they haven't been enforcing these they've just been that's an idea then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how about let's just take a group of us and spread us around and then send in these complaint letters  to people we don't like whether they're doing any violations at all or not and get them the  four letters and they get cut off and then we do the same thing with a tnt and then it would take

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the person completely off the net how long you think before somebody does that to me  well now that i mention it probably thanks john so i got the burst by the way the comcast burst  i have a business class account it's it's when i go to speedtest.net 22 megabits down three megabits  up but it's burst remember so it slows down on the downstream after a while you don't get continuous  22 megs but it's still pretty fast i mean i was i've been able to download uh well the godfather  that's a good example all three movies in oh wait a minute did i say that in just a matter of hours  letter number one no i'm not i'm not using it to download movies i'm using it to  to stream and all that stuff but it's a business account so they can't give me a hard time on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because we have five people using it so you have a business account what does that cost a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  100 160 a month yeah you pay more 160 a month kind of high that's actually pretty cheap for a  business account for 22 megabits down three megabits up it's great i'm happy yeah no i mean  compared to like what at&t yeah and includes tv i get cnn too  oh well yeah well yeah okay so the comcast cares guy now has at this before we uh before this  podcast goes out has 906 followers let's see how long that account stays open he'll keep it open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the guy's right he's one of those guys i don't think he's going to answer anything in real time  because i think he was one of those guys because i get all the my correspondence with him on over  twitter was all after midnight he's like one of those you know is frank aliason from comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  customer outreach fake name you think that's his real name yeah well frank i think is that's pretty  cool it's very cool i think more companies should do that that's a great idea no and in fact there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  may be companies on twitter that do it i'm not sure it might be somebody just mentioned it to me  and said go to you know send the you know complaint instead of complaining to us your  followers complain to this guy you know kind of thing steve gilmore says he's listening and he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  map i don't get anything they're going to bloggers instead because bloggers are more effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no no because bloggers will do what they say oh yeah they're less selective yeah no boy  somebody's giving me some attention i'm a blogger right it's not even that they're less selective

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a lot of cases and there's there's actually they're lonely well i mean first of all there's a  lot of highly critical bloggers that do some pretty good investigation but there's a lot of  blogs that basically just repost press releases right you know and that's i think that's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an effective strategy i'm sure that's you know from an evolutionary point of view that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's happening because it works well but the thing is is it's it's not you know what i mean  it's not evolutionary and it's not new and it's not a new complaint i mean you know having  effective basically the whole point of hiring a good pr company is knowing that they will have  excellent relationships with people who are in your targeted demographic people you're looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for the last pr person i spoke i don't i don't talk to pr at all the last pr person i talked to  is amy critchett remember her from tech tv she was our web web woman she's now doing  pr for louis rosetto the guy who started wired magazine you know louis's new venture is chocolate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know i'm bigger than i should be they don't know i wouldn't say you got 25 hours to with a lot some

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  box openings they go big on engaging gizmodo see because i don't i don't accept stuff so that's  part one i don't talk to vendors because i don't you know i don't want to do that i did have i did  have dinner with an advertiser on thursday full disclosure with a radio show advertiser but you  kind of have to do that right i mean that's kind of part of the deal but there's only five of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so they're paying you for the advertising opportunity i don't think having dinner with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is going to be i don't think it's actually he was he was the ceo of e-set nod 32 he's a theoretical  physicist he's from he's from slovakia his expertise is in hyper superconduct superconducting  right he's he's writing he's doing we're gonna paper on a unified field i can't talk all the  chocolate got me a little stone on a unified theory of of superconducting and he's got an  interesting business plan get this he believes there's no there's no proof of this yet but  his models lead him to believe that it's possible to do superconducting at you know right now it's  at very very very low temperatures but if you could do it at normal temperatures at of course  huge breakthroughs technologically and all sorts of things he believes it's possible but the question  is you've got to find the material and it's almost like a seti at home thing i mean there's just a  lot of analysis you have to go through a lot of materials look at their structure to see which  will work but he's basically forming a company to do this to to try to find this material and it's  kind of one of it's like a lottery if they find it huge but there's no proof it exists he believes  it exists kind of interesting cool i mean this is this is this is a guy so that was a good see i  didn't mind that dinner he also explained to me why elephants have big ears and i thought that was  fascinating you don't get out enough i don't i don't do you know i don't like those dinners  i don't like to do that i'm very shy anything you're actually you know even though you're  outgoing and affable i think you're a hermit i am that's why i built this studio i never need  leave here again i want people to come to me but no pr no vendors don't call me  but you know there is it's interesting because there is some power in all this  and i don't think i think it's so non-traditional that um you're right i think pr companies don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even get it oh they don't companies get it a lot they don't get it i agree with you leo well if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they got it i would think they'd be all over me but i don't i don't you know i'm not i'm true  i'm hesitant to say this except that they don't listen to twit either so they don't listen to  twit they don't have a clue thank goodness so has anybody got patrick for texilla did you get the  si star yet the mac clone are you going to get one of those uh no i'm not really going to bother

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because i don't expect them to be available for very long i'm surprised that apple hasn't crushed  them and it's also i mean basically they're taking a white box they are taking an openly available

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  free hack to uh uh the the uh the ef5 the hackintosh yeah we're going to build one on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the uh which is freely available the guy that wrote the hack is pissed off because it's not  supposed to be commercially redistributed which is si star is doing so that's apple will sue him  the the guy doing the hack could sue him but he's not going to because god knows what would happen  then um and three um you cannot reinstall the uh you cannot reinstall the operating system they  basically pre-install os 10 on it they according to the the unboxings i've read like in gadget had  somebody doing one and uh linked to somebody doing one you can't reinstall the operating system yet  because they haven't figured out how to do an end user friendly reinstallation so if anything  happens to the os you need to reinstall apparently you're going to have to do something special they  have a workaround but they don't ship anything in the box right that will allow you to reinstall

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the operating system plus you have to be very careful about system updates you can't just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  willy-nilly install those it just seems like a great way to save a couple hundred bucks on a mac  instead of just you know i mean it's like why a mac why yeah buy a mac but it's like you lose the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  whole thing like the fantastic thing you know it's like buying i don't know i'm trying to  struggle to think a really good analogy but it seems like for the sake of saving it's like  refining your own losing the entire point of the macintosh platform which is like exactly look good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right no i don't i don't well i don't know it's i think it's like buying a sports car and taking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the engine out and putting it in like a beaten up old pickup or something there you go that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  very i think that's the analogy that's it right there but you saved a couple hundred bucks  yeah yeah it's somebody in our twit forums has one and he's talking about we have a we have a  forums for people who donate to twit even if you donate a buck you can get in twit.tv slash  forums and there's a guy in there and he's talking about it you know he has a mac he has a laptop  it's not that he doesn't have a mac it's just kind of an it's interesting but boy the limitations  are very severe just so much like you can't reinstall you can't download updates i mean it  just seems like not a great idea it's just amazing he does say it's faster it's noisier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he says it's faster noisier is no good faster than his iMac the problem the problem is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is the efi firmware right that apple ships they can't control the fans well it amazes me that  um you know efi is being touted by intel as the next big kind of like system upgrade for  like the last two years now i mean how old is the bios right i mean the bios is as old as you know  they kick anybody to use it god you know 15 20 years yeah and efi is long overdue to hit the  mainstream and once that efi does hit the mainstream then you'll be able to install you know mac  on it really simply because the problem that you get on the sidestart boxes is the kind of efi  emulator that you have to have but it still amazes me that efi hasn't caught up still

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the i agree with you that efi should have caught on faster but it's like if it works don't fix it  but saying that you'll be able to install mac os 10 on anything is is once the efi becomes more  common that i got to disagree with because they're just going to continue to to put you know  basically software switches inside the interface that'll make it more difficult to run the operating  system i mean it's going to be apple unless apple does a serious about face when running their  software on non mac platforms it's always going to be a wicked rip and pain to get it to run on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  invited that he's wrong i'm not skewering him i'm just saying he's wrong what is he wrong about  he's wrong about the about the youtube lawsuit i think he's barking up the wrong tree biocom  suing youtube for basically saying that you know he's trying to associate youtube two-minute video  clips with this was people stealing entire movies right and i don't see it as being the same at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i think one is fair use and one's not and that aside isn't it valuable isn't a valuable promotion

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all redstone is saying but even if it does i get to do it not you yeah and he's saying he's right  i mean he's legally right of course he can say that but is that a boneheaded thing or what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i don't know not necessarily i think it's bonehead i mean this is like those non-disclosures that all  these people sign off on you know sometimes i could look at what microsoft or somebody's going to do  i don't sign these things by the way but i could and i could look at it and say well you know if i  written it up in my column a couple of days before you're supposed to roll it out i bet you would do  your world a good you know they may have some really elaborate marketing scheme that they want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to and we've seen they're really elaborate look at he should be down on his knees he should be down  on his knees thanking the people who made you know who made john stewart a hit because they posted  his clips on youtube he should be grateful not saying it was my job he was a hit before people  started posting all right well saturday night live which is not i know understand a via comp  production but there you could point to a lot of shows the office was a flop until people started  pirating and everybody saw and said oh wow this is a good show uh saturday to bring it back to the
