A little tough getting people on the show today because it turns out,  there's a football game going on or something like that.  And John said, no, I can't.  And on and on.  But so what we figured out is, oh, if we get people who speak French,  they won't care.  So Miriam Jouard is here.  Of course, we love Miriam.  Long time a friend of the show and she's currently working at Pebble.  But before that and in Gadget and is an expert on mobile communications and from Montreal, right?  Quebec.  I know you're in the city now.

I did not realize that.  You don't say a boot.  Not as much anymore.  You know, I think it's I still have a bit of a French accent and a bit of a German because  my mom is German and German as well.  And then I got a possibly a little bit of Canadian, but I've lived in the US for, you  know, pretty much like 12 years now.  So I think the California English took over.  You sound French.

Transcript:  Also from Paris, France, Patrick, not Patrick on the Twitter and a multilingual podcaster  and a regular also on the network.  So thank you both of you for being here this week.  It's nice to have you both.  I did.  Either of you watch the president's address on Friday.  I'm just curious.  I don't.  I wonder if there was a great watch it.  But I read about it.  Yeah.

Start time: 253.77

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watched our own press conference.  I watched our own president's address who had to sidestep questions about, you know,  his affairs and scooters and stuff like that.  So that was very entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in France, they're talking about his love life.  And in the US, we're talking about our spying life.  But they combine beautifully because we've been spying on his love life.  So it's President Obama took to the podium to talk about, of course, the NSA spying and  did, in fact, say, you know what, we want to strike a balance between our surveillance  policies and civil liberties.  The NSA, of course, is collecting and it has admitted to, I guess at this point it's accepted,  has been collecting all the phone data of every call going on in the United States illegally.  All the things.  All the things.  So he addressed that saying not that the program would end, but that this actually worries me.  The information that the NSA collects will no longer be held by the NSA, that they will  have to go through the federal FISA court to get access to the materials.  In other words, they have to go to a judge, say, this is what we want.  This is why we want it.  I don't know.  Did he propose?

Start time: 342.12
End time: 348.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he didn't propose anything.  He just said, no, we're not.  They're not going to be holding the data anymore.

Start time: 349.02
End time: 353.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, who are they going to give it to?  Target?  I mean, what?  I don't understand why this is better.  Well, we don't know.

Start time: 354.02
End time: 383.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can only speculate.  It's either the telecom companies that are going to hold them or a third party.  Oh, yeah.  Good luck with that.  Yeah.  That's going to be...  But you know, the thing that...  That's my first rant of the show.  There might be another one.  But the thing that's really mind-boggling, there are two things.  First, he talked about phone metadata, which is important for sure.  That's what they're collecting.  They're collecting who's calling whom when dropped calls.

Start time: 384.56
End time: 409.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And dropped calls, missed calls, wrong numbers.  Apparently, they're collecting texts and other things as well.  But mostly, it's focusing not on content but on transactions.  Exactly.  And they're saying, I think somewhat disingenuously, oh, that metadata...  It's just metadata.  Don't worry about it.  But everybody who's in our business knows that that data is extraordinarily valuable  and, in fact, can tell them all sorts of stuff that invades our privacy.

Start time: 410.29
End time: 479.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course.  Yeah.  He addressed this.  He also said that there will be better representation of public interest on the FISA Court,  which is important, but only in cases when new questions of new technology would arise.  So when there's something new they haven't ruled on before,  there would be some public interest representation.  So that's good as well, but it's not as good as having public representation, period.  And he also reduced the number of hops for that metadata that validates your collection.  So you can only now collect metadata on someone two connections away  from the person you suspect is doing illegal activity.  And before it was three hops.  So that's a little bit better.  But what was not addressed at all was the question of...  That really blew up was the question of PRISM and the NSA collecting data from, well, the internet.  That was not even mentioned from what I understand.

Start time: 480.36
End time: 529.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, in fact, this is the stuff they're getting from the telcos.  The telcos say, we don't want to have to hold on to this.  The president says that the attorney general and the director of the national intelligence  will have to come up with a plan by March 28th.  Do remember that the law that authorizes this bulk collection, it is legal, expires next year.  And pretty much everyone agrees that after the revelations of Edward Snowden, it's not going to get renewed.  But there's the other side of this, which is that no one wants to be the person who said...  In fact, it's interesting to watch members of the U.S. Congress talking about this on television this morning.  Nobody wants to be the one who said, oh, let's stop collecting this.  And then there's a terrorist attack.  Of course.  And they're on the hook for this.  And that's why this is so difficult.

Start time: 531.33
End time: 569.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, it seems to me like basically Obama just...  I don't think he really said anything, actually.  I mean, you know damn well that the NSA can do whatever they want.  Like we have no proof whatsoever that they're not going to continue hanging on to this data and do anything.  And so I have a hard time believing any of this.  I think it's just a political move saying we acknowledge that there's something going on that is bothering you, the people.  And we're going to look into it and do something about it.  But I really don't think... I think I don't think it's going to happen.  I don't think they're going to do anything about it.

Start time: 570.06
End time: 611.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also now clear that much of this information is shared with, for instance, the British GCHQ.  And they have no restrictions on how they can use it.  Exactly.  And there's also... And the reason this is a tech story, besides the fact that it's about stuff happening on the internet,  is that American technology companies are really devastated by this because no one wants to buy American gear anymore.  Because the presumption is that it's just giving the spies a beachhead in your business.  So it's really a disaster for Silicon Valley among all the other implications.  This is a big story for technology, I think.  Yeah.

Start time: 613.22
End time: 615.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Miriam.

Start time: 616.81
End time: 648.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say, yeah, I think if there's any good to come out of this,  it's going to be that the very strong Silicon Valley companies are going to get together.  Finally, they have an enemy besides each other.  And maybe lobby. I mean, they have been kind of anti-lobby.  And I hate lobbies. I just think the whole thing is screwed up.  But this seems to be the way the government operates in the US.  And so perhaps they can lobby in another way.  And this ties into the other big thing that's been going on, which I think is a very big deal, is the net neutrality stuff.

Start time: 649.00
End time: 652.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we will get to that too, believe me. There's a lot to talk about.

Start time: 653.95
End time: 655.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That will be probably my second.

Start time: 655.32
End time: 658.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a feeling that's what you were going to talk about.

Start time: 659.41
End time: 702.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, I'm not as cynical as you, Miriam.  I think that the things that Obama did address were kind of addressed in the proper direction.  Certainly, there's no... he wasn't going to let up on everything.  What worries me is what he didn't talk about at all.  And if you say, you know, the NSA is going to be doing whatever they want anyway,  then there's no point legislating anyway.  So maybe I understand the feeling, but I think it might be a little bit extreme.  That being said, supporting your view is that story that congressional reps had to ask Bruce Schneider...  Bruce Schneider, yeah.  ...what the NSA is doing, because the NSA won't tell them.

Start time: 703.20
End time: 780.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Bruce Schneider, who's the greatest security blogger of them all, we just love everybody.  He's been on this show. Everybody loves Bruce Schneider.  Congress says, could you tell us? Because we don't... the NSA is not talking to us.  That's really where the failure is.  I recognize that in order to be secure, we need to do something.  I mean, after 9-11, there was absolutely a mandate from the American people,  as well as the government, for these spy agencies to get going and protect us from future attacks.  And I understand the need for that.  Of course, the acknowledgement was we can't tell the American people what we're doing,  but by law, we need to tell Congress, we need to inform Congress,  and they need to, on behalf of the American people, have oversight of what we're doing.  And that's where it's really fallen apart. There is no oversight.  And there has to be a way to balance the safety.  Now, I admit this is a very American point of view.  One of the reasons I like having you guys on this show is that from the very American point of view,  we want to protect ourselves against terrorist attacks.  But ask Chancellor Merkel of Germany how she feels about it,  because in that process, we're listening in on her cell phone calls.

Start time: 781.16
End time: 798.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was interesting. One of the other things he said was,  we're going to stop listening to foreign leaders.  About time!  Right? But he also said that non-U.S. persons would be afforded the same rights as U.S. persons,  which, you know, apparently they're spying on Americans anyway, so I'm not sure what that does.

Start time: 799.74
End time: 802.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get the same right to be spied on. Congratulations!

Start time: 803.08
End time: 862.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I wonder if let's, I'm going to try and get out of my comfort zone or my camp for a second.  And is there a chance that these things, all this spying, is actually getting them results,  and they have stopped attacks, and they actually can't communicate on that?  And, you know, Obama did say success goes unmentioned and failure could be catastrophic,  and the success goes unmentioned is kind of important there.  It's obvious, but maybe they are actually, they see the results of these actions,  and they just can't talk about it, and maybe in 50 years,  we're going to have declassified documents that are going to show that, you know,  three attacks were stopped in the last 10 years, and Obama is seeing those things,  and he has to just take it and take the public opinion being very much against him,  and saying, you know what, we have to do it, and that's the way it is.

Start time: 863.52
End time: 873.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did Francois Harlan, in his press conference, did the Prime Minister of France talk at all about this,  and about the US spying on France, and what his reaction is?

Start time: 875.21
End time: 917.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, I can't remember. I'm not sure he...  He's busy with his own scandal.  No, well, obviously he tried to do, he's busy with his approval rating,  which is the lowest that anyone has ever had in the country.  He was in the teens, and now it's a little bit above,  but he's trying to get the economy back up.  But yeah, it did make a little bit of a stink, but it's sort of forgotten now,  especially because the government had to pass a set of laws which were controversial in their own right in France,  and that were kind of in the same vein as what we've seen in the US.  So I don't think he wants to bring too much attention to that again.

Start time: 919.39
End time: 923.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he must be gratified by the fact that we've decided not to spy on him anymore.  Yeah, I'm sure he is.

Start time: 925.96
End time: 981.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe there's one last thing I wanted to mention on this topic,  and it's sort of the contradiction of them, and then it's the forever them, they,  basically the government and the NSA saying what Snowden did was wrong,  and we are not doing anything wrong.  And now, obviously, Obama had to announce some pretty number of changes because of these revelations.  So I'm wondering how they can hold that dichotomy in their arguments of,  you know, if actually he did reveal secrets that if what he revealed was not,  there wasn't anything wrong in this, why are they now changing it to much acclaim?  That's something that I haven't seen addressed anywhere, which is...

Start time: 982.26
End time: 990.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snowden is a traitor. We don't want to talk about this.  We did nothing wrong to, okay, we should talk about this.  Yes, we did something wrong, but Snowden, he's still a traitor.

Start time: 992.18
End time: 1004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, see, my biggest problem, my whole approach on this is that perhaps if we didn't go out there,  fight wars and piss people off, they wouldn't try to terrorize us,  and then we wouldn't have to do all this.

Start time: 1005.46
End time: 1008.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's a much larger conversation about why terrorism happens.

Start time: 1010.08
End time: 1070.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But my point is right now the NSA is doing stuff against US citizens,  Canadians and French people like me and Patrick and like people all over the world  that are just completely insane.  I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with the big hacker conference that takes place between New York and New Year's  every year in Germany, and this year was in Hamburg,  and I watched Jacob Applebaum's talk for an hour, and it's very technical,  but it outlines some of the crazy ass malware and other virus-like activity  that the NSA is putting into people's computers, sometimes at the hardware level.  And to me, that is just unacceptable.  Like that just goes beyond, I mean, as you said earlier, it threatens our economy,  and I still believe in competition, I still believe in people making money,  and I think that this is a big issue.  This is a much bigger issue, I think, than maybe we got some results.

Start time: 1072.04
End time: 1097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Applebaum was talking at the Chaos Computer Conference about all of these NSA ant-spying things.  Der Spiegel then did the full article, and we've talked about that quite a bit.  50-page catalog of things you can buy from the NSA.  Those, you know what, those don't bother me as much, Miriam, because those are targeted.  Exactly.  Those are, we want to find out what this bad guy is up to so we have a technology.

Start time: 1097.98
End time: 1101.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how do you know they don't use that against people that you know you're not targeted?

Start time: 1103.15
End time: 1116.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, but you never know.  Since James Bond has been using little microphone pens,  you've never known if he wasn't using to spy on people he shouldn't be spying on.  So there's two different arguments there.

Start time: 1117.97
End time: 1163.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One is that we shouldn't be doing any of this at all,  and I think that that's an extreme that a lot of Americans wouldn't support.  They want to be protected a little bit.  So they don't want to take away all of law enforcement's tools.  In fact, we're happy that law enforcement has some tools,  so if there is an al-Qaeda operative in the United States, we can capture him.  But on the other hand, the NSA has gone far beyond that to collect data  about every single American citizen, well beyond what their charter allows them to do.  And I don't think there's any argument that that's going too far.  So you can argue, Miriam, oh, we shouldn't, you know, we've created...  We've created terrorist states, and certainly can make that argument.  At this point, we've got some bad guys out there, bad actors.  They're not going away. I don't know, you know...

Start time: 1164.00
End time: 1173.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. I agree with you, but what I'm saying is that I'm concerned that the NSA  is actually actively withholding bugs in commercial code backdoors it.

Start time: 1174.14
End time: 1175.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we know that.

Start time: 1177.33
End time: 1198.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The conference I thought you were talking about, the RSA conference is coming up.  A lot of people have said, we're not going to the RSA conference  because it was revealed that the NSA paid RSA $10 million to put subverted encryption code out  and recommend it, code that gives a backdoor to the NSA.  So you're absolutely right.

Start time: 1199.00
End time: 1217.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the kind of problems I have.  Like this is, you know, to me it's like, it's a technology problem.  It's not just a political problem.  It's that we have technologies being screwed with, basically.  And by that, Silicon Valley and the entrepreneurship and the capitalism that happens around technology  is being screwed with by this, majorly, I think.

Start time: 1218.42
End time: 1240.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's the blowback.  And that's, of course, you ask Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, all these companies.  That's Cisco.  A lot of the targets of these ant protocols were Cisco routers.  You know, there's blowback. It really, really hurts us.  But I don't think the answer is completely obvious, or do you?  No, I don't.  I think it's difficult.

Start time: 1241.72
End time: 1255.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing I will say is that on the topic of Americans going to war and pissing people off,  my country, having been a recipient of the Americans' help, I will probably abstain from commenting on it.

End time: 1300.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's so hard.  I don't really know what the answer is.  Let's talk about the rules of the road for the Internet and net neutrality.  Some people this week said it's dead.  Well, maybe not.  We'll find out about that and we'll give Patrick a chance to rail on over this.  Google buys Nest.  AOL kills Patch.  A big firing at Yahoo.  Lots more to talk about in just a little bit.  We've got a great cast of non-football lovers on the show today.  Miriam Jouard from Pebble, getpebble.com.

Like the Galaxy S5 will probably be announced there, all the new phones.  And it really has become the show.  Plus, it's in Barcelona.  But maybe we'll send Mike Elgin.  I can't go.  I wish I could.  I'd love to.  But if you're going to be there, well, please call us and tell us what's going on.  Yeah, absolutely.  Be our eyes and ears at the Mobile World Congress.  Patrick, do you go?  I mean, it's just down the road a piece.

Transcript:  I think Mobile World Congress is more about business.  You know, you go there to to discuss partnerships, to to work out deals.  All the big deals you see happening later in the year are gelled at Mobile World Congress.  Oh, that's interesting.  So that's why it's very important to be there, because you kind of hear some interesting stories and rumors and see.  And meet some interesting people.  I when I was at Engadget, obviously, you know, there are news, but nobody's launching big things anymore.  You know, they launch kind of second tier things at Mobile World Congress.  All the big tier devices are now the first tier devices are launched separately with their own events.  You know, there'll be an event for the Galaxy S5 at some point.  And HTC will have something for their phone, et cetera.  I think but I think where Mobile World Congress shines is, you know, like if you're a company like us, Pebble,  and you want to have discussions and meetings with people, this is where you want to be.  Because this is where everybody is.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 1409.27

Transcript:  But the big I agree with you.  Trade shows now are not as appealing to the big companies.  Apple left, Microsoft left CES because they can do it themselves.  What do they need? What do they?  They don't want to be in the mass of announcements.  They want to have their own attention.  We'll talk about that. In fact, I haven't asked you guys.  I'd love to know what you thought of CES.  But before we do that, let's talk about getting out of the post office.  Why should you be going to the post office?  You know, postage rates are going up.  That means there's going to be a traffic jam.  Everybody's going to go to buy stamps except for you because you don't need to buy stamps because you print your own stamps.  That doesn't even sound legal.  But it is. It's not.  We're talking about stamps.com.  You literally can buy, print and use legal U.S. postage with your computer, your printer.  You don't need a special postage meter, a special link.  You just need stamps.com.  It's not just buying postage.  Stamps.com does everything you'd need to do at the post office right from your desk.  The rates are automatically updated.  I've been told that some postage meters charge you to update the rates.  I don't know how they get away with this.  Not stamps.com.  You never have to go to the post office.  They were just included, by the way.  Congratulations.  In Software Magazine's annual 500 list, top software companies.  Stamps.com, we've been using it here for years to print our own postage, to print right on the envelopes.  So if you do mail out bills or flyers at your business, it'll take the data from your QuickBooks or from your address book,  automatically add the return address, your company logo and the postage, print it right on the envelope.  If you're mailing packages, use that USB scale. It's awesome.  You plot the package on there, automatically prints the mailing label.  If you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon or PayPal or any of those sites,  stamps.com will do all your printouts for you automatically.  It pulls the address from the website.  Even if you're using a Priority Mail or Express Mail, it'll send out a confirmation email to the recipient automatically.  It is true fulfillment. It turns you into a fulfillment house.  Now, if you visit stamps.com, you'll see an $80 no-risk trial on the front page.  But don't do that.  Click the microphone that's on the upper right-hand corner and use our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T.  And instead you'll get a $110 bonus value, including $55 in free postage you can use over the first few months of your account.  We'll send you that digital scale. You just pay shipping and hailing. I think it's like five bucks.  There's a $5 supply kit to make up for that.  And of course, a four-week free trial of stamps.com.  Stamps.com. Use the offer code TWIT and stop going to the post office today.  What did you think, guys? Did you see anything at CES that was of any interest?  Were you there for Pebble? Because Pebble made the steel announcement there, right?

Transcript:  Well, you know, that's what my thing was. I was very busy with pimping Pebble and Pebble Steel.

Start time: 1577.16
End time: 1583.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how is that for you? Because last year you went as Engadget, so you were covering everything.  This year, did you have to stay at the Pebble booth?

Start time: 1584.42
End time: 1606.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we didn't have a booth. We had a suite with invitation only kind of thing.  We obviously briefed the big media, the big important ones, you know, all the... I mean, it's hard.  That's one thing I discovered. It's hard to pick and choose who you can brief ahead of time, ahead of your launch,  because you only have so much time and so many time slots to do so.

Start time: 1606.58
End time: 1619.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do you do that? Because, I mean, I do see some discrepancies.  A lot of times new media like us or websites don't get the attention that old media like Wall Street Journal or USA Today gets.  I'm sure you're more savvy than that in that respect.

Start time: 1620.80
End time: 1653.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been trying, you know, I try to prioritize the ones that I know will have the most impact.  That's the key, isn't it?  Directly. And then, you know, immediately after the announcement, we, you know, so there were kind of three tiers,  you know, the people we briefed ahead of time, the people that got an embargo but didn't get briefed,  and then the people who got it afterwards.  And afterwards meant that a lot of people just kind of reached out to us and say, hey, we want to take pictures and see it and play with it.  And so I had to kind of like from Monday onward basically accommodate all these folks till Friday.  It was a lot of work. It was very exciting.

Transcript:  It's got to be a very different experience of CES, though. You flipped sides.

Start time: 1658.30
End time: 1716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was. But you know what's cool is that I still got invited to a lot of the press conferences and I managed to actually go to one of them.  I didn't just had enough time for one. And it was the T-Mobile press conference, which I live tweeted.  Boy, John Legere, what a character he is.  I know. I mean, the guy is amazing. So I live tweeted.  I had a DSLR plugged into my laptop and I would take pictures and they would go get resized and watermarked and sent out to the Internet on Twitter live.  And basically between me and The Verge, we became the two live feeds of T-Mobile's press conference because people really loved it, apparently.  I know we weren't the only ones live blogging, but apparently they liked our pictures the most.  So that was a very rewarding experience. I got to play journalists for a bit and I got to get John Legere say to me live on stage that I could have anything I wanted.  So I'm going to take him up on this somehow now.

Start time: 1717.23

Transcript:  Did he say, Miriam Jouard, you can have anything you want?

Start time: 1720.58
End time: 1756.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, what happened was, you know, he actually, it was my birthday that day and he wished me happy birthday before the press conference.  And at the press conference, I was the first person to ask a question at the Q&A.  And I said to him, all this is fantastic, but I've been a T-Mobile customer since the voice stream days.  So what kind of awesome thing can you do for me?  Like, obviously I'm very happy, but like, you're making a lot of people switch now.  And what do you have in store for me? And he answered the question.  And then at the end he says, besides, you know, for you, you can have anything you want.  So I was like, now I need to try and take him up on this because he said it live.

Start time: 1757.02
End time: 1802.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's, you know, so he was the CEO, I think, of Global Crossing, button down, crew cut practically.  And all of a sudden he's like the anti-CEO. He's got long hair. He's got a mullet for crying out loud.  And a leather jacket.  A leather jacket. They actually, the Washington Post said basically he's become a troll.  Oh yeah, he totally trolls other CEOs.  He trolls the other CEOs.  That's awesome.  You know, on Wednesday at CES he was wearing a t-shirt that talked about him crash.  He crashed the AT&T event and had to get, got thrown out.  Is this an act he's playing or is this the real John Ledger?  By the way, I pronounce it Legere, but it's Ledger.

Start time: 1803.02
End time: 1808.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me too. I always said Legere and now I have to correct myself because I actually heard him say his own name.  Yes, Ledger.

Start time: 1809.24
End time: 1812.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he has a t-shirt that says, I just wanted to hear Macklemore.

Start time: 1813.00
End time: 1842.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean he's very savvy at marketing basically.  You know, he took the opportunity. I'm pretty sure he crashed this on purpose for the publicity.  He wanted to get thrown out.  He was invited by Macklemore's agent. So it's not like he was there just crashing it.  He was actually legitimately there. And I don't think AT&T handled that very well.  I mean, come on. Like seriously, you just, it's a, you know, this is how you deal with competition.  You're all friends and you know, you make the best of it.  I'm sure he was well behaved.

Start time: 1843.08
End time: 1847.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweets. Is it him? Do you think that's tweeting?  Oh yeah.  It's not his people.

Start time: 1848.81
End time: 1863.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. He, he, no. He's real.  He's also obsessed with Batman.  Do you know this?  No.  Seriously, he's completely obsessed with Batman.  That would explain his Twitter background.  Making fun of other carriers and Batman when you read his Twitter feed.

Start time: 1864.90
End time: 1868.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has to be him. This can't be any corporate shill because it's just too, it's too real.

Start time: 1869.26
End time: 1894.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the guy just decided, you know what?  Let's go, let's roll with this and see how far we can go.  And it's working, you know?  And, and so, so that was a big deal.  Like the Macklemore, you know, the, him getting kicked out of AT&T and then the press conference.  So I'm glad I was able to attend as a journalist for that.  And then the other big deal was, you know, the guy walking off on stage at the Samsung conference.  Michael Bay.

Start time: 1895.00
End time: 1896.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1897.20
End time: 1903.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what CES has come down to now.  Screw the technology.  It's all about social media and circus.  It's a circus.

Start time: 1904.49
End time: 1909.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a circus.  It's been a circus for a long time.  Yeah, I'd agree.  Patrick, you didn't go to CES, did you?

Start time: 1911.07
End time: 1961.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  But I mean, I have to say, CES has not been super exciting for a long time.  But I think this time was a little bit more, I mean, except for the, the Michael Bay thing,  which was both hilarious and super cringe worthy at the same time.  But apart from that, there were a few things that were, I couldn't say what specifically,  but the Internet of Things and wearable computing seemed like they were getting a little bit more real  and a little bit more accessible.  We're not quite there yet, but I think this is, this CES was really the time where we're starting to see  that this is not just a sort of buzzword that dies after a couple of months.

Start time: 1961.58
End time: 2005.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably the one thing Comdex before CES and now CES, the big trade shows are good for,  is seeing the manifestation.  I remember, you know, convergence was the watchword for 10 years.  And finally, you started to see it at CES a few years ago with a convergence of digital technology  and television in Hollywood.  The idea of tablets, you first saw tablets at CES at Comdex 10 years ago with Microsoft  and it slowly evolved and you could see that happening.  And you knew when it was really taking off because it became the issue.  Ebook readers at CES three years ago, everybody had an ebook reader.  And so this year it's wearable tech, you're in good position for that, Miriam.  It's wearable tech and the Internet of Things.

Start time: 2006.06
End time: 2043.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems so.  And obviously it's probably going to keep evolving and the things that we're going to be,  if it actually takes off, the things that we're going to be seeing in two, three years  are probably going to be a little bit different from what we're seeing at CES,  but just in the same way that the actual tablets we're all using now are different from the ones  that we were seeing 10 years ago.  So I think, you know, and also there were a bunch of French companies that were doing some,  that were presenting things, you know, essential Internet of Things items  like the connected toothbrush and...

Start time: 2044.00
End time: 2047.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2048.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are things like the...

Start time: 2051.56
End time: 2074.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's kind of the point I'm making is you don't see, you just can see that it's going to happen  because everybody's throwing stuff up against the wall that are in most cases dumb and stupid.  Like remember the Kobo and all those readers we saw a few years ago,  but you knew, well, this must be a big thing because everybody's trying it.  And everybody had watches, Internet connected, everything, refrigerators, toothbrushes.

Start time: 2075.00
End time: 2172.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one that was actually pretty interesting in the concept.  A friend of mine, another French podcaster, alerted me to it.  It was a mother by a company called Sense.  It's a French company as well.  The guys who did the Navistag connected...  Oh yeah, I liked the Navistag. That was fun.  Yeah.  And so it's a base station with, I can't remember, like maybe up to 20 little sensors that are,  they're called cookies.  They're tiny sensors, very flat and like this, they're colored.  And you can put them and use them anywhere.  And they're going to be interpreting the data depending on where you put them.  So you could put one in your kid's backpack and you know where they are.  You could put one, for example, on your fridge door  and you would know how many times things are being opened or on your coffee machine.  And it knows how many times you've had coffee.  And then you also have one, for example, under your bed.  So it knows if you sleep well or not.  And then it can correlate the data and tell you, you know what,  these five days over the last month where you didn't sleep very well,  you also had a coffee two hours before you went to sleep.  So now, obviously, that's an obvious one.  But you know, it's the kind of self, I can't remember the word, sorry.  Quantified self, we call it.  Quantified self, thank you.  And by having all of that data, we can learn more about everything we do and maybe make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can try. I'm sure you can try.  My takeaway from CS was it's always nice to see people in person.  And for that alone, trade shows are really awesome.  And then the other thing was, I mean, I feel the same way as you.  I didn't really see anything that blew my mind.  I mean, it was obviously a very good CS for us, but I worked really hard to make that happen.  And then, you know, the TVs, those curved TVs are pretty gorgeous.  I mean, you know, of course, they're very expensive.  They always start out very expensive.  You know, I have one.  But eventually they trickle down.  You know I own one.  You have a curved one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was very excited.  I went to the show floor for about, oh, half an hour, is about the amount of time I spent on the show floor.  And they had this, at the LG booth, this gigantic washing machine, fake washing machine.  And everybody was getting their picture taken in front of it.  That was the shit.  That's how excited I got about things at CES.  What?  I know.  Why?  The giant washing machine?  Because it looked like, you know, they were trying to sell some kind of smart washing machine, connected washing machine, whatever.  And they had this gigantic one where you could basically, it was an invitation to make fun of things.

Start time: 2266.84
End time: 2325.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you, so the big, really the big story didn't happen at CES was Google buying the Nest company.  Tony Fidel, of course, former Apple vice president who oversaw the production of the iPod.  People say he designed the iPod.  He did not design the iPod.  However, he hired about 100 great designers from Apple and other places.  The Nest is beautiful.  It's got intelligence.  It knows when you're home.  It is on the Wi-Fi, so it can also tell what the weather is.  And it supposedly, smartly conditions your home, heat or cold.  I had one.  I didn't bother reinstalling it when we moved because it's like a big deal.  And then now they do a talking smoke detector that goes, I'm on your share.  I don't know what it says.  Your battery is low.  You go or you can look on your iPhone and it'll say, hey, there was no fire last night.  Oh, that's good news.  It's an interesting company.  I don't know if it's worth five point eight percent of Google's total cash position.  Three point two billion dollars.  Why?  Well, here's my theory.

Start time: 2325.00
End time: 2346.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I want to know why Google bought Honeywell.  Honeywell, the big traditional thermostat and fire detector maker, was about to sue them for a lot.  Yes.  And they somebody thought, hey, look, we can have a whole bunch of cool patents.  And and and, you know, there you go.

Start time: 2347.92
End time: 2352.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, it's interesting because Google paid half as much for YouTube.  One point six billion.

Start time: 2353.22
End time: 2354.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at the time, we thought it was insane.

Start time: 2355.00
End time: 2395.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At that time, it seemed nuts.  And YouTube was about to get sued out of existence.  Remember, I mean, there was some question whether YouTube could continue because they were really raising the ire of content creators having Google.  I think one of the reasons they sold is because Google.  You got to think that there's some some relationship there that Tony Fidel getting sued or threatened lawsuits from not just Honeywell, but First Alert and others, I think, was a little nervous about the future.  And and as Tony said, Google can get I don't know.  I completely understand why Tony Fidel took thirty three point two billion.  That's not a question mark.  But what is Google planning?  Are they planning to make a big connected home initiative?

Start time: 2396.44
End time: 2404.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it goes back to this mother announcement, right?  Like that it's like you have sensors all over the house.  They give you data.  Google wants more data.  They want to know more about you.

Start time: 2405.65
End time: 2408.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  They know when you are sleeping, they know when you are awake.

Start time: 2409.66
End time: 2440.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's it seems pretty clear that the next well, one of the the the next directions that all of this computers everywhere thing is going to take is the Internet of Things as we were discussing just now.  Does it solve a problem, though, or is it just a lot of crap?  Well, it's you mean the Internet of Things in general?  I don't know.  We don't know yet.  But there is a possibility.  Everything seems to be going in that direction, and it seems like it could bring a lot of intelligence.

Start time: 2441.52
End time: 2447.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hear the tech industry say, well, everything is going in that direction.  Let's follow that train.  And then consumers go.  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 2448.10
End time: 2524.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's possible.  But on the other hand, Nest is doing pretty well.  And what they know how to do is design in that area, in that in that industry.  And Google is getting better at design all the time, as is now famous.  You know, that phrase Google is getting better at design quicker than Apple is getting better at the Internet.  And they're getting better very, very fast.  And the thing is, the Nest appliances and maybe they had others in the, you know, on the on the drawing board.  But the Nest appliances are extremely well designed.  And as everyone knows, design is not just the way it looks, but the way it works.  And they are doing extremely well in that area.  So it might be that exactly in the same way that they bought YouTube, they could feel that something was going to happen there.  And they were thinking, you know what, let's get these guys.  Let's give let's give them the free range to do the things they want to do.  And this is obviously going to become something.  So we have a head start.  And on top on top of it, they can help with the design of other Google products in general, which is not a bad thing either.  So I think I don't know if the price is right, but I certainly understand why they would want to buy the company like this.

Start time: 2525.24
End time: 2562.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with Patrick.  I mean, it's it's obvious to me that they are they have all this design and hardware manufacturing expertise and Google's definitely wants more of that.  And then, of course, you know, the patents, the data and they were Google Ventures.  You know, there was already and they had already invested in it.  And, you know, you don't want to see something you've invested into that's doing well that can return you a lot of data and a lot of perks like the ability to do hardware and good design and have that, you know, bogged down by some gigantic lawsuit that they can't afford to fight.  Right. So I think to me that makes sense.

Transcript:  I think so. And partially as part of the story.  But I think what was more interesting to me is the reaction of this acquisition to this acquisition by the media and people thought it was Google spying on us.  Are you kidding me?

Start time: 2582.00
End time: 2603.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a potential for this to happen.  But I do you really think it's that big of a deal that Google can in fact that Nest already has access to things like your temperature over time in your house when your furnace kicked in and out and you know other stuff with the fire detector.  I mean, seriously, like, well, that's that's a lot of data.  You already signed a law for where.  But yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2604.51
End time: 2610.82

Transcript:  So I had a nest and you get a Nest energy report, which is kind of cool, that tells you, well, stuff, not useful stuff, but stuff.  For instance, all Nest thermostat schedules have saved, they say, one point four billion kilowatt hours.  That's enough energy to power all the tablets in the US for a year.  And then actually, this is I haven't I haven't used my nest in a while.  Let me go back and look at a an older Nest energy report, because I as I said, I didn't reinstall it.  This shows you this month, you use two hours more than last month.

Transcript:  Wow.  So you know what?  Wow.  This is not this is not incredibly interesting or useful information.  But once everything can can once everything becomes data and Google can can study it and get you some some value out of it, it can become interesting.  It's it's easy to make fun of it now.  But when the home becomes, let's let's create a new buzzword.  When the home becomes the quantified home and when everything is quantified, then I'm sure you can.  Well, I'm speculating, but I'm sure you can extract value out of it for you.  There's some data.

That became the story, though, Miriam.  It definitely overreacted.  Yeah.  Let's move along.  Oh, by the way, in in July, I earned 31 leaves.  That's a leaf a day.  That put me in the five top five percent of Nestor's.  And I've earned in the year 2006, 206 leaves.  I don't know what a leaf is.

Transcript:  Well, you know, it's actually I have something interesting to say about that.  When I first moved to to the West Coast from Toronto to Vancouver, it was like the mid  90s and it was a time when, you know, body modification was starting to become a big  thing, I guess.  And so I remember for a while there, you couldn't get a job if you had a tattoo or  piercing.  Right.  And and Seattle was really the first place that changed that.  Eventually, they got to a point where I told me that eventually they got to a point in  the late 90s where so many people had tattoos and piercing, they couldn't find anybody  to do the job.  They look at the cashier at QFC.  So they just had to break down and do it.  So they had to break down and accept it.  And I remember noticing that really obviously when I first visited Seattle in the late 90s  and eventually I lived in Seattle.  And, you know, it doesn't surprise me.  I mean, actually, what surprises me about this T-Mobile thing is that you mean just  only now this is happening?

Transcript:  You know, so you go in, you've got a piercing, they go, sorry, we can't use you.  Oh, that's right.  But, you know, I'm reading Brad's tattoo now.  I'm reading Brad Stone's book about Amazon, which is great, the everything store.  And he says one of the things Jeff Bezos did is he when they were hiring people for the  fulfillment centers in 90s, 98, I guess this was he told the temp agencies, send me all  your tattooed pierced people, all the people who can't get jobs.  I will use them in the fulfillment center.  So he might have been one of the reasons Seattle started to open up for that is that people  could get work.  So credit Jeff Bezos with that of all people.  Good.  We're going to come back in just a bit and talk more.  I guess the FCC net neutrality issue will be our next topic.  So prepare your rant, get the blood pressure up, start, hold your breath, blow out.  Our show today brought to you by GoToMeeting.  If you have a client that is holding his breath while you pitch him, GoToMeeting is very useful.  GoToMeeting is the best way to meet online, not just with clients, with coworkers, anywhere in  the world.  You can share the same screen.  You can see each other face to face with HD video.  I got to tell you, you know, GoToMeeting is a great way, just one use case.  If you're pitching somebody and you've got a PowerPoint presentation, they can see your  presentation.  They can hear you, of course, because you get a free conference call, line with it and  everything.  It's part of the deal.  But they can also see you.  But more importantly, you can see them.  And I'll tell you, if you're pitching somebody, the body language, the reaction you're getting  really is important stuff.  You don't want to leave that out.  It's great if you have coworkers all over the world, as we all do now.  I know people, I know teams that keep GoToMeeting running all day because you pay one low flat  rate for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  So it's very economical.  You'll increase productivity.  You'll improve communication.  You'll eliminate wasted business travel.  It's nice not to have to do that.  GoToMeeting, you can even use it on a mobile device.  You can present from an iPad.  You sign up for GoToMeeting on your computer or mobile device right now by visiting  gotomeeting.com.  Start the new year right with a free 30-day trial.  No credit card needed.  That's nice.  Just sign up.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button.  Please, if you would, use our offer code TWIT.  You have to click that link that says have a promo code and put in TWIT.  That way they'll know you heard about it on This Week in Tech.  GoToMeeting from Citrix.  They just make it better and better all the time.  Really great way to present, to meet, to collaborate online.  So this is kind of a complicated story and I think a little bit misrepresented.  A federal appeals court told the FCC that no, Verizon had sued them saying the FCC  cannot enforce net neutrality and the court said yes.  But what the court, and I think all the headlines were the end of net neutrality.  It's over.  Neutrality is dead.  And I think it was more nuanced than this.  But Patrick, you say you have a rant.  So let's hear it.  Patrick rant.  My rant is about a little bit the result probably of the judgment.

So and this goes back, frankly, to the previous chairman, the Kermit chairman.  I'm not convinced as a fan of net neutrality either.

Transcript:  Tom Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the cable industry.  The previous chairman, Julius Genachowski, was a former chairman of the Cable  industry.  The previous chairman, Julius Genachowski, an Obama appointee, apparently made a  tactical mistake.  They did not classify broadband providers as common carriers.  A common carrier is somebody that just passes information through the internet  without preference.  The court said that since you haven't declared these broadband providers as  common carriers, you have no jurisdiction.  The FCC does not regulate.  And so you cannot enforce these rules.  In fact, the judge writing the opinion said net neutrality is right.  These are the right rules.  But we cannot, you know, the law is very clear.  Judge David Tattel said the FCC should have some authority to regulate service  providers.  But until you say that they're a common carrier, Congress has not given you that  power.  And in fact, that's Verizon, basically was Verizon's argument.  This has to be regulated by Congress.  Congress did not delegate that power to the FCC.  The judge wrote, quote, the commission is adequately supported and explained its  conclusion that absent rules such as those set forth in the open internet order, the  net neutrality rules, broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness  and could act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future  broadband deployment.  The judge even said the broadband companies have a lot of financial incentive to  discriminate on the internet.  But, you know, the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction here.  And so they can't stop it.  So what that means is you basically, I don't think it's the end of the internet or end  of net neutrality, but that merely the FCC does not have the right to regulate it.  Congress does.  Now, what we I think if you care about this and you should, because we're already seeing  AT&T propose, you know, things that absolutely violate net neutrality, then you should go  to your member of Congress and say we need either to give the FCC this power or you need  to assert this and adopt this open internet order and enforce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in the current situation, there are probably a couple of things that can happen.  I think in order to prevent the nightmare scenario that a lot of people are putting  forth after this decision.  First, the FCC could go could try to reclassify the the the the the French word is coming  to be the internet providers and and make them classify them as common carriers.  They didn't do that in 2002, as as Nelly Patel's article explained.  And that was probably a little bit of they didn't want to fight what would have been  a huge fight.  But if they want to do it now, it's going to be an even bigger fight.  And it's probably not going to it's going to be extremely difficult, at least.  The other thing that could happen is that they could go on a case by case basis if things  go bad.  And if some of the service providers start doing deals that are really hurting the internet  and the public interest, then they could regulate on specific instances that has not been  prevented.  So either of those things could safeguard the internet as we know it.  My my strong reaction was to the arguments that came out after that decision was made  from a lot of people who were saying, actually, we don't want the FCC to regulate the internet.  It's one of those I don't want the government in regulating things because the government  can't do anything.  So first of all, the court said, actually, the argument is valid.  There is a danger there and it probably should be regulated.  So that's the first point.  And the second point is, it's it always irks me significantly when people say we don't  want X to regulate Y, because some things do need to get to be regulated.  You need to regulate, you know, the roads need to be regulated.  You can't do just anything you want on the roads because there is a public interest in  making sure that things go well when you're in your car.  And in my opinion, I think in everyone who's listening here's opinion, the internet is  a public utility.  There's very little question about this.  It's the same as electricity or running water or its infrastructure.  There's no question about this.  And this for infrastructure, we need to make sure that not everything goes.  So there's, you know, the words socialism come up very often.  And that might be taking it a little bit too far, maybe.  But I come from a continent where you have some countries which are socialist and which  where things work really well.  So it's the kind of absolutism where you decide that regulation is bad everywhere.  And that's really for political gain.  It's a political agenda.  And some things shouldn't be regulated.  I absolutely agree.  But some things should be regulated.  And the internet is clearly a thing that needs to be safeguarded.  Yeah, but do you want, I mean, here you're a French person.

Are you there, Denise?  No.  Okay.  Chad's going to get her on.  That's part of the debate, by the way.

It's not, it's really not about, when you say it like this, it makes it sound like they're going to go in  and decide who can do what and who can, you know, this is all right, this is not all right.  That's really not what they're trying to do.  They're just saying the internet should work the way it's worked until now.  And everyone's information should be treated equally.  That's not a really strong regulation.  You know, it's not like you start enacting 10 million different laws and deciding who can do what, where, when and how.  You just want to, in this one specific issue.

But look, the reality is this, OK, if you have a, to me, you know, the carriers and the cable providers, the internet providers,  it should be dumb pipes, right?  And as that makes them utilities instantly, right?  So if the FCC should have the power to slap them on the wrist if they start slowing down Skype traffic or slowing down Netflix  because they have invested interest some other place.  And that's exactly what I mean, what I think about when I think of regulation.  It's not so much saying, you know, we're going to control the internet.  It's more like if you mess with this, if you with this, we're going to mess with you back because we don't think you're taking into account the betterment of the US people.

Host of this week in law.  Welcome.  Hello.  I appreciate you're doing this on short notice.  My first question is why doesn't the FCC simply declare broadband providers common carriers and then say, and by the way, these are the rules?

Start time: 3559.56
End time: 3574.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the common answer to that question is that it would be really, really politically difficult to on the FCC if they did that, that they would face a lot of opposition on that front.  There is a perception.  What are the implications?

Start time: 3580.22
End time: 3627.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some people think that there's a lot more onerous regulation that will follow given that definition.  So there's the Campbell's nose under the tent.  Right.  And some people think, no, no, no, no.  You know, the FCC can do plenty under the other designation, and it really doesn't make much difference.  So, you know, it's it's a people say that it's a political decision.  What that designation?  Personally, I have a hard time thinking information service, telecommunication service.  How do you call the Internet or broadband services is what we're talking about here.  Either one.  You know, I mean, I just have a really hard time getting my head around that and and putting it into either one of those boxes.

Start time: 3627.06
End time: 3655.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're common, if they're a common carrier, that means that like the phone company, they're not responsible for the data that goes over the line that, you know, you can't go through the phone company because somebody plotted on a telephone call to do something.  It's not their fault.  They're a common carrier.  It seems to me the Internet should be a common carrier.  I don't see why AT&T would even want responsibility for the bits that go over their Internet.

Start time: 3677.32
End time: 3685.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe it's the the telco industry in general.

Start time: 3686.34
End time: 3695.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They themselves don't want to be classified that way.  Yeah, they they don't because they lose.  They didn't have to be.  Because they own media companies.  Right. Right.

Start time: 3695.24
End time: 3737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because if if they were classified as common carriers, they would they couldn't do that deal that we've been hearing about where they will ask certain service services to pay for the bandwidth.  That was actually a great conversation on on this weekend law, which I listened earlier.  And there were excellent points on both sides of the of the debate, but it seems very clear that the only reason that these telcos would not want to be classified as common carriers is that they want to treat different types of data differently.  They want extract more money.  They don't want that neutrality.

Start time: 3737.26
End time: 3758.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to do like AT&T is doing with its sponsored data plan.  They want to say to Netflix, if you was to give us some extra money, we could we could tell our customers that you don't cost anything and they use you more and say to YouTube or twit.  By the way, you didn't give us any money, so you're going to cost more for the customers.  That's exactly what we're afraid of happening.

Start time: 3759.02
End time: 3796.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But I I got to say, I mean, I've always been a huge advocate of net neutrality, and I've always been sort of viscerally drawn to the concept that you we need regulation to make sure that those deals don't happen.  But having, you know, had the discussion that we had on Twill this week and having gone through a bit of the DC Circuit's decision and reasoning on this, there there is something to be said for letting the market make a bit of the decisions on this.

Start time: 3797.08
End time: 3798.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what Judge to tell was proposing?

Start time: 3800.59
End time: 3885.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's definitely there.  There was a huge emphasis on, you know, what you can do FCC, you know, under your mandate and authority.  So less a question of, you know, laissez faire.  What is the market going to do as far as the court is concerned?  But that's the impact, right?  That that we now have some opportunity to let this play out.  And yes, I am.  I am concerned that networks like ours or, you know, I mean, ours, ours is pretty well established.  Even more fringe kinds of startups will will be impacted by these sort of sponsored data deals.  But the only way that that winds up having a really detrimental impact is if people jump on board and say, oh, yeah, all I need is who's in the sponsor data plan.  And I don't want access to the full Internet.  You know, it's really going to be consumer demand that drives this.  And Leo, do you really think that people are going to turn their back on having full Internet access?  I mean, don't you think that people have been conditioned now that they want access to whatever they want on the Web?

Start time: 3885.24
End time: 3926.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it influences people's decisions.  People are economic entities.  And I think that if you as a user know that you could watch videos on Netflix and it won't go against your data cap or cost you money,  but that if you watch the same video on another service, it will.  You're going to choose Netflix every time.  Now, whether people will watch Twitter is not.  And I've said this last week.  I don't think it affects Twitter particularly, but it very well might affect new companies coming into the business who would have to make that calculation.  Gosh, if I'm not willing to pay AT&T for sponsored access, am I going to be disadvantaged?  And a new company might very well be.

Transcript:  That if it winds up being a problem, there's plenty of opportunity.  And the court gave the FCC a roadmap for how it can write net neutrality rules that will be enforceable.  And if it wound up being problematic and fringe players were being edged out, then I think that the FCC would step in.

Start time: 3964.06
End time: 3968.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think the court would.  That's why I don't feel like it's such.  Did you read Neil Eye's article, Denise?

End time: 3996.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He felt like it was a much more negative thing than I feel like you thought it was.  Your panel thought it was on Twitter or I think it was, which is they gave him a roadmap.  They said, look, if you want to enforce this, you can.  This is how or maybe it's up to us writing to Congress and saying Congress needs to either empower the FCC to do this or write its own regulations.  So you think that it's prudent just to say, let's wait and see if this becomes a problem and then act?

Start time: 3997.61
End time: 4022.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.  I think I think this is a wait and see.  And also that there could actually be some beneficial aspects to this.  First of all, one thing to bear in mind.  Yeah, I think so.  One thing to bear in mind is that wireless and wired are already treated differently as far as the FCC's authority to to impose net neutrality.  And for good reason, I think for good economic reason.

Start time: 4023.71
End time: 4025.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  They're done. The technology is very different.

Start time: 4026.67
End time: 4040.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So so wireless is already sort of the wild, wild west as far as what the telcos can do.  And you notice that AT&T announced their sponsored data plan at CES before this decision ever came out.  Right. They knew that.

Start time: 4041.78
End time: 4104.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I want to jump in here because this is I mean, wireless is the stuff I know the best.  And and I think there is you're right.  I mean, on one hand, and this is why I'm not too freaked out about this, is net neutrality has never really officially existed on wireless.  So and it doesn't seem to be a huge issue.  Right. I mean, obviously, there are many issues with wireless carriers right now.  I'd like them to all be dumb pipes and I'd like, you know, the prices to go down significantly.  And that's not the case.  But there's a big, big, big, huge difference between Internet service providers that are wired like Comcast or even AT&T, which provides fiber and DSL to the wireless companies.  Because even though they're one in the same in many cases, the wireless spectrum belongs to the U.S. people.  OK, let's never forget.  That's a very good.  The FCC's job is to regulate that.  And I don't like the fact that the FCC has no way to enforce anything.  That's a very good point.  And that is my problem.  And I think that this just reinforces the fact that the FCC is worthless in the U.S.

Start time: 4106.14
End time: 4122.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you make such a good point, because this is our airwaves that the wireless providers are using.  And it's and it is absolutely FCC regulated.  They auction the airwaves off. They give people the right to use.  That's a why could the FCC approach it that way, Denise, at least with the wireless carriers?

Start time: 4123.06
End time: 4139.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last mile for many people who are on, you know, like ISP level, like who get Internet to their house is often wireless nowadays.  So it means it uses these FCC's spectrum.  Very good point.  And so like this is my whole argument about this.

Start time: 4140.70
End time: 4223.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think, you know, going forward, certainly wireless is the way things will be and that people want things to be.  You know, wired is very, very important.  Wired is libraries and businesses and homes and schools as we sit here today.  And that's that's a huge chunk.  But as we move forward, all of those established wired Internet access points are going to move more toward wireless.  And I think that's, you know, something I am not the person to sit here and try and explain the FCC's authority and mandate.  That's not something that's very much in my wheelhouse.  And I encourage people to go check out our last episode of this week in law, where we had two very good law professors.  On this point, too, they didn't really address, I got to say that particular issue, but they are people who would be much more able to address that than I am.  But I do think it's a good point that, you know, the FCC's authority is certainly certainly fluid.  And that's why this decision has been so up in the air for so long.  And, you know, until the case was argued, it wasn't really clear how this particular federal court was going to rule on it.  I mean, it's kind of an open question.

Start time: 4224.14
End time: 4226.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's no guarantee how this would come down.  It seems to me that the rule of law that the appeals court argued is pretty clear.  And I would guess the Supreme Court would not overturn, would not review it, would you say?

Start time: 4244.04
End time: 4256.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

I just think it's so technical and so interesting.  But I did want to really kind of at least say it may not be the end of the world, folks, that it despite all these headlines, net neutrality is dead.  I think it's far from it's not dead yet.

Transcript:  I think Denise brought some really interesting perspective into the discussion.  And I think to me, it's like because right now wireless is not net neutral, like there's no regulation on that on wireless.  I'm not too concerned that they've upheld this on wire.  You know, I'm saying like I don't think it's going to change too much.  Like I'm not alarmist about it, but I think my it's kind of a wait and see attitude for me.  I what I do wish, though, and and and it bothers me that this ruling happened the way it did is that the FCC, like from years and years ago now, just doesn't have any power in this country.  And this goes back to what Patrick was talking about, you know, should the government have that power?  Right. I think they should.  If it owns the airwaves, right.  If the people owns the airwaves, then the government should make such a that was such a good point.

Transcript:  I absolutely agree.  And there are some very clear places where government regulation and antitrust law and I think, frankly, internet neutrality is one of them.  Anyway, good discussion.  Listen to that this week in law.  Really fabulous.  We're going to take a break.  Coming up, some interesting things this week.  In fact, Amazon says it's going to announce a product that's bigger than the Kindle.  I will give you a chance to think about it and I will ask you guys, guy and gal, what do you think?  What could possibly be bigger than the Kindle?  Before we do that, though, let's see what Mike Elgin is planning in the week ahead, Mike.  It's a big week for earnings reports.

Transcript:  And by the way, it's absolutely impossible at this point to do any Bitcoin mining.  I mean, it's just gotten out of control.  You have to have a huge amount of power.  I read an article.  There was an article.  Was it the New York Times about a guy that does this?  Is all he does.  He's whole house is taken over with cooling, you know, and big ASIC computers.  And I mean, it's crazy, crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  He's basically crazy speculation.  Was that the article?  Maybe.  OK, maybe it was Bloomberg Businessweek.  Yeah, I think it was.  Oh, yeah, it was.  You know why?  Because it was written by Ashley and Brad.  And we had Brad on.  And that's right.  That's why I noticed it.  Crazy stuff.  We'll talk about that in a lot more.  And what is Amazon up to?  But first, a word from my favorite, favorite place for audio entertainment.  No, it's not twit.tv, although it's pretty good.  It's audible.com, the best bookstore of audio books.  It is such a lifesaver.  I'm such a huge fan of audible.com.  I first discovered them when I was a community in San Francisco,  spending two and three hours a day in the car going to Tech TV.  And audible kept me from really probably saved my life, probably kept me from road rage,  from crashes, from falling asleep.  I have listened over 500 books on audible and I can so heartily recommend audible.com.  The Brad Stone book I just mentioned, The Everything Store.  That's what I'm listening to right now.  Really interesting book about Amazon, about Jeff Bezos.  Did you know Jeff Bezos, his biological father, was a circus performer,  the number one unicyclist in all of New Mexico?

Start time: 4631.85
End time: 4632.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That explains everything.

Start time: 4633.00
End time: 4790.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does.  It does.  But it's also a good business book.  It talks about all the decisions that Bezos made all along.  Look, here's why I'm mentioning this.  First of all, obviously audible is a sponsor,  but if you go to audible.com slash twit2, you can buy free two books.  It's not buying, is it?  You can get two books for free.  What we're going to basically do is set you up with a platinum account.  That's two books a month.  But the first 30 days are free.  Pay nothing in the first 30 days.  Cancel anytime.  Those two books will be yours to keep.  The Everything Store will be a great one to start with.  My next listen I think is going to be Dogfight,  Fred Vogelstein's book about Google and Apple.  If you're interested in tech,  there has been in the last year a spate of great books,  Hatching Twitter from Nick Bilton,  Leander Coney's Johnny Ive book.  But there's all sorts of stuff.  There's fiction, there's nonfiction, there's science fiction.  There really is no limit to the kinds of audio entertainment you can get.  In fact, frankly at this point, if a new book comes out,  it's going to not only come out in paper in a bookstore,  but it's going to come out on audible.com, which is really, really fun.  I haven't read this, but the chat room is saying I should read Robert Gates' memoir, Duty,  which just came out, talks about his experience as Secretary of Defense  for both George Bush and Barack Obama.  It should be very interesting.  I'll put that on my list too.  There's nothing like, I love this on the upper right here on my page,  two credits available. I love that feeling.  Because I also have a platinum account.  Two credits a month, and man, I just, what am I going to listen to next?  What am I going to listen to next?  I want you to get those two credits for yourself, audible.com slash twittoo,  and do a little listening at Audible.  I think you're going to like it, but you know what, if you don't, no big deal.  You cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.  There's scary books too, look at this.  This would be a young adult, Hollow City, Mrs. Peregrine's Peculiar Children.  If you've got a teenager or a young adult at home,  there's a great way to get them into reading. Audible.com slash twittoo.  Thank you Audible for your support.  So Amazon's got an event, are you going, either of you,  no you're not going to either of you, you're going to the Amazon event.  I'm not going to the Amazon event.  But they say it's some big announcement.  12-inch Kindle.  No, they did that already, didn't they?  Oh, the DX was 10-inch, wasn't it?  The DX, and they killed it. Oh, it was only, it was too small.

Start time: 4803.12
End time: 4831.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible.  So this is coming up Thursday, wait a minute, no, that's the old one.  When is the announcement?  I have to find it.  I think it's coming up in the next week or so.  They say the guy, they say it's going to be bigger than the Kindle.  I'm waiting for this announcement, this smartphone announcement.  Don't you think that they could do a free smartphone?  Or a very, very cheap smartphone?

Start time: 4832.02
End time: 4834.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, this has been a long-lasting theory of mine.

Start time: 4836.02
End time: 4857.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Bezos is certainly ambitious enough.  January 30th, that's the date, so we got a little time.  It's called the V1 product.  It'll be in Boston.  It's from the K&I team, the Kindle New Initiatives team.  What if it were a Kindle phone?

Start time: 4858.38
End time: 4925.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kindle Watch, just kidding.  So a Kindle phone, I have this theory that they could use WhisperNet to provide basically a free phone.  Almost free.  Like it's subsidized.  But then again, it brings up this whole net neutrality discussion we had.  Because my theory would be that they do this, but that you don't buy, you can buy more.  In the same way as you can buy more with Kindle right now.  And the way you buy it is through subscriptions.  You're like, I want all the books I can eat.  So it's like $5.99 or $9.99 a month.  And then you add, it gives you basic data, very simple, like 100 megs free or whatever, like Google does and T-Mobile does on their tablets.  But then you basically don't pay for data amounts.  You pay for features.  Do you want Amazon Video?  You pay five bucks.  So that's, I think, what I see them doing.  And unfortunately, that goes against all the things we want as keeping things net neutral.  And if anybody's going to destroy net neutrality, it's definitely Jeff Bezos.

Start time: 4927.39
End time: 4929.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, no, Jeff's a good guy.

Start time: 4929.00
End time: 4942.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know Jeff's a good guy.  I like Jeff.  I'm just saying that I could see him doing it.  Like I could see him finding a way to make it work.  And then it sets an example that we don't really want to have.  Well, they're in a unique position.

Start time: 4942.16
End time: 4984.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, you compare this to Apple.  Amazon said, Bezos said, we don't have to make money on the Kindle.  We make money when you use the Kindle, which is very difficult for a company like Apple to compete against.  They have to make money on the iPad on every sale.  There's no, you know, they make a little money afterwards on the iTunes store, but nothing like Amazon could make.  And they could do the same.  It would be probably an Android phone with Amazon unique skinning as they do with the Kindle, because that's Android.  If Amazon avoids the cost of the operating system, they could probably make it fairly cheaply.  And if it's a gateway to purchases on Amazon and not.  And by the way, I mean, it's not just books anymore.  It's movies, it's TV shows.  Amazon streaming is fantastic.

Start time: 4986.50
End time: 4992.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can see how about they give you a phone with with your prime subscription.  Perfect example.  Exactly.

Start time: 4993.00
End time: 5012.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perfect example.  If you want the unlimited Internet, you pay more.  Yeah.  Because by default, all this is in this is a window into Amazon's ecosystem.  So when you get the phone, you get phone calls, you get and you get, you know, access to maybe, you know, some basic Internet stuff.  And then you mostly get access to all the Amazon stuff.  Right.  I don't see them giving away the Internet for free.

Start time: 5014.74
End time: 5024.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but as you said, with WhisperNet, to people who don't know what that is, your Kindle is automatically forever online.  I think it's Sprint they're using, right?

Start time: 5025.61
End time: 5026.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 5027.16
End time: 5035.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's now AT&T.  OK.  So you get, you know, there's no there's a crappy browser.  It's not like you could really use it for Internet access, but you do get kind of.  Yeah.

Start time: 5036.32
End time: 5051.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, you were talking about Kindle OS, which is on the Kindle Fire, but WhisperNet is essentially the syncing service for the e-reader.  Exactly.  So it's not like you get the Internet for free on your Kindle Fire.  It's really just.  No, but you do.  You do.

Start time: 5052.00
End time: 5058.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's in.  Do they have the LTE one?  Xe doesn't have free data.  And then if you pay more, you get.

Start time: 5058.00
End time: 5060.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5061.29
End time: 5068.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I call it WhisperNet.  But to me, WhisperNet is anything that gives you basically free data to kind of hook you in.  And of course, who's going to carry it?

Start time: 5069.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5073.34
End time: 5148.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they have enough of a deal with AT&T right now.  I'd be surprised to see them changing it.  All right.  And you know what?  Here's my theory.  OK.  You would never know which carrier they use.  No, they don't mention it.  If Amazon does it right.  That's right.  If Bezos does it right, this is an Amazon ecosystem, fully integrated thing.  You don't even know.  And they can change the carrier anytime they want because they don't care.  They want you to pay Amazon or part of your Prime subscription or whatever.  And here's my theory.  If it succeeds, you'll see Apple do the same thing.  What you'll see is Apple will walk to AT&T and Verizon with $10 billion in cash and say,  Give us all the data you can give us and basically support all this network wise.  And we will sell iPhones and iPads and other devices at the Apple store that people pay  through iTunes to get connectivity to the Internet.  And then what's going to happen is if that's successful, if AT&T or Verizon makes money  with this, I think it would be AT&T, by the way, then they're going to say to Verizon,  here's $10 billion.  We also want you to be a provider and we'll automatically switch based on what the signal  is best.  And then they'll talk to international carriers and then you'll be able to use your iPhone  and iPad anywhere.  Yeah.  Are you fantasizing now?

Start time: 5149.06

Start time: 5150.04
End time: 5173.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been thinking about this for a long, long time.  I've talked about this on many podcasts.  It's very possible.  And if the only, we need a spark and the spark is Amazon doing it and doing it right.  And if you have that, then basically what happens is the carrier really becomes a dump  pipe because Apple, you pay Apple for your data service and whether you pay for your  megabyte.  I'm not sure we want that either.

Start time: 5174.51
End time: 5175.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, but I'm not saying it's right.

Start time: 5176.22
End time: 5194.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying that I can see this happening because then Apple has full control over the  user experience, right?  Yeah.  Because when you go to Europe, your phone just works.  Wow.  You don't have to do anything.  It picks the best carrier and then at the time wherever you are, and you've paid for  this as part of your iTunes subscription.

Start time: 5196.04
End time: 5205.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think people going to Europe is a big enough problem for Apple to solve that  they will need to go in to enter that incredibly complex.  I don't know.

Start time: 5211.76
End time: 5214.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, T-Mobile gave away international edge to everyone.

Start time: 5216.46
End time: 5223.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only edge, but it's something and it makes me, that's the phone I'm carrying.  I'm never again paying AT&T for international roaming.

Start time: 5224.44
End time: 5229.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, but the answer is to reduce the roaming costs, which are ridiculously inflated.

Start time: 5229.69
End time: 5232.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that happening now in the EU?  Am I wrong, Patrick?

Start time: 5233.35
End time: 5252.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right.  We're the EU, one of the examples of regulation being positive.  The EU is imposing on phone service providers all over Europe to ultimately in a few years,  they won't be able to charge for roaming more than they do in their local country.

Start time: 5252.00
End time: 5256.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically, EU will be one big region and you can use any carrier in the EU.

Start time: 5257.20
End time: 5268.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're missing the point, Patrick.  There's no roaming with what I'm talking about.  There's agreement with each carrier in each country.  So your SIM or whatever is in your phone is automatically switching.

Start time: 5269.08
End time: 5279.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the reason you need it now, Miriam, is that the roaming charges are really expensive.  If you get the roaming charges down to a reasonable level, then you don't need that.

Start time: 5280.00
End time: 5283.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was happening this month, so it's a slow rollout.

Start time: 5283.02
End time: 5319.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's a slow rollout.  And ultimately, I'm not sure, so I'm not going to say anything,  but ultimately, you'll be able to subscribe to any phone service provider from Europe,  from any other country in Europe.  And that's a very good example of the industry not being regulated for so long.  For good reason, there's historical reasons for that.  But the incumbents establishing prices, incredibly high prices wherever they could,  and getting away with it because there was no regulation.

Start time: 5320.00
End time: 5327.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only reason I might not agree with you, Miriam, is that Amazon has had historically not been very good internationally.

Start time: 5328.44
End time: 5343.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but Amazon would not do the international thing.  Amazon would be the spark that would get Apple or Google to do this big.  That's what I'm saying.  It'd be successful enough that they'd be looking at it and go,  we want an integrated vertical experience for our customer that does not involve a carrier anymore.

Start time: 5344.59
End time: 5366.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want a crazy Amazon story.  They have just patented the idea of shipping items before the customer orders them.  I saw that.  That's an interesting idea.  So they know that they have enough data about what you buy on Amazon that they know that you're likely to buy something.  And so what they do is they pre-ship it to the nearest fulfillment center on the off chance you do order it.

Start time: 5366.20
End time: 5370.91

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you read this book, and I know I keep plugging this book,  but if you read this book it becomes very clear that Bezos understands what Amazon's advantages and disadvantages are.  And the big disadvantage that they have over brick and mortar stores is it takes a day to get the product at least.  And so if they could get it to you same day, that's why they're thinking about drones.  That's not a stretch for them because they really want that product to be in your hand as fast as a brick and mortar store can do it.

This was a local news service that Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AOL,  really doubled down on local news with Patch.  And after spending more than $300 million over the last six years,  they finally just said, he's not...  So you know what's really sad?

Transcript:  Well, the idea wasn't bad, right?  No.  For those who don't know, Patch was basically...  Might be an execution issue.  ...a series of bloggers creating very local content.  It was a try to crack the, I guess,  the way of going at the hyper local information  that everyone's been talking about.  Unfortunately, it's not working.  But I think if we had looked at it a few years ago  and had been asked to evaluate it,  I think we might have thought it could have worked.  I think the idea is good.  It wasn't a bad idea per se.

And there's a whole directory and lots of Shoutcast stations.  I'm really glad they saved that.  Winamp, I don't care.  But I'm really glad they saved Shoutcast.

When Marissa Meyer took over,  she brought over a number two from Google, Enrique de Castro,  who poached him from Google to run their ad sales,  paid him, we believe more than she got paid herself,  $40 million a year or something like that.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The beginning of a new year, writes Marissa Meyer in,  by the way, of course, Kara Swisher has the memo.  The beginning of the new year always provides time for reflection.  And upon reflection, you're fired.  No, as we enter 2014, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished.  But during my own reflection, I made the difficult decision  that our chief operating officer, Enrique de Castro, should leave the company.  Should put that in a memo.  Wow.  That's harsh.  Usually they say, Mr. de Castro wants to spend more time with his family.  We wish him the best of luck.

Transcript:  Apparently, there was a lot of people who were waiting for this to happen.  He was not very well liked in the company.  So I think it might have been an admission that she had to do.  She had protected him for a long time.  And ultimately, she wanted to say, mea culpa, kind of.

According to the Times, the New York Times,  he was the eighth highest paid executive in Silicon Valley for 2012.  Marissa Meyer herself received $36.6 million a year.  That seems okay.

Transcript:  And then I guess we'll wrap it up with this kind of tip of the hat to Sandra Day O'Connor.  She saved the VCR on this week 30 years ago.  You remember, maybe you don't, you're probably young, it was on Friday, that the Betamax case was finally decided.  The movie companies, the Motion Picture Association took Sony to court.  I think it was the current head of the MPAA at the time who told Congress that the VCR was to the movie industry what the Boston Strangler was to Women Home Alone.  They sued, yeah, that's harsh rhetoric. Thank you, Jack Valenti.  They sued saying you've got to kill video cassette recording. It's going to put us out of business.  In 19, what was it? Sandra Day O'Connor was the swing vote.  At first, according to archival files, she was, this is the Washington Post writing, inclined to side with the studios along with their Supreme Court majority.  But she grappled with the majority opinion so much so she wound up defecting and supporting the dissent of five-four decision against the Motion Picture Association in favor of it.  The VCR was born. And of course, as is always the case, the motion picture industry made billions off the VCR.  And in the hindsight, it was the stupidest lawsuit ever.

We wanted to get everybody out of here in time to watch a football game.  But normally we do Twitch Sunday afternoons 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern time.  That would be 2300 UTC on Twitch.tv if you'd like to watch live.  And we will be at our regular time next week.  Although I'm thinking and maybe we'd love to get some feedback.  Maybe we should, why should we wait an hour between the radio show and Twitch?  Why shouldn't we just get Twitch right under way?  Why is that hour even there?
