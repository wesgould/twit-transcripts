Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Video host and producer at CNET  and a good friend too.  So we have a really nice panel to discuss.  Well, let's see, where should we start?  I guess since you're here, Daniel,  we probably should talk about the fact that  already the appeals court, the ninth circuit,  has upheld the decision saying,  go ahead Microsoft, just buy Activision.  Go ahead.  We watched with interest the trial in San Francisco  with the lower court and testimony from Sacha Nadella  and Phil Spencer, everybody from Microsoft talking about  how this acquisition of Activision wouldn't harm gaming  and all of that.  The judge said, yeah, FTC, sorry, you got no case.  FTC was looking for an injunction,  a temporary restraining order to keep Microsoft  from making the acquisition before the August hearing  from an administrative judge.  FTC appealed and as expected lost instantly.  It's over basically, right?

Start time: 365.22
End time: 372.90
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, technically the appeal is still out there  and it could go through.  Would they go to the Supreme Court?

Start time: 372.96
End time: 376.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would the FTC go to the Supreme Court?  Isn't that what's next?  The ninth circuit. They're not gonna win it.

Start time: 377.46
End time: 534.38
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're not gonna win it.  And even if Microsoft closes the deal at this point,  what's the FTC going to do?  Try to break them apart, find them?  It's just, this was politically unpopular.  Linda Kahn went in front of Congress,  Congressional Oversight Committee this week.  Granted, Republican controlled.  She's appointed by a Democrat,  so there's some natural politics going on there.  But they brought up a couple of legit questions  like you got your butt handed to you in court flat out.  Why are you appealing this and wasting taxpayer money?  And she was asked kind of rhetorically,  but are you bringing court cases  that you know are gonna lose?  And of course she's like, no, of course not.  But it's like that decision by the judge earlier  on the injunction was flat out obvious.  There was no wiggle room for them.  There was no little bit of light saying that,  well, if you just showed this, I might have considered it.  It was just completely shut down.  And so the only way appeals go through  is if you can demonstrate  that there was some kind of judiciary issue.  Prosecution withheld something,  the defense didn't have something.  You have to show something was wrong,  but there was nothing wrong in this case.  So it was even funny that they appealed.  And yeah, so now the injunction is not gonna happen.  It looks like Microsoft is gonna close the deal.  They were supposed to close it,  well, they're gonna be closing it this week  and the next couple of days.  And that's what made the FTC, their behavior kind of like,  they knew they were trying to trip up the closing date  because were this to fail,  Microsoft would be on the hook for $3 billion  to not go through it.  Right?  Because they would have.  The breakup fee, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And so it looks like they're gonna go through.  The only thing now is the UK.  The UK is still an issue,  but even that went from we made our decision,  that's it, to well,  I guess now we'll maybe take some concessions,  a few more negotiations here and there.  Because those are the only two,  was the UK and the United States.  The rest of the world was like, yep, fine, all right.  And Microsoft was very proactive in making concessions  and trying to say, listen,  we're not going to keep Call of Duty off of PlayStation.  We're gonna play fair with these.  It was a weird case because Microsoft is like a distant third.  And with Activision Blizzard,  they may have a shot at number two, may.

Start time: 534.60
End time: 585.33
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And every country in the world had already approved it,  including Japan, Sony's home nation,  had said, go ahead.  I mean, it's reasonable for antitrust regulators  to look at it.  It was a very big acquisition.  And Microsoft was quick to say,  oh, we're still number three,  but it made them a lot bigger in gaming.  Sure.  The argument that, oh, Lena Kahn keeps bringing cases  and losing cases, she lost against Metta,  trying to keep them from buying that fitness app  from within.  I think you could make the argument  that even the threat of this action  is enough to keep companies a little bit careful.  And I don't think that's a bad thing.

Start time: 586.54
End time: 600.22
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the last time a vertical merger like this happened,  I think AOL Time Warner, right?  It didn't go so well.  I definitely want regulators to at least keep their eye  on acquisitions like this.  Yeah.

Start time: 600.92
End time: 625.11
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is also the case though that,  and this is why they wanted the injunction,  once the acquisition happens,  it's a lot harder to unwind that  than it is to stop it before it happens.  So what happens, Daniel, in the UK now?  If Microsoft goes ahead and they're expected by Tuesday  to finalize the deal, then what is the UK just say?  Well, what, we told you to stop?  What do they do?

Start time: 626.40
End time: 632.91
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  I mean, worst case scenario, which won't happen,  is like Microsoft closes the deal, this goes through,  and it just block UK.

Start time: 634.00
End time: 640.31
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're not gonna sell it in the UK, so you win.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  It's just like you're cut off.  Enjoy your Libra office.

Start time: 640.88
End time: 660.58
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, they just carve them out.  That won't happen though.  Obviously the UK is feeling the pressure now  because they're the only ones.  Microsoft says, hope you like Linux.  Yeah, so it seems like the deal that might go through  is that Microsoft might sell off some of the cloud hosting.  Yeah, the UK's concern was weird.

Start time: 660.68
End time: 668.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was that they would be too dominant in cloud gaming,  which is not a hot and vibrant category.

Start time: 668.80
End time: 671.62
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  It is not.  Google just got out of it with Stadia.

Start time: 671.90
End time: 686.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The companies that are doing it like Nvidia's,  GeForce Now, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass,  or no, what do they call it?  I can't even remember what they call it.  Yeah, Xbox Game Pass, GeForce Now.  They're struggling.  They're not huge by any means.  Yeah.

Start time: 687.64
End time: 723.32
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, and that was revealed during the court case, right?  They showed that it's very soft right now for cloud gaming.  There's a lot of potential there.  We have a couple new handhelds out,  but I can tell you even the handhelds are soft selling.  The Steam Deck and the ASUS, yeah, no, yeah.  So it's a weird argument, but yeah,  they could let a local company handle the cloud stuff  in the UK and everybody else will be happy.  Just hopefully that company can deliver the experience  that Microsoft expects Xbox cloud gaming to deliver.

Start time: 723.80
End time: 740.41
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The UK moved the deadline back in time or forward in time,  indicating to, I guess, to experts,  oh, this means they're gonna be negotiating  some sort of minor concession  so that they can save face and back down.

Start time: 741.40
End time: 759.48
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  I think it's a dead deal.  The whole thing has just been strange.  Yeah, it's been strange.  I understand if you're Sony, listen,  if you're Sony and you're CEO,  you have to fight this, right?  That's your obligation to your shareholders.  You have to try to block this as much as possible  even though it's not a real threat to you.

Start time: 759.68
End time: 801.95
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said, and it really did feel like  Sony got the whole world, all the regulators  in every country to step up,  like you should do something about this,  but it ended up they were worried that Call of Duty,  which is made by Activision and is a huge title  on PlayStation, would suddenly become exclusive  to Microsoft's Xbox, and they were worried about that.  But Microsoft said, no, no, we'll make a deal with you.  They made a deal with Nintendo.  No, no, we're not, we're only,  Microsoft said, is it credible, Daniel Mrabino,  that this is just to get into mobile gaming,  which we're not a part of,  and that's the whole reason for this.  Is that credible?

Start time: 803.46
End time: 839.02
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, between the cloud gaming aspect,  which is geared towards mobile users,  you can basically get a console experience  on your smartphone directly, as well as the stores.  They can launch their own store because,  yeah, Blizzard, Activision King,  King has a lot of games that are mobile.  King is Candy Crush, right?  Yeah. That's the big one.  Boomers and Gen Xers, Unite,  that's one of our favorite games still, apparently.  But it's a huge business,  and it's still an amazingly popular game,  and allows Microsoft to, yeah,  get a foothold into mobile gaming,  which of course they lost after.  It's gotta be a good business.

Start time: 839.22
End time: 840.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're paying $69 billion.

Start time: 841.98
End time: 911.45
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Billion dollars, yeah.  It's, which goes to show you  how much cash they had laying around.  I believe they had 130 billion laying around,  so again, as a corporation,  you can't sit on like 130 billion dollars for long.  You either gotta give it back  to the shareholders at some point,  or you make a big acquisition,  or multiple acquisitions that benefit the company.  So that's what Microsoft is doing here.  But the whole thing was just kinda strange.  I understand Sony had to fight it legally,  but at the same time, emails came out  showing that even Sony wasn't like,  oh, we know this won't really do anything to us.  Because, and Nadella even came out and said,  listen, we don't like exclusives.  If we could choose,  we would not have exclusives for gaming.  We think it's bad.  And that is kind of his thing lately, right?  I mean, ever since he came in,  he undid all the Balmer stuff.  Balmer was very much exclusive to Windows.  We're gonna form our own Apple-like ecosystem.  Nadella came in and said, no, we're doing that.  We're putting Linux wherever we want.  We're gonna put our apps wherever we can.  We're gonna support every platform.  So I really believe him  that he doesn't want exclusives as much.  But Sony is so into exclusives.  And it's worked for them.  That's the irony.

Start time: 911.72
End time: 915.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sony's the bad guy when it comes to exclusives.  They really do it.

Start time: 915.62
End time: 945.44
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  They nailed it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they pay so much money,  but they have so many like,  you know, it was Halo and like Gears of War,  Forza is still there, Forza is still doing more.  But like Microsoft and Xbox  just does not have a flagship game anymore.  Whereas Sony's got a couple.  They have the, was it God of War, the Spider-Man series?  Like they have like a bunch of really, really good titles  and they run commercials all the time hammering that.  So it's a weird case, but thankfully it looks like-

Start time: 945.92
End time: 962.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sony has signed the 10 year deal for Call of Duty.  I thought they'd already made that agreement,  but I guess maybe they'd agreed to it in principle,  but they hadn't signed it.  So now it is a binding agreement  that Call of Duty will stay on PlayStation  for at least 10 years,  according to Phil Spencer tweeting yesterday.

Start time: 963.82
End time: 965.01
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  And it can be renegotiated in 2033.

Start time: 966.46
End time: 977.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and why would Microsoft,  look, Microsoft, as we learned,  doesn't make any money on Xbox.  It's kind of a loser.  Why wouldn't they try to make some money  selling it on PlayStation?

Start time: 978.20
End time: 1008.34
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Why would they do that?  It begs the question, right?  Say they did make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox.  What would the return on value be?  Like, are they going to really catch up now to Sony  all of a sudden in console sales  just because of Call of Duty and the revenue there?  No, of course not.  Would they make more money keeping it on PlayStation  and still selling the game to them?  Yes, they're going to make way more money that way.  So it doesn't really make sense for them  to even make it exclusive outside of just being bitter.  Balmer might've done that.  Don't get me wrong.  I think Steve Balmer might have done that.  Steve Jobs definitely would have done it.

Start time: 1008.46
End time: 1050.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, Satya changed Microsoft.  He said, it used to be,  in fact, the Microsoft mission statement was  every computer on every desktop running Microsoft software.  And Satya Nadella said,  we want to be wherever our customers are  on any platform they are.  And that was a huge shift.  And actually, as everybody who has Microsoft stock  knows, a very good shift.  Stock market likes what happened on Friday as well.  So I guess Phil Spencer had offered this agreement  in January to Sony,  but just Sony said, January of last year.  But Sony said, we're not going to sign that.

Start time: 1051.24
End time: 1083.32
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  We're going to find it.  Why would we sign it if we think we can beat you?  Yeah, why would we sign it?  And they kind of came close, right?  The FTC, I think, threw more sand into the gears of this  than a lot of people anticipated.  They were really kind of,  and it was just a strange thing.  And I'm all for the FTC and watching tech companies,  but this just was not that case.  It's like social media, sure.  Let's take a look at that.  Advertising, sure.  Let's take a look at that one.  But gaming, yeah, I don't know.  That was a weird stretch.  It's not that big.

Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  I became a gamer in my adulthood  and kind of because, I mean, I like the systems in games.  I like figuring out, it's like a puzzle, right?  You figure out the mechanics of a game  and you can figure out how things work.  It's kind of like tech, right?  Or Linux or any type of coding environment, right?  You're trying to figure out systems and how they work.  I was more, look, I agree.  I kind of want regulators to pay attention to different  or maybe larger issues,  but I think that this was a good thing to pay attention to  and I understand Sony's grievance.  Look, it sounds silly to have an argument  about Call of Duty, which is if you watched or read  or listened to these hearings,  it really seemed to come down to Call of Duty,  but I can understand in 10 years,  Microsoft and Daniel, you rightly point out,  Microsoft has pivoted to services a long time ago  and I can understand Sony saying,  hey, look, the hardware market might be shrinking  and if Microsoft totally takes over cloud and services,  we could, I mean, exclusives only last  as long as the next console, we could shrink  and there could be no competitors left for us to buy.  There could be no studios or very few studios  that are capable of creating AAA quality games  that we have as exclusive.  So I understand Sony's fear.  Microsoft is a trillion dollar company  and them making a vertical acquisition like this  and integrating the service providers  into the Xbox as the platform, I would be scared  and I think that consumers have a right to be kind of wary  of this acquisition because in the past,  acquisitions like this have never gone well.  Having said that, as a gamer, I really would like  Bobby Kodak, the CEO of Activision Blizzard King,  the guy who oversaw sexual harassment,  the guy who was responsible for all kinds of union busting,  I'd like that guy to leave.  I would like at least the studio to not be as noxious  as it has been in the last decade or so.

Start time: 1242.40
End time: 1252.09
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and some say this was Bobby's way of getting out.  He's gonna clear billions of dollars in this action  but I think he's still, isn't he on the board still, Daniel?  I think he is.

Start time: 1252.52
End time: 1273.30
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  He does still have like a role.  They haven't been as, yeah, I agree with Dan here.  They have not been as, let's kick him out with a picture  as much as I think a lot of us would like  but he still does play a pretty big role in this.  Yeah, and the company does have a lot to go through.  And Microsoft, yeah, their history of acquisitions  is kind of mixed, right?  Like some of them were really good  but they didn't work out way better.  But their gaming history is not bad.

Start time: 1273.46

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Overture was bad  but look what they did with Minecraft.  They were, I think, very good stewards of Minecraft, right?  They've improved it.  And this is Phil Spencer.  Grown it, yeah.  The head of Xbox, Phil Spencer.  And lately, GitHub, we were all worried  about the GitHub acquisition but that's been all right.  I don't know, LinkedIn,  they certainly didn't change LinkedIn.  I don't know if-

Start time: 1297.00
End time: 1301.93

There's also, I mean, they talked about Call of Duty  but there's World of Warcraft.  There's Diablo 4 just came out.  There's a lot of games.  This is a big portfolio.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  You know, don't forget, we talk about gaming here  but that IP is important in other ways, right?  What's the big thing we've been seeing lately  is converting those kind of video games  into blockbuster movies or TV series.  If Microsoft controls that IP,  that said, Microsoft hasn't had good luck yet  converting this into, you know,  look at what they did with the Halo series.  They got mediocre reviews,  but up tails compared to like The Last of Us, right?  You know, what Sony then nailed, right?  So Sony is actually really good at this stuff.  So I would love to see the Diablo series convert to a movie.  We're all hoping for Gears of War.  That's been in the works forever.  Dave Bautista like literally stepped up and said,  let me play the lead.  And we're like, he is the new character.  Who else are you gonna cast?  He's perfect.  Yeah, you know, so it's like they could do all this  but it does have a lot of value besides, yeah,  just gaming, right?  The long form TV series, Premier, you know, Prestige TV

And by the way, Star Wars was a lot cheaper than this.  That was a hell of a deal for Disney.  Wow, $70 billion.  All right, so the next step,  before Windows Weekly on Wednesday,  it's probably likely that they will announce  the acquisition has gone through.  It's done.  The UK is gonna be left holding kind of a limp hand  but I guess maybe they'll get some concession,  some face saving concession out of Microsoft  and then it's over.  As a gamer, it makes me a little nervous  to see consolidation.  I like, I think from the, I have mixed feelings.  We talked about this a little on Windows Weekly.  It is the case that these days it costs more  to make a triple A game than it costs  to make a major motion picture.  It's hundreds of millions of dollars.  So.

But you know, I think of like Vampire Survivors.  It's a $3.99 game that came out of nowhere.  And it's just like, now that's not called duty level, right?  But there is still potential.

It's the distribution platform.  And to this point, they've been pretty laissez faire.  Abraher, I'm curious, like,  what is your take on all this as a non-gamer?

I mean, just even observing big tech in general  and the ways that it's, you know,  the ways that there's a lot of scrutiny  and to see it extend into the gaming world.  I think, I don't know enough to say  how I feel personally about it,  but it is curious to see these companies  just kind of in all these parallels  and what they want to acquire and all those sectors.  But yeah, I'm learning a lot just listening to you guys.

Right.  So on the one hand, you do need these big tech companies  to do kind of these big things,  but I also worry that you'd lose some innovation  if you don't, and you know,  one of the problems with gaming,  and this is a big problem in Activision Blizzard,  it was for a long time just a bunch of bros.  And so the games weren't representative.  They were really violent.  They were the kind of things, you know,  the John Carmacks of the world  and the Romeros of the world wanted to play.  I think diversity and small indies  are important to any creative outlet, yes?

Well, I was just gonna say, I think, you know,  that what you're saying reflects a lot of what we've seen  with these, you know, smaller startups  that are acquired by companies like Meta, for example, right?  So you see all those two sides of the argument  where it's like, okay, that platform could grow  because it was acquired by Meta or Google,  but then you see a lot of people leave  because the objective of the company changes  and the culture changes, sometimes for better,  sometimes for worse.  So yeah, it is interesting to see that kind of  in the gaming realm as well.

Transcript:  I didn't mean to change.  Yeah, no, I was just gonna say about the indie gaming.  I was kind of agreeing with Dan there with,  you know, Steam is just like, I love Steam.  Yeah, me too.  Steam has so much, you really have, talk about indie.  You have games that are created sometimes  by one or two individuals, and they get business.  They get great reviews, and all the PC gaming sites  do eventually pick it up.  And often I see a lot more coverage of them  than I do the Call of Duty's,  because everybody knows about those.  But like the indie stuff is really great,  because it's so much more,  like one reason I haven't bought Diablo 4  is it's like 70 bucks, you know?  But I can go get like other games for $10, $15  and have just as much fun.  Now, Microsoft does do a really good job,  in my opinion, of highlighting indies.  So they end up offering, like often going  and taking a lot of the stuff on Steam  and getting it on Xbox and even putting it  into their game pass so people can just play  all these really cool games.  I've been a big fan of it.  It was one reason I got into Nintendo Switch  initially.  I didn't care about any of Nintendo's IP.  They had a lot of Steam IP though.  A lot of Steam indie games were appearing on it,  and that's what I wanted to play.  And Microsoft's been, they have their ID at Xbox program.  They support indie developers a lot,  because I think there is a lot of,  we do focus a lot on the AAA titles,  and they are big business.  But those small indie ones are also big business too,  just on a different scale.  And I think it's a really interesting thing,  and I think it'll be fine.  I think those, you know, right now what we're seeing,  we call them boomer shooters.  We did a whole like wrap up of them.  Boomer shooters are basically remakes of Doom games  from the 90s.  And people are just taking that same graphics  and this pixel art kind of thing  and making these first person shooters.  They're really affordable.  They're like $10 half the time.  So they're a lot of fun to play.  They play on any low end system.  And for people like my age, we're like,  hell yeah, this is where it's at, you know?  The gaming is I think still very strong  and will be strong regardless of this deal.  Because I know myself, I don't play Call of Duty.  I don't play World of Warcraft.  I play a lot of like the side scrollers  and indie stuff from Steam.

The game I play, which is actually interesting  that you should mention this,  is a $20 indie game out of Sweden.  10 developers called Valheim,  but it's incredibly compelling.  Oh yeah.  And in fact, they've made hundreds of millions of dollars.  They haven't even come out of beta yet.  They're just raking it in.  And I played it on the Steam Deck  and I just wanted to go back to my big monitor.  I felt very constrained.  But I guess you have a new baby.  You don't get to sit down in your office.

I for one don't want that feeling of,  oh, you know, FTC, why are you even trying to regulate?  Why are you trying to fight trust?  Just let it all, I don't want that.  I want the FTC to be active  and slow down these big acquisitions.  It's completely reasonable to say,  with $70 billion acquisition,  is this good or bad for consumers?  Is this good or bad for innovation?  And so I hope that there's not this sense of,  oh, they see they keep losing.  They're losers.  No, I think we need the FTC.  We need antitrust.  Totally agree.  Yeah, we might even need better antitrust regulations.  I think it's very challenging to think  what do you do about big tech  because it becomes so dominant,  it becomes too big to fail,  too big to compete with,  and too powerful in society.  Look at Google search, for instance.  Very hard to create a competitive search.  And frankly, Google search determines what the internet is.  If you can't find it on Google, it doesn't exist.  That's a lot of power in society.  I don't know who,  you can't count on Google to regulate itself.  You need a little bit of a stick  to hang over their heads.  I don't know.  Let's take a break.  We've got a great panel  and we have other things to talk about,  including shopping coming up in just a little bit,  and AI.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  I meant, let me, I made a mess of this.  I've deleted all my ad copy.  Our show today brought to you by,  oh, I love this one, HelloFresh.  We get our HelloFresh box,  and when we get it, I just look at it and I go,  how do they do it?  It's America's number one meal kit.  And how do they get such fresh, delicious ingredients?  Well, I think one of the ways is it's actually fresher  than you're getting in the grocery store.  They come from the farm to your door in under seven days.  So it's beautiful, fresh stuff, and it's seasonal.  You take a bite at a summer right now with HelloFresh  from chef-crafted seasonal recipes  to their new fresh and fit summer menu.  Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  HelloFresh brings flavor right to your door.  Of course, you get pre-portioned ingredients.  That means less food waste.  You use exactly what you've got, no more, no less.  And these great recipe cards  with step-by-step instructions make it really easy,  and you even see some alternative,  you could add, for instance, a vegetarian option on this.  They've got all the steps for you, which makes it very easy  to learn how to cook some amazing things  like a tangy key lime pie.  They even have now HelloFresh Market,  which makes summer entertaining a cinch.  I'm dying to try the backyard bratwurst bar.  Maybe we'll do that next weekend.  Make your home the hangout place this summer  with crowd-pleasing eats.  HelloFresh makes sure you get peak time summer produce  all season long.  As I said, from the farm to your door in less than seven days,  that makes such a difference.  Fresh is amazing.  It's right in the name.  HelloFresh offers more than just delicious dinners.  It's now easier than ever to add snacks, sides,  and more to your weekly order  with a curated selection of more than 100 items.  They also have lunch.  They've got calorie-smart and protein-smart lunch  and dinner options, plus new vegan dinners to choose from.  HelloFresh makes it easy to eat healthy  with delicious recipes.  Let HelloFresh do the meal planning,  deliver the ingredients, everything you need in that box  to whip up a delicious meal right at your doorstep.  And oh, by the way, and I think we got this habit  during the quarantine, you just kind of,  ah, I don't want to cook.  Let me, we'll just sort of take out.  HelloFresh is 25% cheaper than takeout  and ready faster because there are fast fresh recipes  that are ready in 15 minutes or less.  That's fast and costless.  It gives you the options you want  when it comes to what makes for, to make for dinner,  not just the same old thing all the time.  That's why they offer 40 recipes to choose from every week,  every week, so you never get bored.  You can always find something new to try and love.  I love it.  HelloFresh, no wonder it's America's number one meal kit.  Go to hellofresh.com slash twit 50  and use the code twit50, twit50 for, get this, 50% off  and free shipping.  I know you want to try this.  Hellofresh.com slash twit 50.  And don't forget the offer code twit50  for 50% off plus free shipping.  Maybe this week you could say, hello, fresh.

I did buy, okay, I tried to resist,  but I did buy one thing from Prime Day.  I got a like a MagSafe wallet for the back of my phone  and that felt like a practical thing to purchase.  So that, yeah, that was my contribution,  but I'm proud of myself.  I didn't know, no big purchases.  You know, we were very reasonable, which is good.

It was an Amazon choice.  You know what an Ottoman is?  It's one of those things you put in front of a chair,  you put your feet on.  And it was 37% off for Prime Day,  but the people writing the blog post used camel, camel,  camel, and they went back in time.  That's a really good tool to use before Prime Day  to look at the price.  The price was for the longest time, the 37% off.  The week before Prime Day, Amazon raises it to 113 bucks  so that they can lower it in Prime Day.  You're not really getting a deal in many cases, right?  Do people not know this?  I think people don't know it.

And like, obviously with my job,  we had to highlight and do Prime Day like anybody else.  And so, but we only focused on those deals  where something was truly reduced  so that we weren't kind of like leading on customers like,  oh, it's the lowest price ever  when it's been that price for a while.  But it's true.  I mean, a lot of those prices weren't lower  than they had been,  or they've already been at that price before,  or they're at the same price right now,  even though the Prime Day is over.  So yeah, it's a tricky thing.

This article pointed out that if you are an Amazon affiliate,  as almost everybody is, we are not,  but if you are an Amazon affiliate,  you're not allowed to disparage Amazon  or you'll lose your affiliate status.  So publications are kind of incented  not to talk about this secret, this open secret  that Prime Day deals are often not Prime deals.  We could talk about it  because they can't take away my affiliates.  I won't make any of you say anything.  But I should have probably made bigger deal  about this last week than now  after you've all bought your $12 billion  on Amazon Prime Day sales up 6.1%.  They thought it'd be even bigger.  $12.7 billion in two days.  This is according to Adobe,  which weirdly keeps track of this kind of stuff.

Transcript:  I mean, Americans historically-  I agree with you.  I'm just gonna give you a chance to explain it.  Historically, Americans have been bad  with getting into debt over credits.  Now during the pandemic, famously,  that went down so much, people were worried,  quote unquote, worried that, you know,  oh my God, households now have reserve income  and not as much debt.  What?  Yeah, like we can't have that in America.  But luckily for the financial institutions,  that has since reversed,  and now the numbers are going back up again.  Basically, households are overstretching themselves  on credit once again.  And these pay now, pay later things are very convenient.  You don't need to put on your credit card  and you just click it and it kind of goes through.  And it's a little bit more strict on,  you know, we got four payments, you gotta make it, but-  There is no interest usually, right?

Anybody want to take a guess?  If you didn't see, if you saw this article, don't.  But of the top products purchased on Amazon Prime Day.  You know what the number one product was?  Anybody?  It was cat treats.  That's practical.  Okay.  Number one, temptation cat treats.  So I'm reading this article yesterday morning at breakfast.  I look up and I see exactly that same thing on the table.  That's what we give our cats.  I said, Lisa, I hope you paid only $11.12 at Amazon  for the temptation cat treat.  Of all the things you could buy on Prime Day,  that was number one.

But you know, it's interesting too,  because that's the thing about, you know,  what we talked about a lot with Prime Day was  it's not just the time to buy the big ticket item.  It's the time to stock up on toilet paper or batteries  or whatever you know you're gonna need.  It's gonna be on sale.

And I thought, oh, that's a deal.  So I stocked up on those.  I didn't buy like thousands.  I'm thinking I should grow a beard maybe,  but anyway, I bought a few months worth.  Let's put it that way.  So I did, I fell for it too.  And I don't know if Lisa bought these.

And it comes from some guy's house.  And you could tell, like it's packaged,  like some guy went to Costco,  bought a bunch of it,  broke it up, put it in packages and sent it.

So it benefits kind of everybody.  But yeah, it's really interesting how much it's grown  into a shopping, Black Friday basically.

Transcript:  It was a good timing  because inflation is finally dropping now.  Even I noticed food prices are finally going back down.  I do wonder how much of these numbers  were adjusted for inflation though,  in terms of the money brought in.  So, because some of these items are still, I think,  priced higher than they might've been two years ago.  But I think consumers are feeling a little bit  of economic relief now.  So they might've felt more comfortable spending stuff.

Start time: 3055.82
End time: 3068.78
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  It's also interesting to think about the timing  because for Black Friday at least,  people can get a head start on their holiday shopping.  So there's an incentive to purchase.  Yeah, what are they buying?  This is for them, right?  And then now, it's just, yeah, it's like, what do I want?  Let me just buy all this stuff from them.

It's spice for pumpkin pie.  It's called, but there's no pumpkin involved.  Not as far as I know.  So maybe I'll do a campaign to put the pumpkin  back into pumpkin spice.  There you go.  Yeah, now we're really talking.  All right, that's enough of that.  Amazon, though, I don't know if you know, is a VLOP,  a very large online platform.  This is according to the EU.  The EU named 17 companies to be regulated  under the Digital Services Act.  Nominally, these are any company that has,  is a social, well, a platform, a VLOP has,  according to the DSA, has added a responsibility  to protect their users from illegal content and products,  hate speech and so forth.  So Amazon's response is, Yorana,  why are you calling us a very large online platform?  I love the register's headline,  obscure internet boutique Amazon,  sues EU for calling it a very large online platform.  Amazon said, but we're a retailer,  we're not a social network.  Well, okay, if you say so.  Pretty close.  Amazon's number one business is advertising, I think.  And advertising is certainly covered by VLOPs.  So in any event, you know, this is one of those,  another one of those regulations  where the companies fight, fight, fight.  The VLOPs are Alibaba's AliExpress, yeah, they sell stuff,  Amazon store, Apple's App Store, Booking.com, Facebook,  Google Play, Google Maps, Google Shopping,  Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok,  Abraha, your favorite, Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube.

I won't say though, my usage,  especially for personal stuff has gone way down.  And I don't check it as much, nearly as much.  I do appreciate threads a lot more.  And I'm hoping that that takes off.  Let's talk about threads.

But now threads has become the thing  that I gravitate towards when I wanna send something out.  Also for personal reasons,  if I have like some random Taylor Swift take,  I want us to send out and I'll go to threads.  Or if I'm trying to lean into that more  with promoting my content.  But obviously I have more followers on Twitter right now,  but obviously the ability to import your followers  from Instagram has been a huge boost,  at least in the beginning.  There's still room to add more people,  but I have been gravitating towards threads more,  even to the point where I got used to the like button being,  cause they're kind of swapped on Twitter.  And I'm used to already on threads.  That's what I've grown accustomed to.

Like obviously the algorithm isn't as good as like TikToks,  but I'm waiting for that following page to come out  where I can just kind of choose the people  I actually follow and just see their content.

Transcript:  We should have journalist Maria Ressa on the program.  She is the CEO and founder of Rappler.com,  which is the Philippines largest  and predominant news organization.  She also won the Nobel peace prize last year.  Maria can tell you about,  look, I'm on all of the atomized social platforms  and I bemoan the loss of the Twitter that was.  I was in the beta for Twitter and it was as a journalist,  a remarkably useful tool.  However, I have a hard time forgetting  what Facebook has enabled.  And Maria Ressa, who is a journalist in a democratic country  that was taken over by Rodrigo Duterte,  and she was imprisoned, she was attacked,  and she was so, she was enabled by Facebook.  She was attacked by so many trolls and threatened so much  and enabled by the president, by Duterte,  that her life was in danger.  This was Facebook as a platform enabling the attack  on the fourth estate, a democratic country,  a journalist in a democratic country  who won the Nobel peace prize enabled by Facebook.  Let's look at some of the other things  that Facebook has also enabled.  If we go back almost a decade,  and we look even at our own elections  here in the United States, we look at 2016.  I mean, I really don't wanna get into politics.  But I am a hard time investing time and energy  into Facebook platforms.  And it feels like we've all kind of,  pardon the pun, lost the thread.  I'm sorry, I don't mean to be self-righteous or preachy.  But I have a hard time using threads for that reason.

Start time: 3577.62
End time: 3625.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's one of the things that's interesting  about threads is that people,  even I who refuse to use Facebook,  kind of forgot and buried this.  Facebook enabled genocide in Myanmar.  I mean, their trust and safety  has left something to be desired.  But this has been, in some ways,  threads has been the great revival of Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah, it's polished his brand.  It's polished his brand.  And even people who wouldn't have Facebook  often had Instagram.  And if they didn't have Instagram, they'd have WhatsApp.  So yeah, it's an interesting situation.  Not many people are as principled as you, Dan, unfortunately.

Start time: 3625.96
End time: 3665.56
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  It's not principles.  Look, I covered conflict regions when I was a young reporter.  I saw people die and I saw how social media contributed  to some really horrific things.  And I'm a little triggered.  I don't mean to be sanctimonious or preachy.  But I mean, once you kind of see some of these things,  you can't unsee it.  I think Maria Ressa is a very valuable voice.  And look, if a democratic institution can be tanked  by social media being exploited,  then we need to pay big attention to it  and simply forgetting the last decade or so,  because there's a shiny new social platform is dangerous.

Start time: 3667.73
End time: 3706.39
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it?  So I guess I'd have to do more research and you've done it.  So I'm gonna ask you, Dan.  Certainly it's the case that social networks,  you gotta include Twitter in this,  have been used for- Yeah, absolutely.  Twitter and Huonan were huge.  Yeah, for good and ill.  And you could say the Arab Spring was also enabled  by Facebook and Twitter, among others.  Are they evil in intent or just in,  by omission or commission, I guess is the question.

Start time: 3707.34
End time: 3710.00
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  Well, I can't call anyone evil.  I can't be that kind of-

Start time: 3710.06
End time: 3719.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's in a way, that's the issue, right?  Because if, so Facebook is so big, so vast,  it probably is impossible to police it, I would guess.

Start time: 3720.18
End time: 3755.22
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  I think that they were pretty aware.  I mean, look, everybody's talking,  look, Twitter had remarkably capable people  in their trust and safety,  but they still overlooked the proliferation of QAnon,  which was very harmful.  Look, I was doxxed by QAnon, sent countless death threats.  I mean, Twitter, it helped enable this,  but do I think their trust and safety people  helped enable it?  No, I don't think that.  So I don't know the answer to your question, Leo,  but I think that, and I'm sorry,  I always come on this program to talk politics,  and I don't mean to, but I think tech intersects politics  in some really important ways right now.

Start time: 3755.24
End time: 3804.31
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's important, I think it's important to be aware of it.  You know, what is that new movie  that is essentially a QAnon movie  is being heavily promoted by the New York Times right now.  The Sound of Freedom, which is, well, if you look into it,  the origin story is not good.  And I feel like it's so pervasive in our society  that anything, any social network that reflects our society  is gonna reflect that kind of evil content.  And even newspapers where you would expect  the New York Times to know a little bit better  than to promote Sound of Freedom make mistakes.  I'm sure this was an editorial mistake on their part.  I hope it was.

Start time: 3805.34
End time: 3846.23
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  So-  The challenge I have with any social network  is the vast sums of money and profit that has been  earned by not just the companies themselves,  but pocketed by the individuals there.  And I do think that there is a significant amount  of responsibility by the people who are responsible  for these social platforms,  for enabling things like, well, we say the engagement's up,  the engagement's really high.  Well, that can do good things and it can do bad things.  And I think that, you know, to quote Spider-Man  for the five millionth time,  with great power comes great responsibility.  And I would like the platform owners  to take a little more responsibility  and that they have tremendous power,  but I think they've dodged a lot of responsibility.

In general, you have zero social media.  I don't think, I have YouTube on my phone.  Well, I just feel like garbage in, garbage out.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, yeah, definitely.  Absolutely.  I pay for this YouTube with no hands.  I think there's nobody with clean hands,

Start time: 3875.98
End time: 3901.91
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but part of this is just the vast reach these services have.  It would be almost impossible.  I mean, it would be almost impossible for them  to have completely clean hands.  I think YouTube is an example of a company.  I mean, Google and YouTube want to,  do not wanna promote terrorism or genocide,  but sometimes are used that way.  They do their best not to,  but it's almost impossible for them to prevent it 100%.

Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  We can expect that an honest effort  and we can expect that if you have made billions,  then don't be disingenuous.  Yeah.  I think maybe the formation of the, for example,  Facebook oversight committee was disingenuous.  It is not a Supreme Court.  It did not do it.  I mean, and it really did a very scary thing,  which was, they would get down to the very granular level  and say, well, we are examining this post, this post,  this post and this post, which marginalizes  and makes the scale of the problem seem small.  It makes the scale of the problem seem like individual posts  and that they're ruling an individual post  when the problem is large and at scale.  And let me tell you with artificial intelligence,  the 2024 election and disinformation  of social media is going to be a big challenge.  If you hate politics in your tech now,  you're gonna hate it a lot more in a year.

Transcript:  Actually this week, a congressional report found  that Metta and tax prep companies  recklessly shared taxpayers' data.  Another reason to dislike Metta,  this comes from the markup, the markup.org,  H&R Block, Tax Act and Tax Slayer had a tool called  the Metta Pixel on their software,  transmitting data to Facebook, to Metta,  as you filed your taxes using those programs  and those websites and it sent information  like your first and last name, your income,  your filing status and your refund amounts.

And I don't know how, I think we should investigate it.  H&R Block, Metta and Tax Slayer did not respond  to the markups requests for comment.  Google Analytics apparently does something similar.  A spokesperson for Google said the company  has strict policies and technical features  to stop Google Analytics users  from collecting sensitive data.  And I think that that's the case.  We use Google Analytics and even though it's been banned  in Denmark and some other countries, we continue to use it.  I've been trying to not use it,  but our advertisers demand it.

Transcript:  It's interesting how immune we've become to this idea  that privacy is really non-existent at this point.  And David, you bring up really good points  about Metta's track record.  And there was this really clear hesitation  with a lot of people about whether they should join threads  because of all the reasons that you bring up,  but it's also a testament to how desperate people are  to find that Twitter alternative.  And I think that's really the takeaway here  is that people were so desperate  that they had to essentially choose  between the quote unquote lesser of two evils.  And it's just our reality.

It was once valuable, but I think you can't,  you must know if you use Twitter today  that you are kind of supporting something  that doesn't deserve your support.  And yet I know so many people that are still on Twitter.  As a company, we still use Twitter  as much as I've tried to stop it.  It's hard.  It's hard.  It's the only thing-

And he's an incredible actor  who does amazing stuff in his films,  and they're really good movies,  and yet the Scientology thing.  So do you draw the line and say,  I'm boycotting Tom Cruise films.  And again, I respect people who do,  but the fact is most people aren't.  And it's a weird moral choice.

Transcript:  I think the idea is we use this power  to push these companies into the right direction.  I would argue that Facebook has been  under a lot of scrutiny.  They have improved a lot of ways.  One thing that's interesting about threads,  people just say it's a Twitter alternative,  but their mission statement's kind of different than Twitter.  They've publicly said they don't want to focus  on hard news and politics.  They wanna focus on people's hobbies and interests  and form communities around them.  They're not gonna stop people from.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Well, one interesting thing is you don't,  if you go and post something, just because you post it,  it doesn't get into people's feeds.  So it's algorithm, it's the algorithm.  Yeah, I mean, the big thing with threads  is the responses get the interest.  So if you look at your feed,  it's all about responses to things.  So that's one way that they change things.  I would also argue that Facebook has a better,  I don't know if you try to block anyone on threads yet.  It's more interesting than Twitter  because when you block them, it goes,  do you want to block all their further attempts  of creating another account on our service?  Kind of like Instagram.  And you can choose that option.  Yeah, it's interesting.  And so that goes a lot further  than just blocking that one account.  It's gonna go and try to block any further creations.  They have a little bit better moderation,  but Facebook has also been famous for having very good  or better moderation in the United States  than other countries because of the marketing here.  So I think we need to hold threads  their feet to the fire on this,  but they are at least trying to create  a nicer social network.  They just ban people right away, right?  They're not taking, and there's a thing,  if you try to follow, is that Donald Trump Jr.  it warns you, he posts like false information.  People on the right were going crazy about it.  They are that network that Elon is trying not to be,  but a lot of people are like, no, we want that network.  And some people, I think it's an interesting choice.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  He can give that moral alternative  that people are looking for, not on Twitter, right?  A lot of people want that.  It's like what I was mentioning,  couple of times on the other times you had me on here with,  I think verification should be offered to everyone  where it's tied to your name and your actual identity.  And you should be able to sort by that.  That'll help filter out a lot of trolls  who rely on being anonymous on the internet.  And they're starting to go down that route.  They haven't offered yet the whole verification to everyone,  but it's kinda getting there.  So it's about markets, right?  I always tell people corporations aren't evil per se.  Capitalism isn't evil.  It's an amoral system.  It reflects whatever people are looking for.  So if you wanna have like, back in the 60s  when we had segregation and companies cater to that,  it was the market and that's what was reflected.  Now today it's the opposite.  Corporations are like, wait, if we appeal to more people  and different genders and identities and all that,  we increase our market share, we can make more money.  So now it's the opposite.  And now the right wing is getting all of a sudden  really upset about capitalism and the free market.  So it's really interesting how these systems work.  Isn't that a shift?  That's hysterical.  Yeah, I saw the other day, it was Andrew Tate's tweet  and he was going about the system  and it sounded like a Rage Against the Machine song.  Like, his husband's 12 years old.  And I was just like,  he basically made the Marxist argument of alienation  in today's, but he wouldn't say that.  I'm like, you're a closet Marxist.  Isn't that hysterical?  That's what's happening to the extreme right.  They're basically turning to Marxist,  but they don't know that because they don't read Marx.  So it's like, and I don't mean that they think  communism is the answer, but this is again,  the misunderstanding with Marxism, right?  Like people just only know the second half.  They don't know the criticism part.  So they're almost there.  They've like connected the dots,  but they haven't seen the big picture yet.  It's really hilarious.

Transcript:  You know, I'm reminded of that bumper sticker, you know,  if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.  And every time I see that I'm going,  well, you can't live your life in outrage.  You'll have an ulcer and die at the age of 40.  So the question, I think it's kind of an ancient question  is how do you live in a world  that doesn't live up to your standards?  How do you survive in a world like that?  Where you, and you know, Dan,  maybe you've got the right idea,  which is you push them in the right direction,  but you can't be perfect.  I think religion has handled this.  You know, the Christian religion tradition is  we're all sinners, but it's okay  if you acknowledge it and repent, we'll forgive you.  And I think that that was religion's way of dealing  with what must have been, from time immemorial,  this conflict between I know what's right and good,  but I also have to live in a world that is not good.  How do you deal with that?  And I'm not perhaps 100% good.  How do you survive that without being outraged at all times?  It is an eternal question.

You've been through this.  I was just too close to it for a long time.  Yeah.  And we all kind of in the back of our minds  know these stories.  I don't think there's anybody who doesn't know  what happened or who hasn't read what happened with Metta,  but how do you live with it in the modern world?  How do you survive without walking through life  being outraged at all times?  Maybe you have to believe in redemption and forgiveness.  Maybe that's the secret, I don't know.

I mean, it really is the topic of the hour.  It's so interesting to watch companies, you know,  Meta says, oh, the metaverse, forget that.  We're not interested in that.  Or, you know, Google and Microsoft and all these guys.  Yeah, yeah, we were just kidding about that stuff.  It's AI.  AI is the hot ticket.  You think AI can solve this social problem  by being better and more proactive  at protecting social networks?  See, I worry about this, Daniel.  I think that I don't wanna trust the machine to do this work.  No human should have to either, I understand.

Transcript:  Yeah, so Solve is doing a lot of heavy lifting.  I wouldn't say Solve, but definitely AIDEN, right?  So there's already this stuff out there, right?  Twitter sentiment analysis has been known  for a long time, right?  So this looks at your word structure  and the types of words you're using  and assigns ratings to those words  based on negative, positive, or neutral.  And like, you can actually analyze your entire account.  It'll go through all your tweets  and it'll give you like a rating,  like whether or not, like on average,  you're a pretty angry person,  or you're a pretty positive person,  or you write neutral stuff.  There's no reason why then you couldn't have  your own personalized algorithm  based on positive or neutral information coming in.  Well, that's true.

Start time: 4907.10

Transcript:  I mean, one of our sponsors, Grammarly,  does sentiment analysis on your writing.  Right.  And will even say, I've seen it happen to my wife.  You know, you should really tone that down.  Yep.  You might wanna put please and thank you in there,  that kind of thing.  She's busy.  Yeah, so.  She doesn't have time to do that.

Start time: 4924.18
End time: 5079.56
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  That's one way for viewing information  is to have it apply to your algorithm  and just have that as an option to choose.  Or, you know, threads, they want to implement this,  could basically try to block the most negative stuff  and just say, you know, kind of like,  I don't like a lot of stuff that Musk said,  but what was his phrase?  It was free speech without reach.  You know, this idea that like,  if you post negative stuff,  like you're free to do it,  but we're not gonna like promote it, right?  I actually agree with that.  And I think, again, sentiment analysis can play a part  in analyzing those messages  and making sure that they don't get,  they don't show up in people's timelines as much.  And then you can also have it on your end.  You mentioned Grammarly,  but and Twitter kind of does this already, right?  I don't know if you've ever tried to respond to someone  with a lot of swears, say something mean.  It's like.  Do you really mean that?  Our audience doesn't really like that, you know?  So they're already kind of using that already, right?  So you can kind of do it on that end as well.  So that is one way, you know?  And we already have Bot Sentinel,  which is another Twitter tool that goes through  and analyzes accounts based on  whether they're trolling or not.  And it's a really interesting thing.  And I see people using it.  They'll be like, they'll see someone,  they'll do an analysis and they give the Bot Sentinel score  and it's like, oh, this person,  cause you'll see it'll be like red hot,  you know, they're trolling, right?  And just looks at their history.  So that's where I think like AI machine learning,  sentiment analysis can play a role.  I don't think it's going to solve problems.  I still would like to get people just to stop posting  unnecessarily everything that comes in their head.  I don't think people need to share an opinion  on every single thing in their life,  but that's a separate issue.  Oh my God, I got to talk about that forever too, yeah.  Yeah.  So I think this stuff can at least start to play a role  in moderation, cause you're right,  you don't want humans doing it.  Capital intensive, right?  It's super expensive.  It's just hard on humans too.  You get to do that in all the countries.  Yeah, especially with the image analysis, right?  There's been famous articles written about that  and the problems there.  But first you have to train the AI from humans,  you know, to get to that level.  So that's what I'm hoping, you know,  especially stuff for violence  and things we don't want to see.  Really, you know, AI I think does have a potential there  to filter out things.  The problem of course is there will be controversies, right?  Some good stuff will get caught up in the bad  and then there'll be, you know, charges.  And this is where transparency in algorithms,  I think, you know, really does play a role in all of it.  Company seems to be a little bit more forthright.

Transcript:  Sometimes you have to see the bad stuff.  Look, Blue Sky's going through this controversy right now  where they are making tools that allow you  to not see things like racial slurs in user names.  That doesn't mean they're not being used  and not being used to target people.  I mean, that's one reason I never turn the filters on  because I want to know.  You want to know what's there.  Yeah.  I think that like just pretending it's not there  doesn't make the problem go away.  It just puts you into a different filter bubble.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  There's definitely some true to,  you don't want to filter out everything necessarily,  but on the other hand, I think it's been proven over time  and this gets into the, you know, regulation stuff.  People like moderated communities.  Yeah, that's for sure.  This was always an issue on forums.  You know, like on forums, you know,  when people go off topic or gets into politics,  the moderator comes in, bans people.  Some people don't like that decision being made,  but people like that. No, you have to do it.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Right, and a lot of people just don't want that.  So this idea of like having sort of a machine learning act  as a moderation tool, I think is, you know, something that,  and that's why, again, threads is kind of proving  this point, right?  A lot of people say like, well,  why is threads so much better than Twitter?  A lot of us are like, it's not Elon.  That's almost enough, you know, which is kind of sad,  but the bar is pretty low for threads right now.  Yeah.

Transcript:  This is interesting because when chat GPT came out,  actually Dolly before it and then stable to fusion,  people were kind of acting as if a guy  could solve every problem.  And I think one of the things that's happened  over the last few months, which is good,  is people are starting to say, well, it can't,  but there are some uses of AI in a kind of directed manner  that do make sense.  You know, using, I saw a farm machine  that goes through the fields and zaps weeds without,  because it recognizes weeds without zapping the plants.  Now they're doing that with pests as well,  because it's using AI to recognize that's a pest,  that's a plant, using lasers to zap the pests.  So there are some kind of more restrictive,  good uses of AI than just kind of generally  just throwing AI at everything.  I think that's a good tendency  because we've been really over,  I feel like overhyping AI.  You agree, Ibar?  How do you come down on this one?

Start time: 5245.02

Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really all we've been talking about,  but I think you bring up a good point.  With any new technology, with any platform in general,  I do see a lot of parallels between,  you know, it's kind of comparing apples to oranges,  but there are a lot of parallels between,  you know, social media existing and how we choose to use it,  and AI existing and how we choose to use it.  And I think there is a combination of fear and hope  when it comes to AI.  A little bit more fear probably,  it's not a 50-50 split here, but I do-

Start time: 5270.26

It's not a constant level of being at peace with it  or being fearful of it.  It's very much this, there's spikes and then it drops.  But, you know, I think it's really, really great  to see people in various sectors and professions  speaking up about it and saying,  we need to figure this out now.  We need, like before it's too late,  we need to put up those guardrails.  So I think it's great that people are terrified  and outraged and speaking up about it  because, you know, we could potentially reduce any harm  that will come out of it.

The AI safety group that's saying,  oh my God, it's an existential threat to humankind.  Their machines are gonna,  and then there's the AI ethics group  of which Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell  with their stochastic parrots and others  who are I think a little bit more sensible are saying,  look, don't, AI is not gonna eat humans,  but we should be very concerned  about the ethical problems with AI.  Face recognition, being less reliable  with people of color, things like that.  Those are the things we should be paying attention  to do today.

It is, he wrote the book, it is 10 years old now,  but if you haven't read it, Super Intelligence,  Paths, Danger, Strategies, great book,  Super Intelligence, Paths, Danger, Strategies.  He told me, I'm paraphrasing, but he told me  the great danger of artificial intelligence  is that we will anthropomorphize it  and we will overestimate its capabilities,  which puts us at risk of underestimating  the potential problems and harms.  And I think that might be the space  for him right now. That's exactly right.

Transcript:  wasn't he? Right, yeah.  Bostrom came up with what's called  the paperclip maximizer, which is that, you know,  if we don't tune the values of artificial intelligence  to be in line with human values  and we give it a problem to solve  and we say like, make paperclips,  we don't say, make paperclips for 10 minutes  and then stop.  AI is just going to make paperclips  until the universe is a bunch of paperclips.

The problem with the AI is the humans  and you've got to give it the right rules.  It's just going to do what you tell it to do.

Transcript:  So Cathy is one of the smartest people  in the business right now.  And she's connected to this whole network  of people who are academics  and very smart people who are probably not  camera trained and not loud voices,  very smart and really paying attention  to the issues of AI ethics, AI bias,  because like we've already noted here,  if you train AI on a corpus of data  that happens to be biased,  not that we're all racist,  but if you take a corpus of data  that is just from one source,  it is going to inherently be biased towards that source.  So you will have on the output,  you will have ends that aren't for the good of all humanity.  They will only serve that one particular group of people.  Cathy lists the potential real world harms  that we could experience right now.  And I think that's really important to pay attention to  so we don't get distracted  by the existential potential problems.  There's one other challenge.  I sometimes feel like-  That no one's talking about,  which is climate change.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hold on just a second,  but I sometimes feel like-  Yeah, yeah, sorry.  People like Sam Altman have a vested interest in us-  Yes, distraction.  Ignoring AI ethics and worrying  about the existential threat to humankind.  They want us to worry about this.  Pay no attention to the ethical concerns  or the immediate concerns.  Let's really think about what AI is gonna be like  when it turns the world into a bunch of paper clips.  And I think that's a little self-serving.  I've been wondering why these people  who seem to be really knowledgeable about AI  are so worried about AI taking over the world.  I don't think that's the problem in any near-term future.  All right, let's take a break  before we talk about climate change.  No, no, I'm all done.  Yeah, I think I will watch this  because it sounds like Kathy Baxter gets it.  She works at Salesforce,  but it sounds like that's exactly what she's saying.  Right?  Am I right?  Am I paraphrasing her correctly?  Yeah, you're exactly right.  That's what she's saying.  Yeah.  Don't worry about these more approximate issues.  No, you don't have to worry about the 23rd century  in AI taking over.  Let's break though.  We got a great panel, lots more to talk about.  Let's get into AI in a second.  That's our next topic of discussion.  But first, a word from Zip Recruiter.  I know all about how hard it is to hire people  as the owner of a small business.  Plus, as the owner of a small business,  I know that you're not just dealing with hiring,  you're dealing with economic uncertainty,  an economy that's up and down.  We've all got the challenges,  but at least when it comes to getting the right people,  you've got a hiring partner  who's focused on you and your needs.  It's the one we use and the one I highly recommend,  Zip Recruiter.  If you're hiring,  you gotta hire the right people faster, more efficiently.  You gotta keep costs down.  Zip Recruiter helps you do all that.  From pricing to technology,  everything that Zip Recruiter does is to help you  and what works best for you.  And I want you to try them free right now,  ziprecruiter.com slash,  I can go on and on.  I have gone on and on about all the things  Zip Recruiter does for us,  but let me give you in a nutshell,  some of the things Zip Recruiter does to take care of you.  The pricing, completely straightforward.  You're gonna know exactly what it costs  before you post your job.  No surprises, you can stick to your budget.  You're in charge of that.  You'll also reach more people than anywhere else  because Zip Recruiter sends your job post  to more than 100 job sites.  You're casting the widest possible net.  One thing I've really learned is,  hiring is what makes your company.  Your company's made of people.  Hiring the right person makes a huge difference  at your company.  Hiring the wrong person also makes a huge difference.  The wrong kind of difference.  You wanna hire the right person.  Zip Recruiter really helps with this  because once you post your job,  their smart technology will pinpoint candidates  that qualify and send you their names.  They'll find great candidates for you,  give you the opportunity to invite them  to apply for your job.  So you look at the resume, Zip Recruiter says,  in this, when we post on Zip Recruiter,  it's breakfast, Lisa says,  oh, we just got, Ashley just gave us notice.  We've gotta find somebody in the continuity department.  So she'll post it at breakfast, right?  Job opening.  Now immediately that's going out to 100 job sites.  So it's going to a lot of people.  But then Zip Recruiter goes through the million resumes,  the current resumes they have on file,  because people come to Zip Recruiter looking for work,  and they say, well look, here's five people  that fit the qualifications you just posted.  Lisa looks at those and goes, oh, that's good.  Oh, that one's great.  No, I don't want that one.  And then invites the people she likes to apply  to the next step.  I gotta tell you, when you invite somebody  to apply for your job, they apply.  It's like, it's an honor.  They're thrilled, right?  So it's a great way to start your conversation  with a candidate.  And then, of course, you're gonna beat the other businesses  to the punch, because you're gonna get those people,  they're gonna apply, you're gonna hire them.  And by lunch, we start at breakfast, by lunch,  we always have two or three great candidates.  That's a nice feeling, especially when you're scrambling  to fill a position.  Hire the best people with the help of a partner  who's all about you, making your life easier.  ZipRecruiter, four out of five employers  who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  within the first day.  You wanna try it free?  Go to our special address, ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  Please use that address so they know you saw it here.  ZipRecruiter.com slash TWIT.  I can tell you for a fact, ZipRecruiter,  it's the smartest way to hire.  All right, back to AI.  Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI.  This is actually an interesting case.  And while I'm a huge fan,  I'm not sure I agree with the case.  She says you can go to chat GPT,  she's suing OpenAI and Metta, along with others.  She's a comedian, of course,  author of a book called Bedwetter.  She says you can go to chat GPT and say,  summarize Bedwetter, and chat GPT will summarize it,  which she says proves that it's read my book,  that it's somewhere seen my book  and absorbed it into its corpus.  She says the reason is because,  even though her book is copyrighted,  there are a number of sites which will illicitly,  torrent sites and so forth,  put shadow libraries of copyrighted material online.  And that chat GPT has then scanned those,  and that's how it knows what her book is.  Is there merit in this case?  I love Sarah Silverman,  but I don't think there's any merit to this case at all.

Transcript:  It also feels like there's no precedent yet.  So this could be the determinant here,  where what becomes of copyright law with something like AI?  I don't know the answer to that either,  but I think this will be really interesting  in terms of setting that precedent,  seeing what happens from here.  Yeah.

Transcript:  It's the same as an artist suing stable diffusion,  because, well, you must have looked at my art  and you must be able to draw something that looks like me,  or Getty saying, well, we can see kind of fragments  of our watermark on some of the images that you're putting up  so that you must have looked at our stuff.  But here's why I think there's no merit in this at all.  If you ask me to summarize Bedwetter,  I have read it and I can summarize it.  Is that violating Sarah Silverman's copyright?  Absolutely not.

Start time: 6097.00
End time: 6109.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Yeah, it's gonna look like Kinkade painted it,  but it's not the same painting.  Yeah.  We'll see.  I think the courts are gonna universally say no,  that that's not copying.  That's synthesizing.  Anyway, it would be very interesting.  Very interesting to see.  Abhar, what do you think?

End time: 6268.08
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I do think it's unlikely that they would side with Silverman,  but I do think at the end of the day,  what's interesting here is that fear, right?  That fear from a lot of creators.  Oh, I understand it.  Absolutely.  Yeah, so I think it's interesting to see  what becomes of that,  and it is very reflective of that general anxiety  about what can this do, what can we allow it to do,  what should we allow it to do?  But I think you definitely have a point in terms of,  I don't have a lot of faith that they'll be like,  okay, no, you can't do that.  I do think you have a point there.

Transcript:  Well, the courts could.  I mean, if they did say that,  they would really put a block in front of AI's development.  It would slow it down quite a bit if you can't just...  You know, there's an interesting article about AI using Brave  now is apparently allowing AI companies  to take copyright data and use it for AI training.  This is an article from StackDiary, Alex Ivanov's,  the shady world of Brave selling copyrighted data  for AI training.  But see, Google's been doing this too.  Brave is going out and using its spider  to try to create a search index to compete with Google.  And apparently you can.  Brave offers numerous API products,  some of which are specifically designed for AI.  In fact, one's called Data for AI,  lets you feed results to AI models for inference.  You pay, if you pay for it,  you can get all that info that Brave is spidering  for its search index and use it for your AI.  So they're even enabling this.  But I don't buy the headline, the shady world of Brave,  because I don't think it's shady, is it?  If it were private information, yes.  Google has proposed using something like robots.txt,  it wouldn't be robots.txt, but some sort of file.  As you may know, you can keep Google  from indexing your website with a simple text file  in the directory of your website saying,  it gives permissions to spiders and so forth,  saying don't index this, index this.  You can say do not index any of my site  if you don't want your site  to show up in Google search results.  Google is proposing something similar for AI,  which probably is a good idea.  But I don't think there's a legal requirement  that you would do that.  I think that if it's a public website,  it's a public website.  You're not saying, well, a human can look at this,  but no machine can.  Or, I mean, that's what robots.txt says,  no machines allowed, humans only.  All right, you guys have nothing to say about that,  so I'm gonna move on.  It's a very interesting, it's a brave new world  we're part of.

Transcript:  Well, certainly that's one of the things  the Hollywood writers, the Writers Guild of America,  and now the actors are worried about,  SAG-AFTRA going out on strike.  Boy, you got the actors and the writers out.  I don't think there's gonna be a lot of new  Hollywood material coming out anytime soon.  Actors say one of the reasons they're striking  is because Hollywood studios will sign deals  that basically give them the rights forever  to your digital likeness.  And so the SAG-AFTRA is saying,  we wanna prevent this, the association, I'm sorry,  Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers  say, well, we have something that's gonna protect actors.  But the groundbreaking proposal, according to The Verge,  that they offered is that background performers  should be able to be scanned, get one day's pay,  and then the company owns the scan, the image,  their likeness, and could be able to use it  for the rest of eternity on any project they want  with no consent and no compensation.  That's their proposal.  Sounds like a great deal.

It wasn't for the actors,  although the actors were doing it too.  So then what happened was Joan had a bad day,  she came home, she turned on Netflix,  and then one of the first shows,  it's not called Netflix though, it's called Streamberry,  which is a really great name.  Streamberry.  If you go to Streamberry,  you can create your own blah, blah, blah is awful.  So I created a Daniel's awful show,  And here it is, Streamberry.tv.

So what happens, Joan comes home from work,  she turns on Streamberry,  and is watching it with her boyfriend,  and the show comes on called Joan is Awful,  and the lead is Selma Hayek.  I think it was Selma Hayek.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  But she has the same haircut as Joan does,  and they start watching it,  and Joan's horrified to find that it's basically her day  acted out.  And what they're doing is they're using,  Selma Hayek actually didn't act,  they just used her face,  because she signed a contract saying that they can just use  her face for whatever they want.  And so the show is entirely generated by AI,  not in real time, but a couple hours later.  Oh my God, they've done it.

And then sometimes they take liberties  with some things to add drama.  And then as the show progresses,  it turns out that they plan to do this  for everyone who signs up for Streamberry,  that they're all gonna have their own show.  Wow.

And it has a very meta ending to it  that kind of just really starts to hurt your brain,  in terms of how deep the AI and supercomputer thing goes.  But it's, I mean, it's that much different  from what this is proposed with these actors,  which is pretty absurd in my opinion,  that I almost get like, we can scan you and use you,  but the no compensation part.  Forever and ever.  Amen.  I mean, if they had compensation,  I could see the benefit there for the actor maybe,  but nothing, and not even an acknowledgement,  that's just like, I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah, the nanny is the president of SAG-AFTRA.  And she is great.  I voted for her and I support her.  Let me see if I can,  should I play a little bit of this?  Let me see.  Bob Iger says, oh, you know, we don't care.  Disney doesn't need these guys.  He said, this was at the Sun Valley conference.  Bob Iger said, they're not being realistic.  So Fran Drescher said in response,  I found his remarks terribly repugnant and out of touch.  You have to do it in the nanny's accent though.  Positively tone deaf, I don't think it served him well.  If I were that company, I would lock him behind doors  and never let him talk to anybody about this  because it's so obvious he has no clue  into what is really happening on the ground  with hardworking, hardworking, hardworking,  hardworking people that don't make  anywhere near the salary he's making.  High seven figures, eight figures.  This is crazy money they make.  I don't care.  And they don't care if they're land barons  of a medieval time.  I want to find a recording of that.

I'm sure that could be done.  I was going to say though,  what's interesting too is none of this is completely new,  of course, right?  On Netflix, they're running that really good short series  about American gladiators.  And that was the theme of that show  where all the members were getting paid,  the gladiators were barely getting anything.  They're getting no residuals.  They're getting nothing from the toys.  That was terrible.  And then, yeah, then they kind of gathered together  almost as a union, but not quite.  And they went and said, hey, we would like more money.  They got fired on the spot.  And it was Samuel Goldwyn.  He was like, we don't renegotiate.  And that was just like, something's been going on forever.

Walked out of the London premiere of the movie  when the strike was announced, they said,  oh, we're on strike, bye-bye.  Which makes you wonder who's gonna promote these films  if the actors won't show up.  This is not good.  Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon  walked out from the London premiere of Oppenheimer  to quote, write their picket signs  ahead of the strike Thursday evening.

Transcript:  We love having you on, Dan.  Sorry to be so sanctimonious.  No, that's not sanctimony.  That's the conscience speaking  and I think it's really important.  It really is.  I've been bringing it up,  but I've been bringing it up gently  in all our conversations about threads.  You know, it's meta, right?  You know, does that bother you?  Yeah.  I got off Facebook years ago,  because I don't-  Yeah, I deleted mine.  Yeah, me too.  And I don't have WhatsApp.  I had to have Instagram,  but not so much to contribute up to it,  but more because if you're not logged in,  you can't show people's Instagram pictures  and sometimes that's how we would show  that content on the shows.  But then it made it really easy for me  just to slide into threads and they got me.  And so now you're making me think twice  and I think you're right, absolutely right.  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  There are a number of good reasons to use a VPN.  Security, privacy, eliminating geographic restrictions.  But I gotta tell you, there's only one VPN  I recommend for these purposes and that's ExpressVPN  because they do it right.  Let's talk about geographic restrictions.  I have a Netflix account, right?  But only when I'm in the US,  all I can see is Netflix US.  If I travel, I could see Netflix in the UK or Japan  or wherever I am, they're all over the world.  In fact, I think they're in 100 different countries.  Wouldn't it be cool if you didn't have to leave the US  to be in another part of the world?  Well, you can.  There are tens of thousands of shows on Netflix  that you don't get to see because you're in the US.  Watching Netflix without using ExpressVPN would be like,  I don't know, paying for a gym membership  but only using the treadmill.  Baby, you got lots of stuff out there.  ExpressVPN lets you change your online location  so you control where you want Netflix to think you are.  So I was watching Netflix in Italy.  I was thinking, this is great stuff.  Well, now I can do that anytime.  ExpressVPN is all over the world,  over 100 server locations  and it works with other services too,  BBC's iPlayer, YouTube and more.  It is a real boon if you're a traveler,  but it's even if you're just at home,  if you wanna watch, let's say, Top Gear,  you just go to UK Netflix, bada bing, bada boom.  Jurassic World's on the Hong Kong Netflix,  Pulp Fiction's on Canadian Netflix.  Here's how it works.  ExpressVPN's got an app for every platform,  Windows, Mac, even Linux, iOS, Android, even routers.  They sell a great little router you could put in your house  and now the whole house is on ExpressVPN.  Very cool.  So you fire up the app.  Now normally you just press the big button  and it chooses the server that's closest to you  because that's gonna be the fastest speed,  but here's the trick.  You can say, no, no, I wanna be in the UK today.  You tap that button,  suddenly your IP address is no longer visible.  The IP address you're merging  under the public internet with is in England  and so sure, watch whatever you want.  Why should you choose ExpressVPN?  Blazing fast speeds let you stream in HD  anywhere in the world.  It's compatible with all your devices  and privacy is job one.  ExpressVPN goes the extra mile  and I know this because they have  independent third party audits.  ExpressVPN runs a special distribution of Debian  that automatically wipes the entire hard drive every day.  They also wrote their own trusted server  which has been vetted by third parties.  It operates sandboxed in RAM  and as soon as you close the server, it's gone forever.  Only you are on that server.  So there's no logging, no trace of your presence.  It is truly private  and of course everything you do is encrypted  so you're fully secure.  Be smart, stop paying full price for streaming services  and only getting access to a fraction of their content.  Get your money's worth with a great service  that protects your privacy and security at the same time.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  When you use that link, expressvpn.com slash twit,  you'll get an extra three months of ExpressVPN  free with a one year package.  Brings the price down below seven bucks a month.  It's a good deal.  Expressvpn.com slash twit.  Thank you so much for their support of our network.  If you, we had a little party here  the other night, Friday night.  It was kind of wild.  It was a lot of fun.

Transcript:  Listen, an addiction is an addiction.  That's where I stand.  It's the one social media platform that I feel like,  I don't feel worse after I'm on it.  And I think a lot of people are in that same boat  where a lot of people just become hooked on it.  It's a really, the algorithm is.  And it's harmless, right?  It's not.  You know, as I will not go on the record saying that,  but I will say that I don't want that to be attributed to me  if I'm absolutely wrong.  But personally, I do feel like, you know, for me,  you know, you're gonna be at risk of sharing too much data  no matter what platform you join in 2023, right?  And so for me, what it ends up becoming  is it's a platform where I don't feel myself, you know,  I don't feel like I'm comparing myself to other people  like I do with Instagram.  And I don't feel like I am just, you know,  becoming undone every time I open up this app.  It's an app that I open up,  it shows me exactly what I wanna see.  I get a good laugh.  And it brings a lot of people joy.  And I think, you know,  I actually read a really interesting article  from Taylor Lorenz that really echoes what I feel  in terms of people talking about Twitter versus threads,  but really TikTok is the winner for a lot of people  because that's where I go when I want to know  about a trend or a product,  or know if other people feel the same way that I do,  that's the platform that I gravitate towards.  And so I think that's why TikTok really has continued  to grow and that's why people don't feel deterred  by a lot of the concerns that, you know,  lawmakers bring up and a lot of privacy  and security experts bring up.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, and if you're worried about privacy,  everybody just jumped on threads.  I mean, if you look at the stuff threads gathers about you,  what is the argument that doesn't send it  to the Chinese government?  Is that the issue?  Right, and that's something people bring up.  Because it does send data brokers  and if the Chinese government or anybody else  wants that information,  they can buy it cheap from data brokers.  They don't need TikTok to gather that information.  Meta is doing it for them.

Transcript:  So Taylor had a very interesting couple of pieces  because I don't know what it is about TikTok,  but there's a certain group of society that just,  it's just, oh, it's TikTok.  So the latest Today Show,  the Today Show actually ran a segment  on a dangerous TikTok trend called  the Boat Jumping Challenge,  where people were apparently jumping off boats  and they said many have died,  except it didn't happen.  And good on Taylor for looking into it.  Stories were published in People Magazine,  Forbes, the Daily Mail, the New York Post,  and the Mail and Post tell you something,  both Murdoch publications,  that there is some political slant to this.  There was no, as Taylor writes,  there was no boat jumping challenge on TikTok.  Before the media frenzy,  no boat jumping videos had gone viral,  no hashtag related to jumping off boats  had ever been popular on TikTok.  Not a single trending audio on TikTok  has ever been linked to jumping off boats.  So it started with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency  saying on July 3rd, a news story was shared by Today,  by NBC's Today Show regarding first responders warning  against a deadly boating TikTok trend.  Please be advised the information was wrong.  There is no record of this happening.  Until Thursday of this week,  the spokespeople for Today wouldn't refuse to comment.  Finally, Today admitted it and has retracted the story.

Transcript:  Didn't happen.  But it does feel like a lot of publications do hop on  that when they hear about something  that feeds into that bias of,  okay, TikTok is dangerous, let's talk about this.  Let's really lean into the fact that it's dangerous  because of XYZ and with a non-equal distribution  in terms of talking about the other social platforms  and the dangers that they might present.

Transcript:  The origin of the boat jumping challenge,  Taylor Lorenz writes, can be traced in the Washington Post,  could be traced to a single comment  that a local Alabama resident made during a news broadcast.  Bobby Poitevin, a multimedia journalist at ABC News  in Birmingham got a tip about boating accidents,  spoke to Jim Dennis.  During the interview, Dennis claimed it was TikTok  that was causing children to jump off the back of boats.  He just made that up.  It was wrong.  It's the same thing with the Tide Pod challenge  and the Benadryl challenge.  We had in the Petaluma, our local paper read a story,  oh, it's all over TikTok, teens are going up to doors  and kicking on them and then running away,  kind of a, what is it, a ding and dash,  dong and dash, ding dong and dash.  Doorbell ditch.  Doorbell ditch.  Sounds like you know a little bit about that there, Benito.  And they were saying, people were terrified,  there were shootings, never happened, never happened.  I don't know what it is, we just wanna believe this stuff.

Transcript:  That's what it is.  So don't worry, kids are not jumping off boats.  The Today Show says that was wrong.  And don't kill wasps with gasoline,  that's not a good idea either.  So what about the states, well actually,  Texas has been sued now over its TikTok band,  saying that's a violation of the First Amendment,  government cannot do that.  And you know what, I think that's a good point.  The Knight First Amendment Institute  at Columbia University filed a lawsuit  against the Texas TikTok band.  So maybe these bands, Montana has one,  Alabama has one, I think.  That's right, yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting.  Obviously people are not gonna take it well  if you're banning an app that popular.  I mean, I have to say that TikTok has the same issues  that other platforms have in terms of,  you will come across content, especially younger users,  that might make them feel bad about their bodies.  That's up to the parents, yeah.  Right, that is an argument that's up to parents.  It goes back to the discussion  that we've had this whole show of,  is it the platforms or is it the ways  that people use those platforms?  But I can't rave about TikTok without also saying,  there is a caveat here, it's not all great content  that's gonna make you feel amazing,  but there are certain demographics  that might struggle more with the content  that they see versus the content that I see.  So I just had to put that out there too.

My son though has moved to Instagram for the most part,  Instagram and YouTube, but he got to start on TikTok.  It's funny, he went from zero to,  it just took a few months because the algorithm picked it up.  And once the algorithm picks it up, it launches you.  It's pretty cool.

So the way I described it in my video,  which is really weird,  but I said it smells like dirty outside,  which if you don't live in San Francisco,  you might not understand,  but it's basically like, that's what I feel like it smells.  What is wrong with Elon?  We have to have a whole show about that  if you want an answered.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Start time: 8548.66
End time: 8577.46
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  It was a whole debacle.  I was supposed to have access for presale.  As we all know, Ticketmaster is a disaster.  It didn't work out.  And then a friend of a friend sold them a face value for me.  So bless her.  I hope she knows how much I appreciate it.  She doesn't even know me personally,  but my friend told her that I am a die hard.  What's wrong with her?  I'm glad she believed her.  Did she not want to see Taylor?  They had two friends that were successful.  So they didn't need both tickets.  It was like a friend group that broke it all up.  So thank you to that person, that kind soul.

Transcript:  California Senate Bill 829 bars entertainment facilities  like arena amphitheaters and stadiums  from entering into exclusivity contracts  with ticketing companies like Ticketmaster.  Yes.  Let's hope that that passes because this is the problem  is that Ticketmaster insists on exclusivity with the venues.  And so artists like Taylor Swift have no choice  but to use Ticketmaster.  And then it becomes a personal battle.

Start time: 8606.32
End time: 8623.94
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  It falls upon the artist to kind of like,  she's really been pushing and speaking openly  against Ticketmaster as much as she can.  Not that she can do that much,  but the onus falls upon them to make their fans happy.  But Live Nation is just such a huge force  and venues don't want to lose out on that revenue either.

Start time: 8652.02
End time: 8685.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I've worked for football games.  I don't know.  Taytay is something else.  It's a next level.  So not being a Taylor Swift fan, I had no idea,  but I really admire her re-recording all of her albums  because she lost the rights to the masters.  That's right.  And so she said, well, fine.  I'm just going to record them as Taylor's version.  And all my fans will buy from now on  instead of the old version, they'll buy Taylor's version.  I really admire that.  So I listened to the whole album.  I enjoyed it.  I love that.  I'm not a young woman.  I feel like it's music for young women, primarily.

Start time: 8685.98
End time: 8701.47
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  It can be.  Well, the thing that's really great about this  is as much of a burden as it was  for her to go through that and re-record everything.  And as much as it surely cost her a lot of money to do it,  but people are rediscovering those albums.  So that came out in 2010, but the re-release is in 2023.  So I don't know if she listened to it in 2010.

Start time: 8702.18
End time: 8715.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now she's a more mature and has lived life.  So I mean, Christina Warren's also a big fan.  She's been reviewing track by track.  Would you say, are they identical?  No, her voice is even different, right?

Start time: 8716.06
End time: 8737.78
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  Her voice is different.  That's actually better.  She's richer.  It's fuller.  Her vocals are more mature.  Exactly, it's richer.  And also, there's very, very slight differences  in the songs, but usually it's better.  And it just sounds cleaner.  Her voice has improved, obviously, over the years.  So it's like the new and improved.  It's like a remastered version.  Are the music tracks the same?

Start time: 8737.86
End time: 8743.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, are they roughly the same?  The production is the same.  They're not rearranging it.  It's just the remaking.

Start time: 8743.42
End time: 8751.30
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  Exactly, because if it was rearranged,  people would be compelled to listen to the old version  and that would completely defeat the purpose.  So they've done a really good job recreating everything.  Nice.

Start time: 8751.58
End time: 8766.82
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  Very nice.  How did she do this?  She owns also a Swift person and purchased the record.  And my daughter, we play Taylor Swift vinyl for her.  Your one-year-old is a Tay-Tay fan?

End time: 8774.04
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Traynham Young.  That's awesome.  But I'm curious, how did she do this?  Does she own the publishing?  Yeah, she wrote it.

Start time: 8774.08
End time: 8789.10
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  But she didn't own the masters?  Right.  Yeah, because she wrote the songs,  she was able to re-record them.  I think there's something that says that  you have to be able to distinguish them.  So there might be one word  that she sings slightly differently in the song.  Oh, there's something you can definitely hear the bass

Start time: 8789.30
End time: 8794.82
Speaker: Dan Patterson
Transcript:  or you can hear the instrumentation is different.  Exactly.  It's probably better.  It's a bit more subtle.

Start time: 8794.90
End time: 8813.84
Speaker: Abrar Al-Heeti
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the case.  Usually it is better.  I will say this is probably the album  that she's done the best job.  The production is the best  and the audio engineering has been the best  because I think for Red,  which she wrote at least a while ago,  there was some that I was like,  this doesn't feel finished.  But I think this one is definitely the cleanest example.  Nice.
