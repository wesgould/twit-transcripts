Hey, thanks for having me on the show.  Welcome to the show.  We thought it'd be good to have you because not only was CES this week,  but Samsung had its own little announcement.  There's a lot of phone news, but there's also a lot of news about big tech.  In fact, Denise, the radio show today, I had two, not one, but two different people say,  I don't want to use an Android phone because I don't want to patronize Google.  I don't want to use an Apple phone because I don't want to patronize Apple.  They both banned Parler and I don't want to use Amazon Web Services.  And I said, dude, you don't want to use the internet because big tech.

Start time: 254.15
End time: 302.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe them.  Both of them mentioned Oracle.  Yeah, I don't think the Oracle phone is on the horizon to be on.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Yeah.  However you feel.  I mean, look, I think it's pretty obvious that Twitter had to do what it did.  Facebook had to do what it did.  Even Amazon had to do what it did.  And Apple and Google are justified in pulling Parler  because the rhetoric was getting so heated and so...  And the advocacy of violence was so clear that this was the right thing to do.  In fact, there was a study, the Washington Post had a story that said,  ever since Twitter deplatformed the president,  fake reports of election fraud have gone down 73%.  Turned out it was all him.

Start time: 304.21
End time: 331.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And I mean, we could spend all this show talking about what's the right thing to do  and what's not the right thing to do and what's the moral thing to do and  who you want to be as a company.  But I can tell you that the legal departments of these companies aren't concerned with that.  They're concerned with these companies not being on the hook under Section 230  of the Communications Decency Act.  That's interesting.  Which does not protect them from the criminal acts of their users.

Start time: 332.30
End time: 339.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Section 230 doesn't go so far as to say if there is a post-advocating violence  that you are not responsible for it.

Start time: 340.39
End time: 368.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Correct.  Anything that is a federal crime is not within the safe harbor provided by Section 230.  No federal crimes, no IP violations.  You can thank Hollywood for that last one.  So of course, storming the Capitol is a federal crime.  Instigating people to storm the Capitol is a federal crime.  Anything involving interstate harm really is a federal crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're kind of rerunning a little bit of last week's episode, but you were in the chat room and  you were saying such interesting things, including that, that I wanted to get you on  this week and talk a little bit about that.  And some said, well, it may also be that their lawyers warned them, but that the  companies involved jumped at the opportunity.  They've been waiting for a good reason.  I don't know if that's true.  In fact, there's reporting that Jack Dorsey had to be talked into it by his team members.  He didn't want to block the president.

Start time: 401.30
End time: 466.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that rings true to me.  I'm not familiar with Jack.  I don't know Jack, but everything I've ever read about him seems to be very,  we want Twitter to be a pretty free and open platform as much as we can be.  And then over the years, he's had to back off of that because people have used the  platform for pretty awful things.  And really what I think you're really cutting to the heart of it, Leo, in that  there are a lot of people who feel like, okay, well, I get it that you have to  regulate people doing bad things on your platform.  But there are a lot of people out there who feel like it's not being policed even  handedly.  And all I can say to that is that there can be, when you're the president of the United  States, it's pretty visible.  When you're not, someone has to report it and then it has to be investigated.  And then they have to make the pretty draconian call to either suspend your account or  knock you off entirely.  And they do that on a daily basis.  How many hundreds or thousands of times?

Start time: 468.92
End time: 517.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The New York Times kind of backs up in a story from yesterday, what you said.  Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, is working remotely on a private island in  French Polynesia, frequented by celebrities escaping the paparazzi when a phone call  interrupted him on January 6th.  On the line was Viyaha Gadi, Twitter's top lawyer and safety expert.  She said that she and other company executives had decided to lock the president's account  temporarily.  So Dorsey wasn't even involved in that 12-hour ban.  Dorsey was concerned about the move, said two people with knowledge of the call.  He had resisted this, obviously, for four years.  But he had delegated these moderation decisions to Ms. Gadi.  Is that my saying her name right?  Do you know, Denise?

Start time: 518.11

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually don't know.

Start time: 520.00
End time: 556.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And usually deferred to her.  He backed it up later in interviews.  But it sounds like, yeah, he for years said Twitter is the free speech wing of the free  speech party.  He did not want to.  And I have to say even the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Cory Doctorow have kind of  said, you know, this is maybe not a great precedent.  Do we want big tech to rule on these issues?  Essentially not, you know, unhindered.

Start time: 557.40
End time: 575.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the answer to that question opens a whole can of worms, right?  Because the reason that and you're more familiar with this than any of us, Leo, that radio  and television are treated different than the Internet is because years ago, someone  decided that the airwaves belong to the public.

Start time: 576.46
End time: 592.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as they do, you have to be licensed to use the public spectrum.  That the theory being that's a limited resource owned by the people.  So you should have some responsibilities if you're allowed to use it.  But the Internet is not a limited resource, not owned by anybody.

Start time: 593.19
End time: 628.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And therein lies the difference.  So are we going to start?  If you answer the question, the Internet does not belong to the public.  It belongs to all the little private nodes that allow us to access the Internet.  And it's also different from broadcast in that it's, you know, broadcast is very one way.  And the Internet is very two way.  And, you know, are we going to start treating the Internet as though it belongs to the public  and regulate it similarly to broadcast?  Here's what is a big question.

Start time: 628.86
End time: 694.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what Corinne McSherry.  Hold on.  Let me just give you the EFF thing and then Justine, I'll give you the floor.  This is what Corinne McSherry wrote at EFF.  The decisions by Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others to suspend and or block  President Trump's communications via their platform is a simple exercise of their rights  under the First Amendment and Section 230 to curate their sites.  We support these rights.  Nevertheless, and here's the here's the nevertheless, we are always concerned when  platforms take on the role of censors.  And this is why they call on them to apply a human rights framework to these decisions.  We note those same platforms have chosen for years to privilege some speakers,  particularly government officials over others, not just in the US but in other countries as well.  A platform should not apply one set of rules to most of its users, then apply a more permissive  set of rules to politicians and world leaders who are already immensely powerful.  They should be exactly as judicious about removing content of ordinary users as they  have been to date regarding heads of state.  So I don't know exactly what they're calling for there.  Justine, go ahead.  I'm sorry.

Start time: 695.66
End time: 759.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, there's so many things to think about.  Like the Internet is still sort of new.  So we're still kind of navigating these waters.  And I mean, we obviously have not had a president that had this much power on social media before  because the Internet has just gotten more and more popular.  And then like you were saying, you know, reading through a lot of the responses,  everyone's like, this is free speech.  Like our speech is being taken away.  I'm like, these are private companies.  They have the right to do this.  But the fact that normal, regular, everyday people are not the president of the United States.  So his one single tweet obviously can create such backlash than someone with maybe like five  followers.  So I mean, even if there isn't a preference, it's like me also as an influencer, like I kind of have  this responsibility that if I say something, people are going to listen and you have to be careful.  So I feel like if there's some sort of clause, like if you are a verified user, then maybe these  are specific things that you have to abide by.  But it's scary because he really did incite a lot of just insanity throughout this past couple of  weeks.  And it's kind of still shocking and I'm still sort of processing it all.  So I think everyone else is as well.

Start time: 759.94
End time: 764.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree with you.  I think we're all kind of like, what the hell just happened?

Start time: 765.45
End time: 772.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Justine, have you thought about public office?  Because it would be nice if our elected representative felt that way.  I was joking also about that.

Start time: 773.70
End time: 796.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, oh my gosh, I'm going to run for office.  And it's like a lot of these people growing up now, they have their entire lives are online.  So you know their entire history, but it's like a lot of these, you know, the I don't know how to  explain it, but it's like most younger people today, like they're not going to want to run for  office after seeing like what people are going through.  That's how you kind of bring those new people in that have these new ideas if this is the way  people are being treated.

Start time: 797.56
End time: 818.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, I reject completely the idea that the president has been silenced in any significant  way. He can walk down to the briefing room at any time and get national coverage by all  television networks.  He can, I mean, he's the president and nor have conservatives.  Most talk radio in the United States is conservative.  As far as I know, Rush Limbaugh is still broadcast five days a week.

Start time: 819.76
End time: 822.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had WhiteHouse.gov for four years.

Start time: 823.14
End time: 824.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why didn't you put messages there?

Start time: 825.62
End time: 829.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the Obama administration used that fairly effectively.

Start time: 829.22
End time: 844.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So I don't think he's been deep platformed in a significant way.  But at the same, and I do think this isn't a first amendment issue.  A lot of people say, what about the bill of rights?  These are private companies.  They're not, they're not prevented from doing this by the first amendment.

Start time: 845.90
End time: 849.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's something that you need to stress because a lot of people don't understand that  at all.

Start time: 850.10
End time: 850.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 850.64

Start time: 852.44
End time: 912.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allow the lawyer on the show to reiterate that the first amendment only applies to  government actions.  Courts are in accord about this.  Private companies have a very, very limited responsibility under the first amendment.  If they have something that has, you know how when you go to the shopping center and  there's somebody there with a table who wants to harass you and give you literature?  Yeah.  They're there because there's a case out there or it's really more of a state by state  issue than under federal law.  But a public forum can be created on private real estate such that if you own a shopping  center or a park or somewhere else where the public congregates, you might have to  set aside a little free speech zone where, and again, you have to allow whoever wants  to use it to use it.

Start time: 914.56
End time: 936.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You remember going to the airport and you'd be harassed by Hare Krishnas as you walked  through the airport.  Do you remember that?  But then they made free speech booths and they have to be there because that's private  space, right?  So they're allowed to say, no, no, no, you can't wander around harassing people.  You have to stand behind this booth, which by the way is empty most of the time now because  it's no good.  Nobody ever just walks right by it.

Start time: 936.94
End time: 937.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we can't travel.

Start time: 937.98
End time: 939.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and we can't go to the airport anyway.

Start time: 939.06
End time: 985.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tiny and totally real world, real properly, sorry, real property related exception.  Private companies aren't bound by the First Amendment.  It's purely a government thing.  That's why when Trump was using Twitter and blocking people from following his Twitter  account, a court stepped in and said, I'm sorry, you've created a public forum as a  public official using an internet service.  And he's not the only one.  There certainly have been many, many, many other public officials who've run into this  too, that when they decide to use social media as a way to interact with the public, bingo,  that triggers the First Amendment.  But as far as what the private platforms can do, that's a completely different question.

Start time: 985.64
End time: 1031.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me bring up the larger issue.  This is the issue that came up at the radio show.  So there is concern that Big Tech has an awful lot of power that, you know, nobody can say no  to Mark Zuckerberg.  Even his board of directors can't because he has the majority of voting stock in Facebook.  He's not elected.  He's a private person.  And yet he controls a platform with more than two and a half billion people that has already,  we know, has immense power.  And that seems like an awful lot of power.  David, I had a guy call me and say, I want a tablet, but I don't want Android or iOS.  I said, I think you're out of luck.  I mean, even FireT, Fire tablets are Android under the hood.

Start time: 1032.75
End time: 1103.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, these companies are inescapable anymore.  There really is no alternative.  And we've seen what happens when you try to create alternatives.  Usually what ends up happening is the alternative was created for a very specific reason.  If you have a parlor situation and the alternative ends up being host to everything you wanted to  stop in the first place.  So, you know, meanwhile, regular people are very content to use these platforms.  And even if they may not trust them very much, it's still where they congregate naturally  just because of critical mass.  I mean, the same thing is true of software platforms as far as operating systems and  things like that go to.  So, yeah, I mean, I think there is the kind of the inertia argument that Facebook and  Twitter and these companies are so large that they exert power that no other company  realistically could gain at this point for them to lose that power would be a truly  incredible event.  So I think that does that brings up those big difficult questions about regulation and  about what people are doing on these platforms and the responsibility the companies have  toward customers, towards governments, toward their partners.  And I think that we're not finding a lot of good answers at this point.  We're finding a lot of polarization.

Start time: 1104.10
End time: 1184.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there is nowhere to go that isn't run by big tech.  I mean, there is literal I mean, I said, well, you could get a pine phone that runs  Linux.  It's not very usable.  You could get a Libram, you know, purism, Libram laptop that runs Linux.  And, you know, as kind of they've taken the Intel management engine out and, you know,  you could do that.  But the things that people think of as the Internet and think of as technology are really  dominated by those big five tech companies.  It'd be very hard to get away from them.  In fact, who was the New York Times reporter who tried to do that?  I can't remember her name, but it did not go well.  She actually turned off Amazon and her router.  She said nothing from AWS.  And she could there was nowhere to go.  Was it cashmere?  Yeah, I think it was.  There was nowhere to go.  She's like, there was not a good experience.  Mike Masnick and Techdirt wrote that rather than saying these guys have been de-platformed,  that Parler, which is practically out of business, this is the free market responding to Parler.  That's an interesting point of view.  These are free market companies deciding it's not worth the trouble to host them.  So we're just going to kick them off.

Start time: 1185.79

Start time: 1207.98
End time: 1260.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You touched, Leo, on the other thing that could happen here and that government is sort of slowly  doing here and in the EU and maybe even elsewhere in the world.  And that is saying that these companies are too big and starting to look at them from an antitrust  standpoint.  But as you've been pointing out, it's not a Ma Bell situation.  It's not one company that has all the internet.  It's several of them.  And they're not working together on these kinds of issues.  Although I'm sure there are people who have theories about them working together.  I don't know that any of that could be proven or demonstrated.  But to say that Amazon is the only way to host material on the web is just inaccurate.

Start time: 1260.95
End time: 1323.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  In fact, Oracle copied AWS's API, something they sued Google over.  So if you want to move, you could just go to Oracle.  Instead, and apparently, at least those callers who called the radio show both brought up Oracle  as being a place to go.  Anyway, it's a political subject and it's a Tinder box and I don't want to stir up  any anxiety in our audience or among you guys.  But it's still going on.  It's still an issue.  And I think it's difficult because I think big tech is awfully powerful.  I don't know if we want them to be that powerful.  It's almost impossible to avoid them.  Denise, speaking of the EU, both Angela Merkel of Germany and Macron of France said,  oh, how could they let that happen in the US?  Here, the government would decide.

Start time: 1324.80
End time: 1335.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're far closer philosophically and from a policy standpoint to both deciding  that antitrust laws apply and that the public owns the internet.

Start time: 1336.85
End time: 1371.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  But I think I interpret it more that they don't have a First Amendment there.  They don't have a rule that says government can't abridge speech.  And in fact, Germany does.  You can't sell Nazi memorabilia on eBay in Germany because it's against the law.  So Germany is perfectly comfortable abridging speech if it serves social interests.  We hear we really love our First Amendment.  But that's one of the reasons this is challenging.  This is tricky.  I don't know what the answer is.  Anyway, I wish we knew.

Start time: 1372.34
End time: 1389.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And I think that the reason that you're not going to find Nazi memorabilia,  I mean, maybe you do on eBay.  I've not searched.  I think you can everywhere but Germany.  I'm assuming that it's banned from being sold on eBay in the US too.  And that's not a First Amendment thing.  That's a policy thing that the company decided.

Transcript:  That's so great.  I'd be like the fifth, but for some reason, my dad decided not to use his middle name  when he named me.  So I can't, I'm just the only one.  Is it better to be the third or better not to be?

Transcript:  That's a good point.  Although every contact list application I use tries to merge me and my father together  because we have the same first and last name, even though we don't have the same middle  name every time.  No, that's not me.  That's my dad.  Justine Azaric is here.  I Justine superstar.  When Jason suggested, let's get Justine for the show.

So I left and it was you at I think it was CES that convinced me.  Oh, no, no, no.  You got to be on Twitter.  Everybody's on Twitter.  So you got me back on Twitter in April 2007, I think.

But at least we still do this show.  You know, it's all right.  This is to everything.  There is a season.  And, you know, Justine now, massive star.  Look at the YouTube stars.

End time: 1715.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still doing TikTok.  Yeah, I mean, I go through phases, too.  But I feel like TikTok for me, sort of at the beginning of the pandemic,  kind of reminded me why I started making content because it was fun.  You didn't I wasn't putting thought into it.  I was just doing it because I enjoyed it.  And I think I have to sometimes have that reminder even with YouTube.  When you have those downfalls, you're like, why am I even doing this?  Am I enjoying this?  You just kind of have to remember why did I start doing this?  And then, you know, you do slowly remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the truth.  I mean, I know I take no credit for your success.  Obviously, because you just are one of the hardest working people  and you're brilliant and you do a great job.  And so you're completely self-made.  I don't want anybody to think I for anybody have any sense of having contributed to that.  I'm just, you know, you work hard and it and I know how hard it is to do what you do.  How many videos a day are you doing?  You have to work all the time, right?

Transcript:  It's pretty much nonstop.  And then during the pandemic, my sister and I decided to start a podcast.  So that has taken way more time than I thought,  because we still are both editing it ourselves, uploading thumbnails,  produce it.  Yeah, it's I just don't know why I don't hire a team.  Like I think I just really love the process of creating so much that I don't know.  You don't have a team?  I have one other editor and shooter.  That's it.  I still edit half my videos.  My sister, we take turns editing podcasts.  Yeah, I would probably get a lot more done if I had more people.

Transcript:  Making it.  It is.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm thrilled to have all three of you here.  I feel like that moment on Jeopardy, it's the worst part of Jeopardy when Alex Trebek  would go and talk to the contestants.  I always skip through that part.  Now I feel guilty.  I feel I have to go back and rewatch.  We just did our little Jeopardy moment.  We'll get back to our game and double Jeopardy in just a bit.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.

So this year CES was not in Vegas.  In fact, Justine, you and Rich Demuro had to go to Redmond to do CES.

Start time: 2070.62
End time: 2095.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so Naomi Kyle and Brian Tong were the second set of hosts.  So they had two separate kind of sections, like completely different productions.  So we were the morning shift and they took the afternoon.  So we were talking about this earlier, but my call time was like 1 a.m.  Oh, my God.  We did rehearsals at 3 a.m. and went live at 4.  So honestly, I've never done overnight shoots before, but this was something that I've never  experienced.  I was going to bed at 4 p.m.

Start time: 2097.98
End time: 2117.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you would introduce like the keynote speaker is here and you would set that up.  But how did I didn't do any of it.  I feel bad.  I went to CES in last year and it was a lot of fun in Vegas, but I just couldn't.  I couldn't bring myself to sit and watch video all day.  So I didn't do it.  Yeah.

Start time: 2118.34
End time: 2133.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have it's on demand until the my dog is you can go back and watch it.  That's OK.  Yeah.  So it's there until February 15th, but it was cool because we were kind of the interstitial  kind of bringing together.  And you were live.  It was live.  Yes.  Fun.

Start time: 2134.90
End time: 2153.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a great gig.  So instead it was a little smaller instead of 4500 booths.  There were 1900 exhibitors.  Nobody had to walk the show floor.  Here you are in the Wall Street Journal.  You did this show from the Microsoft studios.  They have some very nice studios.

Start time: 2153.42
End time: 2185.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have this crazy just the set was amazing.  And obviously my biggest concern was obviously COVID because I have done basically nothing  for the past year except work out of my house.  And so it was great because everything felt very safe.  It was very distance.  They had different routes that you could take.  I had a specific room to go like even catering.  I got so many questions about what was this like?  How did it go?  Because that's also going to be the new normal as far as production goes.  I don't think it'll ever go back to 100 percent the way that it used to be.

Start time: 2185.36
End time: 2208.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say watching, for instance, Apple's WWC and their keynotes, the three events that  they did at the end of the year, it really was so much better.  You missed the in-person, I guess you missed the demo room, but it's a much better way to  consume the information.  I think from Apple's point of view, it's a much more successful way to deliver it as  well.  It's there and a lot more control.

Start time: 2208.87
End time: 2227.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  For people being able to cover it, we don't have to travel.  We're here.  We get the products and then you might have less turnaround time, but at least we're here  and ready to work.  So I do miss the in-person, but I think this past year has taught us that there's a lot  of unnecessary travel that really did not need to happen.  There are better ways that we could do things.

Start time: 2230.82
End time: 2251.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I go back and forth on this a lot.  In the past year or so, I think we've watched the way various companies and industries have  responded to this.  And some of them have been much more aggressive in pursuing the digital event strategy.  And some have really just turned back the tap and really made announcements feel a lot  lighter touch, I would say.  Yeah.

Start time: 2252.10
End time: 2258.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good example, David, the Google event this year, it was so sleepy.  Yes.  No.

Start time: 2259.46
End time: 2379.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very much so.  And I think that you see companies with two minds about this.  I think Google has been very sensitive about not wanting to look like they're tone deaf,  I guess you would say, while the pandemic's ongoing.  But other companies have really, I think I've seen more stumbles than I have successes,  quite honestly.  I think the engagement at a lot of these events is quite terrible, to be honest.  I know for a fact that I tune out of most of them.  Yeah.  That's why I didn't watch.  Yeah.  And that's the reason nobody watches.  In terms of journalists and brands, how they connect, this has been, to me,  an unmitigated disaster for the last year.  I really think most people have suffered for it.  And nobody's really, you've gained more time to do more things, but it's come at the expense  of that hype and excitement and the collective energy that these in-person events bring.  I am not the kind of person who is going to say that I get crazy excited about smartphone  events. That's not really true.  But I understand that they bring that energy and that mass of people together in a way  that is far more effective in amplifying a brand's message than these digital events,  which I've just seen failure after failure after failure.  It's causing journalists, especially just kind of go through the motions when they announce news.  They get everything ahead of time.  They've got their product images.  They've got all their virtual assets.  And they've got their copy done.  They file the story and they move on.  There is not that deeper engagement.  You tend to get at a show like CES where you're able to kind of wander to the corner of the show  floor and be like, well, there's something really weird over here.  And I want to talk to the people who made it for 15 minutes.  There was just, to me, there was no real effective outreach from the show this year in that regard.  But we've seen that from every event, in my opinion, since COVID began.  It's been a real uphill battle.  And I think that most companies from brands that I've talked to, there is a desire to get  back out there and do events again.  I don't think most of them are substantially turned off of it from a cost or attention  standpoint.  I think they're ready to get going again.

Start time: 2380.02
End time: 2414.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a huge difference in cost.  You don't have to fly people out, put them up in a hotel.  You don't have to have a hundred thousand dollar booth.  It's a lot cheaper for companies to do this.  But if they don't get the bang for their lesser buck, then maybe there is an incentive for them  to want to do it.  Justine, you must have been at Steve Jobs' iPhone announcement, which is 13 years ago  last week.  There was an energy, there was an excitement there.  Partly because we didn't know what he was going to say.

Start time: 2415.44
End time: 2449.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't replace that feeling.  But also, for me, being able to be at home, be in my element, have the product.  Some journalists, you don't actually have to sit down and record videos and stuff like that.  So I feel like there is a little bit of a difference.  Whereas I can actually have time with it before I actually make the video.  So I think it really depends on the different types of people that are doing this stuff.  You will never be able to replace just being able to go and see your friends and other fellow  coworkers and just enjoy the products.  Because there is that feeling like David was saying that you just can't replace that.

Transcript:  David, what about the Samsung event this week?  They announced the Samsung Galaxy S21.  It was a lie.  I didn't watch it.  I think Jason did it with Florence Ion because it was 7 a.m. Thursday and I didn't want to get up.  Was it live?  Did it give it a little bit of buzz?  Samsung has never done great events.

Start time: 2471.65
End time: 2478.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Honestly, I did not watch the press conference.  We'd been briefed ahead of time and that is kind of the behavior that engenders in people.

Start time: 2480.08
End time: 2502.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of it is not.  Nowadays, even Apple is having a hard time keeping a lid on its announcements.  You know, Apple, that was the difference.  As we filed in that day in 2007 at Macworld Expo, we didn't know if there was an iPhone.  We didn't know what it would be called.  We knew nothing about it.  Those days are long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are so many cameras.  It's really shocking.  And then the S21 is also very pretty.  The colors are nice, but it's hard because there's very small upgrades from every phone.  So it's like, how do you kind of do a review where I'm just like,  okay, here's a couple of extra specs.  I just made this video last year.  So I think that's the same video.

So it's just good to be it.  I feel like we thought that 2020 was over, but I think 2021 is just a little bit different than 2020.  Or two.

Transcript:  Can I drop a note of optimism into the discussion?  I think what we're missing at these kinds of events when they all go virtual is that lobby con factor  where you go and there are some speakers and panels and things that you definitely really want to see.  And then the rest of it is just meeting the people that are there and the serendipity of  whether they are going to coincide with something you're working on and how you can collaborate  together and make it all better.  But the note of optimism I was going to inject is my dad and stepmom got vaccinated this morning.

Transcript:  Good.  Oh, that's great.  I have to say, David, though, you did kind of nail the difference, which is that buzz.  Even if you don't go to CES, you know that once a year in January, there's going to be this kind of  industry wide excitement about new stuff.  And no big company has announced anything really important at CES in a long time.  Microsoft stopped going, Apple stopped going.  But there's just this energy that you miss, I guess.

Start time: 2681.95
End time: 2747.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think that it's, you know, for the smaller companies, especially,  and I speak as a journalist, but I also attend CES in a business capacity with our sales team.  And you just can't replicate that virtually.  It's impossible.  And people, you know, when you talk to people in the media about CES all about, oh, what new  products were announced, you know, how much news is coming out.  And that's fine and good.  It's a big part of the show.  But the bigger part of the show is really, you know, commerce.  It's finance going on here.  You know, money is changing hands.  People are committing to buy things.  People are making deals.  And when you don't have the physical show, that becomes just an order of magnitude more  difficult to do.  And I think that's why you saw the vendor participation rate just go through the floor  this year, because they all knew we're not going to make any money.  We're not going to score any deals.  You know, we can't get out there and network.  And that makes the show necessarily more, you know, more challenging.  And I think we saw that with product announcements that most companies, I think, especially the  smaller ones, decided to pull back.  I think they saw this as an opportunity to push roadmaps back, maybe a quarter or two.  Maybe they had to anyway.  And I think they took that chance with CES this year.

Start time: 2747.78
End time: 2791.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the other point to be made is they may have been done.  Even if CES had been in person and real and the same as before, I think if you're a retailer,  you're not anxious to start stocking up.  You don't know what's going to happen.  And so I think that there is this pall over the economy.  I know it's not showing up in the stock market, but there is this pall  as businesses go under.  When's consumer spending going to come back?  No one knows.  And yeah, the vaccines, but no one knows.  And I think there's this, I would guess there's this general sense among the buyers and the  makers that, well, let's wait a little bit before we make any commitments.  Is that right, David?  Is that what you think?

Start time: 2791.98
End time: 2826.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think, you know, I mean, it's very well understood.  Uncertainty is a hugely powerful economic force.  And I think that you see that play out across the industry.  We saw, you know, like there was still a fair number of products announced, but I think you saw,  you know, and this is another article that was kind of on the sheet that I did read because  it was by my, you know, good online acquaintance, Kevin Toffle over at Stacey on IoT.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I totally agree with him.  I think that everybody's taking a step back and saying we've got an opportunity to reevaluate  what the product roadmap and what our goals are in light of everything that's changed in  the past year.  And I think they're taking that opportunity.

I put the sourdough in the freezer and just the other day, Lisa said,  whatever happened to that sourdough?  And so I brought the sourdough, I started it up again.

It's a zero sun game though, because if they put as it's national August 8th,  national sneak some zucchini under your neighbor's porch day.

Start time: 3145.42
End time: 3165.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that I have the same phones.  Justine does the S21 and S21 Ultra.  And I think the overall sentiment from everyone I've spoken to  and from myself at this point is they're very iterative phones.  They don't really change a lot.  So you have the latest internals from Qualcomm here in the United States,  if that's where you're buying the phone.  Is that the 888?

Start time: 3165.68

Transcript:  Which is a lucky number in China.

Start time: 3172.78
End time: 3319.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I think that is...  They say that's not why they made it that.  Yeah, sure.  But they're lying.  I think that Samsung remains a de facto choice for smartphones  just because overall in terms of component quality and availability  and just relationships with carriers here in America especially,  it still ends up being the default for most people just because  either it's the most aggressively priced with discounts  or they're kind of Samsung lifers and they keep upgrading within the brand.  Let's be fair, advertise like crazy.  Yes, of course.  They advertise an insane amount.  So I think that those people who have been inside this,  been with the Samsung smartphone family for years now,  they're going to like it.  I think they'll like it better than they did the phones last year  because they fixed kind of the autofocus issue the S21 Ultra had with the camera.  But overall, in terms of things you're going to notice that are an upgrade,  there's a 10x optical zoom lens, which I think is really cool.  I like to take kind of artsy and more landscapy photos  and that lens is great for that because it lets you get closer.  To me, that is the best thing a camera can do is let you get closer to something.  But I think for the average person, maybe that lens isn't quite as useful.  When you're a 10x optical zoom, if your hands shake,  the effect is a little outsized on the viewfinder versus holding a full-size DSLR  with a telephoto where you're able to steady.  It's not always a practical solution.  But the phone itself, it's so iterative that I would just say,  if you go play with the Galaxy S20 Ultra,  you will have the same basic experience you have with this phone.  There are so few substantial changes as far as the ordinary consumer would be concerned.  The only one that they would notice is that it's cheaper.  A big difference, yeah.  It's 200 bucks cheaper.  Exactly.  And the way they achieve that on the Ultra in my mind is Samsung's just eating more margin.  I don't think there's really anything to it other than that.  Maybe Qualcomm lowered the price for the Snapdragon 888.  The other two, the baby S21 is a plastic back,  which I don't think anybody really needs to be concerned about.  And I think it represents the best value in the family.  But overall, there's nothing surprising here.  I think that Samsung played it safe,  and probably they planned to play it safe before COVID happened.  I'm not convinced that a lot of decisions with regard to these phones  are related to economic changes apart from the price drops.

Start time: 3319.68
End time: 3332.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A year ago, probably, after the release of the S20, they started planning the S21.  So it wouldn't be a surprise.  It sounds like they're going to kill the Note, right?  They're going to replace...  They're putting the S Pen on the S series.

Start time: 3334.04
End time: 3375.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're dancing around that.  The statements they put out have been...  Initially, it sounded like an executive said,  oh, the Note's going away.  And then another statement came out and they said,  oh, well, we don't exactly mean that.  And so I'm not sure what that means.  And I don't know that we've had any good leaks about this just yet.  I suspect that what we could see is a more down market Note smartphone  that comes out more similar to the base Note 20 last year.  And maybe we don't see the ultra high-end Note again.  But I could be wrong there, too.  It could be possible Samsung is just going to continue for now, business as usual.  But yeah, the way the wind's blowing, definitely.  The Note line is slowly being pushed out of existence, is redundant.

Transcript:  There was some upset about the lack of micro SD card.  Do you see that as an issue?

Start time: 3380.76
End time: 3424.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's an issue for people who comment on the internet mostly.  It's not really an ordinary consumer problem.  And honestly, the situation with SD cards on Android,  they're treated like such second class citizens  that they're really not useful for anything but bulk media storage.  And that's really all anybody's using them for anymore.  With 128 gigs of storage on the phone out of the box at the bare minimum,  to me, you're catering to a crowd that has had this thing for a decade,  and they really, really don't want to let it go.  But you're not really advancing any more utility to the phone by keeping it there.  And you are making some sacrifices.  When you're talking about 10 or 20 extra milliamp hours in the battery,  you can squeeze in there.  That's a big difference.  Phone makers start making those decisions.

Transcript:  They did take out the one thing I really thought was cool  with Samsung Pay.  You could use it on a MagStripe terminal because they had this MST technology.  And I always enjoyed, oh, we don't take Apple Pay.  And I said, well, wait a minute.  And I just would swipe my Samsung phone and they go, how did you do that?  I always enjoyed that.  But I guess that's probably the time has come to get rid of MST as well.  Yeah.

Start time: 3449.90
End time: 3476.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The anecdote I heard about the MST was kind of interesting is that in Mexico,  actually, Samsung phones are very popular because of the technology.  Because even though in Mexico, they're supposed to have contactless and EMV,  a lot of shops apparently still don't use it.  They just disable it or they use an old reader.  So that's kind of a bummer, obviously, for people in Mexico who use and buy Samsung phones.  Here in America, though, I feel like we've seen the pandemic  rapidly accelerate the contactless payment movement.

Start time: 3488.58
End time: 3530.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is Qualcomm's second generation ultrasonic fingerprint scanner,  which I can probably through the screen scanner.  Yeah, it's a through the screen scanner.  So the way Qualcomm's works as opposed to the other side, there are basically two types.  You have optical and you have ultrasonic.  And Qualcomm's is ultrasonic, which uses basically a ultrasonic pulse  that a little controller sends out and that reads your fingerprints.  So this year's scanner is 70% larger than the one that they used last year.  Nice.  So you don't have to be so accurate.  Yeah, they also claim it's faster.  I don't really believe them on that.  It feels almost exactly the same.  But the larger scanning area does help because that really is,  you know, it makes it easier to kind of fat finger it.  Yeah, that might make it faster.

Start time: 3530.42
End time: 3541.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you don't have to aim.  Justine, one of the things they pushed and they were very excited about  was all the video production capabilities.  I know you're an iPhone person in your heart of hearts.

Start time: 3542.66
End time: 3587.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I am.  It's just it's like the iPhone obviously works so well with like the Apple ecosystem.  But obviously I do have a PC.  And so I kind of have this whole other separate Windows life.  So being able to have the Android phone and I do miss the SD card  because I'm that bulk storage person who I'm transferring all of my footage.  I save everything on the SD card and then take that out.  Then I copy it to my Mac if I'm editing there.  But now with cloud storage and 5G becoming a little bit more available in places,  we're going to be storing things in the cloud and being able to retrieve it faster.  So I do understand that they're kind of pushing that.  And if like David said, too, like if you're able to get extra battery life,  that's also very important.  And I think most people aren't really using the SD cards like,  you know, someone who's a content creator would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  Yeah.  And I mean, 8K is OK.  It's 8K, but without the sensor of a red or the prime lens,  like you're not going to be getting like this true, incredible cinematic 8K quality.  But what I did like is they said that you can take a 33 megapixel kind of screenshot  if you are filming in 8K so you can still take like a still photo from it.  So you're still able to kind of do that, which is cool.  But I have done a couple of vlogs just on the S20 and I think it's great.  It's just the audio is usually where it gets me is because usually the iPhone does have better  microphones.

Transcript:  I don't have one, but I've rented some before and I love shooting with those.  But the thing that I do like that they did with the camera bump is they embraced it.  It's actually all one with the outside of it.  It's giant.  Oh, and then during their unpacked event,  they're talking about trying to create the perfect black color.

It's hard to think of what you could do that would get people to go,  oh, I got to have that.  That's fantastic.  That's a huge improvement.  At this point, it's just this a little here, a little nudge there.  Even Apple's having a little bit of that problem.

End time: 3790.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all essentially the same thing.  And I know there's been rumors that Apple is going to be also making that,  but I was joking.  I feel like they were waiting for Samsung to do it.  And probably next week, they're going to be like, hey, guess what we have.

Start time: 3790.96
End time: 3796.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's funny.  Surprise.  It does require a Samsung phone for some of the features, right?  You can't.

Start time: 3796.64
End time: 3842.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the one thing that it does require a Samsung phone for, what they want to do  is they want to tile, create a network of tracker tags that can then ping each other  and create a sort of mesh.  So if you lose something, then you can use other people's smart tags to ping your tag  using the Samsung.  This isn't live yet.  It's next year, I think they said it's coming out.  Or they're going to start testing it later this year.  So theoretically, it would allow you to extend the range.  For finding things.  Granted, the number of places you're going to find that many smart tags outside of Korea,  I don't think you can.  I don't you don't need a hand to count them because I don't think they ever will be.  But they are coming out with a new version or a different version,  I should say, of the smart tag later this year.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And I'm actually that's the one I'm curious to test.  This current Bluetooth only one is kind of like, well, it's tile,  but with the promise of ecosystem that I don't think will ever materially occur.  The ultra wideband version, the idea with ultra wideband,  if you'd seen how UWB is used with the HomePod and the iPhone,  is you have that really, really, really fine grain degree of like  when the phone understands when it's near something,  because you need direct line of sight for these frequencies.  They won't penetrate almost anything.  I don't think even at 90 gigahertz, you'll penetrate a piece of paper.  But it's basically so you can get that like fine.  Like if you're looking for something under the couch  or if you're looking for something, you know, that's like somewhere in the room,  but you don't know where exactly the idea is,  you can have that much more fine grain degree of control finding something.  But until we use them, you know,  I don't really don't know what the experience is going to be like.

Transcript:  That's in theory what Apple is going to do.  If they ever do whatever that is that they're going to do,  it will use UWB.  So you'd be able to aim your iPhone and say, is it under the couch?  Where is it exactly?  That's kind of the thing.

Our show today brought to you by the folks at ITProTV.  ITProTV is, I kind of have a soft spot in my heart for those guys, Don Pezet and Tim Broom.  They started IT, they originally were IT trainers in the classroom setting.  And they started ITProTV because they saw what we did with Twit.  They went to an event.

David, is there any sense of a trend this year at CES?

Start time: 4253.12
End time: 4353.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you know, you have the kind of the standards.  You have TVs, you have laptops, and you have kind of, you know, now smart home.  The one I think we I would say really the trends that actually stuck out as not being  as prominent were the ones that were more noticeable to me.  I mean, you had automotive essentially drop off a cliff.  There were some announcements from like Cadillac,  but these are mostly concepts.  They're not real things.  And I think you saw that area drop off.  You saw a smart home drop off like we discussed.  Mobile at CES is essentially dead.  There's no more of that.  So I think the theme really was that CES this year slimmed down to kind of its core competencies,  which tend to be like I said, TVs, laptops, and then, you know, to an extent still smart home.  But overall, you know, for us and the way we cover it, obviously we're covering it from more  of a mobility perspective.  And so what we end up seeing are mostly the laptops this year.  But as a trend, I think that, you know, you saw the bigger players, you know, with more  announcements, and then you saw the smaller players kind of step back.  If I were to say there's a particular product niche that had a high level of interest,  I think laptops for sure, just because the demand is through the roof.  We've seen the numbers about PC sales going up for the first time in a decade.  So everybody wants to jump on, you know, the work from home train because they either have to or,  you know, they're looking for better tools to work from home.  And I think that, you know, you'll see probably over the next year, you'll see more and more  innovation in laptops and probably desktop computing too, you know, if what Apple's working  on turns out to be true.  So I'm looking forward to all that.  And I think CES is probably just a taste of what we're going to see for the rest of the year.

Transcript:  It's kind of hard to show off TVs on a virtual screen.  It's kind of hard to show off self-driving cars if you can't get in them.  I think maybe there is no way you can't really judge CES this year.  What about those crazy rollable LG and TCL showed rollable phones and rollable screens?  They had a was it LG that had the or is it TCL that had the tablet that was a scroll?  But again, we can't look at them in real life and say, well, that'll that'll never work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what I was going to say, like most people, they end up seeing it through all of our  coverage anyway.  So they're just envisioning it from our show floor footage as well.  But I think talking about trends, the buzzword that I just kept hearing over and over was AI,  AI this, AI that.  And at some point I'm like, what even does it mean?  What does it mean?  Yeah, this AI toothbrush, which I actually have one of the oral BIO toothbrushes and their AI is  pretty incredible.  Wait, I have that too.

Start time: 4431.78
End time: 4447.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I guess it's got to be trained so that the accelerometer and the brush really, it doesn't  know that you're brushing your lower right hand corner, but thanks to training with models that  can kind of, oh yeah, when they do that, that's the lower right hand corner.  I guess that's AI.

But it shows on the screen, right?  It shows where you are in your mouth and you got to do this.  I was, my teeth never were cleaner than when I did that.

Start time: 4469.26
End time: 4526.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I said.  And I first tested that out last year at CES and then they made me give it back because  it was a prototype.  So then I went for like six months without having perfectly clean teeth.  And so it finally came out.  Those are the types of things that you don't, like you can't really experience.  Like I went to the booth, got the toothbrush, tried it for two days and then I had to give  it back.  But yeah, the AI, the automotive is all kind of very interesting.  And it was kind of cool because my sister actually hosted some of the GM interviews.  So they were able to like re-record, have all of this content ready.  So by the time actually CES came around, you were able to like watch all of this content.  But yeah, I mean, as far as mobile is concerned, CES is not the place for that.  And I feel like all these companies, everyone's just kind of figuring out how to do it on  their own and to make the buzz without the help of like these larger companies or platforms.  They're just like, we're going to do it and we're going to hopefully, you know, just hope  for the best.  Yeah.

And one of the things that's cool about it, it has in the truck, it has an automatic  electrically powered pallet.  You put the packages on the pallet.  They get loaded in the truck and then offloaded from the truck automatically, which is kind  of cool.  I think that a lot of companies that are doing EVs and self-driving have realized that the  future for them is going to be in business sales and commercial use, at least initially,  because I don't know.  You drive a Tesla, right, Justine, or do you?

Transcript:  Then the problem with a lot of these electric vehicles is where do you charge it once everybody  has one?  Huge problem.  The Tesla infrastructure is so superior to everything else.  If you don't have a Tesla, you might be struggling to have these charging stations.

Everything EV is about a year ahead of the rest of the country, at least.  But I feel pretty confident, especially watching where Ford and other EV manufacturers are now  seating press cars, that the charging infrastructure is there enough for them to  start making incredible argument that these vehicles are pretty livable,  as long as you live in the right part of the country.

Transcript:  The Rivian is also pretty awesome.  I did see that last year at CES, so I'm really interested to check that out.  But the problem is a lot of these people, if you want to have a self-driving car,  you have to go Tesla route because great, there's a difference between an electric car and then,  oh, this one drives for me.

Last week on MacBreak Weekly, David Polk was saying his Model 3, it'll get them on the on-ramp,  it'll get them off the on-ramp, it sees stop signs, speed limits.  They're getting better.

Transcript:  I think it's even the things that you're connected to.  Like I obviously I was then searching for a chainsaw because then somebody on Twitter  said I was using the wrong one.  So I'm like, oh, what's the right one?  So I was like, there's now chainsaw police telling me that I'm not using the right one  for the job.  I'm like, I use a chainsaw once a year.

Yeah.  You know why?  Because it's the middle of the night and your defenses are down and you're scrolling and you  go, oh, I really have to have that toaster cozy.  I really need that.  And then you buy it.  And the other thing is it's gotten easier and easier to buy, especially on an Apple phone,  because you just click the button twice.  It goes, bing, and you bought it.  You bought a toaster cozy.  Oh, you bought six of them.  Nice.  Share them with all your friends.  Apple is planning a podcasting subscription service according to the information.

It's a Spotify exclusive and they also run a crowdfunding page, Patreon.  And they make a quarter million dollars a month on Patreon.  Yeah.  What?  And they...  What show is that?  It's called The Last Podcast on the Left.  It's kind of a very macabre show about, you know, murderers and cults and things like that.  And it's in the comedy genre.  So I think that, you know, there is a lot of money out there in these super big popular culture shows.  And I think it makes sense for Apple to get on board with it because honestly,  as soon as Spotify bought this...  Or basically bought rights to this podcast, I had to start using the app.  There is no escape.

I mean, that's simplifying things, but it's the same reason, you know,  the same reason they want the control.

Start time: 5130.46
End time: 5160.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also interesting because, you know, we've tried to see that trend of getting,  you know, influencers to do traditional TV and it doesn't normally work because  a lot of times people get the content where they want to get it.  So that's why I post stuff everywhere because...  Right.  That was my thought.  There is crossover, but there's also not.  I even love consuming content on Instagram the most when I'm looking for  content for my friends.  That's where I like to watch and see that short form content.  So it's kind of like I do have to produce for everything.

And then now I'm kind of like, okay, I think I want to go back to TikTok.  So I wouldn't say my strategy is the best, but for me,  it's keeping myself motivated and entertained just to keep making content.  So if I don't want to do something like I'm not going to do it.

And then I'll just take those pieces of like a main YouTube video  and kind of parse that out throughout like Instagram, Twitter and stuff like that.  And then the streaming stuff has been fun because that seems like a very...  A more rabid type of audience because it is live.  You can basically only see that at the time that I'm doing it.  And then with things like Clubhouse, have you joined that yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like a new type of app that is audio only.  And it is currently like invite only.  So you have to be like nominated by somebody.  But it has sort of this fascinating appeal of there's no video, there's no recording,  there's no DMs.  Really the only way that you can talk to people is if you get a notification that pops up that says,  these five people are chatting, join now.  So you click join and it's all audio.  You can kind of like take the stage.  So it could be even something interesting for you to even look into.  You could be doing this also on Clubhouse as well.  So it's kind of cool.  And then you can have people kind of come in and out.  I can send you an invite if you want to check it out.  But it's kind of this sort of fascinating new thing that my first jolly.  Yeah, I know.  It's cool.

Renee Richie was actually in there chatting.  And so I clicked it and I was just going to drive and just listen to like my friends talking.  And then like, oh, Justine's here.  So then you take the stage and then you just start talking and chatting.  So it's kind of like a live voice chat that people can kind of listen in.  So there's like a little crowd and an audience.  And then you can just have people talk.  And it's cool because the etiquette there too is you can just leave and you don't have to be like,  hey, I got to go.  You don't have to say bye.  No one judges you.  It's great.

Like every single video that I post, I have done something on it.  I've exported and uploaded it.  If I didn't edit it, like I've done something on it.  So, you know, not a lot of creators still do that.  But it's like for me, it is a personal thing.  And I still do enjoy that part of it.

You probably hear him on your local radio or TV.  He does a lot of national voiceovers as well.  Our show today brought to you by the best bed in the business, Casper.  I just bought, I don't know, this might be my fourth Casper.  I keep buying Casper's, not for me.  My daughter moved into a new apartment.  I said, honey, I'll take care of the bed.  And I got her and it was a great deal.  The Casper frame, the box spring, they call it the foundation.  And then on top of that, I didn't spend a ton of money.  Got the Casper original.  It's a really nice mattress.  I even got her some sheets and pillows from Casper.  They are the place to go to get your sleep in order.  Sleep is so important.  Don't, you know, take it seriously.  Here I am with my brand new, I think this was the Wave Hybrid.  Another one of my Casper collection.  I have quite a few.  I love Casper mattresses.  Only Casper mattresses are made with 86 supportive gel pods.  To align your spine, eliminate aches and pains,  give you the supportive comfort you need to wake up refreshed  and ready to go all year long.  One of the things I love about Casper's, first of all,  they come in that surprisingly compact box.  You open up the sealed, they must have a giant, you know,  seal-a-meal to put those in there because once you open it up,  and it smells fresh the minute you open it, you don't have to air it out.  It's so comfortable.  Casper's are amazing because they both give you great support.  So your back is well supported, but they also kind of mold where you need it.  Supportive comfort and it's soft.  It's hard to describe.  I don't know how to describe it.  Doesn't it look comfortable?  You just got to try it.  The Wave Hybrid, perfect for people who have aches and pains  and want a mattress with lots of support and cooling.  For the most plush mattress, if you really like soft,  you try the Nova Hybrid.  It's plush.  It's luxurious, but there's still that great support.  See, even Sammy, our cat, loves the Casper mattress.  Or of course, the original mattress.  That's what I got Abby.  It's the one for sleepers who want both support and cooling.  She loves it, of course.  And you can't have a Casper unless you have an original Casper pillow.  It's made with that unique pillow and pillow design that's soft on the outside,  supportive on the inside for all night comfort.  Casper makes everything you need to refresh your whole bedroom this year.  From their super soft percale sheets to their all-season down duvets  to their cozy, calming weighted blanket.  Wait, they make a weighted blanket?  I got to get that.  And I love the Casper Glow Light.  That is perfect.  Look, I live the La Vida Casper.  That's me.  As always, free shipping and free returns, no contact delivery.  You have 100 nights.  If at any time you're not happy, Casper comes, they get it.  They refund every penny.  Make 2021 comfortable.

End time: 6218.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It won't be after this.  I can assure you that.  I mean, their shipments are already down and they don't have enough chips.  They physically don't have the chips to make the phones at this point, at least not many more.  So they're going to run into a rock and a hard place unless the  Biden administration gives them a reprieve.  I don't think Xiaomi will suffer much for this.  I don't know how many American investors Xiaomi had, but I don't suspect it's a lot of them.

Transcript:  So it was Huawei, Samsung, Apple, and then Xiaomi now is the third place,  is the largest seller of smartphones.  Now Huawei makes 5G networking equipment, and I think you could make a reasonable case that  we don't want infrastructure built on stuff that is kind of beholden to the Chinese government.  But smartphones may be a little bit different.  And Xiaomi does not make 5G or networking gear at all, right?  Just smart devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just going to affect manufacturing.  So not necessarily if we're able to fly and things like that.  I definitely think that drone regulations are important because a lot of people  just think they're like fun toys that we can just go and do whatever.  It really is a big responsibility because you are responsible for this  tiny little aircraft that could potentially hurt someone.

Transcript:  Intel replaced their CEO Bob Swan.  He'll be stepping down next month.  They're hiring the CEO of VMware, Pat Gelsinger, to take over the position.  Intel really facing some tough economic headwinds.  There's Dan Loeb who's one of those activist investors.  He urged Intel to explore strategic alternatives, which usually means to sell.  They also said that Intel should divest from failed acquisitions  and criticized Intel for its loss of manufacturing leadership.  One of the things Gelsinger will have to decide is if Intel should continue to run  its very expensive and money-losing chip fabrication  facilities or do as so many others have done and outsource that  to companies like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer, TSMC.  I think a big change for Intel.  It's been sad to watch what used to be a dominant company in the PC industry  just suffer blow after blow after blow.  We'll see if Pat Gelsinger can turn things around.  Any thoughts on that?

Start time: 6427.66
End time: 6509.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The sentiment I heard about Gelsinger overall seems quite positive.  He's seen as a real company man.  He's seen as a guy who really loves Intel and loves what the company is about  and wants to set them on the right track.  I think that the investors are always going to crow about taking action right now  because they're concerned about the stock because Intel stock is in the dump  compared to where it was a year ago at least.  I think that that noise is still at the point where we don't know if Intel is going to be able to  make some advancements on its own nodes that can get it back to being competitive again  or if outsourcing really is the future for them.  I think Gelsinger is going to help answer that question, but I don't think  based on what we know so far that Intel itself was not ready to make that decision.  They probably have to answer a lot of really complicated questions  before they make that decision because Intel is worth like $200 billion or $300 billion.  Intel is a big company.  A lot of jobs, a lot of momentum and R&D and a lot of roadmaps that could be gravely affected  by a decision to outsource Foundry.  Also, that would be the death of chip foundries in the United States.  That would be the end of it.  Everything would essentially be foreign at any scale.  I think they will probably look very long and hard before deciding they want to totally outsource  the business.

Transcript:  That was another question I got on the radio show today.  Can I buy a PC that's entirely made in America?  I said no.  You can get one that's assembled in America.  Apple's Mac Pro, that nice little Mac Pro that was made in Austin,  but it's full of Chinese parts.  Good luck.  Actually, the Chaos Computer Club, the great Berlin hacker confab, had an event in which  hackers showed that...  Remember the Bloomberg story about Supermicro that somebody had placed a rice grain sized chip  on the Supermicro micro motherboards and it was being used to spy on the US military?  Yes.  Then they...  All Apple and Amazon and everybody said, that didn't happen.  That never happened.  Supermicro even went to the lengths to say, it couldn't happen.  You can't do that.  Well, a hacker at the Chaos Computer Club has done it and said, you absolutely can do it.  It phones home.  It changes how it works.  He actually did it.  That's not proof that it was being done to Supermicro, but it is proof that you got to  be careful about your supply chain and consider where those hardware pieces come from because  you don't know what's going on in there.  It's easy to do stuff like that.  Not easy, but possible, I guess.

Transcript:  Oh, good.  Well, then you'll like this.  Mark Lohr, who's the guy who founded diapers.com.  Remember, Amazon took him down by undercutting diapers.com to the point where they were  worthless then buying the company.  Well, not completely worthless.  They spent $350 million to buy it.  Mark went to work for Amazon.  Left after a little while.  Started Jet.com to try once again to take down Amazon.  That didn't work so well.  15 months later, Jet.com was purchased.  I think it was for billions.  I think $3 billion.  Yeah, $3.3 billion by Walmart to launch their e-commerce division.  Mark Lohr stayed there for a while.  He's just announced he's leaving.  He's out of the e-commerce business.  His new plan is to build, it's a multi-decade project to build a city of the future  supported by a reformed version of capitalism.  It's a new model for society we'll be testing.  He said, he didn't say where it would be, but he did say that everyday citizens will  direct the economic upside in the city's growth stock.  Imagine, he said, use your imagination now, a city with the vibrancy, diversity,  and culture of New York City combined with the efficiency, safety, and innovation of Tokyo  and the sustainability, governance, and social services of Sweden.  This will be our new city.  I wonder, is he going to put it on an island?  Is he going to carve out a part of the North Dakota countryside?  Is it going to be in a missile silo?

Transcript:  I gave you the answer ahead of time.  Good.  You all did your work.  According to the land report, Bill Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates own 242,000 acres of land.  The reporter, Eric O'Keefe, had to do quite a bit of digging because Gates has been doing this  with the usual way, shell companies, hiding.  But he was clued in by a weird story that a 14,000 acre swath of eastern Washington farmland  had just been sold for $171 million.  And he said, wait a minute.  That's an awful lot of money, $12,000 an acre.  But it is, whoever bought it, he says, knew what they were doing because it's actually  really good farmland.  He did a little more research and it turns out Bill Gates has been buying up farmland.  The guy's got some money.  So he's probably, it's hedging his other investments, but kind of interesting.  I just thought I'd pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can grow lettuce in the air.  You don't need farmland.  You could do it yourself.  Finally, the last story comes from the register, Thomas Clayburn writing about Austin Sendak,  who is at Stanford now.  He was 10 years ago, a physics student at UC Davis when he proposed a new unit of measurement.  As you know, we've got bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes.  We've got yottabytes and zottabytes.  But what comes after a yottabyte?  Well, he's from California.  He suggested the hellabyte because it's a hell of a lot of bytes.  Google supported it.  They've actually added a bytes to hellabytes calculator.  You can search on Google.  Wolfram Alpha supports Hella calculations.  There are other proposed terms.  Brontobytes is another proposed unit.  Unfortunately, I'm sad to say there is a group that does decide all of this.  In fact, the quadrennial meeting is coming up in November of 2022 of the International Bureau of  Weights and Measurements General Conference on Weights and Measures.  That's where changes to this SI system have to be made.  They say, you know what, we're going to name something, but it's probably not going to be  Brontobytes.  It's probably not going to be hellabyte.  I think the front runners are really boring.  Rana, R-O-N-N-A byte, 10 to the 27th, and Quetta, Q-U-E-T-T-A byte for 10 to the 30th.  Those are the front runners, partly because they need a single letter abbreviation like M or G or  T, and H and B are already taken.  In its defense, the hellabyte would be a hella good unit.  For instance, the sun has a mass of 2.2 helitons, pretty good, right?  Releases energy at 3.3 heliwatts, which is a lot better than 300 yottawatts.  I can't even take yottawatts seriously.  The number of atoms in 12 kilograms of carbon-12 would be, instead of 600 yottaatoms, it would be  0.6 heliatoms.  Again, I think it's on the face of it.  Obvious this is a much needed improvement.

And what I'm learning the hard way is that they basically need to lean on us who know how to use  any sort of smartphone or computer technology to get them signed up to get them vaccinated.  So just bear that in mind, not just for your family, but the people around you who might be  older and not so dialed in.

We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon,  2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern,  22.30 UTC.  Now, I tell you that time,  not that you have to watch or listen at that time.  Of course, it's a podcast.  You can listen to it anytime you want.  But if you want to watch us do it live  and get the chatter before and after and all of that,  that's why I tell you the time.  The stream is twit.tv slash live.  There's a variety of audio and video streams there.  You can pick the one you like.  If you're watching live, chat with us live in our chat room, irc.twit.tv.  Community run.  It's a great place.  Lots of fun people in there.  irc.twit.tv.  On-demand versions of the show,  as with all of the things we do at Twitter,  available on the website, twit.tv.  You can also download them there or audio or video,  or you can watch on YouTube.  Every one of our shows has a YouTube channel.  We do not have a show TikTok channel,  but I think there is a TikTok presence of some kind.  It's January, time for our Twitter audience survey.  It helps us understand you so we can make your listening experience even better,  and it helps us sell advertising completely anonymous.  It'll only take five minutes.  twit.tv slash survey 21.  We also have a twit forums at www.twit.community.  That's a great place if you listen asynchronously to join the conversation.  Every show gets an entry there and you can comment there.  I am no longer on Twitter.  I am on twit.social, our mastodon instance.  You're more than welcome to join me there if you'd like.  If you're already in the Fetaverse, just at leo at twit.social.  But if you're not, you can create an account there and join the federated mastodon.  Actually, it's not just mastodon.  There are a lot of different programs that use that.  It's nice that it's federated because that means you can follow people all over  from your individual instance, in our case, twit.social.  Of course, the best thing to do, if you would for us,  after you reviewed it on iTunes, is to get your favorite podcast client.  If they take reviews, put a review there too.  Download the show, subscribe to the show so you download it automatically  the minute it's available over Sunday evening.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.
