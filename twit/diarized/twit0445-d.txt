Transcript:  building it now we're not actually building it we're trying to figure out  what he was actually going to build given that he left tens of thousands of  handwritten notes behind about it so this you know it's a little archaeology  project he was crazy and is it gonna crazy is it is it steam-powered I think  it will have to be steam-powered just because the amount of metal you got to

Transcript:  you have enough money to do it we have enough money for the moment when we come  to build it I suspect we're gonna need quite a lot more money just because of  the amount of brass we're gonna need but for the moment it's research projects  and we managed to get a very large grant to do that so that's happening wow it's  made out of brass it's made out of gunmetal which is an amalgam of a couple  of different things and a lot of iron as well of course and it's probably  horrifically noisy when it's running right well we don't know that's a good  question that Babbage was actually quite good about trying to keep things quiet

End time: 384.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so we'll see but it's big I can't wait what a great idea anyway great to have  you all here this had a lot of news this week and I you know I don't know exactly  what the big story is I have to think it's the bid by Comcast to buy time  Warner Cable which strikes me as perhaps a tempest in the teapot since  there's no way the Department of Justice the Federal Trade Commission or the FCC

Start time: 384.76
End time: 421.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  will approve this or is there own I I have a sneaking suspicion that this will  get approved because I think all the processes are the anti-monopoly processes  we have have been broken in this country and they have been for a while I think  the excuse Comcast is going to make is that since there is no overlap in the  territories it's not really a monopoly and but it doesn't make any sense for  for the government to approve this but it will get an approved unfortunately

Start time: 423.42
End time: 434.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is does that Serena carry weight the fact that they're not in the same market  so if my internet service provider or cable companies Comcast it's not going to  change if it's time Warner's not going to change that just the merged company

Start time: 434.44
End time: 477.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  will have more customers they're growing larger we've seen this in mergers in the  past I'm not an expert on on monopoly law but I'm not like I'm not terribly  shocked if this is like I don't necessarily want it to pass but I am NOT  I won't be shocked if they agree so they have the Department of Justice agrees to  kind of let this come together the markets is a good loophole and in  addition there's so much Comcast lobbying money in Washington right now  for a variety of things net neutrality among them that I'm I'm not going to be  shocked if they if they don't you know they don't much the reason I would be

Start time: 478.16
End time: 601.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know worried about this is not just that they're going to be in the same not  in the same markets but these guys will have a massive influence on how you and  I access content on the internet so if they have such a massive you know  control over the the consumer market they can actually control the pricing you  know the per gigabyte bandwidth pricing can come into play they can do things  like charge you know companies more money to send traffic on their network  and I think that's the big challenge right now is if you are any future  Instagram or any future Netflix has very little you know recourse once you have  these mega you know you know giants controlling the internet access and I  think that is the thing we should all be worried about not that they are not in  the same markets the challenge we have is that the FCC chairman is is you know  who's his cable guy yeah so good luck trying to get anything past him or you  look at you know some of the other you know legislative bodies they're like  pretty highly compromised and the lobbying machines of you know cable  companies and and telcos is pretty amazingly strong and I think people here  in the valley don't quite understand I don't really pay that much attention to  the politics of networks like they are all so obsessed with the here and now of  lining their pockets and they don't really realize that these are the guys  who are the really the enemy of innovation in America is the the big  giant cable and telephony monopolies and I think I am increasingly worried  about what's gonna happen in the future it's not it's it's both cable television

Start time: 601.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and internet and it's bad in both businesses Comcast is the number one  cable company 23 million subs Time Warner cable number two with 12 that  makes them 35 million subscribers they're the number Comcast is the number  one ISP Time Warner is the number three ISP that would give them a total of 31  million households and I think it's been pretty clear I don't know about Time  Warner but it's been pretty clear that Comcast doesn't care a whit for net  neutrality and having this kind of clout with content creators will put a terrible  burden on content creators I you know I think there's pretty good evidence even  it's illegal the Comcast for instance is slowing down Netflix right now a

Start time: 650.20
End time: 687.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really good say again sorry there's um no sorry it's there's an interesting  thing that recode was reporting in that Comcast supposedly has a written or a  verbal agreement with with the FCC to abide by the open internet rules I know  20 18 despite the fact that the open internet rules are of course no more  thanks to Verizon but there is this problem with Netflix going on and there  are you know hints here and there and between that and the lobbyist money it's  I'm very concerned about everything that's going down right now it's despite

Start time: 687.70
End time: 831.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that so this is purely anecdotal but I think everybody who's watching who's on  Comcast probably has experienced this Matt Vukash is a software engineer who  wrote a blog post he says Comcast is definitely throttling Netflix he uses and  despite the fact that you're right this is a violation of their existing  agreement not to do so the problem is that Comcast owns its own streaming  business Xfinity stream pics so it's a it's a direct competitor to Netflix so  what he did is he tried Comcast over an extended period of time he was getting  terrible Comcast results on his network he's a student and so he he's at Indiana  University and he tried Netflix just without you know just direct connect he  was getting 235 kilobits per second over Comcast 235 kilobits per second that  means he was at best able to get 320 by 240 video and it buffered all the time of  course then he did something interesting instead of getting Netflix directly he  used his in universities VPN now normally you wouldn't want to use a VPN  for streaming video because the overhead would slow it down remember without the  VPN when when when the ISP could see what he was doing 235 kilobits per second  with the VPN 3000 kilobits per second Comcast couldn't see into the encrypted  tunnel so didn't know to block that traffic and despite the VPN overhead he  was able to get high quality 720p video consistently over VPN he says you know he  contacted Comcast on two separate occasions they found no problems with  his internet then he said they said he'd get a follow-up call from an a network  call never came I have to say this is pretty clearly anybody who's used  Comcast to watch Netflix knows it doesn't work consistently it's often  terrible and that's when Comcast you know is just the little old Comcast now  it's gonna be the cable town that owns everything I can only get worse agreed

Start time: 832.22
End time: 948.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you know I think the big big thing we should all be thinking about is how  can a company which controls the access also controls the content I mean if they  want to be the cable giant they need to start spinning out everything else they  own in the content side of things so that they can be in one business so this  at least gives some power back to the content owners so if you are a cable  company and you are going to dictate the terms so now they're gonna be so big  that they can dictate terms to content owners like ESPN and everybody else they  can dictate terms to internet companies like the you know the Netflix of the  world I mean this is just insane to think that we are dealing with a merger  like this we've been there before and we are making essentially one more too big  to fail kind of a corporation and and the problem is there is nothing as  consumers you can do about it because our whole political system is so  compromised just look at you know how many people come out of FCC and they go  and go work for for you know cable companies or telephone companies and the  reason for that is like why would they want to risk their own personal future  and take any tough decisions when you know they know they have a cushy job  if they don't do anything like they don't have to do anything and they just  end up making these big giants winners and like I am increasingly you know  despite you know not you know optimistic about the future of commercial internet  in this country because it just is like a two two-tier monopoly we have either  the phone companies or you have the cable companies a duopoly yeah well I

Transcript:  mean we can't just blame government which obviously isn't the most activist  in this but you might also want to blame ourselves I think that there's a certain  amount of fatigue even among geeks who know this is a bad thing you know this  week was the on Tuesday was the day we fight back except everybody decided not  to fight at all remember we were supposed to have a big action on Tuesday  against mass surveillance call your legislator the good news is 90,000  people did use the website to call their members of Congress I didn't see a lot  in the net about this though it seemed like it was awfully quiet do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of well I think the only thing is that whenever I hear Americans talking about  this this issue is that you have to have the perspective that you are talking  about it in the context of a legal framework there is actually a legal  framework what came out in some of the stone documents is that the legal  framework in the UK is much weaker and so we were there's a long-standing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cameron I think there is somebody who said that democracy is nothing but  perception and that's what it really is getting proven every day we see that our  government spies on us you know people actually have very little respect for  fellow citizens and I think the idea that the British people you know need  need to be censored on the internet makes no sense to me it's like wait how  does that even make any sense who is David Cameron to decide what is  pornography or what is you know unfair language and I think that is where we  start to kind of lose a little bit of of grip on on you know a little on society  per se and I think I'm beginning to feel that more and more of this news comes  out and more and more people around us are developing a certain apathy towards  the whole thing it feels like that yeah and I think a lot it has to do with the  incremental nature with which information is coming out like people  are just like reading in you know you know in like tiny bits on the internet  you know remember that every time you've had big scandals in the past which led  to major change there were like consistent like big reports which  always laid context to the things which were going on and giving people an  understanding of how it impacts them I see much less of that happening  especially in the big media and and I see more of like let's report on the  news let's do some you know much slinging on people bringing that news  or the information you know let's let's much sling on the whistleblower rather  than just talking about what is the big issue at hand are we going to be a  different kind of democratic society going forward how are we going to go on  ourself in this time of change and the internet so I think instead of focusing  on all those things we are beginning to focus on all the ephemeral here and now  things which which have much lesser impact but you know I think as media  people as media entities we need to take a step back and say okay what is the  role we do need to play going forward I think that's a huge challenge I find in  in on an ongoing basis like I mean I find really hard to grasp all the  changes which are all the information that is coming out of the Snowden you  know files I guess and like I still don't understand like how does it impact  me the world around me and I hear a lot of the the fireworks around it I don't

Start time: 1292.46
End time: 1350.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hear about the actual problem and what I think maybe we can it's harder for us to  grasp the privacy implications but this Comcast-Time Warner merger impacts to  me impacts the free and open internet and a lot of this impacts the free and  open internet and can we not as geeks at least stand for that to stand to  protect the internet it seems so important Tim Wu wrote a great book  about this called the master switch in which he said it's the nature of open  networks to become closed he he starts in the book he starts with talking about  the long-distance telephone system but he uses cable the cable and broadcast  TV industries the Hollywood entertainment industry and ultimately  the internet as examples of this in other words he would say probably oh  this is exactly what you'd expect the big the incumbent you know you have a  free and open internet until there's some real money to be made and the big  incumbents come in and say yeah we'll take it from here is that what's

Start time: 1351.02
End time: 1427.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  happening I mean that's what you really think you know it's happening I the it's  not just that I think the challenge is that we don't have anyone actually  putting any oversight on these guys no right that's that's the bigger problem  just like you know maybe some of us have no problems with whatever is coming out  from what NSA is doing but where is the oversight what is the clarity and  oversight why do we have a government if we don't know what it's doing why do we  have FCC or FTC when we know that they're not going to do anything in  favor of the citizens and look out for the citizen interest and I think that is  a bigger problem more not not that these big companies are trying to become  bigger I mean that's the nature of corporations we need to find our ways to  control and put like you know some kind of you know legislative controls on  these companies not like otherwise they run amok like it's like I am I'm all for  like you know full-on capitalism but we still need some kind of rules and  regulations to keep these guys in check I mean I think and there is nobody who's  gonna do that like that is that is become more and more obvious in last

Transcript:  television it's about broadband yeah they don't really talk about the  broadband part mostly because they don't disclose their margins on that business  they didn't don't disclose a lot of stuff on that business mostly because  it's it's very profitable to them I think interesting and and you know I  think there is I mean I wrote a post about this a little while ago which  compared like how much you know how much frequency they need or how many channels  they need to to pump out broadband and like how much money they have to spend  to get content for those networks so compared to that the the broadband

Start time: 1628.14
End time: 1665.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  networks are just more profitable that's encouraging in a way I you know I  remember talking to cable vision many years ago and they said we just can't  make internet work we have to sell you know from a business point of view we  have to sell premium content over cable HBO and the Olympics over cable  because the economics of internet are not good but you say that's not the case  that in fact the internet business is the fastest growing and has the highest  gross margins and of course you don't have to negotiate with anybody for  programming does this mean that Comcast and or a unified Comcast time Warner  cable would head toward being an internet company particularly they

Transcript:  government created actually the there is another way of thinking about it you  talked about Sonic net the reason Sonic net delivers what it does it's not just  because it can you know get access to the phone companies phone lines it also  is building its own network and it is doing you know things in a much smaller  fashion which allows the company to expand in a more you know in a more a  thoughtful sort of a way I think building a nationwide network is very  expensive but you can build out networks in in small cities or small  neighborhoods just like your ISP which is sonic.net has done or my ISP which is  webpast has done is they've gone after very specific niche markets and then  use that to expand their base and become a business and I think the only way to  build out independent ISP is through having a very small and focused approach  rather than having a national approach to building out an ISP and the  technologies are pretty you know the the equipment we need and all those things  we need to make a network is not that expensive anymore I think the cost is  Google fiber a viable option for instance if Google wants it to be it

Transcript:  also eight years ago right right so things the great thing about technology  is everything does get cheap yeah I mean the Google network isn't that is much  cheaper compared to those guys because they went into one small city set it up  now if they went went to like maybe 20 cities like that every year maybe you  know somewhere between five to twenty billion dollars right I mean and if they  can turn those those networks into networks for like which ensure video  advertising to their products I mean they can pay off much faster I think  there is clearly like if there is any hope of competition on a national level  it would be Google on a on a on a regional and a small city level I think  a lot more people should be thinking about ISPs I told the guys from from  from sonic.net that they should open source their their network architecture  plans so that other people can copy them and hold them are right I think that's  what we need to be thinking about how do we actually overcome these guys maybe  it's time to think about an alternate independent internet which is not

Transcript:  different in fact Bill Gates always said this he said I'm reluctant to give away  a lot of my money until I can spend the time I need to spend to make sure it's  being used wisely because it's difficult it's actually difficult to give away a  billion dollars and and give it away appropriately but Gates of course has  been very active in going to other successful tech entrepreneurs and saying  are you gonna do it too he got Warren Buffett to give away most of his fortune  and a lot of others so that's good absolutely maybe don't send out a press  release yeah go ahead send out a press release it makes you feel better we're  gonna take a break cheap words the article in the New Yorker saying Amazon's  good for customers but is it good for books we'll ask that question of our  panel John Graham coming is here go home Malik of giga-ohm and a serenity  Caldwell Macworld comm our show today brought to you by their folks at fresh  books a great cloud accounting solution that helps thousands of people like me  entrepreneurs small business owners save time billing get paid faster keep  track of their receipts keep track of their expenses and their time and hours  I started to you know I've been billing for years you know using WordPress or  not WordPress so Microsoft Word or Excel to create the invoices and it was just a  pain some months I just would say I'm not gonna do it this month I'll do it  next month I remember sending a company a bill six months later and they said  we're not gonna pay that what are you crazy what's that was that was almost a  year ago so billing is a big deal and it was always a pain until Amber  MacArthur when I was up in Toronto told me about fresh books it was a startup in  2004 and I started using it and it really was great it was a lifesaver made  it easy to create invoices beautiful looking invoices easy to get paid I  could send the invoices by email with a button on the email it said pay Leo that  really did help getting paid faster it's it's more now it's a complete cloud of  counting solution lets you lets you keep track of invoices but also capture and  track expenses on the go get real-time business reports with simple clicks and  you can try it right now free for 30 days visit fresh books I'm sorry get  fresh books dot com if you're if you're an entrepreneur if you're still doing  your invoices by hand you got to check this out get fresh books dot com free  for 30 days and by the way the delicious part of doing this they're giving a  every single day to somebody who signs up for a new account having heard it here  on Twitter so when you sign up at get fresh books dot com if you want to get  in that drawing for the birthday cake every day enter this week in tech and  how did you hear about us section when you sign up give us a little credit and  you might get a birthday cake get fresh books dot com did you guys read the New  Yorker article Amazon of course I've been fascinated by Amazon after having  read Brad Stone's book the everything store really interested in how it does  business the premise of this is that by making ebooks inexpensive by making  books easy to get they've Amazon has devalued the book an independent  publisher Dennis Johnson is quoted saying Amazon has successfully fostered  the idea that a book is a thing of minimum value it's a widget does that  seem reasonable is Amazon bad for books it's bad for bookstores yeah it's

Transcript:  definitely bad for bookstores I don't necessarily know if it's bad for books  it certainly has created some problems in terms of books making excess profits  but it's been I feel like it's been really good for really good and really  bad for ebooks but it provided a huge market for independent writers Amazon is  good for authors very well to a certain extent I mean there is the whole  kerfuffle about everything going on in the ebooks fear and about you know  agency pricing versus non-agency pricing and how much that's actually making  authors in the traditional publishing model Amazon you know it depends on  depending on how much how many books you are selling Amazon can be great for you  or be terrible for you for the average author I feel like Amazon's really great  because it's an easy way for lesser-known authors to really get the  word out and now that Amazon owns Goodreads it's a way for them to sort of  create a community and be able to touch base directly with their fans and their  readers yeah that that New Yorker profile I'm of two minds I mean I build  ebooks for Macworld so you know I have a very big stake in that game and while  Amazon has done some great things for the books world and the ebooks world  it's also made you know it's made the the paper book market a lot tougher it's  closed a lot of independent bookstores so yeah I don't know if I can I can  specifically go one way or the other about it I have some good feelings about  Amazon and what it's done for reading in general and for independent authors and  I have some really bad feelings about them as well Amazon uses the wholesale

Transcript:  model a traditional model where they buy at least for physical books they buy  books at the wholesale price the publisher authors which is usually one  half of the cover value and then they set the price on the Amazon store offer  and undercutting their cost. Apple does the agency model in fact Steve Jobs one  of the reasons Apple got sued is because Steve Jobs was a little bit too vocal  about putting Amazon out of business with the agency model in which they  charge 30% of the price and the and the publisher sets the price and they also  and then one of the reasons they really got in trouble they also told the  publishers they couldn't set a lower price anywhere else they couldn't sell

Transcript:  the book for less anywhere else or that they could sell them for less but Apple  could dock the price to that price if they did decide they're gonna sell it  for seven dollars on Amazon right and it had to be docked for seven bucks which  is really it was a huge problem because again the as you said Leo the publishers  weren't setting the price with Amazon's wholesale model Amazon was buying the  book for you know say eight dollars and then they were undercutting themselves  and they could be like oh well to make this book really you know selling lots  of numbers we're gonna discount that book to like 699 or something like that  and when Apple came into play with the agency model Apple's like well we want  to sell all of your books at 999 so you guys get you know the maximum possible  money that you can get but if Amazon decides to do discounting and Amazon's  not on the on that model we're gonna be able to discount it right away let's say  with most favored nation is that the right clause yeah yeah yeah oh you said

Transcript:  absolute sure book publishers you know went to Apple because they were terrified  of Amazon they're even more terrified now because iBooks has not become a big  player in the same way that iTunes has become a big player in digital music  according to this New Yorker article Amazon represents for at least one major  house a third of their sales on any given week headed towards about half  independence less than 10% one New York editor said only a third of the 3,000  brick-and-mortar bookstores still in existence will survive if publishers  don't waive their terms of payment bookstore it's clear that Amazon's  strategy is to dominate sometimes by losing money on a product until they put  the other guy out of business and then they own it Walmart used to do that I

Transcript:  think I don't think they're doing anything different I think the thing  which we should we should you know talk about is that the publishing industry  itself was loath to change or experimentation right and it is full of  so much sloth and and I think the people who complain about Amazon or Google or  anybody even Apple are people who are middlemen people who are getting  squeezed by the efficiencies of the internet-based systems and I think you  know serenity is right like you know this has been great for independent  authors and writers look at a lot of interesting ebooks which are coming to  market again they haven't succeeded at scale just yet but I do feel that the  the publishing industry has to blame itself for you know finding itself in  the position it is just like the music industry had trouble with its with  itself and you know they always blamed other people for their problems and it's  like wait technology is gonna keep moving you either you get with it or you  don't and figure out how to get ahead of it the the books business hasn't like  you know even today you want like in we live in a world which is so here and now  and and a book publishing schedule is like almost two years to three years  between commissioning to publication and the whole process is so inefficient and  Amazon is essentially trying to eliminate a lot of these inefficiencies  and I think you know Mac world can write like a really great piece about Johnny  I've or ebook about Johnny I've and have it in the market and in like a month you  know that's what readers ultimately want right they don't want to wait three  years after some you know big news events to wait for books to come or maybe  there's a lot of inefficiency in the system so you know we can't just blame  Amazon for everything you know I think the publishing industry has to look in  words as well and ask themselves the question as to like how they can improve

Transcript:  Jeff Paisas always said that he says it's not Amazon I'm just representing  the internet you know and the Internet's gonna put a lot of people out of  business hey let me ask you about this one John Graham coming because Cloud  Flare wrote about it the 400 gigabit per second NTP amplification DDoS and he  right yeah NTP is network time protocol mm-hmm that's right and so what is this  kind of attack this occurred on Monday but there've been more and more of these

Start time: 5854.84
End time: 5899.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all the time well this is the latest in a long line of what are called  amplification attacks where people misuse protocols that are based on UTP and  what's interesting about a lot of these protocols is you can send a small packet  and get a really big packet in response and by forging where the packets coming  from what you do is you send a packet looking like it's coming from the  victim and then some other server probably sends a massive packet to the  victim and these amplification things are really a problem because you can as  an attacker you can have only a small amount of bandwidth at your disposal and  suddenly turn it into 400 gigabits per second or whatever that's a lot of

End time: 5944.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  absolutely and in fact what happens is the pipes get clogged and you're then  talking about fighting it off yourself and then going upstream and upstream and  upstream to to drop packets so these but what's happened over the last would say  two months is NTP which is the network time protocol has become very popular as  people have realized that it has this enormous amplification factor so you can  get hundreds of times the bandwidth you've got available in the attack and  we've seen this one particularly big one on earlier this week at the 400 gigabits  per second and I expect we'll just see more because this is completely viable  and something people can do if they've got a grudge or an axe to grind you have

Transcript:  a diagram in the primer that you wrote showing how an attacker with a megabit  per second a one megabit connection can then go to ten compromised machines  those machine you have to compromise those machines ahead or have them on a  botnet but those machines are then the trigger machines that because there's  ten of them they have a gigabit per second and then those go to 400  amplifier machines which amplify it by 50 times by the time you get to the  target machine you're talking 500 gigabits per second all from a single

End time: 6017.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  delivered well it depends a little bit on the protocol how large is in that in  that blog post I talk about that the the scariest one actually is SNMP which has  a 650 X amplification factor so you could get 650 times the bandwidth out  through it and a surprising number of devices have SNMP available on them on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  attack using that now NTP is a little bit smaller it's in the 200 range 200  times the good thing that the reason people like NTP is that NTP tends to be  running on servers and those servers have got really beefy internet connections  so you'll find that you know a server running in a university somewhere or in  a business might have like a gigabit per second connection if you can then fill  that up with packets then that's a good part of your attack right there whereas  a lot of the SNMP stuff we've seen has actually been on home routers so we  actually saw one from Comcast some time ago where SNMP was used so it's not just  the amplification factor is how the machines you're using are connected to  the internet and NTP has become very popular because of the massive rate you

Start time: 6077.94

End time: 6121.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  detailed instructions for all sorts of NTP service that I in the blog post I  wrote I linked to a lot of instructions for how to do that and the other thing is  that the underlying problem is the ability to do IP spoofing because we can  do IP spoofing from anywhere then we can have packets of any protocol appearing  from anywhere on the internet and there is a thing called BCP 38 which is a best  practice for internet companies to not allow IP spoofing on your network now  if that was introduced all of these problems would disappear because

Transcript:  really the people running big networks so internet service providers some very  large several organizations which have packets transiting through them if  they're their own if they're essentially their own ISP right so it's  really something that and it has to be done globally when we the attack we saw  I think there's a map in that blog in one of the blog posts we put I mean this  was truly an attack coming globally hitting us yeah from everywhere so how

End time: 6293.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well everything in the ISP business is about how much money you can make right  I mean it's very very margin thin business so this is one of those things  that is a bit of an externality it's some some spoofed packets coming from  your network it doesn't necessarily hurt you directly you might get hurt by  packets coming from somewhere else so there isn't an sudden incentive to do it  unfortunately what we're seeing is that the attacks are getting so big and this  one that we've talked about you know this week is enormous that this really  is essential that people start locking this stuff down because what we've seen  is that pretty much anybody can be the victim of a DDoS and the DDoS is are  getting larger and larger and that means that ultimately you will end up being a  victim and so and it's easy to trigger so all you have to do is annoy a hacker
