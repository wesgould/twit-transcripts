End time: 313.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So access journalism is where you are nice to a company or a person because you'll get access  So a perfect example is people that are afraid of Apple  Because they won't get the iPad mini or the new iPhone early to be able to review it and then they don't get paid  Use and so on and because we're the New York Times  We don't have to play that game and the Wall Street Journal doesn't either

Start time: 414.40
End time: 419.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems that we say this every time there's a major event that because there's people on the ground using Twitter to report

End time: 433.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is first person and you can't the scale of I mean you basically have a distributed  Journalistic force they're not all trained, but they're creating the sharing images the sharing updates you have real data coming in  But then there's also one reporting team can't replicate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 486.68
End time: 494.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 495.68
End time: 538.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean think about the things that you saw it was the same ten images  Yeah, after tomorrow, and you'll see them in the next hurricane. It'll be and eventually it was demonstrably fake  And so who cares well, but at the same time I think that what happened was that there was a favorite there was a  As David Carr my colleague says you know the internet and Twitter. It's a self-cleaning oven right people immediately try to decide exists  Yeah, these sites exists  What's his name from the Atlantic Alexis magical set up a site where he was literally live?  It was fantastic. Yeah, that's where these real and fake  Stamps on these pictures come from Alexis's and the the the really smart thing that he was doing was he was going and he  Was taking the pictures and running them backwards through Google image search, and he would say oh  This is actually a screenshot from this. This is a photo from seven months ago

Start time: 539.10
End time: 546.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is real so the tools of the correction is built in even though that that is a risk  Speed works to the advantage of misinformation

Start time: 547.90
End time: 576.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For a time so I wrote about this for my column this week, and I interviewed the author of  This this book about lying, and he was saying you know everyone lies politicians lie  Stores live corporations lie everyone lies and on Twitter. They lie what is different is that?  people now  Can have the lies is actually accountable to at least a username right it may not necessarily be a person  but as a username and  And also there are people that have the ability to correct this quicker than than they ever would have had before

Start time: 576.78
End time: 597.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter's efficient role you call it in guarding the truth. Yes, actually you didn't call it that some headline  Nick's been because we've been talking a little bit about previous stories where the headline often was kind of sensational  Even the times which is not bad  Or it's rewritten in a way to be understandable, but not quite accurate some people write for SEO

Start time: 597.48
End time: 601.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some people write for for people to be able to get into the story quicker

Start time: 601.62
End time: 611.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know it's a different job for a headline than it is the reporter obviously correct  And people should know that I think it's not maybe not commonly known, but headline writers. That's a job

Start time: 612.48
End time: 673.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so what was really fascinating to me about the hurricane coverage on Twitter and  Focusing on that was there was the images that were flowing in from people were just fascinating right they were just I mean some really breathtaking  Images, but what time did was they sent out five real photo journalists that are paid to be photo journalists with their iPhones and Instagram and  They shot images and those were some of the images that stood out more and so you have for me one of the most beautiful  Images and haunting images was the picture of the carousel did you see that yeah?  The water had risen James Carousel and on the Brooklyn side which was just taken by someone just a random  You know citizen journalists if you will and then there were pictures by these photo journalists  And you can see this world where these things are colliding and but they're all telling the story  A role  I mean we're not eliminating professionals  No, and that's and that's evident by the time photos standing out  So we're not eliminating those people but at the same time people are have the ability to be able to share  The things that they see from from from every street every corner every basement

Start time: 673.56
End time: 722.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was fascinating for me is when you there's obviously an advantage to professional you know journalistic operations  But there's a physical limit to how much you can cover and so much of the story Nick  And I talked a little bit about this on the ride up was focused on Manhattan  Because you want you had a split city, it's also the media capital  But there you know the scale of devastation was much larger in  Staten Island and Rockaway Park and Rockaway  The far Rockaway and the beach and being able you can find those stories online now, too  And so there was someone had started a great discussion on Facebook about why aren't we seeing this coverage and people started pouring in?  With the images with the coverage with the images and you see not only in documentation, but in relief efforts  You know occupies done a super organized job down at the edge of Brooklyn where you don't see as much Red Cross activity

Start time: 722.54
End time: 805.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, so speaking of the coverage right now  We're beyond the the initial coverage during the storm phase and now we're in the interpretation phase and the story of recovery  Like is anyone else super annoyed that everyone that there are so many media publications and so many people making hay  Tying the single data point with global warming is anyone else annoyed by that  I take it that you're a global warming denier, right? No, no, no, I've got no stake in the thing, but it pisses me off  I'm somebody who as a magician back in the 70s  There is a guy named Yuri Geller who claimed to have psychic powers and could bend spoons with his minds and one of the tricks  He would do after bending a spoon in front of everything. He would say now all of you go out and look for  Look for watches that were stopped that have started happening now  My psychic powers have caused this to happen and everyone would go out and they'd find these little knickknacks  Oh this this old watch wasn't working now. It's working  It must have been your psychic powers and the phone lines would light up for it  It's it's a it's a magic trick to how to defend the students with this mind of course, right?  You're saying correlation does not equal causation, but it also goes both ways  It annoys me when Fox News starts saying coldest day in eight years, where's your global warming now?  When either side validates it they're part of the problem because it's unscientific and it only gives validity to the other side  I just want all of those assholes to stop it

Start time: 805.90
End time: 830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's I read a piece in some science journal this week that basically said can we say that this storm is  A result of global warming of course  No  Obviously, but can we over time the fact that we're seeing more of these storms these combination effects the scale the breath the impact  The economic loss is growing  Yes, that is the trend as a result

Start time: 830.76
End time: 837.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can also say that a warmer Atlantic which is demonstrably the case does increase the strength of sand

Start time: 837.52
End time: 845.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you so any specific storms scientifically you can't say yet  That's a global warming storm and that's not but the fact that these are stronger over time in general

Start time: 846.62
End time: 859.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's just it is is the only way to analyze a statistical trend is to look at the statistical trend  Anytime you point to a single data point and interpret it with that lens you do harm to the public understanding of science

Start time: 859.06
End time: 865.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But people don't experience trends, right? They experience single data points. They experience a loss

Start time: 867.12
End time: 886.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  To be made for it and sure never let a good, you know disaster go to waste but that's the problem  That's why we have a scientifically illiterate public is because we keep we can't resist on both sides  Taking advantage of a tragedy on one side or the other to to essentially idiotify  idiotify everybody

Start time: 888.16
End time: 947.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's say there were global warming and it were the issue maybe not global warming with whether what's the cause but let's say  There were just just bear with me for this  So let's say there were global warming what you would have is a series of increasingly strong  climactic results that you couldn't individually point to global warming, but at some point you you have to say  Well something's going on and and so that's it's it's it  I read a great speech and I'm trying to find I can't find it about if you're gonna pick the hardest thing you could pick  To demonstrate it would be something that takes thousands of years. It's very very difficult and  But on the other hand, it's also if if there is global warming and the planet is dying  We kind of need to know that you know what I'm saying and we kind of have to act upon it  No, absolutely. So it's appropriate to start looking for evidence not stopped clocks  I understand why the issue stopped clocks is germane, but well and understand. Okay. Here's my rule, right?

Start time: 947.76
End time: 965.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is the Brian brushwood rule. You are allowed to make political hay on a specific data point for a specific storm  You're able to blow it up  But that means you can't complain when the Republicans make hay over a big snowstorm or being a particularly cold year  You're either gonna play the game

Start time: 1364.28
End time: 1377.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Independently came to the same conclusion which was that Apple has deferred you wrote an article about the way it's planned obsolescence  They deferred an eight megapixel camera and a retina display in this thing  They could have easily included it because they want to do it  They want something for next they're gonna do it six months from now

Start time: 1379.12
End time: 1386.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 1406.42
End time: 1426.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's just my general take was Apple should not have I think you're right Brian  I think that they were somewhat aware of the low end, but look what happened  Google came out and said okay  We'll take 50 bucks off the Nexus 7 the problem is you cannot compete at the low end because neither Google nor Amazon has the same  Business model as Apple correct Google makes money when you use it Amazon makes money when you use it Apple makes money when you buy

Start time: 1426.34

Transcript:  so when I covered the the release of the  Kindle HD and I spoke to Bezos and he said I don't care if you have the first Kindle in your drawer or this Kindle  He's like we just care if you buy books  Yeah, if you buy media from us whereas for Apple, it's if they care if you have the newest hardware  It's the margin on some they probably make some

Start time: 1459.64
End time: 1465.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe as well so so in the long run is Amazon have a better a better business model because they're based on the media  Not the not the device

Start time: 1467.50
End time: 1506.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In my opinion the Amazon Kindle fire HD, which I've used extensively is not very good. I agree. It's a bad UI  It's a bad UI. Yeah, the Nexus 7 on the other hand is extremely competitive. It's 200 bucks for 16 gigabytes  It's got a higher res screen. The only thing lacking it doesn't have a rear-facing camera  Most people don't care about that. Yep, and so my recommendation was not to buy the mini if price is an issue  Get the Nexus the Nexus 7 is a wonderful wonderful  And I think Apple should have and I think you and I both before the show agreed to this  Not have said we're gonna make a competitive low price product  We're gonna make a small iPad and we're gonna charge whatever we need to charge to make it a retina  Maybe like an iPad mini. Yeah, yeah like

Start time: 1510.74
End time: 1551.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They would have been better off if they had  Offered because the press event was obviously it was a heavy focus on the iPad mini and then a minor focus on the  Latest revision of the iPad  I almost feel like the fact that they try to pull this as they are very good at in general this breathless new  Innovation something you've always wanted for essentially what's a mushy middle product?  It's something that pretty much just bridges the gap between your cell phone and an iPad  I think they would have been better off if they played it down as an afterthought  You know may focus more on the the new iPad revisions and then say oh  BT dubs people seem to like smaller devices  So we made one of those for you, too  If you're interested then they could have charged $100 more and nobody would have complained

Remember the web? Remember that this was all for mobile, right?  The days and and it was crazy to have two different sites. I still have two different sites on one of my blogs  Squarespace like any modern company, which is a real handful in the business said wait a minute  What if we just had one site that sizes itself intelligently to the platform?  And so when you get a Squarespace site, it looks great on anything from an iPhone even like one of these mini iPhones to the  To a 27 inch Dell XPS. I mean it's incredible  And it all is done automatically you don't have to think about it when you for instance when you upload an image it automatically  Sizes that image I think seven different versions of it for every possible  So here's what you do go to Squarespace comm and just take it take a test drive. It cost you nothing  No credit card needed you're gonna start by picking your template if you're a photographer, you'll notice some really gorgeous  Portfolio templates I shouldn't say photographer artist designer anybody who wants a portfolio  This this is a really great place  For that and then once you get your site you can import all your data

So let's look let's you want to go behind the scenes do it go inside out  So Scott and Johnny not big fans of each other and and according to people close to the matter who could not be named  Because they're not allowed to speak publicly by the company. So we have to say the New York Times  there were times that there were meetings about the same thing where Scott would meet with these people and in his team and then  Scott and his team would leave and Johnny would come in with his team and and leave and they getting conflicting messages from the two different  Teams. Well, these are some of them  I mean, of course they get conflicting my sister from Apple period because it's a it's a difficult company to work with but  but that you know, the the reality is Scott so  So Steve was a huge fan of skew Morphe design, right?

Transcript:  When in our chat room when nerds attack so skew Morphe design is essentially like an example is  Steve Jobs loved the leather stitching and the leather on his private jet and he wanted to be he wanted it in part of the  Of the Apple OS so they put it in the calendar. I believe yeah  Whatever it was so you see that the leather stitching another example is  There's some pretty bad examples  But there's a like radio where you have the radio dial or you have you have buttons that are turnable  So skew Morphe design can kind of blend between the actual user interface and the design the idea was like originally

I feel calm  Okay, but now so if you look at the last few versions of the iTunes logo, for example  It always was a CD, right?  But now go and find like a 12 year old and ask them if they know what's the CD and they're gonna be like  I don't what is that? Why is that round thing on that? Why are you pegging your design?

Transcript:  So jobs is a big fan of it and I think it worked for a long time  But eventually you have to kill the thing that is great, right?  You have to you know, you have to cannibalize yourself and and I think Johnny if you look at the look at this design of  This beautiful machine and this beautiful. I mean when he sits up there and his British accent  He goes it's the most beautiful iPhone we've ever made  He's not kidding like these are these the designs of these things and he'd like he's you know  Always focus on these things and apparently and I don't know if we actually put this in our story  But I'm gonna break some news here exclusive so exclusive on Twitter.

Start time: 2698.54
End time: 2709.55

Oh, yeah, it's fantastic  And he does the numbers, you know, it's all about the numbers  One of the things he pointed out and he's looking at the you know, the financials is that apple spends  more than three or four times what google and uh facebook spend  Yearly in uh, it's not rnd. It's like just in technical stuff  So it's not servers. They spend more than twice  um  Uh what intel spends now intel is a very capital intensive industry  They buy they build fabs apple spent eight billion dollars last year on infrastructure  So his question was what is apple doing that they're spending three times what google and facebook are spending spending twice what?  intel is spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what do you think that's it? Okay. I would love to hear what you think  um, I gotta guess that part of it is network  Because they need to build their network infrastructure  But if they're spending three times at google and facebook are spending it can't be all network  Uh, some of it has to be fabs. I think that they're very focused lately on doing their own chips  You know look at the a6x. I think they see that as a as a differentiator from companies that are using kind of more generic  arm chips  But then maybe the maybe the building in cupartino. I don't know robot army robot army  That's a good choice

So the building the things they're doing in that building will be applied to the devices we own  Okay, um, and I believe that uh, one of the things that they will be doing in the next few years  I don't know what the time frame is is is wearable computing and I think that that's the next iteration  No, that makes sense. I think you're right for a lot of people  Um of uh, you know ryan block, so could we all be thin and revolutionary?  We could all be walking around with apple logos on our bodies ryan blocks

Where they all kind of yeah, I like that is wearable computer. I like wearable  I think that's believable sir and I think that I think that wearable computing is the next iteration of these devices because right now  What are they all flat?

So so for example mobile phones created a problem where people texted while driving  Yeah, Siri and and Google voice and things like that were a solution for that problem, right?
