Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, Episode 53 for May 7th, 2006.  And an unusual panel on TWiT This Week. I'm not sure why, but we couldn't get many of  the regulars. I'm frankly very happy about it. The most regular, of course, is Robert  Heron, who we love having on. He's always a welcome guest from DLTV. The co-host with  Patrick Norton, who is not here. I'm not sure where Patrick is. Also joining us, Alex Lindsay,  who's been a regular many times and has his own TWiT clone, Twim, This Week in Media,  which is part of the TWiT network. Good to have you, Alex. We've got lots to talk about.  Well, we'll tell you in a little bit, of course. And then a couple of newbies who've never been,  well, actually, I'll save the newbie for last because Will Harris has been on TWiT twice now.  And we're glad to have him back from bit-tech.net, which is Britain's,  the UK's favorite enthusiast website. Somebody's breathing. It must be you, Will.  Sorry, is it me?  Does this get you excited? Are you getting hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very hot in here. My air-con is working in my hotel room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, Will's in town. He's in Santa Clara. You came in for E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool. I'm out here first seeing NVIDIA, actually, the graphics company.  They've got some cool stuff to show me. Then I'm flying on to LA on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll talk about E3 in just a second. But let me introduce the final member of our panel today,  somebody who does do a podcast for the TWiT network. It's a brand new one, our newest podcast,  Floss Weekly, Chris DeBona from, he's the open source manager at Google and the host of Floss  Weekly. Hey, Chris. I'm also a regular on the screensavers. He was always our open source guy  on the screensavers. So of the panel here, is anybody else going to E3 besides Will?  Nope. I was going to go. I got a funny phone call from Al Lowe last week, the guy who did  Leisure Suit Larry. And he said, can you be my guest at E3? And I said, wow, yes. But then I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just have so much to do. I guess the big hubbub is that all the booth babes are gone.  Yeah, that's the main reason I'm not going. They're cleaning it up. They're cleaning the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  whole thing up. Do they still have the Tycho drummers though? I mean, because that's really  what drove me. I was invited to a thing that Vaya is doing. You'll probably go to this, Will,  and featuring the girls of destruction, but I have no idea. That's a really interesting thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because we actually went to the girls of destruction is like a girl gaming clan, right?  Oh, all right. So they're not babes. They're actually gamers.  They're actually gamers. And they've set up a house in Sweden of all places. And they've  basically got like a training house for this girl gaming clan. And we went out there to see it.  Are they Swedish? Why are they in Sweden? Well, I think it's because Sweden has like  really chunky broadband. You can get like a hundred meg there just like for nothing.  So they went there for the broadband. And so they flew in. They've got a girl from  England, a couple of girls from California and a girl from Japan or somewhere. And they've put  them all in a house to train together and to like hone their elite skills, I guess. And then they're  flying them off to different tournaments and stuff around the world. Great. Maybe it's just me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but I think if you got a bunch of girls together to live in a house to play video games. You  wouldn't be video gaming, would you? Well, I'm just thinking it probably looks just like a frat house.  They're probably no different than a bunch of guys. They probably sit around in their boxer  shorts drinking beer, playing games, right? No? That's about right. I wouldn't say. I mean,  why wouldn't they? So they're so you think like Chardonnay is being served? Come on.  Yeah, they're not drinking chablouille. I'm trying to frag someone. I could tell you that right now.  So Viya, I guess what has hired them or sponsoring them is sponsoring them. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're all pretty good gamers. They won some stuff at QuakeCon last year. And it's like a  promotional thing. You know, Viya gets the name associated with these cool gamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they are they hot? I mean, I hate to ask. You can't reduce it. You're playing into the  stereotypes. No, no, it's not me. I don't have any interest, but I know our audience would want to  know. So a couple of them are hot. I think when you just say, you know, the Swedish female professional  gaming team, right there, that just says it all. Sold.  All right. So anything else besides the Girls of Destruction that's going to be exciting about E3?  Oh, well, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii. Well, the Wii is clearly just an attempt to get some press  at E3 because they don't have really anything to say except the new name. Right? Yeah, it's a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's strange. But PS3, apparently they're going to have the new PS3 controller. It's not going to  be that boomerang thing. They're going to do a new one. That's going to be there. And they're  going to have some playable Revolution titles on the floor. So you can go and actually try out the  weird controller and use it as nunchucks or whatever. So that should be quite cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it look like? It kind of hangs, right? There's a hanging part or?  I'm trying to remember. Are you talking the Nintendo booth?  No, the PlayStation 3 controller. Do we know what it looks like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The PlayStation 3 controller, the concept one looked like a boomerang, didn't it?  Yeah, but they're. And it was really, really weird. It had really long handles.  And everybody hated it. Everybody hated it. And so they're coming up with a new controller. But  interestingly, the only reason that they're doing that is because they had a lawsuit about the dual  shot controller, didn't they? Which they lost. Which was saying that.  Immersion Corp. Yeah, that's right.  That Immersion actually owned the technology in DualShock. And so they're having to change  their controller. That's a company to invest in.  Well, Microsoft has already invested in them, hasn't it? Microsoft's on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reportedly, I mean, Immersion owns the patents to any form of force feedback or.  Wow. Rumble.  Wow. You can put in a controller. But that's true. I remember Robert.  From medical devices to gaming consoles. I kind of remember when we first saw the  first Immersion device. It was the first force feedback we'd seen.  Well, that got seen, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their first. Yeah, their first Immersion device. I mean, the first feedback device.  Immersion used to make these big arms that you'd use to digitize. We actually had one at Lucasfilm.  And you would digitize. You could digitize 3D objects by touching on different points,  and it would build those 3D models. And so that's where Immersion started. And I think they were  kind of. We thought that they were all going to kind of fade away because as we started doing  laser scanning and other things, we weren't really using that that much. And then this force feedback  came in, which I think is they're mostly supporting by either licensing or suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's funny, you know, I mean, I think that Evans and Sutherland and Lockheed would have some  sort of prior art on force feedback of any kind whatsoever.  You mean for big flight simulators that they might have built for the Air Force.  Guys, they've been doing crazy stuff for almost 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting. I think that it was, I don't think that Immersion came up with it. I think that they  bought somebody who had been doing it for a long time. So somebody else who had the patent, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Interesting.  Anything else? OK, so we're going to see the new PlayStation controller. We're going to see the  Nintendo Wii or something like it. Xbox 360. It sounds like the only announcement is with that HDDVD  we talked about last week. Anything else new? And then they'll have a video, Halo.  And they'll have Halo. Yeah, which will only be out on the 360, I guess.  Oh, really? This is Halo 3? Yeah, it's there, Sam, like three months ago.  Oh, yeah, the 360. You don't have an account, a permanent, like a gold member account. The whole  week of E3, everything's free. So jump online and have some fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's quite good because they're putting on, like the demos that are going to be at E3 and  stuff, they're actually making available on the Xbox Live. So if you don't get to go to E3,  you can still see some of the cool stuff that's there, which is really interesting.  That's a great idea. And nobody's ever really done  that before. I mean, you get sometimes cover discs, don't you, of videos and stuff from E3.  They're actually making loads of that stuff available for anybody to download on Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that idea. You know, I have to say, you know,  the Xbox Live team has just been firing up all cylinders from day one.  It's the one thing they've really got right. They've really got 360 right. And this is the  Linux guy saying this. You know, I mean, they've really got it right. My office mate, he's got a  360. And just the stuff he tells me just blows my mind. Well, but Chris also has a background in  gaming. I mean, before you went to Google, you were designing a massively multiplayer online  role-playing game. Yeah, because nobody had done that before, it turned out. Yeah, I did that for  about a year and a half. Yeah. So you watch this stuff with interest, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah, very much so. Do you game?  I was at E3 a couple of years ago. Yeah, it's fun. Do you play games?  I do sometimes. I have a daughter and a wife and a job. And so games kind of come last.  Yeah, like I'm first in line for Half-Life 2 preloading it.  You know what I'm first in line for? I am so excited about. Have you looked at the videos of  Will Wright's new game Spore? Oh, yeah, it's the Spore stuff.  Yeah, that looks. Spore is mind blowing.  Yeah. Yeah. It's hot.  Do you want to describe it, Chris Force? Well, you know, there's actually a video up on  Google Video and many other places, I'm sure, where, you know, it shows like you start off  at the sub-molecular level, you know, with these single-celled organisms or whatever, and they.  And evolve, bro. And you have to evolve.  And then you have these little animals, then you have little villages, and then you've got  villages killing each other, and you've got rockets and space and, you know, solar systems  and galaxies and the whole schmear. You know what I like is that the choices.  The choices you make, even at a single cell level, will then follow through. So your creature will  evolve based on the choices you've made all along.  Right. So the real question is, can he make this fun? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? I mean, that would, I mean, when you first looked at SimCity from a distance, you'd be like,  well, why would someone want to play with that? But I mean, the first time I touched SimCity,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I lost like eight hours. And The Sims is very compelling,  but this seems like something Will, who did SimCity and The Sims, has been building up to  his whole career. I mean, this seems like the culmination of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually. It could go so horribly wrong, though,  couldn't it? It could be so atrociously awful. It could be SimAnt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It could be. I'm so terrified of the game,  because if it's remotely good, I'm going to lose whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is worse. Which is worse, is if it's terrible or if it's really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm rooting against it, because, man, I just, I don't know if I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  deal with losing that much time. It looks like the ultimate game, which is,  it has elements of gameplay, but it's also very open-ended. So you, you know, you can add,  you can make a three-legged creature. That's one of the videos that everybody's seen,  though there's some new ones that have just come out, but you could make a three-legged creature.  And then everything from then on has to support three legs. So your buildings, your cars,  everything you do after that is kind of determined by the fact that you made a three-legged creature.  Sounds like a total time sink. Yeah.  I can't wait. What a fun one.  I cannot wait. So that's, that's the one I'm not so worried about Halo 3. I'm worried about Spore  taking up all my time. Yeah. You know, they're fun, but they were no.  I'm really hoping that Sony shows off some of the online components.  The online components for PlayStation 3. Yeah. Because I mean, the hardware is not final.  The big deal, the controller is getting redesigned and there will be some playable titles,  but I just, I want to see what they're doing in terms of online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they have a release date? Yeah, like November, isn't it? It's like holiday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not going to make it in other words. They're saying before the end of the year,  but now that the blu-ray stuff has been pushed out yet again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're also saying that the cell processor is being a real, real pain in the ass to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I bet. Yeah. And Sony kind of has a history  of cutting it really close to their development tools. So they should just say,  we'll be out before Vista and that would be safe. That's a safe bet.  It'll be out when it's done. So I thought this was kind of interesting  story that was just floating around really more as rumor than anything else.  Microsoft has been talking with Yahoo about buying a big stake, maybe even the whole company.  This is one way Microsoft, which certainly has, I guess has the cash to do it. It seems like it'd be  fairly expensive, although Yahoo stock price has been fairly depressed.  It would certainly be a way of solving Microsoft's search woes.  What do you think? How much would it cost you to buy Yahoo now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll have to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot less than it would have been like five years ago.  Yeah, their stock price is terrible. It's been tanking. Let me go to Yahoo Finance  and see what Yahoo's capitalization is.  I mean, it would be 47 billion.  47 billion? Yeah.  Microsoft probably has that much in the bank.  They have 56 billion in the bank.  There you go. They could pay cash for it.  They probably do.  And still have enough left over to buy EMI.  That's a...  47 billion.  Now I'm going to start a rumor right now.  You heard it here first.  Google and Yahoo and Microsoft, all three have enough cash to buy the entire music industry.  I don't know how. I don't know that that's true. I mean, Microsoft, sure. I mean, they've got  infinite cash, but you know.  Well, you okay. So you give up a little stock. Your stock's almost 400 bucks now.  You give up a little stock, but truthfully, I mean, the market caps of those three companies  are bigger. I've been told, I haven't done the research, but I've been told bigger than the  market caps of the three big record labels. You could effectively buy the music industry  and just say, okay, it's a free concert, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be cool. I mean, what would Microsoft get out of Yahoo?  I mean, what would it then like merge Windows Live with Yahoo or would it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's another AOL Time Warner. I don't think they could swallow it.  No, I don't think they could swallow it. I think it would hurt both companies badly.  I don't know that I buy it, but I think the best thing for Google would be if Microsoft  bought Yahoo because it would just drive the crazy of the companies for years.  Exactly. And Google just say, okay, have fun.  We're going to be over here. You guys.  We'll just keep doing our thing. You have fun trying to swallow that snake.  Think about it, because Yahoo is not a small company and neither is Microsoft.  And Yahoo's had focus problems for the last three years anyway.  On two unfocused companies added together.  In Yahoo's defense, they do quite well at attracting and keeping users. They really do.  They have more page views than anybody else on the internet.  They've been well challenged by Google and have responded well.  I think Yahoo Maps responded to Google Maps very well and is very critical.  Yeah, they're very.  Yahoo Mail has responded very well to Gmail and has gotten much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're really into this Web2 stuff, aren't they, which I guess Microsoft wants to be into  because it's sort of the antithesis of what Google is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's so much overlap, though. Microsoft Live versus what Yahoo is doing.  There's just so much overlap. I think that it's a bad. It would be a mistake.  But I can totally see Microsoft doing it. It's a form of floundering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that it's similar to when Netscape really picked up and Microsoft felt like it didn't  buy someone, but it needed to do Internet Explorer.  Right.  And it's almost a knee jerk reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they bought Spyglass, right?  Yeah. Yeah. And it's a neat.  I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I forgot all about that.  Geez. But the thing is that they feel like they have to.  Their way of getting caught up again is to just go buy something.  Go buy something or build something that's just like theirs.  And they've been successful at doing that in the beginning, but  I don't think it's worked out over and over and over again.  Well, the things that make Microsoft really successful,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the things that make Microsoft really successful have been the things that it has developed from  scratch from day one, Office and Windows.  It hasn't really done apart from those things.  I mean, what has it ever bought that's been successful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question. I'm trying to think.  I think there's like this list of Microsoft acquisitions online. Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I just think I think that Microsoft, you know, made it was in the right place at  the right time in the mid 80s when Apple was not clear of what it wanted to do and  took advantage of it. And I think they've been on that that momentum for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's also their realization that software is arguably the most important part of any  computer experience. It goes beyond the hardware. I mean, that's what people interact with.  That's what people that is the experience is how good is the software.  So and now I've done that right away.  And nowadays, software isn't something you put on your hard drive. It's websites.  It's web services. So to me, that's what that's the whole point of acquiring Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, allegedly, but is it I mean, it's one of those things like  we're heading back into the thin client mentality, aren't we?  Yes, very much.  The early 90s proved that thin clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a different world now.  Yeah, that's before the web though.  Yeah, you're going to have micro micro formats. You're going to have you have.  I think it is very different. What was that number, Alex? You came up with this.  How many people on the Internet now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Six hundred and ninety four million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three quarters of them are Chinese. Six hundred ninety four million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, 10 percent of them are Chinese.  Yeah, I think 72 million are Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really good question, though. Is this just the return of the of the thin client,  the network PC, which has come and gone as you know, every 10 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of excitement around the idea of the Internet app.  I'm not sure if the web is the solution to that. I mean, if you look at I'm a very strong opponent  that iTunes would have never succeeded on in the in the web.  No, it's a desktop client very much.  And you watch and you watch these other ones. You watch Napster, you watch these other  services that are trying to do the same thing. And beyond having a different business model,  the experience is so much lower than iTunes that you just as an iTunes user,  you can't even imagine using it because it's all you know, I open up another window and then I wait  and then I look at this window and then I wait. And it's just it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you think about the parts of iTunes that are most frustrating are the parts that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  loading online while you wait. Right. The more cash, the better it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point. Like, you know, when you go to subscribe to a podcast or try to find a podcast,  like, say, Floss Weekly with Chris Bonet, then you find yourself hitting that subscribe button.  And then you have to start over if you want to find something else. And it's a little weird.  Why can't I hit back?  That is annoying.  Actually, in the iTunes space, there's a couple of big stories. One Napster is offering free music.  The first five plays of any of its two million songs are absolutely free. Obviously,  this is the last ditch attempt to win audience away from iTunes.  Smells like flop sweat, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. Yeah. And the thing is, you still have to be connected to the internet. I mean,  most of us want to listen to our music somewhere other than sitting next to our computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that copy, that darn Windows media copy protection scheme, which requires  that you certify that you own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And you got to have the player that's compatible with it if you want to take it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And once again, it opens a player window. So you have to find the song on the website,  and then you hit another thing, and then it's going to open the player window. If you want  to listen to another song, you have to go back and go back to the web page, and then you go back to  the player window. And it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like iTunes doesn't have copy protection, but it's just much less intrusive.  They get out of your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those things like iTunes works because even though it does have copy protection,  and even though it does have lots of restrictions and stuff, the chances are you will never notice  them. Because even if you just buy off iTunes, you buy off iTunes, you put it on your computer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you put it on your iPod, you never want to think about it.  I think there's a fundamental way that different companies look at this. I think that most of the  companies that got into the music space, Microsoft, when you look at their DRM,  they thought, how do we cater to the industry so that they'll give us more music? Where Apple is,  how do we make it easy for the consumer, and how do we force the industry to do it that way?  So Apple goes to loggerheads with them, but they're looking at how do we make the experience  better, while the other ones are looking at how do we make it easier for the industry to step over?  And it's just two very different ways of approaching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big news from Apple's point of view, they were able to talk the record labels into sticking  with 99 cents a track. The record labels were making a lot of noise about wanting variable  pricing, pay more for current hits, pay less for old songs. I don't know how Steve Jobs does it,  but somehow he got into the table, all the contracts were up, and yes, he got them agreed  to 99 cents. In fact, Apple shares jumped 2.9% on the story. Big, big news. Now this is interesting,  the big four labels make about 70 cents a download. And remember, Visa makes 25 cents a download,  so Apple is making a nickel at best. Well, and then take out the Akamai costs for the bandwidth,  which is very expensive. I think Apple loses money, probably loses money on every download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet you they don't lose money, but I bet you they don't make it. They make no more than a penny or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the question. What did Steve have to give the labels? Did he have to give them more money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, surely you hit them with a piracy stick. It's like everybody's got an iPod, and if they're  not filling it with legit music from our service, they're going to be filling it with pirated stuff,  and then you're not going to get anything. Steve Jobs has the big swinging club when he comes into

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  these meetings now, doesn't he? I mean, Apple's the seventh largest reseller of music in, I mean,  overall, not just online, the seventh largest music reseller in the United States. Like Sam

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Goody walking into the meeting saying, we're not going to stop selling records unless you guys agree.  Yeah. I mean, that's a big deal. Yeah. And I think that's funny. If you look at when they first  started selling music via the iTunes music store, the record companies were going around telling  everybody, you know, not to pirate, and there's lots of legitimate ways to get music, and everyone's  like, no, that's BS. You know, show it to us. Right. So he went to them and said, listen,  people are pirating. They're saying you're not doing it. You're going to come under FTC,  you know, scrutiny. Right. Let me sell your stuff. Here's the price. Right. Right. And they probably  thought, yeah, whatever. You know, we know how to sell music. You got your computer. People don't.  And they said, sure, whatever. 99 cents. Who cares? Maybe that's what happened. Maybe the  record. Maybe the labels really, that's what happened. They said, oh, it works. I guess,  I guess it's not such a once it started working, they started getting greedy. Right. Well, that's  when they say, yeah, now we could charge a buck 39 for Britney Spears. So it works so well for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rhapsody. Yeah. So this is, this is a question. I mean, are we sure that this is a good thing?  Because from my point of view, if I like, I'm not buying what's ever is in the top 10, I'm probably  not buying Britney Spears or no, I like the idea of cheaper, old song, cheaper, older stuff. I  wouldn't have minded if I could go and get like, you know, one of the old chili peppers albums for  like, maybe 60 cents or something. Maybe Apple didn't do us a favor. Maybe Apple did not do us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a favor. Maybe it would have been variable pricing would have been a good idea. But on the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hand, it's I don't know what it's like in the States, but in the UK, older stuff always costs  more. And stuff in the middle is kind of not bad. And the new stuff costs more. So it would probably  open it up for, you know, it would get worse in the long run. But but at the moment, I wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have minded cheaper old stuff. So are you in Santa Clara right now? Is that what you said? Yeah. Go  down to Rasputin music. They have a dollar bin. Oh, what a great store. 17 billion CDs. Oh, wow.  Take them back to England, do a little bit of CD arbitrage, you know. It's funny though, because  in the States, people are always looking for imports, right? You gotta get the imports.  They cost like $50, the vinyl imports. Nobody's, nobody ever likes what they've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what amused me was that everybody in the States always complains about cinema prices,  right? Oh, yeah. And in the UK, it's way more expensive. It was like 25 pounds, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You pay more than 10 bucks. You pay more than 10 bucks for a movie. Yeah. I went to see MI3 this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  morning. It was 10 bucks. And I would pay 10 pounds in London. That's like twice as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's absurd. $20 for a movie ticket? Oh, no. And you gotta tell them how long the commercials

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are. Oh, the commercials at the beginning are at least 20 minutes. It was a line, your popcorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bucket with gold. What are they doing in there? I mean, that's crazy. It's way more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It always makes me laugh. You guys are always like, oh, your DVDs are so expensive. And,  you know, DVDs are more expensive in England as well. So if you think you could have bad over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there. Do they make you, do they still do the national anthem at the beginning of the movie?  No. Good. That's what you're paying for. You don't want to have to get up and sing God Save  the Queen. Yeah, it's sort of replaced by a Coke commercial. So who gets that money? Is it the  exhibitors? Is it the movie companies? Who's the greedy? I think it's the theater owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because if you've got a massive theater in the middle of London, you're paying, you know,  how much in rent is going to be astronomical. I mean, property in England is so much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong. The way it works in the States, I believe,  is that all of the ticket sales go to the movie company. And then the exhibitor-  It's not all. It's not all, but it's a large portion.  And the exhibitor's profit is really on popcorn and Coke and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Well, I don't think we have quite the same popcorn and Coke culture in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you got to work on that. Your movie prices are good. Actually, you know, it's interesting. If  you add up what it costs to go to a movie in the States, if you include popcorn and Coke,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's probably not much more. Yeah, much less. I mean, you have to walk away from the popcorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and Coke. You get a box for a box of candy. Yeah, that's crazy. Maybe it isn't such a big  disparity. It's just that we pay money in the other way. Are the theaters in England at least  nicer? Do they have good screens and nice seats? They're all right, but it's really hit or miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some places that are at real dives, obviously. And there are some places that do  like great- you can go to some great places in Kensington in London where you can go and they've  got a really nice screen, really nice sound. And everything is armchairs and little tables.  And you can get like waiter service at the beginning of the movie. They don't bring you  like alcohol and stuff. That's pretty cool. I'd pay £10 for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a theory that this is actually why cargo pants are seeing a resurgence now.  You can put a lot more in your pants and go to the movie.  You can smuggle more sweet tarts in those pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've actually been able to make it in there with a Starbucks coffee without

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  spilling it in my cargo pants. This is completely not tech. Well, it is.  If you have a broader definition of tech. Fashion is really important.  There's some guys that are making something called a beer belly, which you strap onto your gut. It  looks like you're fat, but inside you've got beer. And it's for going to ball games, movies,  concerts. You just figure out there's another. It has a little thermoelectric cooler on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. They call it the beer belly. What are they going to do? Feel everybody's belly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't, right? Boy, you got a hard belly. Well, I'm stuffed. I just had eight bratwursts.  So the big rumor going around is that while everybody's paying attention to E3  in Los Angeles, that Apple is going to announce their new MacBook line up in Cupertino. Is this  nuts? Is it going to be Tuesday, Alex? We're going to be there Tuesday. Are we there Tuesday

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or Wednesday? But aren't we going up there Tuesday? I think it's Wednesday. I think it's the day we're  going over there. But I think that. Oh, OK. So we may miss it. We may miss it or maybe be able to  shoot some stuff when we're there. But yeah, it's supposed to be the little MacBook is supposed to  come out. I mean, I think that I think Apple just wants to release it as soon as they're ready. I  don't think they're really concerned about what else is going on. Now, I don't think E3 really  fits into there. We're pretty sure it's people. You're Apple people. All right. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's people walking around. Not all of us are Apple people. Well, I don't mean that in a weird  way. I mean, you know more than I do about Apple is how I should have said it. So what's the what's  kind of the big deal here? I don't get why them rubbing their MacBooks. You're obviously not an  Apple person. You're not an Apple person. Does it have like a little arm that gives you a little head massage?  Is this the ultra portable notebook? Well, I don't think so. 13 inch  smaller. It's going to be an iBook. It's just a little smaller than the white polycarbonate  tie book. Whatever. Here's the thing that's surprising to me is that the this MacBook supposedly  be a duo and instead of a core solo, which I thought it would be. That's how you would  differentiate on price. But I think it's actually getting harder to buy cord solos. Nobody wants to  sell them. Nobody wants to sell them. And so Intel's made them really, really, really cheap.  Interesting. Like there's an N100 ThinkPad, which I just got my wife, which is in the mail right now.  It's a core duo and it's $700. So it's like, what's cheaper than that? It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  $600 for a flip and ThinkPad. I think the MacBook is going to be really, I know we're going to get  one for our CFO here and specifically because of the dual boot, being able to, she needs to be able  to use Quicken, which has a Mac version or QuickBooks, I'm sorry, which has a Mac version,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but it doesn't really work. We're pretty sure this is this rumor is true because there was a slip  on the Apple website in which they actually put a link to a MacBook, not a MacBook Pro,  but the rest of it, we don't know the facts. Well, the listeners can go to the twit  53 delicious tag and go right to it. So you can see it right there. You mean a picture of it?  Yeah. I mean, that's where links to. Oh, wow. I'll have to go look. It's very useful.  This is useful. The computer, she is useful. She's useful. The internet, who would have thought?  The rumors, of course, are from ThinkSecret and Apple Insider. And they say that this be this  13.3 inch widescreen. I would probably buy that if it's cheap enough. That'd be awesome. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the 12 inch with a 1024 resolution, the 1024 resolution is just too low. Yeah. But a 1024  or a 1280, like a 13 inch widescreen with like 1280 by 768. That's good. I take that. That'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great. Going to have to pick the camera in it, you know, and yeah, apparently, hopefully it'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go over into the they'll then be like a MacBook Pro that's like 13 inch and we'll have the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kind of full factor. According to Apple Insider, Asus is going to make them. Hmm. Not quantum. No.  Asus makes decent, but not great notebooks. What's your opinion of the Asus notebooks? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have you guys reviewed them? Yeah. I mean, they are solid if unspectacular in general.  They make a couple of really nice little widescreen models. The one that I really like is they have a  they showed me a prototype a few weeks ago, which was entirely in clad in leather. It was a leather  it was a leather bag notebook. It was awesome. A couple of Kat of Nine tails. And they had and it  was really nice. It was like, if you have like, I don't know if you guys have, if you have like  an expensive leather wallet, it's got that really lovely like texture on it. I wouldn't mind that.  They had they had one that was in there like a really nice tan leather color. And then they  had one where they treated it. It was really like bright pink leather. What about the thermals or  something like that? It was awesome. They look like a blanket. Robert's got a good point. It's  going to get pretty hot. But I guess if you've got a like a cool duo or something that runs quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cool, you can get away with it. Hey, have you felt the new MacBook Pro? That ain't cool. Well,  that's not cool. I think it's hot. My friend at work was disassembling his checking the heat sinks  on it and everything. Just making sure it was all he got about three quarters of the way of  disassembly and he gave up. He was just like, okay, this is he just bought it. I don't know.  I was impressed that he even opened the thing to begin with. I think that's insane. That's what I  said. He finally gave up on it, put it back together. And then he took some hundred dollar bills and  started burning them for fun. There you go. Did you see that Islamic militants are now using  first person shooters to recruit terrorists? Who put this article in here? Is this from you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was me. It was one of those things where allegedly Islamic extremists are using,  do you know Battlefield 2, the computer game? Yeah. It's quite easily moddable. And so they  modded it basically to have like a sort of like an Islamic extremist awesome army and then like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the American infidels. Do these actually exist? You know what I mean? Yeah, where can we get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you've got to go along somewhere and they give it to you on a disc. If the quality of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mod is good, the content is almost irrelevant. But it's not a... What's the playability of being a  suicide bomber? I think they should bring out back Bomberman or Suicide Bomber 2. Suicide Atomic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bomberman? Yeah. But I mean it's not that really from the Americans using America's army. Sure.  I mean that's basically propaganda. That's total propaganda, but it's a good game. I think this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one of those stories that's too good to check. You know what I mean? Yeah. We don't really want to  know. Dan Devlin, a Defense Department's public diplomacy specialist says, this is, I'm quoting,  BITTECH. He believes this kind of strategy will be employed more and more as terrorist groups like  Al Qaeda utilize technology to spread their message. So Will, where'd you get this story?  Oh crikey. This is your reporter Ryan Garcide. Oh man. Is Ryan reliable? I'm following the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did Ryan... No, it was definitely linked somewhere else. All right. It comes from Yahoo News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh there you go. Yeah that's right. If you say it's... So it's Reuters? Yeah. Oh.  So it's Yahoo reporting from Reuters. I'm not going to say a word. I was going to say something  like, they make stuff up all the time, but that would be lie. So I'm not going to say that. I  don't think it's true anyway. I'm sure they're very... Internet reports in not reliable shock.  MySpace, speaking of shock. Not reliable shock. This is from Valleywag. So again, consider the  source. What's wrong with Valleywag? He seems obsessed with women. You know, like... He's  obsessed with half the posts are about people like his... Larry Page's girlfriend. It's all about  Larry Page's girlfriend. Oh yeah. So tell us the story here because I actually haven't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The story on this I read is that there's this guy, this chap called Trent Lepinski who is a...  Basically he's sort of a student. He's a wannabe journalist and he did loads of research into  MySpace and how it started and to what actually went on. And the theory is that the two guys who  are the poster children for MySpace, I can't think of the guy's name. Is it Mark Anderson somewhere?  I can't remember. Tom Anderson, sorry. Basically they sort of created the idea and then they sold  it to a company which basically was a spam company. Right. Krista Wolf and Tom Anderson.  That's to the right. And they basically sold it to a spam company. The spam company developed  it into MySpace. That's right. And that when Murdoch bought it, all the money went to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  spam company. It's basically... Intermix Media got all the money. We actually talked about that a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  couple of weeks ago. And it's basically about how Tom Anderson and Chris are basically a bit of a  sham and they're just nothing more than a front really for this spam operation. Oh interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So really it has nothing to do with... But he's not saying that they aren't doing what they say  they're doing. It's a fraud in one sense. No. So allegedly MySpace has already threatened this kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with a defamation lawsuit. Oh great. You don't mess with Rupert Murdoch. And he claims that he's  like going back to try and have decent journalism and journalistic standards to go and do these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things. Interesting. All right. How about the Blue Spam story? I followed this one. Blue Security is  an Israeli anti-spam organization which has a kind of unusual way of fighting spam. They have what  they call a do not intrude list. Almost 500,000 people have signed up for this do not intrude  list. And if you're on the list and you get spam, essentially they spam the spammer back. They send  message after message saying take this guy off your list. Take this guy on. They send so many  that in effect they're DDoSing the spammer. Now actually it's not the spammer. It's the sponsor  of the spam. The spammer probably is a hired hand, a hired gun who is brought in by a company that  wants to sell something. So they'll flood the sponsor. It's hard to get back to the spammer.  However, there is a spammer, a guy named Pharma Master, thought to be a Russian,  who has responded this week with a DDoS attack against Blue Security's own system.  And furthermore took down TypePad because the Blue Security blog was moved to TypePad.  So he's been launching attacks like crazy. And you know in a way I kind of don't blame him.  You're playing with fire. You start DDoSing people. You're going to get DDoSed back, right?  So the thing is about this kind of thing is that if you're going to spam in response to spam,  isn't that just like you're another spammer in response to your spam for that spam? And it's all  just huge ways to ban with them. On the other hand, you got to like any technique that actually  pisses off spammers, which it has done. Does this actually do that though? It doesn't seem to slow  it down at all. No, you're right. It hasn't really worked, has it? In that sense, you know,  it just needs more people. And it certainly doesn't work for these. You see, I don't buy this at all.  You know, more power to BlueSpan for trying something new, right? So gay them. Good. But  in the end, I just don't think it matters. You know, I had that. I think it's one of those things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like once you're on the list, surely you're like, you're more likely to be spammed because there's  a list of all people in one place who have valid email addresses. Isn't it one of those things like  you should never really unsubscribe or spam mail because then they can know it's a real email

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  address. I made the mistake of saying unsubscribe me from one, you know, I got one email. Never,  never, never. This was years ago and now, you know, I just get hundreds of them. I had nothing until

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then. That's one thing I love about web-based email nowadays. At least with my Gmail account,  I never see anything in my inbox that doesn't belong there. And very rarely. You get no spam?  No, no, I do. I mean, there's a spam folder that fills up and I used to delete it out, but I don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't care. Of course, all your friends are wondering why you're not responding to their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  emails. No, I do check it once in a while. You know what it turned out with Google? If you're  an actual Google employee and you have that dot Google on your email, if that goes into a Gmail  account, Gmail puts up this crazy red message saying you should be really careful about this  particular user. They might be impersonating company or blah, blah, blah. It actually flagged  that one somebody I know who actually works for Google sent me an email and it just, it totally  flagged it and dropped it into my spam account. What about that, Chris? Do you see that? Yeah,  send us some. I've never heard of this. My God. Here, I can actually, I still have, I saved it  just because the, and it highlights it in this bold red text. And it was just like, okay. So  what are they saying? They're saying because it comes from Google.com, it may be forged.  Yeah, totally. Gmail will allow you to email from a known good address. So it'll send like  a confirmation email to it and then you can have that as be your reply to. Right. Right. But maybe  they put some special logic that if it's reply from Google and it's not a certain list of servers  that it flips out. I don't even know. Hmm. That may be just part of the standard anti-fishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stuff. It got weird. Yeah, I have to, man. We, we, one of our ISPs, we have a bunch of different  servers and a bunch of different places, but I get mail from different mail servers. And one of them  though, blocks is so tight about blocking the stuff. I have, I have a friend of mine who has,  you know, who can't send me email from his normal address, you know, and they're like, well, we can't  really turn it off for one person or, you know, they don't have any way of really managing it.  And, and I'd rather just get all the mail and sort through it myself. I mean, I don't really,  I mean, it doesn't take me that long. The only time I get upset is when I'm on dial-up, you know,  in Africa or something and I'm getting 600. Oh, here it is. Warning. This message may not be from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  whom it claims to be. Beware of the following, of following any links in it or providing the  sender with any personal information. And that was somebody who works that I know that works  at Google. So it's an anti-fishing. Sent me an email to my Gmail. It's an anti-fishing warning.  I would rather err on the side of culture. That's funny. They assume that if it comes from,  if it comes from Google, I wonder if you got it from paypal.com or citybank.com,  you'd get the same warning. It probably would. It's a anti-fishing warning, right?  Yeah. That's what it sounds like. Yeah. I mean, I'm not,  you know, it may be totally irrelevant because according to Frost and Sullivan in seven years,  the internet's going to be broken anyway. We're going to run out of IP addresses. There are no  more left. Yeah. I'm scheduling a vacation for that week. You know, they don't, they don't  actually give a date, but they say 2012, there will be a 17 billion devices connected to the internet.  And that's, that's about how many addresses there are for IP version four. So we're going to have  to all move to IP six because it's only 32 bit addressing. So IP six, which is 40 or 128 bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  addressing, that'd be enough. Yeah. Isn't that a lot of dead space though that we could use up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it's bogus. I don't, I'll have to look at this article, this research report,  but what people have been saying this for years, but what happened was routers.  And for a long time we thought, oh, there's just not going to be enough IP addresses,  but that's when you assume that every device on the internet would have its own address.  But thanks to routers and that and DHCP, you know, how many, how many devices do you have in,  in your house that's on the net, but you only have one internet address, at least half a dozen.  Yeah. So in, I think in fact, it's, it's much less of a problem than anybody thought it would be,  which is why IP v4 or v6 hasn't really taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. And even things like offices mostly run, you know, you can have an office of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  200 people running off one night, one address. So I don't, I don't, this is Frost and Sullivan. I  mean, they, they, they, they know what they're talking about, but I don't know if that, that  may be one of those Malthusian skies falling predictions that in fact doesn't hold up.  I mean, all the current browsers, I believe already support IPv6. So  you have routers that don't, that's the problem. The whole, the whole internet infrastructure would  have to be replaced. That's okay though. Who cares? It'll be all replaced by then. Anyway,  I mean, it'll have to be, I think so. I think by the way we're getting all this extra spam from  blue, whatever, you know, because of blues, blues, blues spam. Steve Soderbergh said at a panel  this week at the Tribeca film festival that he's going to use BitTorrent to release a short.  I think that's great. I think anything. You never saw that one student film of his.  Oh, is it really bad? What was the name of that? So now I have to go to IMDb. Cause he did,  I mean, he's done some great movies. Yeah. Some of my favorite, I mean, traffic and traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's done some brilliant work for sure. So, but what's your head to explode? You should go and see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gosh, where is it? This is a student film, but is that what he's going to release or is it? No,  it's a new short he's doing. He's going to do a high def film, Alex. I love it. Yeah. And it's  going to come out in mid May. It's part of the next issue of a DVD quarterly called Wolfen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually think he's, he's shooting in the nine fifties, which are the same, same campers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  using the same HD cameras that we use for Mac break. That's cool. Well, no, the reason I like  it is because it's a Hollywood establishment guy saying, no, BitTorrent can be used for things other

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  than piracy. Well, I think it opens the door. I think Hollywood should be more afraid of this  than they are of people downloading illegal movies because a lot of what keeps Hollywood,  a lot of why we see the same movie over and over again and why, why a lot of this is problematic.  I mean, why Hollywood is fine with the system in some ways, the way it is, is because the  constrained supply of distribution keeps them in business. If anybody can put out a movie that is  HD resolution to thousands and thousands and thousands of people, it very quickly starts to  diversify the market, which was going to cause, you know, it makes it much harder to make a  blockbuster, which goes back to what George Lucas said about, you know, no movie being more than

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $15 million. But as, but as we've learned from Mac break, which is we do a 1080P version,  it's hard to find the bandwidth for these massive files. When we do, we do ours in BitTorrent. I mean,  Mac break is going out in BitTorrent. That's the only effective way to do it. Right. Although we  have had people, Cashfly has approached us. I don't know. Did you tell Cashfly how many

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  terabytes they'd have to serve? That wasn't for the Mac. That wasn't for the, I don't think they'd  have any interest in doing the BitTorrent one that way because they. No, but for Mac break for the,  for Mac break for the little one we were talking about. Oh, the little one. Yeah. I don't think  they were, if we were talking about, if we made it direct download of the, of the, of the HD version,  we'd probably be burning through like 50 to a hundred terabytes a week, which would be problematic  for whoever was. Nobody could really do that. And that's the interesting thing about BitTorrent is,  is that when you're talking, it really is designed for this mass market distribution because the more  people want it, the easier it is to download it. It actually works better with popular content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. That's its flaw. It doesn't work well at all with unpopular content. Right. Yeah. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a rumor that I saw this week that the next version of OS 10 is going to have BitTorrent built

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  into it somehow. Oh, I read that somewhere. The rumor is, is that it's going to be, it's not going  to be actually something that all of us can take advantage of, at least at the beginning. The rumor  is, if it happens, is that Apple's going to use it to distribute very large files. We don't know what  they would be, but they might look like movies. And, and you would, and the, as the rumor goes,  you would be able to, Apple would be able to distribute stuff using your computer and you  would get some kind of points for making it available. So it'd be a volunteer in, you could  say, I want to, I want to be part of this. And you might get discounts on music or, or free songs or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or some. I see game companies doing this already. World of Warcraft uses a system just like that for  distributing that, what was that last patch? About 300 megs. And if you enter the details of the  actual download process, it shows who you're connected to and the files moving up and down.  They've been using peer to peer for a while, but the, but I think it's, isn't it troublesome for a  big company to do that without somehow compensating? I mean, I think that's been the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that, but that's what Apple would, the rumor is that Apple will offer discounts on stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at iTunes. And I mean, you'll get something for it. Those of us who use BitTorrent realize it really  isn't a big burden on your system. I mean, it's not a lot of data. However, I think people are kind of  nervous about having somebody use their bandwidth. If it's set up properly, the user would never know.  It's when it's sucking up all of your upload speed. And then that in turn would just affect

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  everything you're doing. Even if you try to surf to a page. And if a developer like Apple has enough  control over the clients, what it means is that they can very softly distribute this out to a lot  of people. So they can send it out to 10, then a hundred, then a thousand, then, you know, so it's  not something that it hits any one computer very hard. You do a staged rollout of the content so  that no one server is doing a lot. Staged rollout is the thing that's missing right now for most  BitTorrent clients. And it's just hard because you can't, you just don't know who's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  available. I still think it's not really the, it's not really how much it hits your system that  concerns people. It's just the, the mere idea of it. Yeah. Like, but I'm paying for it. Why do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know? Right. Right. But we know that Macs are a Mac and hot. Well, see, the thing is Mac users  would be the type that would just kind of go, sure. Apple, anything you want, let's take over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the world. Anything you want. How can I, how can I play? You think that really I am Steve Jobs,  Cabana boy. It seems to me that if your performance in your download, you're late,  you're able to go as quick. And I don't know the upload part. It really doesn't, I don't even think  about it personally. No, I run, when I run BitTorrent and I keep it running all the time,  it hardly does it, you know, impacts it at all. So I should admit at this point that I'm really,  really terrible at BitTorrent. I'm bad at it. You're a bad BitTorrent to me. Yeah. I think that  BitTorrent just doesn't work for me very well. No, no, no. You know what? It's everybody because  people talk about it as if it's this holy coming and you realize that very frequently the files  come in extremely slowly. It's not unusual to see when you're downloading a BitTorrent file. Yeah,  you'll get that next week. Yeah. When I see 2k, I'm like, uh, that's very common unless it's really  popular content or somebody like Apple has a lot of seeds and a lot of clients out there. And that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really, that could be, if Apple can persuade a hundred thousand people to play, it would be

Transcript:  pretty profound. Once, well, once Twitch seeds, I mean, Twitch is a good example. Once we seed,  we'll have several hundred seeders. It's very quick. Nobody pays. Nobody is doing a, you know,  has a burdensome amount of downloads. You know, it's hard when I first seed it, I'm,  I'm the primary seeder and then the server gets its copy. It becomes a seeder. And so it's slow  at first. So if you first try to download twit in the first few hours, it's slow. But by the time,  you know, by, by, by Monday morning, it's fast. It's very fast. It's also too, a lot of people  don't realize that if you're behind, if you're using a router and you're dealing with not  addressing and everything, most of the bit to one clients require you to port forward specific  ports for better performance. And that can be an issue too. Some of the better clients actually  tell you exactly what to do, but I think Google's doing bandwidth shaping to you Chris. That's why  it doesn't work. Oh, no, no, no. When I do try to be torn something, I tried to do it from the  server and this massive thing. All right. I'm not really a pirater. I have too much stuff of my own  that I've already like digitized and I haven't gotten time to watch. So I think, I think people  who really download a lot of stuff, it's a collecting thing. It isn't because you're going  to watch it. Yeah. You just want to have, Oh, I've got that. Yeah. I think it's a lot to do that.  Hey, real quickly, before we wrap up, CBS now joins Fox and NBC as, as the big networks all  moved to distribution over the internet. CBS is inner tube, which may be the worst name I've ever  heard for a television distribution site. I don't know. It could have been called we.  Well, the worst thing is they don't own inner tube.com that's owned by a tire company.  So bad. So you have to go to see, you know, you'd think they could have come up with something. They  could have had the marketing people on television morons, CBS online. I don't know. Anyway, go to  CBS.com inner tube and you'll see that they in fact offer a lot of programming. And in fact,  they're going to offer the pretty bunch old stuff. They're going to offer new stuff. They're  going to offer pilots of things that have never aired. They've got shows like Greek to chic,  which never intended to air some interesting stuff, but it's all streaming. Oh,  it's at least widescreen. No, for the shows at least. Yeah. That stuff will be widescreen,  but it does not full screen. I hear you. I mean, not necessarily full resolution,  but at least the widescreen ratio is wide. Yeah. And they don't have as many spots, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They kind of do a light spot load thing. I think that I, and it may be just because I,  I travel a lot that I'm so sensitive to this idea that I have to be connected every time,  every time I need to, I don't like streaming. That just really, really frustrates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pausing and rewinding thing. If you want to go back a little bit, usually that'll break a stream.  And then you're sitting there cashing, cashing. Streaming is what people who don't get it do  when they want to do internet distribution, in my opinion. But then this is coming back to the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that we were talking about a thin client, isn't it? I mean, Alex was just saying, I don't want to  always be like connected to do stuff. And so thin clients have only got a limited thing because  until we get to the point where literally everywhere it has an interconnect connection,  then this isn't really going to work. You're always going to want to have stuff on your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  machine and do stuff on your own. Well, I'm on an airplane. I want to watch it on my,  on my laptop. I don't want to watch it off the internet. Well, right. And for reliability  reasons too, especially in a home environment, there are reasons you wouldn't want, say a home  media server touching the internet directly. You would rather have it, you know, with the content  that you've stored on it and to be able to access it without, without having to worry about, you know,  potential hacking or anything else. So yeah, it's just connected to how my wife listens to this show.  Wait, wait, don't tell me it's like some NPR thing. Yeah, I download it. It's great. It's great. And  you can get it via podcast or you can listen to it with real, with real player. Yeah. Who's going to  listen with real player. And then it's like, well, why don't we try it just with the podcast? And

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's just, it's perfect. Oh yeah. You know, and I think that it's not just having the bandwidth,  I mean, having connectivity be ubiquitous. It's also having it be fast enough ubiquitous, you know,  ubiquitous and fast enough all the time to watch video. And like when we look at, like we, we just  made the latest Mac break. We actually uploaded the podcast at 960 by 540 and you know, that's,  everyone's going to get a big surprise. And the, that's pretty. You mean the iPod version is five,  it's not an iPod version anymore. It's just the podcast version, but it, it, it's a podcast.  It's not a podcast. It's broadband video now. And the, but we figured out how to make it as small as,  as a regular podcast. So I mean, for the same, it's like 10 megabytes more than the  360 by 180. Wow. Yeah. It took a lot of tweaking. Is that the, is that the cell?  Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a great one. And, and we, but we figured out how to,  there's a bunch of technology stuff that we've been doing to squish it down. And,  but the main thing is, is that still at 95 megs, you know, it for 24 minutes, that's really great,  but it would still, the bandwidth you would need, it's great to download it and watch it later. And  it looks really big on your screen and it looks gorgeous. And you can read the text on the screen  and all that fun stuff, but it's, it's not something that you're going to be able to stream  anytime soon. And so all of us keep on watching all these videos that look nasty. When you look  at all these streaming content, because it doesn't, you know, number one is the compression that, that,  that Macromedia is using or not Macromedia Adobe is either, you either have to make it really big,  or you have to make it look really bad. And there's not the spark and the, and the onto just aren't  efficient. They're not nearly as efficient as H two 64. And that's going to be sites like sites,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like YouTube are just proving that people don't always care. No, happy to have it pixelated and  look like rubbish because they just, they just want to know when they're not paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My kids live on YouTube. They just live on it constantly. But I think that once you start,  once you start having something else there, once you start having stuff that's higher quality,  I think people will get a little more picky. They're just, there's just nothing else out there.  Everyone want to watch, wants to watch video, they have broadband and that's available and it  doesn't cost them anything. And they don't have to sit through a bunch of commercials, but as soon  as that changes, people are going to get, and as soon as someone else starts to put up higher  quality video, people are going to get a lot more picky. And this goes back to e three, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess one of the things they're going to do there is try to hype their particular brand of HDDVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Both Microsoft and Sony are going to go head to head with that. I think I get my players,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they get a player on Monday or tomorrow. Yeah. And HDD player. You're kidding. Is it going to be  the Toshiba? Yeah. Great. I'm just, I'm happy to have it as a high quality source. And I'm  also getting a HD satellite hookup for the lab and I'm going to be very, very curious to see the same  movie delivered in HD over satellite, compare that directly to the HD DVD format itself.  I've been underwhelmed. I know which is going to look better, but I just want to see it in person.  I've been underwhelmed. I had a dish HD for a while for review and it, you know, it's, it's DVD  quality. I, I, I, I, you know what? Next week we'll talk about it. That's I'm getting the new MPEG four  hardware too, and that should be installed sometime next week as well. So, so we'll do a high def round  up next week with Robert. That's great. Woo. Woo. I really like to be there because I have to tell  you, I'm loving high definition. Isn't it great? I don't, yeah. Like Sopranos on it. It's like,  Oh, I'm spoiled. It just shows you never really think, Oh, that'd be great. And HD it's like,  Oh, this is really good. Well, what happens is you just can't go back. I mean, it becomes the  standard. I'm really pissed. I really want sci-fi to be in HD. Yeah. I find myself watching some of  the worst TV simply because it is an HDI Miami for instance. Oh, and of course I'm at work at 11  o'clock. It's what is it? Uh, one of the soap operas is in HD and I don't have a sound. No,  but it's something to look at. That's actually in HD. But it's, uh, well it's quite cool because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're just about to get a HD in England. It's just about to be rolled out next month. You guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't have it yet. No, no, no, we don't have it yet. No wonder you could charge 20 bucks for a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, so we're really excited. They're, um, sky who was owned by Rupert Murdoch is just about to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  transmitting in HD. What is the penetration for HD TVs in Britain? Do a lot of people? Uh, it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's pretty small, but it's getting a lot bigger, a lot faster. Yeah. Um, but it's really interesting  because they're, they're broadcasting exclusively in 1080i. That's, that's all. And so it's really  weird because virtually all the TV sold in the UK at 720p obviously. Right. Um, but sky is, is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  broadcasting exclusively in 1080i. I think that's fairly common. I think on cable, uh, and the cable  channels like ESPN HD, uh, I think they're, most of them have settled on 1080i. I think it's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  frustrating that we, we had a chance when we moved to this digital era to get rid of the interlaced  altogether. And eventually we're going to get there. I think the people, as they start one  up in each other, I mean, some of this are now being able to do 1080p progressive scan, which  means you're seeing every, every picture. And I think that's everything progressive. That's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing I like all the sporting events and pretty much everything. The whole point of interlaced  because you didn't have enough bandwidth to show the entire screen. And so you're going to do half  and half. Well, you can do that too slow. Every TV can do that now though. There's no reason for  the interlaced. That's crazy. I mean, they all compressed to the same bit rate. It's just,  do you want twice the resolution delivered with half the data in a sense or do you want that,  that full resolution? But you're not really getting twice the resolution. Yeah, actually.  But your frame rate goes down. Yeah. It's still, well, it's the way it's delivered as that  interlaced. You're getting every other line compared to getting the whole frame.  You know, I haven't ever sat down and looked at, looked at one compared to the other on a good TV.  But as I, when you look at it on a monitor, on a computer monitor, it's horrible looking interlaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's different because the computer monitor by itself is, is progressive. It's  showing. Yeah. It's kind of making everything progressive. So everything's going to look bad  on a computer monitor, but it's not upscaling. But the 1080p is really the end of the road. I mean,  it's not, I'm not the end of the road. No, cause you've got the red camera and now we're at 2000p.  But, but the, the, the, we're just beginning Alex. No, but the 1080p though is, is I think  where everyone's going to end up. And so, you know, like when we're looking at, at buying these,  we're really making sure that they're compatible with the 1080p signal. Cause I think that's what  people are going to end up as they start, as the competition keeps on pushing them forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we do, we do at 1080p, uh, every, uh, once in a while on Mac break and you can.  They're all now, weekly. They're all, they're all going to be weekly 1080p. And we got,  we've got a new shoot schedule coming up and lots and lots of shows coming your way.  Macbreak.com or you'll see them post on twit.tv. As soon as I get around to a post,  I have such a backlog now about five podcasts. I get up there all at once.  Oh yeah. Yeah. Robert Heron is on DLTV. You catch his great work there with Patrick Norton. Please  say hi to Patrick for us. And we'll talk next week about, uh, hi, deaf. We're going to want to get  your deaf, your, uh, review of the, uh, HD DVD. That'll be awesome. I can't wait. Yeah.  Of course, uh, our good friend, Will Harris, who's visiting from Britain,  he's going to be going down to a E3 and maybe we can get you on for an E3, uh,  wrap up as well. Uh, well, yeah, that'd be cool. See what's going on. Bit-tech.net. It is a kind of  the, the enthusiast site of choice in the UK. And, uh, we're glad to have you on to talk about it.  Of course, Chris DeBona, our good friend who does floss weekly, our open source podcast. We just did  a great one with Miguel de casa. I liked that one. So good with the Miguel is the guy behind gnome  and now mono talking about putting.net on Linux. He's absurdly fun to talk to. It's great. I think  it's a great episode. That that's one of the podcasts that's backlogged. I will get out real  soon. We also have our first biotech podcast is, is done. I just have to get it out the door.  Nice. So we got weak in cells. No, we're calling it futures in biotech fib,  fib. And you know, we're talking about Robert was the thing that you were so interested in  microarrays, the ability to put on a single chip, the entire human genome. Uh, and it just,  it's remarkable what they're doing. We're talking about DNA, protein and tissue microarrays.  Just the analysis tool alone. And it's the speed and the number of individual things they're able  to analyze this. Oh yeah. Is this the affometrics one? Uh, it's the first step really towards  personalized medicine where you can go in and get a drug or a therapy or treatment exactly tailored  to the issue at hand. The geneticist chip, it can do a hundred thousand sites tested. It's incredible.  Yeah. I think the record now is a hundred, 19 or 20, something like that. That to me is just  thing is rocket science. I mean, it's, it's just awesome. Well tune in with a fib will appear this  week as well. Uh, and of course, Alex Lindsay, uh, Chris DeBona, Robert Heron, Will Harris, uh,  will appear again on another this week in tech very soon. And we'll be back next week  with more tech news for you. Our thanks to our friends at AOL radio for providing the bandwidth  for all of the twit podcasts at AOL.com slash podcast. I'm Leo Laporte. Another twit is in the can.  The server's completely collapsed. So here's the deal. I'm just trying to get the thing up,  but I have a hell of a time. What, what, what blue screens like? Forget it. I'm killing you.
