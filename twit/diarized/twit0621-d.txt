And I know you still take amazing wildlife pictures and we could see a lot of those on your Instagram. I see them on Facebook.  Also joining us right now Denise Howell from This Week in Law. We thought we kind of rejiggered the show a little bit to get a woman on the show.  Thank you Denise for being here and I'll tell you why we thought it'd be good to have a woman.  Big news roiling Silicon Valley right now. It started with stories from the information talking about Justin Kaldbeck who is a venture capitalist.  Started his own firm Binary Capital and has been accused by a number of women of inappropriate behavior.  These were VCs who had approached him about funding and Kaldbeck has now left the company.  In fact they're folding the venture fund.  But then Katie Benner in the New York Times just a couple of days ago publishes an article which goes much farther mentioning not only Kaldbeck but other high profile venture capitalists.  Chris Sokka of Lowercase Capital, Dave McClure of 500 Startups.  Dave wrote a mea culpa in which he said I'm a jerk and he planned to step down but he'd stepped down a little early.  Chris Sokka of Lowercase Capital, Dave McClure of 500 Startups.  This is kind of roiling Silicon Valley. Katie Benner is on the line with us. We appreciate you joining us Katie from your first day off.  Katie Benner Happy Vacation.  Chris Sokka Happy Vacation but you know when you write a story that says this big you know you're going to get calls and I know you're doing interviews around it.  How did this story come to you?

Start time: 306.72
End time: 390.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Katie Benner Well so a lot of it to your point really did come after the information published the story about Justin Kaldbeck.  I think that most of the women in the story were not expecting the sort of support that they got.  The story said that Justin Kaldbeck had sexually harassed them or groped them or propositioned them while they were trying to raise money from his venture firm.  So he was really in a position of power over them. They need the money for their companies to grow and survive.  That's why you raise venture capital. It's why you make relationships and create friendships with VCs.  And it's sort of what it's the lifeblood of all the innovation that Silicon Valley professors to embrace and to promote.  So they're trying to raise money. They were harassed and they didn't think anybody would believe them.  And then not only did people believe them, you had Reid Hoffman and you had Melinda Gates come out on Twitter saying these women should be believed and they should be supported.  So that was an extraordinary moment. And in the wake of that, as I was calling people just to see what kind of impact the story was happening,  I was meeting more and more women who said, you know, I want to go on the record too.  I have a story to tell. And a lot of them had screenshots, text messages, Facebook messages supporting their allegations.  You know, this wasn't he said, she said. We were reading these text messages saying this is a real proposition.  This is a really bad thing to do. So certainly a lot of people had that kind of supporting evidence as well that I think helped them come forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, this follows on the heels of the Travis Kalanick's resignation from Uber, Susan Fowler's blog post, which started that.  It is starting to feel like this is endemic in the Valley. Is that the sense you get, Katie?

Start time: 407.79
End time: 481.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't think that it's surprising to me that it would be so pervasive.  If you think about it, the venture capital world is very tiny and very closed off.  So, you know, it's very much a who you know sort of business. It's a network business.  The actual capital itself is held firmly in the hands of these hundred or so venture firms.  And they have there's no transparency. So they're not publicly traded.  There's no reason for them to explain when bad things happen.  So what usually happens is if a VC abuses his power, the firm is incentivized to let him or her go quietly, maybe pay them off, maybe put money into next fund just to get them out of the firm's hair.  And instead of letting everybody know why they're being fired or why there's a mutual agreement legally for them to part ways, they just let them go very quietly into the night.  And then they can do whatever they want as long as they're not messing up with the messing with the reputation of venture firm A or a venture firm B.  Those firms just push the people out and move them along.  The way it was described to me was it's very similar to what the Catholic Church was doing when they'd find out that there were bad priests.  They would just move them to another parish.  Right.  Rather than say something bad had happened because that would hurt the reputation of the industry in a bigger way, just move them away and make them someone else's problem.

Transcript:  Well, and you point out in your article that two years ago Alan Powell sued Kleiner Perkins and lost in a very kind of similar situation, which makes me feel like and of course we just saw Roger Ailes forced out at Fox News.  Bill O'Reilly as well.  Bill O'Reilly.  You get the feeling that in the corridors of power men have kind of started to run wild in a way that maybe they always have.  Or do you think there's something, it's gotten worse?

Start time: 512.80
End time: 571.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that they always have, but we're seeing more women take on more positions of power and more women feel like it's okay.  There's no backlash that can happen that's going to keep them from speaking out.  Now that feels very new to me.  I can't remember.  I think that even two years ago when Alan Powell took Kleiner to trial, it was extraordinary.  Everybody said, I can't believe she did that.  She'll never work again.  It's going to destroy her career.  Nobody said this is going to hurt Kleiner or what about Kleiner?  Everybody said, oh my gosh, this woman just sacrificed herself.  So now there's something has happened in the culture and in the zeitgeist where when people come forward, it's less about these women have just destroyed their careers and their potential to make money and more about, oh well, what happened and why is this happening and do we want to do business with this firm?  So there's a shift in the conversation.  It's important.

Transcript:  Last night, Dave McClure published really kind of a strong I have to commend him for at least not denying it, but saying I did it.  He says I'm a creep.  I'm sorry.  He says he's he's seeking treatment.  My behavior was inexcusable and wrong.  Credit today for I mean, not for what he did, but for immediately copying to it and stepping down.  There are others you mentioned.  Go ahead.

Start time: 606.51
End time: 614.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  500 startups he had stepped down months ago and they just kept it quiet.  Once the story came out, there was no way for them to keep it quiet anymore and they had to disclose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Christine Tsai, his co-founder is running the company.  Did you get the sense Christine knew about this and had helped cover it up or was she shocked?

Start time: 622.78
End time: 677.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get this and she was very surprised.  You know, the woman who we talked about in our story, she was harassed by Dave years ago and it wasn't until, you know, way led on to way and Christine heard about it and reached out to her just last year and said, I want to know more.  Now, what happened after that is 500 startups did launch an internal investigation in the past few months has forced Dave to step down.  But you have to wonder what they've ever been public about it and made that public knowledge without the story.  Who knows?  And if they hadn't, well, then doesn't that just perpetuate the problem?  Because, you know, 500 startups is known for supporting women.  It's known for diversity initiatives.  And if everybody still thinks Dave is a hero, well, then they're still going to do business with him and he'll still be able to be in situations where women could be vulnerable around him because nobody knows if there's anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons this rock Silicon Valley is because Chris Saka and Dave McClure are well liked and well known in Silicon Valley.  And it's I think it's a bit of a surprise.

Start time: 689.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think also the tech industry was thought that it was above this sort of thing.  We were smarter, more enlightened.  So we came into the 70s and 80s.  A lot of the people who are the founding industries, but founding starters of the computing industry was geeks at school who got beaten up and therefore slightly more open minded about things.  But it does seem from the stories that you and others have done on this is that we've got a serious problem which needs to be addressed.  And the quite frankly weasel words coming out of binary capital at the start of the week compared to where they are now was just.  They denied it at first.  Oh, initially it was a flat on denial.  They're making this up.  And now it's just within 24 hours, it's kind of like, oh, this is the worst 24 hours of my life.  It's like, well, boo hoo.  You know, Katie, has there been any backlash to this article?

Start time: 734.28
End time: 812.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, of course there there will always be backlash.  Some of it I don't want to get too into because fairly distasteful.  But I think that the backlash that we've got and does feel to me more interesting.  I've gotten a lot of messages from people saying, OK, one, this you focus on on men harassing women, but please know that men harass men.  And this, you know, that is not just sort of heterosexual men harassing women, that there is all sorts of harassment because there's all there's such an imbalance of power between the people who have money and the people who need money.  And technology to make ideas happen.  I think actually that's a very valid criticism.  And and also people talk about the fact that the harassment isn't standalone.  But the fact that it's sexual harassment or proposition people for sex and kind of get them to go to bed with them.  That that is there's almost there's just a symptom of a larger problem in the industry that women just aren't as respected.  Right. And if women were respected, that when those things happen, when that very specific harassment happens, people be up in arms about it, covering it up.  I thought that was an interesting perspective as well.

Transcript:  Take care. Katie Benner, New York Times.  Her article appeared in the June 30th online edition of the New York Times and I probably is in print this weekend.  While it feels like this is a breaking story, I also feel like this might be something that's been going on for a long time.  Denise Howell, you've been covering technology for a very long time, at least 10 years.  When did you start your blog many years ago?  Have you seen? Go ahead.

Start time: 873.90
End time: 886.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember.  My question is, is this something that's been going on all along, but has been kind of an open secret or is this something that has gotten worse over the last couple of years?  This kind of harassment.

Start time: 888.12
End time: 922.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it's something that's been going on all along and that it's not unique to the tech industry, that it's been going on in the legal industry and the banking industry and the farming industry and the journalism industry and all frontiers of science.  And, you know, I mean, to think that harassment is unique to the tech industry is naive because having been around the fringes of the tech industry, all of the harassment I have experienced has been outside of it and I have experienced my share of it.

Start time: 922.84
End time: 933.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure you have.  This is kind of the point.  Every woman has a story to tell something like this.  But you're right, Ian.  We thought we were immune.  Well, I think we know better.

Start time: 933.80
End time: 954.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're more modern.  Well, technology is supposed to be a meritocracy.  It's a very young industry.  It came in in the 70s and 80s when we were supposed to have sorted a lot of this stuff out.  And it's just very dispiriting when you see this stuff coming up again and again and again.  But at least people are speaking out about it.  And that does seem to be bringing around some change.  And the more people that speak out about it, the better.

Start time: 954.72
End time: 962.15

Start time: 969.52
End time: 1268.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And to get to that point a little deeper, I am so grateful for Katie's reporting and the fact that we're having this conversation on the one hand.  And by no means do I want people to discount what has been reported and alleged.  But at the same time, there is some fallout from this, I think, that is damaging and productive, if I can say that.  On the one hand, I think it's really important that we have these conversations.  Reid Hoffman is absolutely right that his decency pledge.  I hope people will go and read that and take it to heart.  Because I think that's how we get through this.  That people live being decent.  And fortunately, the vast majority of my relationships in the technology and in other business arenas have been where people lived being decent.  But there are those episodes where you have, you know, you remember the terrible and traumatic things that happen to you.  And I'm hoping for a day when people don't get to the middle or later part of their careers and look back and say, God, you know, I had tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of business relationships with people that went really, really well.  And there was not a shred of harassment involved.  But there are four or five that really stand out as being creepy and awful.  And, you know, I hope we're moving away from that.  And I think that the way that we get there is through what Reid Hoffman suggests, you know, you've got to if you see something, say something.  You've got to make sure that people who are doing this and I do feel that they are in the minority of people in the business world, that there are still people out there today who haven't gotten the memo that this is just not OK.  But if they're held accountable and if people are living this in their daily life and if the checks on it aren't just the corporate message of, oh, we have legal compliance obligations where you have to go to a management training class and learn about harassment.  And maybe someone's chewing up a video on a screen and letting it play and not really paying attention or even watching.  And everyone's just checking a box that this has been done.  But people are really living this in their daily lives.  And I think we'll get to that point where everyone in the room where it happens, because on the other end of this extreme of having this conversation about backlash, Leo, when possible backlash, you know, you know, you're not going to be able to do it.  But I think that's a really important point, Leo, one possible backlash and one backlash that we already see in Washington, D.C., among Congresspeople anxious to avoid scandals, senators as well, is sort of taking the Mike Pence approach where, oh, if you are of the gender where I might be associated with having a relationship with you, then you and I shall not have certain relationships that could be problematic in my opinion.  That could be problematic and controversial.  You and I shall not even dine together unaccompanied.  We will not be in a venue where there's alcohol served because of the fear of scandal and and maybe false accusations.  So I think on the other end of this extreme, you have to be really careful both that people who might be subject to harassment don't live in fear of that and that people who might be accused of it don't live in fear of the false accusation and not to have any sort of backlash to Katie's reporting.  But just a bit of pushback to the people that she reported on do dispute these allegations.  She's saying that this is cutting dried and it happened based on the reporting that she's done and what she's seen.  And she's certainly doing a service in reporting that.  But two of the people here do dispute that this actually happened.  Chris Sake and Mark Cantor say, no, it did not go down like that.  So we're having sort of a trial in the media for them.  And I want people should be aware that this is not a trial in a court where credibility and witnesses and evidence are all subject to being.

Start time: 1269.08
End time: 1302.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's challenging because, of course, one of the mantras is believe the woman.  Right. But it is conceivable that there's false accusations.  And so it's very challenging.  On the one hand, you don't want to dismiss these, but on the other hand, you don't you don't want to convict somebody unreasonably.  You're right. This is a survey from Claire Kane Miller in the New York Times, the upshot.  Americans are wary of being alone with the opposite sex.  And I think you're right. I think that would be a very bad trend because it would keep women out of the room where it happens.

Start time: 1302.84
End time: 1316.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, when Mike Pence first made his comments about he wouldn't have lunch with a alone with a woman.  Why? Well, I don't know, because I was part of me when I first read that was like, well, hang on.  Is he saying that he's not sure he can keep control? No, I think he wants to be above suspicion. Right.

Start time: 1317.08
End time: 1320.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK. And if you're a public figure, you might want to avoid those these kinds of accusations.

Start time: 1320.82
End time: 1335.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also a very handy way, though, to make sure that, you know, as you say, you can exclude women based on I don't feel comfortable being in a room with you.  It's called the Billy Graham rule. Yeah.  Yes, in New York, he was even when he was on his deathbed, he didn't have he wasn't alone with a female nurse.

Start time: 1335.82
End time: 1382.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you wonder, I mean, I don't know what Billy Graham was worried about.  I don't know what Mike Pence is worried about. I I should point out, though, you were talking about diversity in tech and Google's diversity report came out.  It's the annual diversity report. And while you do see more women at Google, it's still a fraction of of what would nominally be 50 or 51 percent.  It's only 31 percent of the total hires and only 20 percent of the tech hires.  Yeah. The thing, though, that's very depressing to me is if you look at the diversity report, African-Americans represent two percent of the overall one percent of the tech hires Hispanic people, three percent of the tech people.  It is it is far from a diverse group. It is very heavily white and male.

Transcript:  I think that's what we feel like Silicon Valley should be a meritocracy.  Pure and simple. And it should be race blind, gender blind.

Start time: 1396.82
End time: 1411.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It clearly is. Unfortunately, human beings were there and they've all got their grab bag of prejudices and you know, mistaken views.  So it's it we're getting there study, but surely.  But it's just not moving anywhere fast enough as fast as it needs to be.

Start time: 1412.14
End time: 1442.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I really do. I agree with you, Denise Reid Hoffman, who is the founder of LinkedIn.  Immediately, almost immediately after the information report a week ago, Friday published an article called the Human Rights of Women Entrepreneurs and and asked people, you know, said we do care.  We men in Silicon Valley, we do care and and we do need to kind of, you know, this this bill of rights, this this agreement that there should be zero tolerance of this.  Right. A decency pledge.

Start time: 1444.54
End time: 1460.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And I think that's really what people really need to take that to heart.  And I think that's where this needs to go.  Because, again, you know, you can do HR departments and big companies are really helpful as well because people know they'll be accountable and they'll lose their job.

Start time: 1461.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But you look at, for instance, Uber and Susan Fowler, there was no help for her in the in the HR department at Uber.

Start time: 1469.34
End time: 1494.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a friend of mine was actually pitched by Uber about three weeks after the Fowler article came out.  And this is a woman who co-wrote a book called Women in Technology.  She was pitched by the HR person and responded, look, based on Uber at the moment, this is not a company I really would want to work for.  And the HR came, the female HR person came back to it and said, look, you and I both know sexism is a problem in the industry.  We're working to work this out, but you really need to stop being so prissy about it.

Start time: 1495.26
End time: 1503.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  All right. We're going to move on. We have many other things to talk about.  And I know sometimes it's an uncomfortable subject and not really strictly about tech, except that it is.  And I think it's important to talk about.  So I'm glad we could get Katie Beneron. Thank Katie for joining us during her vacation.  Denise is, of course, going to stick around.  And by the way, I should point out Denise is now on an iPhone.  I don't know why it is, but for some reason, her computer just can't do Skype.  So we're it's perfect because we're going to celebrate the 10th anniversary of this technology in just a second.  Thank you so much for being here, Denise.  Scott Bourne is also here. Still not dead.  And that's not my line. That's his from photo podcasts dot com.  And we'll have a lot more. And Ian Thompson, too, from the register dot co dot UK.  Our show a lot more coming up in just a second.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite online backup.  I talk about Carbonite every weekend because they're sponsored the radio show,  but also because I feel like the weekends are when people think about backing up.  Right. During their business day, the workday, it's you're busy.  You got stuff to do. You're making great stuff.  You're doing the spreadsheets. You're doing the balance sheets.  You're doing the accounts receivable.  You're probably not thinking what would happen if all this stuff disappeared?  Would we even have a business?  So now during the weekends, a little slower, you get a little time to think about it.  I want you to think about carbonite, carbonite online backup.  Here's what every backup solution should have.  And you should ask your I.T. person or if you're the I.T. person, ask yourself, do we fit this?  First of all, I'm a big fan of Peter Krogh.  He's a photographer. His 321 backup, three copies of everything, right?  An original and two backups on two different media.  Don't put everything on a CD or a DVD or a hard drive.  But one of those should be offsite. That is the most important part.  It should be somewhere away from your premises.  So if there's a fire or a flood, some big act of God, your data doesn't go along with everything else.  You can survive a business burning down.  You got insurance, you got fire insurance.  You could survive that, but could you survive losing your customer list, your supplier list, your accounts receivable, all your books, all your data?  Maybe not. You got to get carbonite.  Go to carbonite.com. They've got plans for home and office.  And by the way, the biggest threat to business these days, ransomware.  And carbonite can help you there too.  Take a look on the business side. It's carbonite for office at the resources page.  There's a great bunch of white papers, including ransomware mitigation and how you can use carbonite to protect you when the worst happens with ransomware.  They're sponsors of open ransomware.org and they and it really is an important subject.  Business has to look straight in the eye.  I know businesses that are literally stockpiling Bitcoin so that when they get ransomware, they can pay the bad guy.  That is not that is not the right plan.  Carbonite.com. Go there.  Take a look at the plan.  Sign up for the one that's right for you.  You can try it free with no credit card.  Free free.  But do use twit as the offer code because you'll get two months free with purchase.  It's not too late yet.  Carbonite.com offer code twit.  Ten years after the iPhone.  Oh, could somebody get me my iPhone one?  It's on the green stand in my in my office.  Thank you, Burke.  I remember very well Scott Bourne.  I vividly remember this.  We were doing Mac break weekly and you knew there was going to be an iPhone.  You were the iPhone fanatic on the show.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really?  Were you first in line?  I was first or second.  Well, you know, I got to be honest here.  I did not stand in line.  One of my staff did.  But then I went in and paid.  You swooped in.  And then Greg, who was the guy who stood in line for me, we had this idea, you know, probably  ought to take the phones and put them in your pocket in case during your celebratory hoist  someone grabs the box out of your hand.  That's a good point.  That was an empty box I was hoisting.  And yes, I was happy because, you know, I just sort of had a feeling this was going to  change everything.  And I think I was kind of right that time.

I'm standing on the corner.  I'll never forget that, Scott.  So here it is.  This is it.  This is the iPhone that changed.  This changed more than just how we think of phones.  This changed a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, I'm this is kind of embarrassing because I was a skeptic about the iPhone when  it first came out.  That's not nothing to be embarrassed about.  I was using a Nokia N95 and in comparison to that.  I loved the N95.  The specs on that were terrible.

Start time: 1904.31
End time: 1944.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had a Blackberry Pearl, which also was probably a more capable phone.  But what happened with this is because of its success, this launched a manufacturing  industry in China where accelerometers, GPS, radios, screens, all of the technologies  that went in the iPhone suddenly became cheap, widely available.  We wouldn't have drones if it weren't for the iPhone.  There's a lot of technology we wouldn't have had the giant manufacturing capabilities  of the iPhone not been created just to support this device.  And I don't know.  I think even you, Scott, probably didn't anticipate what a life changing event that was.

Start time: 1945.20

The most expensive decision I've ever made in my life times a billion was to be a host  on MacBreak Weekly.  Why is that?  Because we agreed it would.  You sold your shoes to be on the show.  We agreed it would probably be best if I sold my Apple shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll take that.  If I could do that again every day, I'd be happy.  Anyway, I did not know financially what would be happening.  I had no clue that it was going to be Apple's core business.  But what I kind of did think, I remember everyone arguing with me all the time about all the  stuff it didn't have.  And I said, y'all are missing one real crucial point.  People don't buy anything because of what it doesn't do.  They buy it because of what it does do.  And the notion that you have this thing without a keyboard that had a screen that you can't  I just when I first saw it, I was actually more impressed than I thought I would be.  And, you know, obviously that first phone didn't, you know, a two megapixel camera.  It didn't have cut and paste.  It didn't have cut and paste.

And then I saw somebody with one of them in public and the amount of buzz it got.  And when you actually try the UI for the first time and you're like, it's kind of like the first time as a Brit when I first tasted New York pizza and it's just like, that's what it's supposed to taste like.  And it's the same with a mobile phone.  It was just like, that's what the UI is supposed to be like.  And that's what's going to be the game changer.  And the second big warning was on AT&T power network started falling over.  That's right. It was terrible.  You couldn't use it.  You couldn't use the increase in data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 2172.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember.  Yeah.  I'll give you a picture to Scott Warren's picture of Scoble coming out of the Palo Alto store.  Please tell me he wasn't in the shower.  No, he was fully dressed.  I remember waiting in line.  I waited in line six hours here at the AT&T store in Petaluma.  The fun thing about in those days, Apple lines kind of went downhill and now they don't even do them because Angela Aren't the head of retail at Apple doesn't want lines.  And I think she's right.  It's not nice to consumers.  It's great for marketing, but it's terrible for consumers.  But the people you would meet in those early days and certainly that first time in line were really interesting, cool people.  The people in front of me, the two guys in front of me had been up all night.  They worked at Google.  They were rewriting Google Reader to work on the iPhone interface and they'd stayed up all night.  And then they had driven because they thought, well, we won't be able to get it in San Francisco.  The line's way too long, but let's go up to the farm capital up in Petaluma.  We probably can get an iPhone there.  And they did.  It was really cool and fun.  And as with much Apple stuff, it was a cult in the early days.

Start time: 2173.10
End time: 2185.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I stood in line for the iPad too because we wanted to get one for review.  And the first 30 people in the line sitters were line sitters who basically went in, bought their hardware, handed over to the bloke with a big bag outside, took their cash and walked off.

Start time: 2185.78
End time: 2195.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the same thing happened with the iPhone.  Until they started selling the iPhone in China, there were a lot of Chinese sellers who would occupy places in line so they could get their phones to sell.

Start time: 2195.80
End time: 2265.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember they had to limit it to they started sort of ad hoc limiting the sales to six phones per person within a few minutes of opening the main Apple store on Market Street because that was what was happening.  People were buying a bunch of them.  I actually legitimately wanted six for my staff, but that was all I could buy.  And it was it was it was absolute mayhem.  And but Leo, we walked around the corner, all four corners and found the line and we were doing interviews with people.  And that was for us for the Apple phone show.  That was great.  Oh, and I had an Alex was with me.  Alex from Mac Break Weekly for those of you Alex Lindsay.  And we were walking around and we shot video.  And we've I mean, we got so much material out of that deal.  We could have done 10 shows.  But I mean, think about how much it's changed beyond all the stuff we talked about.  I mean, when you put a little kid in front of an iPhone, they immediately start trying to pinch and zoom.  And that that they walk up, they walk up to my big screen.  My next door neighbor's granddaughter was over, walked up to my big screen, was trying to pinch and zoom on my 70 inch TV.

End time: 2296.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's Apple just being stupid about their laptops.  But I mean, in terms of it is that instinctive thing.  It's very natural.  It's one of the things that scares me because a lot of my friends have got kids now.  They they pick it up really quickly, but they're just hooked on these things.  If you want to, you know, they want to punish the kid.  You don't, you know, you know, around the side of the head like it was growing up.  You take away the iPad or take away their power cord.

Start time: 2296.76

They may be getting the best skill, the best training for their future right then playing those games.  Let me show the video.  Now, remember, the iPhone was announced at Mac World Expo in January.  And those of us remember this, Scott, we're at Mac World Expo.  We're covering it. I do.  And they had one iPhone in a case with guards on either side.  You couldn't touch it.

And by the way, I wasn't the only person that knew, I'm sure several hundred marketing people at Apple do.  But, you know, we had enough information to be pretty successful at gleaning what was going to come.  I think none of us, even I, as the probably the largest proponent.  And that's, by the way, measured by all metrics available, size, weight and enthusiasm.  Even I wasn't sure that it was going to take off the way it did.  But I was sure one thing that I was going to buy it, even though it was on AT&T, whose motto at the time was, and maybe still is, we're not happy until you're not happy.

It was a very closed system.  You couldn't write apps for it.  You had to hand over control completely to Cupertino, which is very much the way they do things now.  But they changed.  At least they did open it up to third party apps.  Once they realized that battle was lost, then it was like, right, we've got to open this up and but we're going to keep very tight control in the closed walled garden that Apple has.

This is David Pogue's video.  I want to find that bit where he shows at Macworld Expo the iPhone.  I can't find it, but he shows the iPhone in its cylinder.  It's a plexiglass only.  And what we learned is there were only three or four iPhones at the time of Steve's keynote.  None of them worked very well.  None of them worked 100 percent.  He had a very, very specific roadmap of what he could do.  And if he deviated, it was very likely it would crash.  They had a second one ready in case the first one crashed.  But Steve, again, the master, he rehearsed and rehearsed and he got it exactly right.  The iPhone engineers who were responsible for different parts of the iPhone were sitting in the audience.  And we now know drinking heavily.  And each time one of the engineers particular invention, the radio or the screen got shown and the demo worked, he would drink.  And they said, by the end of it, we were all blotto.  But they deserved it because they had worked their butts off for a couple of years nonstop to create this thing.  And still there was a lot of work to do.  It was not a finished product.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. But I mean, January, this is always I mean, this is something Apple has formed for.  They do show stuff off early before it's actually ready for it.  But then they come they come through.  True. I mean, Apple didn't invent the smartphone and Blackberry made the smartphone necessary.  Apple invented the touch screen smartphone and made it desirable.  I mean, we all loved our Blackberry's up to a point, but they weren't something that you actually desired.  It was the functionality you desired with the iPhone.  With my phone, I mean, I was in the UK and I saw somebody using one of these very ostentatiously in a pub and women were swarming around in men were swarming around.  It was a good way to get to know people.  Oh my God, can I touch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was a little bit like with the original Macs, right?  Because people brought the iPhone into work when their work was issuing them Blackberry's.  And they found that they could get much more done with their iPhone than with their Blackberry.  And they pushed that.  And I think that there was this response from the enterprise that sort of lagged the consumer group of people running out and waiting in line.  And oh, it's so fun.  It's so beautiful.  But the functionality is really what got it.  You know, the soon companies had bring your own device programs.  That's right.  Yeah, changed.

Transcript:  Oh, but I mean, it was a wedge at the top as well, because I spoke to the we got an email through and my former employer saying we now if we if you want to use an iPhone in the office,  we now support that.  And I was friends with the I.T. guys, as you'd expect.  I just like I thought last time we were in the pub, you said that over your dead body such a pain to implement.  He said it is such a pain to implement.  I loathe it with a passion.  But every board director has got one.  That's why we're supporting it now.  We have to support it.  Yeah, I mean, some people.

Transcript:  I just want to quickly point out along those lines.  I happen to have a good memory.  And I remember Palm and the CEO talking about how the iPhone wouldn't last very long.  What does anybody remember what happened in Palm?  Yeah, you know, Rim, which is Blackberry.  Same thing.  Microsoft saying, oh, come on, you can see.  Nobody will buy it.  It's too expensive.  It was, by the way, four to ninety nine bucks.

Transcript:  Five hundred dollars, fully subsidized with a plan.  I said that is the most expensive phone in the world.  And it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine.  Now, it may sell very well.  You know, we have our strategy.  We've got great Windows mobile devices in the market today.  Oh, my God.  Motorola Q phone now for ninety nine dollars.  It's a very capable machine.  It'll do music.  It'll do Internet.  It'll do email.  It'll do instant messaging.  So I kind of look at that and I say, well, I like our strategy.  I like it.  I can't blame him, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also I mean, let's face it, if you just are looking at, you know, specs alone is not an unreasonable thing to say.  No one's going to pay five hundred bucks for this.  What what Balmer underestimated, many people underestimated is the magic that was Apple and their ability to market their ability to excite people to and most importantly, I think, to get people to buy into their vision.  And it really this isn't really the anywhere near the end game.  This is and I remember the first Mac wasn't either.  Right.  But but but Apple had a crucial point.

Start time: 3116.80
End time: 3189.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead.  That's the crucial point, Leo.  I was seeing as a photographer, I was seeing the impact that this could have in version three, four and five.  And I was meeting with people from the big camera companies and they were having the same reaction as Balmer.  They were scoffing.  This will never impact us.  Well, if you look at the SIPA data, which is the camera association out of Japan that shows sales up to about two thousand seven eight nine ten, they absolutely started to just dive.  And they've been diving and diving and diving every year until last year.  They finally the growth curve started to flatten out a little bit, but it decimated the point and shoot camera market.  It does not exist anymore.  And when I was talking to people, I said, you know, you might want to factor this in and try to make your cameras work with these things.  And they poo pooed it and they passed and they're they're just out of business.  So I think that there's a lesson for all of us to be learned here is look at number the first version of something and try to have a little bit bigger vision than you do for what's right in front of you.  And look at the possibilities because we all know that's what made Steve Jobs really special.  I think those days at Apple died with him.

But in fact, there was some something there.  Look at this. These are this.  Rico did a whole bunch of graphs about how the iPhone changed the world.  This is to your point, digital photos taken worldwide by device.  This is only in the last six years in 2011, 50 percent by phone in 2017.  Eighty seven percent of the world's pictures, more than a trillion pictures taken on a camera phone.  Yeah. And look at this.  The black slices cameras and the gray slices tablets.

She thought about the Sony. She has an A7R too, a very nice full frame Sony.  Still too heavy. She went with her favorite camera of all time, the Olympus OM-D.  She has an EM-1. I got her the Mark II just before the trip, so she'd have the latest greatest.  And she took great images. She loved it. She never complained about the weight while I'm lugging around 20 pounds and three lenses.  And I know you're an Olympus shooter now, Scott. So I showed her all your pictures and I said, you're right.  You get amazing wildlife photos.

If you don't, you're going to be in a wheelchair any day.  Yikes. Were you shooting? You were a Nikon shooter, right?  Canon. I shot a Nikon and Canon, but mostly Canon because I needed their 800 millimeter lens for bird photography.  But, you know, I carried 40, 50 pounds of gear around on my shoulder for decades and I had 11 shoulder surgeries and my doctor said, look, I'm the best orthopedic surgeon in the Northwest.  I can't help you. There's nothing left to work with. You got to stop.  And about that time Olympus announced the OM-D E-M1 Mark II. I bought them. I bought them with my own money, by the way.  And then they called me and said, would you like to be on our visionary team? It's the highest honor I've ever received in my career. I'm grateful to them.

But that's the new Echo with the screen.  And now I can say Echo show my front door.  It's hooked up to the ring video doorbell.  I can see what's going on in my front door.  And if somebody's at the door, I could talk to them.  The ring video doorbell and the Amazon Echo.  Well, it's a match made in heaven.  I love the ring.  We've been talking about the ring a lot.  This is something that has been was I think Jamie created it.  Maybe he was on Shark Tank and he had something a door bought.  And they and I think it didn't get the money on Shark Tank.  So we went back to the drawing board and he created the ring doorbell and everything changed.  Now Richard Branson is a big investor.  They are coming out with new products all the time.  In fact, they they have a brand new ring of pro.  We're reviewing it at the moment. Yes.  Awesome.  So this is a doorbell with an HD camera, a speaker, a microphone and a motion sensor.  It replaces your existing wired doorbell.  You can also use the original ring as a battery so you can use it without wired doorbell.  You was easy for me.  I just unscrewed that old crappy.  Everybody seems to like I don't know.  Is this the case?  We buy a new house. Beautiful house.  There's always a crappy like 50 cent doorbell and it's kind of not working.  And the donger, the chime in the house goes.  Yeah, it's just I don't know what it is.  It's like the last thing.  So I just unscrewed it.  Two wires are coming out of the door.  Jam ring gives you in the kit right over here.  I'll show you the ring gives you everything you need.  I'm no handyman.  But about an hour later, I've got the whole thing.  And by the way, I'm slow.  You could do it in less time, but I watched all the YouTube videos and everything.  And they've got a level and they've got a mount and a mounting plate.  And you just include a spirit level in the box.  They do. Isn't that nice?  And the mounting plate is actually much nicer installed in the original doorbell.  I replaced it with.  And now when somebody comes to the door, even if they don't ring the doorbell, I get a notification on my smartphone.  You pair it to your smartphone when they ring the doorbell.  I get a notification and I can I could say accept and say, yeah, what do you want?  And if it's a UPS guy, don't tell him this.  But I just say, yeah, I'm in the shower right now.  Leave it. I'll sign for it tomorrow.  And it works.  And I don't have to worry about the packages on the porch because I can see them.  So this is this is where you want a security camera.

Transcript:  I am very disappointed, though.  And you don't have probably this problem, but with the large files that come off the Canon Lightroom is very slow.  Oh, it's horrible. It's horrible.  So what I want to do and I'm sorry we turn into photo show, but we'll stop in a minute.  Do you think it was going to happen when you're talking?  What I did is I got photo mechanic.

Transcript:  And so what I do is it's the front end to my selection process.  It doesn't do the editing that Lightroom does, but you can go through all the pictures instantly in photo mechanic.  And I just I use Chris Markowitz three star method and I triage all my pictures.  I had 4000 images, got them down to 30 images, and then it automatically all of the, you know, the stars are imported instantly into Lightroom.  And then you do your editing instead of 4000 images on 30 images.  And it's much better. So that's what I ended up using.  And that's one of the reasons I'm on on Windows.  But I do think that it's not a long time before the iPad Pro will be a viable choice for this.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we got Denise back. Are you there?  I am here. Sweet. Well, good.  Because we're ready for the legal portion of the show.  Are you ready? I am. This is the numbers section.  This week, the EU decided that Google was sending people to its shopping site  instead of just giving them good search results. And they find them two point seven billion dollars,  2.42 billion euros for giving illegal advantage to their own comparison shopping service.  Google says we are going to appeal. Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google and in an article that he wrote for Politico.eu  said this is really has nothing to do with shopping, that the big newspapers and magazines in Europe  are highly threatened by Google's advertising business. Axel Springer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.  lobbied the EU very hard to come down on Google. And by the way, this is not the last thing they're investigating Google for.  They're also very interested in how Google's using the Android operating system and its monopoly there  and how Google's reduced choice by preventing third party websites from sourcing search ads from Google's competitors with their AdSense.  And I think, I'm not sure Jeff's wrong on this one. I really do think that the lobby, the big business lobby has influenced the EU somewhat in this.

Start time: 4638.10
End time: 4669.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Up to a point, it's harder to influence the EU, for business to influence the EU, than it is for business to influence politicians over here.  Because there isn't the kind of legalized bribery campaign financing structure that we've got here.  I mean, when you look at, I was actually, I looked at the fine, I looked at the judgment, and it could have been a lot worse because the EU had the ability to fine Google up to 9 billion euros.  Good Lord.  And they called it a day at 2.4. I'm curious to what you think about this, Denise, because it seemed like a very odd ruling.

Start time: 4672.28
End time: 4699.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just have two observations. I haven't looked too closely. And of course, I'm not practicing in the EU and not very conversant in all of the intricacies of their interpretations of antitrust and this particular ruling.  But I will tell you this. I think the EU is being far more aggressive on coming out for companies for antitrust kinds of things than the US is right now.

Transcript:  Secondly, no government likes thinking that search results are being manipulated to deceive people.  So if the contention is Google should have been more forthright about disclosing exactly what results people were getting, Google knows that well.  They've been through that and they will continue to go through that.  And they're going through it in a financial way as a result of the EU right now.  And yes, they may appeal and Chuck has good points, but I think it's a good cautionary note for any search engine that you be forthcoming.  Let people know what they're getting. If you have a partnership with results that you are supplying, let people know that.  And let that in a big, obvious way.  And if you're not doing that, look out for governments coming after you.

Start time: 4773.92
End time: 4808.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  I mean, we have so many technology firms who are in, if not near monopolies, then oligopolies.  And certainly the regulators don't seem to be doing anything about it.  At this end, I think the EU feels that if you're going to operate within their borders, then you've got to be subject to a certain amount of antitrust legislation.  And yeah, they're gunning for Google on the Android platform as well.  But I honestly think a lot of this was just about the inherent unfairness of Google promoting its own shopping results.  I know Murdoch hates them because Murdoch wants to rule the world and anyone who gets in his way gets stomped on.  But, you know, we shall see.

Start time: 4810.54
End time: 4870.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, if you look at so part of this is that the EU defines a monopoly differently than the United States and trust differently in the United States.  The EU, I'm told, and you're the lawyer, Denise, so correct me.  The United States laws are designed to protect consumers from predatory monopolies.  The EU laws, I'm told, are more slanted towards protecting other companies from predatory monopolies.  So that may be why they may be listen to Axel Springer and News Corp.  But it's also the case that I don't think Google really was pushing people to shopping.  If you searched for a product, there was an advertising bar that showed ads.  It said, you know, advertisement.  And then there were legitimate search results underneath that.  I think that was clearly an ad.  I don't think Google is trying to fool anybody.  That was that's that's their business is advertising.  I'm not sure I accept the premise that they were trying to trick somebody.

Start time: 4871.82
End time: 4880.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure I accepted either.  But I do remember the days when Google didn't have those promoted results at the top.  Right. And it was a pure experience.

Start time: 4880.72
End time: 4914.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I agree.  I mean, those days are gone.  It is Google is a business.  Yeah. And they can.  I mean, I complain because Google has YouTube.  I mean, I, you know, I'm in the business of video.  Right. And if you search for a tech review, you're much more likely to find a YouTube result than a tweet result.  Now, Google probably says, well, that's because more people are interested in the YouTube result.  But I feel like Google, if it's going to be a pure search engine, shouldn't be in the content business.  Yeah. Because now they're competing with me.  And I'm afraid I can't prove but I'm afraid their search results favor their own business over mine.

Start time: 4914.74
End time: 4933.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got to say it's the only reason I now use Bing is for searching for Bing video because you can never see Bing video on you on Google.  No. But I mean, if you actually search search on Bing for videos, then you get both YouTube and everyone else.  Right. Whereas if you search on Google, then YouTube gets promoted all the way down the line.

Start time: 4934.10
End time: 4943.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So I'm aware of the idea that Google could.  And I agree with you, Denise, that I would love to go back to those days was Google was pure search results.  But they're in a lot of other businesses now.

Start time: 4944.84
End time: 4976.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And right. And of course, you know, disclosing what you're doing varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  You know, what efficient to make it clear that this is an app.  You know, this is something that we see not just in search results, but with the fire festival,  are people posting because they want to go to the Bahamas or because they're being paid.  It's something that I think is a work in progress on a number of fronts.

But before we do, I want to cut quickly to SpaceX because they're about a minute away from another launch.  They did a launch earlier this week. This is a communications satellite that Elon Musk's company is about to launch into space.  And the only reason I'm showing this is I know a lot of you will otherwise stop watching live because you want to go to the SpaceX launch.  So I don't want to I don't want to lose you.

Transcript:  They called him old iron butt because he could sit there and talk and talk. So, Denise, am I right in saying that this is a bad precedent? The Canadian Supreme Court.  So the case was that there were two companies. One was copying the product of the other. Actually, they were buying it and relabeling and selling it, making a counterfeit product.  The company sued Google saying you should delist these counterfeit products. You're supporting counterfeiting. We want you to take that listing down.  Google fought it. And in the end, it went to the Canadian High Court, which decided that not only good does Google have to take those listings down, it has to do it not just in Canada, but all over the world.  That seems like a dangerous precedent.

But what happens when a Turkish High Court says, oh, you can't have anything on Google that's critical of Erdogan, our president, and we want you to pull it down worldwide? Then what happens?  And so that's the problem is that the laws differ considerably from country to country. And I don't want the lowest common denominator to determine what's on Google. Eventually, you've got nothing.

Transcript:  Well, we've got this problem with encryption at the moment because the word is that the US government and the UK government, various other governments all want to be able to backdoor encryption to have a key to read and screen cryptocommunications, which I'm sure they think is fine for them.  But then if China then turns around and says, actually, we'd like the same. We've got some dissidents we'd like to put away for a while.  Exactly.  And what do you you can't say, well, it's OK for us, but it's not OK for you guys. And China is not going to accept that.  I mean, everyone, almost all Western companies produce their kit in China. And if they don't agree with what the Chinese government says, the government can just turn around and say, yeah, you remember those factories you used to have? Yes.  Let's talk about those, shall we? And, you know, this is the same thing with the Google ruling in Canada. I don't see how that can be enforced.

Twenty eight percent of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.  I might add my website, Leo Laporte dot com, also runs on WordPress.  I used WordPress, self hosted WordPress for years and I loved it. I always loved it.  But it was kind of a pain because I had to keep it up to date, keep it secure.  And I ended up it felt like I was doing more work just to keep it up to date than I was posting.  So when I got WordPress dot com, it was a real revelation.  All the benefits of running my own site, but they do the hosting.  They keep it up to date. Plus, you're part of a massive community.

Transcript:  And yet I think who was it that said this is the best new gadget of the year. This is the most.  I love the Echo Show. It is an Amazon Echo with a built $230.  So it's more expensive, although the original Echo when it first came out was $200. So it's not much more.  As a built in seven inch tablet, I think the Echo uses the tablet very well for additional stuff.  When you do a flash briefing, for instance, you can have video in it in some cases.  So part of my flash briefing is the Tonight Show monologue. You actually get the video on the screen, which is great.  You also get song lyrics when you're listening to music. So you can sing along.  You get a constantly updated feed of news and weather pictures. You can have your images on it.  You can get a slideshow. It actually and it's got better speakers in the old Echo.  It's actually sounds really good. I haven't my kitchen.  I got one for my mom because the biggest feature is you can call each other. Right. Video call.  I could say, you know, echo call mom.  And if mom's in my address book and her phone number is registered as an echo, it will call her echo, whether an audio or Echo show.  I sent her an Echo show because I want to see her and she could see me.  The drop in feature was a little controversial. I don't think we fully understood it when they first announced it.  I thought you could drop in and just see what was going on without it being announced.  But in fact, the camera isn't automatically turned on, just audio. And it's really an intercom feature.  So and you have to enable it. There's also privacy controls. But I put what I I've used. We have to.  So yeah, there you go. There you go. See,

I don't know what you maybe you've changed a setting.  You've got a teenage son as well. So no, I don't. Yeah, exactly. I don't want to drop it on my teenager.  But what I but what I but but but it's great because I put it in Michael's room.  He has the old echo, the tube. But even if he had a show, you put it in his room and you say drop in on Michael.  And in his room, it goes bloop. And I can say Michael, dinner's ready.  And by the way, it's really loud. It's nice. But I don't see him unless he taps his screen and enables video.

Start time: 5722.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5741.78
End time: 5765.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I sent one to my mom. I don't want her dropping in on me.  I'm not a teenager, but you know, OK. Yeah, it's the intercom is neat because you can I can have an intercom across the country with my mom.  I could just say, hey, mom, are you there? Not that I would do that a lot.  And then you can also make video calls. But you're seeing the camera when you say drop in.

Start time: 5766.40
End time: 5779.02

End time: 5920.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. Now we so by the way, we don't use the A word on the shows.  I should have probably warned you and you didn't. So that's good because most people have it set for the default.  We don't want to trigger anybody's echo. I but the ones we use around here, we make it echo.  And that's pretty good. And when we talk about we refer to the echo because I don't think many people have said it to the echo.  It reminds me so much of the Sony dash or the chumby. Or do you remember the you go back far enough, Scott, you might remember Cisco had a thing called the Audrey, a kitchen computer.

Of course, you're on camera right now, but that's the nest IQ.  And this camera is the newest indoor camera from nest. It's a 4K camera.  So but it only sends 1080p. It looks at everybody does face recognition.  And after a while it says, oh, I haven't seen you in the house. I better let Leo know you're in the house and it zooms in and follows you around.  Oh, no.  And it notifies me. But the negative and the reason it's here and not at home, the negative is it's till it learns who's who.  It bugs you all the time. There's somebody in the house. There's somebody in the house. Somebody in the house. Somebody in the house.  But I think eventually we'll see it learns all the people's faces and then it's.

That's right.  But they've applied a patent for technology where if you're watching a film, connect will scan how many people in the room are there and charge out and work out the charges based on the number of people that are there.  And you're kind of like, what exactly is in this for the end user?

And maybe some of these already exist and I just don't know, to people who want to tell them that they have a cute butt or whatever.  Yeah.  But one that's not just there to serve their shopping needs, but maybe other needs.

Transcript:  But first, I want to thank the company that literally brings you this show every single day.  It's Sonic, our 10 gigabit fiber internet service provider. I bet even Scott Borne doesn't have 10 gigabits up and down.  Sonic is not available, sorry to say, in Seattle, Scott, but it is available in San Francisco, the North Bay, and the East Bay area.  I know that this ad is frustrating for many of you because you can't get Sonic, but I want you to hear this because this is what is possible.  This is a viable, successful, profitable company that gives you amazing internet for an amazing price.  Listen to what you get. If you're lucky enough to be able to get Sonic, and if you're in the Bay area, you really ought to find out if you can.  With Sonic, you get 15 email accounts, a gigabyte of storage, you get personal web hosting, you get a new domain, you get fax line service,  you get a home phone with unlimited local and long distance calling, you can port your existing number over to the home phone,  plus you get gigabit internet service, $40 a month for all of that.  And it's possible. And Sonic, by the way, no bandwidth caps. They will fight government subpoenas. They fight for your privacy.  If you look on EFF, they're one of the few four or five star all green ISPs in the world because they really protect you.  They've got great local customer support, affordable pricing, and their advocacy for you is paving the way for a better and, I think, more private internet across America.  I love Sonic. I'm happy to be a Sonic customer here. I wish I were a Sonic customer at home. They don't have it in my area.  If they do, get it. Join the internet revolution. Find out anyway at Sonic.com slash twit. Sonic.com slash twit.  You'll get your first month of Sonic internet and phone service free. And yes, they offer TV too. You can bundle it with dish and save $120 on your Sonic bill.

I didn't know. Do you have the gigabit? No, I'm actually upgrading it at the moment. You have Fusion probably.  Oh, but you can get it now. Yeah, I can get it now. But the key advantage for me is every time you pick up the phone for tech support, you get a human being instantly.

And there aren't a lot of five star companies in here. Sonic is one of them along with Apple and Dropbox.  Still amazed Apple got five stars, but still well, I don't. Yeah, I don't know if that's fair. But anyway, so this is one for Denise.  Not because you live in a McMansion. I live in a McMansion. What do you know what the definition of a McMansion is?

Transcript:  But the blog, which I love McMansion hell dot com MCM and do you know about this? McMansion. They have been not not recently. In fact, if you if you if you go there now, you'll see a lot of public domain images.  But what they had been doing is taking images off of Zillow. Let me scroll down far enough. Maybe I can find it. And and basically doing a critique of the house of how bad the house is.

Start time: 6735.72
End time: 6748.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's all of those are gone because Zillow complained. They said you can't use these. And now millions of people who had never heard of this blog at all. I got to get me some of that.

Start time: 6749.72
End time: 6780.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The good news is Zillow has decided not to pursue legal action. Kate Wagner Wagner, who authors the blog, got good news EFF to defend her and threatened Zillow with a potential counter suit. She says it's fair use of Zillow's images.  The photos showing the exterior and interior of huge ugly suburban homes are used to skewer the celebration of wealth and conspicuous consumption. That's fair use, isn't it, Denise?

Start time: 6781.58
End time: 6788.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is not just a story for me, but for Scott. These are not Zillow's images. The images are uploaded by third parties.

Start time: 6792.01
End time: 6800.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't even own them. Yeah, that's that's so Zillow's asserting ownership of pictures that somebody else took. Cheeky buggers.

Start time: 6800.82
End time: 6816.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the thing is, if you're critiquing, if you're critiquing the photos, then that would probably be fair use. Yeah. But if you're critiquing, if you're critiquing the house, I know they're critiquing the house, not the photos.

Start time: 6816.76
End time: 6837.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're using the photos to say, oh, look at this ridiculous house. And Zillow doesn't have the standing here. Zillow doesn't own the copyright in these photos.  The photographer does. The photographer probably in most cases is a real estate agent who put the listing up on the on the on the real estate.

Start time: 6837.82
End time: 6854.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think probably Zillow knew that and just decided, well, this is a blog no one's ever heard of.  We'll fire off a legal letter to them and then, you know, they'll shut up and we can get back out and get back on with our lives.  And then Streisand effect kicks in and the world and its dog knows about this site now. We're all going on there trying to find out what is going on.

Start time: 6855.64
End time: 6863.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope Kate puts those original pictures back up in the original post. It looks like to protect yourself, she took them down. She only has public images on there.

Start time: 6864.80
End time: 6888.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As Scott points out, though, I mean, I'm not sure, you know, house photo.  If you're commenting on the subject matter of the picture, you may well have a good very use argument, too.  So there are probably two reasons why these should stay.  No, no right of Zillow to assert this claim. And they're doing commentary on it.

Start time: 6889.18
End time: 6900.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And the photographer probably doesn't complain because it's a real estate agent who wanted to sell the house in the first place.  The more publicity for the house, the better. Well, maybe not this kind of publicity.

Transcript:  Yeah, but it's going to be a woman with the kind of gumption that's needed to do a root and branch reform of that organization.  And I don't know. Sheryl Sandberg could do it in a heartbeat. CEO at Facebook. But would she take it?  I know this is the problem. I don't think Rico. I don't think that she would. I don't personally think she would either.  But you just need man or woman. You need someone to really take that organization and shake it up by the scruff of the back of the neck.

Start time: 7005.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they were like, oh, a lot of people objected to this article because it was in the Guardian.  It's like, no, we objected to it because it was wrong. It's putting people's lives at risk. To steal a phrase from you, bollocks.  Well, yeah. I mean, the Turkish government to copy that article and put them out and put them out on state media.  Hoping that people would use it.  As a way of discouraging people from going onto a messaging service.  I mean, I was at a security conference just after that story broke.  And one guy who I respect and isn't prone to HyperBoll said whoever wrote that and whoever edited and published it has got blood on their hands.

Start time: 7034.86
End time: 7056.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  72 security experts shortly after the article was published wrote an open letter saying, absolutely WhatsApp is secure.  The problem you're talking about is not a significant issue. Can be changed in the settings.  Easy as pie.  And the Guardian finally six months later said, well, our reporting was flawed.

Start time: 7057.38

End time: 7086.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're right. This is more serious than just getting it wrong.  The risk is that somebody, a dissident who needs privacy might not use WhatsApp and go to something less secure.  Exactly.  Or less widely used because they're afraid of, you know, that WhatsApp has been cracked.  All right. I think we can wrap things up here.
