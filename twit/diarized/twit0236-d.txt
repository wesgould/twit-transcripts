Transcript:  This is twit, this week in tech.  The show that covers the technology news from the week.  Oh no, I'm sorry, that's Buzz Out Loud.  This is the show where we just kind of goof around for an hour and a half.  And we're so glad you're here.  I'm glad to be here.  Yes, Molly Wood is here.  So good to see you.  You've returned to Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have.  I'm back on Buzz Out Loud every day.  Yay.  I tell you, it's a much better show.  I've never made so many people so happy all at once.  It was a really gratifying feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it just to know that they want you, they love you, they want you back.  I like that show.  And now you're ranting professionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am.  I've decided to rant in written form and not just in audio and video.  I'm going back to my writer roots actually.  I have a new blog.  It's news.com slash molly hyphen rants, which is its own rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a rant right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't.  I filed a bug for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you find that once you start ranting that you could rant about almost anything?  You just start looking for rants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much.  Yeah.  In fact, someone Twittered me the other day and he said, why do you let, I don't even  know what it was, why do you let a commercial bother you on TV?  And I just wrote back and I said, have you met me?  I let everything bother me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  That's the tagline.  I let everything bother me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I let everything bother me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also here, Mr. Mark Millian from Los Angeles, the LA Times.  So good to have you, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to be on again.  Yeah, Mark.  And I let nothing bother me, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  You're kind of, you're one of them.  He looks, doesn't he look just like Justin Long, the I'm a Mac guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just like living life in LA, right?  For the Times.  What could bother you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm on my Macbook.  I got an iPhone here.  I could be the Mac guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Mark Millian.  I'm a Mac.  And of course, Molly is a PC.  That's true.  Earlier I was wearing a t-shirt that says, I think I still have it here.  It says, I'm a tech god.  And Windows 7, it was my idea.  Is that not, now, now see, do you rant against Windows ever?  Because that is a terrible, a terrible slogan.  Windows 7, it was my idea.  You know, that's kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the best slogan I've ever heard.  I mean, you know, yeah, sure.  I rant about everything.  Like I said, everything bothers me.  But Microsoft is, they, I mean, bless their little hearts, they may have the worst marketing  department in all of human history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new name, OK, so the World Mobile Congress went on this week in Barcelona and they announced  the new Windows Mobile 7, except it's not called Windows Mobile 7.  It's called Windows 7, Windows Phones.  Windows Phone 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows Phone 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you missed a part.  Windows Phone 7 Series.  Series.  Ah, terrible name.  Can you, could you come up with a worse name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just grammatically awkward.  It's just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's, and it's so unmemorable.  I mean, I've been saying it all week and I still didn't remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's beyond awkward.  It's just word salad.  I mean, it's like aphasia.  It's just, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows 7, 7 word series phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's like remember when Yahoo had this was my favorite name ever, actually.  Yahoo Go 4 TV.  Yahoo Go 4 TV.  Yahoo Go 4 TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like when Tina Fey goes, I want to go there.  It is just, I want to go there.  It's just crazy, crazy, man.  Anyway, what are your thoughts about the new Windows 7 series phone mobile thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think despite the, despite the word salad name, this is the first time  I've seen Microsoft doing something in the mobile space that looks vaguely promising.  It's based on Zune and it incorporates all of these kinds of things that, you know, I  saw Bill Gates at E3, what, three or four years ago, showing off the idea of having  your Xbox gamer tag integrated into your Windows mobile phone.  And it was like, hallelujah.  And now four years later it's here, which is great.  But is it too late?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark, have you, I mean, we've not, nobody's seen these phones.  It's all, it's all, it basically all seems video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I've spent a lot of time, obviously with the iPhone since I have one and with  the Android for many years trying all the different Android phones for reviews.  And I like that they didn't just pull out a carbon copy of the iPhone Oats.  It's not just little, little, you know, chiclet buttons, but it's rather like this like new,  fresh, like these big Lucida Grand, I think is the font face they're using.  And it just looks really nice and it looks kind of fresh and original because nobody's  used the Zoom before.  So it feels like a new interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fresh because what is this Zoom they talk of?  No, I agree with you. I think that it's kind of it's refreshing just for the fact that  they didn't try to do an iPhone.  I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did a tiny bit try to do a Palm Pre, which I think has been a little overlooked  that they're really doing kind of that Deca cards because of the slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what they what they say is that it doesn't just slide this way, it slides this up and  down and left and right.  There's it's like it does on the pre to the pre you slide up and down to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the pre totally has the X axis sliding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, you slide up to close files, right?  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. So I guess OK, so it is a little preish, although I think big fonts,  really nice graphics.  I'm a little annoyed that you have to have, you know, like ads for essentially what are  ads for Microsoft products in there like Xbox Live and.  What are you talking about?  I mean, you got a tile for it.  I guess you could I guess you could get rid of it.  Right. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is awesome because you can integrate your Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but what but what if but what if I don't have a gamertag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you should totally get one.  Oh, it's my fault.  So I guess in that sense, maybe it is a little bit of an ad for that.  Maybe maybe I should.  I'm sure you can turn it off, though.  I'm sure it's going to have a customizable, you know, tile screen or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm wondering if you can switch the default search engine from Bing to Google  because they were pushing that mobile Bing quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And whatever happened to the rumor that Apple was going to do  or do a deal to put Bing on the iPhone, that that must have been a bad rumor  because that never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was definitely a bad rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was an upsetting rumor, actually.  That just made you feel really kind of dirty.  I didn't that didn't feel comfortable to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you do? You use a pre today, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm on the droid.  I broke up with my iPhone  and then now I'm very happy with the droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? You know what I like?  I'm using the Nexus one and I loves it.  I was just testing that phone. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it nice?  Yeah, I mean, it's they all all the improvements that haven't.  I don't think they've rolled them out to droid yet. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's two point one and Android only has two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And some of that stuff is awesome.  Like they they somehow managed to improve further on the the navigation app.  Yeah, which is just incredible that it's free in the first place.  But yeah, there's there's so much good stuff going on with that Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, as long as we're talking, I haven't asked you guys,  what do you think of Buzz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my buzz.  I'm ranted against Buzz, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, what a surprise. Oh, really?  You didn't like Buzz. What a surprise.  What did you like about Buzz?  What is Mollywood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The giant privacy nightmare. Oh, that.  Oh, that's nothing.  Yeah. The part where everybody that I really like and I'm close to on Gmail  suddenly became part of a public friends list that everybody could see all the time.  And also the fact that it pulled as my internal profile picture,  at least it didn't publish it publicly.  But as my like profile picture that it showed me,  it used like a picture from my droid that I hadn't ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I mean, on top of all of the terrible things that it did, including  and this may be the worst thing about cluttering up my Gmail inbox,  which is unacceptable.  It also, I think, like pulled this droid picture out of thin air.  And that was just creepy as hell. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that is creepy.  Now, but it didn't publish it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't publish it. Now, it just published the list.  I'm going to channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to channel a Google engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but you you didn't have a profile.  So we had to put we had to supply a picture because you didn't.  Did you not?  Did you not create a Google profile, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it's just so I'm sure they were thinking, well, it's just so useful.  It was a very Steve Jobs kind of rollout, actually.  It was very like, well, you want to do this, right?  You want to have everybody in your contact list as your your public contact list.  Everybody that you email a lot, of course, they would be your contacts. Right.  And it's like, never mind the fact.  I mean, I think the big mistake.  OK, the first big mistake was I can't believe they didn't learn from Facebook  that you don't opt people into this kind of thing.  And then the second mistake is just the idea of having social networking as part of email.  I just feel like those are two really different paradigms right now.  Still, if email is still private space, at least to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That that actually hit me immediately, what you're talking about with Facebook,  because this just totally reeked of one of Facebook's many blunders.  It's like these these engineers that have no mind for public  testing and no sense of personal privacy, that it's just this mindset  like, well, we'll do it for you. Right.  We don't need your permission.  This is what you wanted.  Like you're saying, this is what you want to do. Right.  This is I mean, this is like Facebook's public updates, this newsfeed, this beacon.  It's it's just these these these engineers that are like, wait,  why wouldn't you like this is I mean, isn't this the way to go?  This is like the easiest thing to do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll do it for you.  And then Eric Schmidt has the nerve to say what nobody was hurt.  That was like his just his justification for it.  Well, you know, nobody was hurt by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and did you see the the class action lawsuit that's being filed?  The lady in Florida. Yeah. Right.  A abusive ex-boyfriend who sees her contact list  basically who she's emailing with most often, namely her new boyfriend.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now, of course, because I am exactly the opposite of Molly,  I'm Molly twisted.  I loved it and I didn't mind.  But I but I also understand why people were upset by the whole thing.  It wasn't it wasn't a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You also got 10000 followers almost immediately within a week.  I know your you know, your bathroom scale has almost as many followers  as me on Twitter.  What's your Twitter handle? We got to fix that.  It's just my name, Mark Millian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  M-A-R-K-M-I-L-I-A-N, please, please.  I beg of you, just follow the guy, because I don't know if I can.  I don't know if I can handle the rep the approbation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd rather you just plug Leo's underscore scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the opposite. We don't want that.  Oh, dear. Well, yeah, no, it's I don't know why anybody would care  because Leo scale, the only thing it does is every morning it says how fat I am.  Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why that's the appeal of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you're cutting down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're looking good. I'm slimming down, baby.  Thanks to Leo's scale, thanks to the fact that I am humiliated  in public every morning, whether I like it or not.  And you know, did you know that I did this, Molly?  And when you get on the scale,  it it tweets it immediately, like you can't like, oh, shoot and jump off.  Like, oh, no, don't send that. It's too late.  I've because I tried a couple of times.  I'm going, that's wrong. And I jumped off and no, too late.  So I know I'm it's a mistake.  Time to do, Molly. I knew you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go. I was thinking like more power to you, sweetie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I muted you, Molly.  I did. Yeah, that doesn't happen often, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I actually mute all this time because I've been saying really smart stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. The whole show, the whole show.  She was so good, folks. I wish you could have heard her.  Oh, man, is she brilliant?  Is that is that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All better. You can hear me now.  I've been seeing Calcana's weighing himself in public, and I was thinking  he's doing it, too.  I, you know, no, that's a little hard.  Like, good for you. But no, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No woman would ever do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's just this is the kind of right.  Like, this is the kind of thing that only a geek would think of,  like how Google admitted that they didn't test buzz anywhere else, but inside Google.  So, of course, it made perfect sense to them to just sign up everybody  because it was like all your buddies from Google.  And then the whole idea of the scale, which is like, you know,  maybe you should like ask some girls about this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now they fixed it. They fixed it.  So it's OK now, right? I mean, they fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it's fine and I think it's great.  It should definitely be an opt out thing.  You know, I'm glad it is now.  When you're at start. Yeah.  When you I still don't like it, like it just doesn't make any sense to me as a paradigm.  I already have Facebook and I don't want social networking in my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, now this this is what I think is funny,  because people who are on Facebook bitch about privacy on buzz.  I mean, Facebook is not I mean, let's face it, it's a sieve.  Yeah. But you know, but.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but you can configure it, right?  Like, I think that all of the things that Facebook did wrong  are the things that Buzz did wrong to, like opt you into all of this stuff.  And Facebook definitely should not be let off the hook.  Like, just because Buzz is bad doesn't mean Facebook is not bad.  I mean, they you know, the fact that when they rolled out their new privacy thing,  they opted everybody in.  If you hadn't changed your default privacy settings,  then all of a sudden your default privacy settings became everyone.  Right. On the Internet.  I mean, that was almost just as bad, except that on Facebook  you already opted into the people that you're friends with.  And that and you knew that that was a public facing thing.  The idea that that Google would come along and all of a sudden  make all of your email contacts public, I think was just absolutely.  I can't even believe that they thought that was OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely reprehensible. They back down.  I don't know why Eric Schmidt wasn't a little more apologetic,  but that's you know, I think that's kind of Eric.  He's also the guy who said, hey, if you're not doing anything wrong,  you shouldn't mind if everything you do is seen online.  What do you got to hide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the common thread between these companies  that they don't seem to realize is that social is a very sensitive subject.  People have their personal privacy beliefs and this is just a business to them.  I mean, in real life, like social interactions,  there are unspoken, subtle nuances like the I'm not really surprised  that these engineers don't get those certain things,  but they're this is like just causing problems for a huge population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C.  Dvorak's in our chat room. I'm going to pull him up.  I didn't I didn't I want to get him on the show, too, so he can rant.  Then it'll be two renters and you and me, Mark.  Let me get John on here.  And then we're also going to take a break because I want to get a commercial.  And so let me see if I can pull up John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Hello, John.  Also, if you have any engineers in your chat room,  can you ask them what in the hell is wrong with this stupid laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Molly now looks like Miss like they're saying you look like Mrs. Cleaver,  like June Cleaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm seriously getting like more messed up and odd looking by the second.  Dear everyone, it's an HP and V15 and it's a turd.  Help nobody's ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's going to ever let you buy any of their products.  You understand that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really shouldn't because it should be said out of the gate.  I have this magnetic field and I breaks everything.  Has already gone back to get fixed, like the hard drive died.  The end key didn't work.  Now the webcam stuck on like either night mode or Veronica Lake vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it. If you put on some pearls,  you'd be a hot TV star from the 50s.  You got any pearls?  You she's looking around.  All right. We're going to take a break when we come back.  John C.  Dvorak and more news, including I bet you guys will have something to say about  this. A school that now admits its spied on its students using their laptops  46 times. But that's all.  Meanwhile, folks, I want to talk a little bit about GoToMeeting.  My good friends at Citrix have put together a great product based on their  remote access technology.  You know, you've heard about Citrix, I'm sure for years.  They do go to my PC, the great high end enterprise stuff and go to meeting.  GoToMeeting is meeting software designed to make your meetings just pop to life.  We all have phone calls, you know,  those conference calls where you want to show them something visual and you can't,  you know, a chart, a picture, a spreadsheet, maybe a PowerPoint presentation.  It's frustrating because you're trying to explain it.  This slide here, if you were,  if you were able to see it as a graph that contains four bars, one's red,  one's blue, one's green. That's not going to work.  Call loss longer.  A picture's worth a thousand words. And with GoToMeeting,  you can show them that PowerPoint. You could show them the spreadsheet.  You can collaborate.  You can even train because you can give them control of a program.  Even if they don't have it on their system. I just love GoToMeeting.  I want you to try it right now for free by going to go to meeting.com slash  twit. We use it on a couple of our shows now to show screenshots. It's fantastic.  For sales presentations, for product demos, for training,  go to meeting.com slash twit.  Try it today. I think you're going to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  School.  You go to meeting for the first time. The other day it was a,  an engineer was showing me a office sync and he's, I mean,  he's based in Chicago. So how'd you like it? Pretty cool.  It was really cool actually.  And I was on my like piece of crap computer at work and I was like,  I really don't think this is going to work.  And just put in the password and instantly it came up and yeah,  I had no experience with anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love it. Love it. I don't know what's happening with John. John, are you going to,  are you here? John? Are you, are you going to come in?  John, do you hate us? Mr. Dvorak. Look, I found some pearls. Mr. Dvorak.  You did. Let me see. Oh, you look, look at that. She looks gorgeous.  Now you do look like June Cleaver. June Cleaver. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I was going for. Can we go back to the Veronica Lake?  Wouldn't that was good? You also look like Veronica Lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look gorgeous. And she's wearing a ton of makeup, which looks, you should,  you know, in black and white, even it looks even extra special.  You look more like Lauren Bacall now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I guess if this thing is going to be a turd,  it might as well be like a Lauren Bacall turd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well made up turd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. John says he's trying to connect. I'll try again with John. Meanwhile,  what do you think about this school in Pennsylvania? They,  I guess it's, I mean, it must be a good school.  They give their kids laptops when they matriculate.  What happens is a kid is called on the carpet by the assistant principal who  says, we know what you did. And the kid says, what? Look,  look at this picture. And it's a picture of the kid in his room.  And apparently this assistant or vice principal used a photo taken automatically  from the kid's laptop by the webcam.  The kid good for him said, um, I don't think that's right.  That's right.  Sound right. And where'd you get,  so the parents come in and say, uh, what's going on?  Well turns out that every laptop is shipped with a software that would let the  school take pictures from the laptops, camera, listened on the laptops thing.  Now they say it's in case the laptop stolen. And yeah,  there are Mac programs like this is one called undercover that will do that.  But now it's starting to come out that maybe they've used it before and maybe  really they are using it to spy on the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, and in 42 times,  they used it 42 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they,  and they managed to claim that in turning it on 42 times that all of those times  were because they thought that it was missing or the laptops were missing or  stolen, which if you actually have that level of problem with the laptops,  they'd give the students maybe like chain them to the desk instead of spying on  them in their bedrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, we're talking to inner city Philly right here.  You don't know.  Is it inner city Philly? Is that what this is?  I, I don't know much about the school. It's Philadelphia. Um,  I'm willing to get to bet that they're buying laptops buddy,  that they're not having too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has to be fairly, fairly affluent. I mean, this is, that's an expensive thing.  It's the lower Marion school district. Uh, now of course, uh,  there's a lawsuit, uh,  Blake J Robbins versus the lower Marion school district.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think this story is especially near to me because,  um, when I, when I was in high school, like six years ago, five years ago,  Oh God, sorry guys.  This is mean.  I, I, we had all gotten laptops my entire high school and my senior year.  Um, but I mean, at that point it was,  I mean probably their biggest blunder for that particular year. We were,  we all just installed like super Nintendo emulators and stuff.  So no work was getting done, but uh, it was still early days at that point.  So, um, so they didn't, I mean,  they didn't even know that they could monitor us. I'm sure using the cameras,  but they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was scary. Hey,  that's John C. Dvorak appearing on your laptop to see what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to look as much like Molly as I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very attractive. You're black and white.  You got that much going for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should give yourself some hair. Now's your big chance.  Oh, since I have a hair,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it doesn't really offend me. Oh, he has plenty of hair. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately. Yeah. But he's, do you're just in time, John, to, uh,  to say like for some reason the school district was totally justified in spying  on the students with the, with the security software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's the deal, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the school district or a bunch of perverts and they wanted to see if a  kid was masturbating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you almost start to wonder though,  like what possible other reason could there be other than just absolute dirty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  burns? I just told you the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We believe that a child here has been masturbating. We have the pic. What,  you know,  they don't ever say what this kid Robbins was doing that the vice principal  showed him the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I read something that said they thought he was taking some kind of  pills. I saw him taking a pill. No, I mean,  it's there is absolutely no excuse for this.  And I think they should be sued frankly off the face of the earth.  Like I cannot imagine. I mean,  I guess I can see that maybe it was sort of a slippery slope, right?  Like they turned it on one time because they thought it was lost.  And then they thought, Oh,  maybe we can keep an eye on these kinds of problems students.  And then the next thing you know, they're watching them all the time,  but you know what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're just making this up as you go along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's trying to find some possible justification. It's kind of hard to believe.  It creeps. That's the reason you really think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What also really kind of pissed me off about this story is that the consensus in  all the coverage was that the quotes were saying like, well,  we could understand if they were just monitoring site activity,  but to go through the webcam, like,  why is it cool to monitor site activity? Yeah. Even still like it,  when I had the laptops in my high school,  they had just a big flowing list of every site everybody was going to.  And for that very reason I would get home and then never use my school  listed laptop again.  And I also love about this story that the kids had just finished reading 1984.  It seems like that irony just keeps popping up and like that Amazon book story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that really true? That sounds like a dig comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too good to be believed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's true.  That was too much. Oh, wow. That's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The 1984 irony never stops. You remember that?  They pulled the 1984s off of the Kindles a few months ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk a little bit about, anyway,  I guess his school district is going to be in deep doo doo.  The FBI is now involved because I mean it's more than,  now it's just not a civil case. Now the FBI says,  you've violated computer intrusion laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I would not be surprised if at some point there is either a hint of,  or actual child porn charges.  Cause child porn charges have been levied against people for far less than  this. And the fact is these parents are saying,  you probably have webcam footage and pictures of my kid in various stages of  underage and that is flat out into extremely bad territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awful. You're right. Oh geez. I don't even want to think about it.  Jail time. I mean, it's absolutely horrible.  Yeah. We're talking jail time.  No wonder the FBI is involved. Oh, that's depressing. Now,  you know, my kid's school gives them a Mac book with a built-in laptop.  What do we do? Do we have to look for that software and try to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just put a post it over the webcam, which is frankly what I should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always put a piece of gaffers tape over my little cameras on those laptops  and monitors that have cameras on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You tape it over, but then you still have audio. You know,  it's also a problem because many people,  people who use Justin.tv and other use stream video streaming services quick  often turn on when they turn on the flash to capture it,  give permanent permission for flash to take over the webcam and the,  and the microphone. So could even go to a malicious site that would just say,  okay, start taping the flash. It's you wouldn't, you do.  Wouldn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've gone back to the Hawaiian look. Is this that,  is this what you're going to be seeing from now on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just, you know, it was a rainy day in Petaluma and I just thought I'd  bring a little sunshine into the lives of the little people who watch this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever tell the story to these people about how you used to wear these  wild shirts over at tech TV? And then one day,  it's one of the bosses,  one of the suits came over and told you to tone it down.  When in fact this was adding to the entertainment value of the show to an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  extreme. We didn't want to be too dull. Actually,  I was on the internet now. Yeah. Damn it. So I can wear my,  my Tommy Bahama shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think that some of these stories need to be told. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you've just told that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although we do only have so much time in life. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trying to catch up since you kept me off the show for the first 20 minutes.  I'm sorry. I didn't, you know, we had,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people are like, sweet, John's not on. You can keep Leo on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a little, we had a little scheduling, Snafu. And, uh, I guess we hadn't,  we hadn't contacted you, John, not, not through any lack of desire.  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  So, uh, Apple has begun a war on porn.  The last 12 hours Apple has booted, you're going to like this, Molly,  5,000 applications from the app store applications it had approved,  but now decides that, uh, they're too sexy, overtly sexual content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What, why did you direct that story at Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause she doesn't like Apple's, uh, punitive, you know, draconian control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like them bossing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So, so you're thinking John, that I'm being sexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like my droid where I can have all the porn I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I thought you were being insulting. You make it sound like she's like some  ex porn girl or something. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I said nothing to do with the porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not an ex porn girl in this video, this webcam. No, I, I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I like is that you're, that you're in the kitchen, Mrs. Cleaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Folks, if you're not in the kitchen, she's like Molly Cleaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had her put pearls on. It's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope. Just later on. I'll go make a roast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For those of you who are not watching on video,  you must download the video version of this show and watch later. So, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is exactly the kind of thing I think that Apple does and has been doing all  along with the app store,  which is kind of arbitrary approval and disapproval of apps.  And then what I've said to them before,  and we'll say even more strongly now is that censorship is an incredibly slippery  slope. And once you start even just a little bit,  you find yourself in this really uncomfortable position, right? They,  if they hadn't been so insistent on approving every app in the first place,  then it wouldn't be so easy to say, well, we want the sexy stuff gone.  And then all of a sudden it's gone. And then it's like, where do you end?  Because you're always going to be offending someone.  So they could play whack-a-mole like this for the next 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny cause I'm a Mac break weekly.  I was complaining about the fact that they were turning down really great,  useful applications and allowing programs like tight body perky boobs to get  through, which is actually a program that was there and has now been removed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it? What's the name of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gone. Now it's gone, John tight body perky boobs.  But my question is how did this get through the screening process when programs  like the Squarespace blogging app gets turned down?  Cause it's icon is unesthetic.  And so I can't really be,  I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say, I'm not glad that these apps are gone.  But, but the point really is the point that you made Molly,  which is once they start censoring for whatever reason, bad, bad icon design,  they're now in this business. And so they,  they are going to get held to a higher standard.  They did not warn any of these application guys that, you know,  what you're doing, we might pull it off or anything like that. So let's just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to be a higher standard necessarily.  It's going to be an increasingly arbitrary standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's arbitrary. That's my point. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but this isn't the first time they've censored. Like there was no Google voice.  They refused like Google voice. Like you said, Squarespace, right?  Those bother me. That's Apple politics.  Those bother me a lot more than not being able to get booby apps on my phone.  Like you just pull up Safari, you can get porn, but for these useful utilities,  that's, I mean, that's just politics. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In an effort to raise the ratings of the show,  I'd like to now go through the business insider,  Silicon Valley business insiders,  15 outrageous sex apps that made it into the iPhone app store slideshow.  I jiggles your mom,  video strip poker strip. Simon puff.  This application lets you lift the skirts of Japanese girls by blowing into your  iPhone's microphone to create a virtual gust of wind.  Yeah. Pocket girlfriend.  Pocket girlfriend, which a lot of geeks as bad as close as they're going to get.  The Russian brides gallery.  Oh, my vibe.  I'm not going to go into that one. Adult tennis boobs.  A bunch of pictures of tennis players.  Yeah, this is what the computer revolution has finally come to.  This is what it's all about, baby. I can carry that in my pocket.  Boobs in my pocket. Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find it kind of adorable, like vaguely sweet.  How many of these apps had boobs in the name? Like that seems so almost innocent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a quick way to find it. You know, if you do the search now, interestingly,  there are quite a few apps in the, in the Android marketplace that have,  but not nearly the number frankly, that have some sexuality in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although the Android store has, what is the, what's the app?  The they have the porn app store.  Oh, they do. That is like the porn app store aggregator.  What the heck is it? Oh, I miss that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I feel like the tip, Molly, that's I miss that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my favorite for iPhone, too, if you it's basically a web app.  If you if you go to I think it's sex app store dot com, you you you go to the site.  Well, cause they, yeah, the, and the way it falls it onto the home screen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the way Android works is they, you know, anything you can buy from anywhere.  So this is, I think this is one of my favorites. It's called my candy. Sorry.  My candy. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  M I K A N D I and it's the world's first porn app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. And that's why you want a droid. Well, I don't know. This, by the way,  this application is still available in the iTunes store. It's called nude it.  Uh, what you do is you take a picture of somebody and it superimposes a person  in their underwear under their head.  So it does face recognition and then puts a naked person underneath them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  Poor guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a 99 cent app that is still available. It was just released. So maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Confused by what I mean, the suicide girl one is still on there.  I have it on my phone. That's the problem with this is that, uh,  yeah, suicide girls on their playboys still there. I'm looking right now.  They have this, like, you must be 17 years or older to download this game,  but what, what, I mean,  what are their standards for what gets deleted and what stays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Like that's what's so ludicrous about this.  Not only are they going to be playing whack them all and pardon my language or,  you know, euphemism there,  if they keep trying to do this,  be in the censorship game because new app iPhone apps are popping up, you know,  left and right. They're also totally arbitrary and they won't say what the  standards are. And anytime you don't know what the standards are,  then you have a broken system because you have no trust as a developer that  you're not going to get completely screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's statements so far, the only statement they made whenever we receive  customer complaints about objectionable content, when am I getting feedback?  Is that you, John? No.  Molly, Molly, do you have a, yeah, it really is. What does that?  John disappeared in back there. John's gone too. This is just, I'm a, you know,  the whole week, the whole week. What is that facing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So effing annoying. Yeah.  That's not how I say it when I'm not on camera. So annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's a reaction whenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable  content, we review them.  If we find these apps contain inappropriate material, we remove them.  However, 5,000 apps gone in 12 hours sounds like more than, you know,  they're just getting around to it. Sounds like a new policy. It's a purge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just a ridiculous, you know, I mean, it's, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they got some tech stories. That's a tech story. It's got the word Apple in it.  Oh yeah. Well, I guess there's that. Does Google make us stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. Does Google make us stupid? I think proof is positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the future of the internet survey conducted by the Pew internet and  American life project and Elon university's imagining the internet center.  Who endowed that? I'd like to endow something. Elon university.  I'd like to endow and imagining the internet center.  They were asked to consider the future of the internet connected world between now  and 2020 and the likely innovation that would occur.  Survey required them to assess 10 different tension pairs.  There's somebody getting a big grant for this.  Each pair offering two different 2020 scenarios with the same overall theme and  opposite outcomes. Are you following me so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't find it on the list of stories. Yeah. Oh, you go there.  It is this Google night. Yeah. This episode two 36.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we go to delicious.com. Yeah.  Uh, Nick car in a cover story for the Atlantic monthly, uh,  in the summer of 2009 wrote is Google making us stupid?  He said that the online searching and distractions of browsing through the web  were limiting his capacity to concentrate. Nick's a smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he's stupid. Well, he should have changed the title of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Google making me stupid is what I should have asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not Google's fault. It's you. Well, but they basically found no,  when they did the story, they essentially said, it's not making you more stupid.  It might make you think in a different way,  but ultimately it's making you potentially more informed and,  and not more stupid at all. Yep.  So can you prioritize what you keep in your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now understand this isn't a test. It's a survey.  So it could be making us stupid. We're just too stupid to know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be.  It sounds like just a specious argument. Did you read this text?  I'm not thinking the way I used to,  he wrote in part because he's becoming a skimming browsing reader rather than a  deep and engaged reader.  The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable,  not just for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words,  but for the intellectual vibration those words set off within our own minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's his fault, right? I mean, if, if he wants to skim, then he's,  he's making that decision.  If he wants to Google the Renaissance and then read like a 100 page piece about  the Renaissance, he could do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's forcing him.  Good point. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, just because we have new technology,  we have to mourn the loss of the old way that we did things.  And it's just exhausting.  This sort of nostalgic exercise and like over intellectualizing the loss of  everything that used to be wonderful.  Like you have almost the entirety of human history at your fingertips at any  given moment on a computer or on your phone. Shut the hell up.  Life is pretty awesome now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So says Molly Cleaver.  Thank you, Molly Cleaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excuse me. I have a roast to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be right back with Leave It to Bieber right after these words from our  sponsors.  I couldn't resist. All right, sorry.  Get some Ovaltine everybody.  We're going to talk a little bit about carbonite.com and we'll come back with  more great stories.  Our guest's Molly Wood from CNET's Buzz Out Loud and the new page,  cnet.com slash molly dash rants where she rants about all sorts of great subjects.  She's just the greatest. So great to have you on Molly,  even if you are in black and white. John C. Dvorak.  I'll get it fixed.  No, I like it. I'm not complaining. It's good. It's really good.  If I could superimpose it over the Leave It to Bieber thing, maybe I will.  Let's see if I can make it make merge you together with the Leave It to Bieber  thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  You got too many toys over there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now, now what was her name?  What was the name? June Cleaver, but who played her?  You know, if the, if Google weren't making you stupid,  you probably could figure that out.  Barbara Billingsley. Thank you.  Billingsley.  Barbara Billingsley. Very good. Tony Dow.  And the Beaver.  And what's his name as the Beaver?  Yeah. As so and so as the Beaver.  I think we're going to call this show the Beaver and see if Apple will let it be  in the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody already came up with, I think, I think they nailed the title for the  show.  Oh yeah. What's that?  Tennis boobs.  It's got SEO written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be back with John C.  Dvorak from Channel Dvorak and Mark Millian from the LA Times.  We were having some fun talking about the week's tech news,  but I do want to mention backup. Oh, don't get scared.  I got an easy way for you to back up. You know,  sometimes I think people listen and I mentioned backup and they,  they just freeze up because they've had a bad experience. You know,  you forget to back up and you lose your hard drive and it's going to happen and  you're going to lose something valuable. Your, you know, your pictures, your music,  your financial documents, your email, something's going to go.  And there's no reason for that to happen. It's not just hard drive crashes.  I mean, they're Carnegie Mellon study up to 13% of hard drives crash in their  first year, but it's also, frankly,  user error, people throwing stuff out. 43% of people lose files.  They consider replaceable every year.  600,000 laptops lost or stolen at you say us airports every  year, 600,000.  And only 3% of those are ever recovered. That's why carbonite carbonite.  Since 2006 it backed up over 25 billion files restored 2 billion files.  That's 2 billion files that people went, thank you, carbonite.  I want to make sure that you have carbonite on your system. You install it.  It starts backing up immediately.  All of the irreplaceable files in your computer,  the stuff internally backed up to the internet encrypted using AES 256 bit  encryption. So your privacy is guaranteed and you can get it back so easily.  And by the way, that's important.  A lot of times people try these online backups and they say, I love it.  And then they try to restore and they go, oh no, where is that? Not with carbonite.  They even have an iPhone application. So at any time,  if you want to see how your backup's doing,  you can go to the iPhone or go to another computer,  even log into carbonite.com, download your file and get it back.  Try it right now by going to carbonite.com,  use the offer code Leo for two free weeks.  And if you decide to buy after the trial, you'll get two free months.  Use the offer code Leo less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup  carbonite. It's backup done.  Right. And now we return to leave it to Beaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, I want to chat. I thank the chat room for the suggestion. Oh,  a little, little vino.  Little shots in 2003.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get that at the, at the Costco? Isn't it like the wine buying time at Costco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this has been sitting in the cellar for a while. It's aged,  but there I have to say for people out there want to know Novato, California,  Costco go there. Now the place is loaded with, uh, loaded in the gills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. Loaded.  Sad story loaded. Sad story this week.  Um, uh, small plane crashed in Palo Alto, um,  killing three executives at Tesla, not Elon Musk. The CEO was, uh, was fine.  Fine. But, uh, um,  I thought what was most interesting about this was the coverage.  Mashable broke the story. At least that's the, the, uh, geeks, you know,  coverage I saw on Twitter as Facebook loses power due to small plane crash.  Right. And then CNN says three executives,  Facebook loses power.  And then it was CNN that pointed out that there were actually in fact three,  uh, executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People in the plane who died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook was out for a while. I think that it was Tesla executives.  It was pretty bad that they were focusing on the Facebook adage when  obviously no one, you know,  probably not everybody's okay when a plane crashes into a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's usually pretty bad. That's considered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the Tesla stuff came out a lot later and that is, I mean, that's awful.  It's a very small company still, I think. And that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't take that long for the Tesla material to the one Tesla guy in  particular that came up pretty quick because he's the owner of the plane.  Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York times talking about how much you should pay for a digital edition of  the times on the iPad. And there's some debate. Um,  and I'd be curious what you guys think. First of all,  how much would it be worth for you to get the New York times on the iPad instead  of say the print edition? Would you buy it?  We could do it with the LA times if you prefer a Mark.  We're not charging.  It's free. And you think you're going to continue to stay free? Yep.  We're going to stay free. I think that's interesting. That's interesting. You know,  Murdoch of course, and the times and others are saying we got a charge.  We can't, we can't give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's great for us.  We get to be the number one paper pretty soon on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Times the times is debating the, uh,  hardcore print guys in the times, according to sources, uh,  at geek.com are saying 20 to $30 a month.  It's like 240 to $360 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seems like the paper subscription costs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the paper's pretty expensive. If you just, uh,  it's like $6 to get the Sunday Friday, Saturday, Sunday times, $6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened to the 25 cent paper? They made it all up on advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's long gone. John. How old are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think, I think if they're building a full featured,  if they're building these really kind of full featured apps that are optimized  for these devices, not necessarily the iPad, cause no one should buy that.  But I think that there may be some compelling argument that,  you know, toward a subscription fee.  Like I think I would subscribe to papers on a, on a tablet,  on a reading device like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think how much I'm paying right now and that, you know,  what's the right price, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be a lot lower. I think 20 or 30 bucks a month is too much.  Digital edition. That's absolutely ridiculous. I mean,  I think five or $10 a month is probably about where you might find people  willing to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you have according to geek.com is the print folks were afraid of  cannibalizing their print business. Like there's anything left in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would you would ever heard that argument before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The digital folks say, Oh, 10 bucks a month.  We want to charge 10 bucks a month, which some would say it's still too much.  Mark, you would say it's still too much, but I think 10, I would pay 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a dollar, I would pay five or 10. Um, just for,  for bits blog and the main tech and business and world content alone. Um,  I think it's worth five or 10 bucks, but, um, I mean, at,  at the LA times we have this philosophy that we're not going to take things away.  This is, this is like taking things that,  that everybody online has been getting for free for a while.  And they could easily turn to scores of other organizations to get their news  content. Um, I,  I think there's so many other areas that the New York times could go into.  They could do like, they could have small teams that build mobile apps.  They could create like new products. They don't,  they don't need to take everything and put it behind a wall.  So you think it's a lack of vision?  Uh, I, I think to an extent, maybe it is a lack of vision. I think they're,  they're worried more about how to make up the money in the next two years rather  than, um,  than looking to other other ways and having the content as almost a sort of  loss leader. Uh, I mean, John, John, you mentioned, uh, the, uh,  the 25 cents fees for the paper and then you make it up in advertising that,  that was always the business model. I mean, granted, classifieds are gone now,  but, um, the, the business model was never to make,  to make people pay upfront. And it's,  I frankly don't think it makes sense to go there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has jobs visited the LA times? Do you know, Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I knew I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. Good. Good answer. But I,  but I don't know. Oh, you could have stopped there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you knew it's your journalistic responsibility to tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question. Is it? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NDA by seeing my, can't tell anybody. He's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Molly, if, if, if jobs showed up at CNET, even if the,  if the big boss said you can't say a word, if would you, would you say,  if the big, ask me the question, Leo,  John C. Dvorak, if Steve jobs came to the house  and your wife said, John, you may not tell anyone. Would you say,  I would tell everybody. Yeah. Well, you don't work.  Nobody tells me what to do. Why you got, don't have a job, John.  You just work freelance for a bunch of people.  I've told everybody at the twit cottage that they may not say,  say that Steve jobs was here. It's a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When was he there? What? So he was there then is what you're saying.  Excuse me. I have to, you know, for some unknown reason,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just can't see Steve jobs showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he didn't show up. Actually. I think Steve, I think, you know,  remember I, I held up the laptop and, and, and,  and sent out a signal of the iPad announcement, right?  And I've been waiting for repercussions cause you know, I mean,  they didn't tell me not to, nobody stopped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a couple of, of, of Steve jobs lookalikes that are in the industry.  We can do a show and then I'll be sitting there and the thing is, Hey, Hey,  Hey, that's look, look, look, and then you'll swing the camera.  I'll grab a camera, swing it over, catch him as he runs out.  It's like the Yeti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just see a, you know, a welch well clad foot come out the door.  So what was I saying? Oh, so Steve apparently did visit the wall street  journal in the New York times.  Uh, or something. Yeah. Wearing a weird hat. Yeah. Now that's Valley wag.  That can't be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think the question really is though, like, you know,  with all due respect, Mark, the LA times has had some pretty serious financial  problems that the New York times and wall street journal are hoping to avoid.  I mean, it is a possibility,  and this is obviously a discussion that's ongoing in the industry,  but it is a possibility that it isn't sustainable to keep relying on  advertising in the way that we have,  at least not if that advertising has to pay for the cost of,  of manufacturing and delivery. So a digital edition is going to be cheaper,  but if it has a value add, and I guess that's my question,  does it give me something more than the web? And if it does, and it's a,  it's a great reading experience for whatever reason on this tablet,  then I don't know that it's,  that it's going to be fundamentally unreasonable to charge a small subscription  fee. It's just that that has to be,  I think it's going to have to be a small subscription fee or people aren't going  to pay it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Molly, the industry model sustained itself for 150 years in newspapers.  Uh, we're, we're in economic downturn right now. You,  you kind of have to have faith that it will eventually turn around and that  advertising will be a viable model again. And granted,  before there was classified ads,  but that's that just goes to the point that there are other business models out  there.  And then it was just never about limiting your reader base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I mention something that was being overlooked here? Yeah.  Especially about the New York Times and to a lesser extent,  probably to no extent with the Wall Street Journal,  the New York Times is because they set themselves up as a syndicate,  two syndicates actually is a New York Times syndicate.  And then they actually syndicate their entire content to anybody who wants it.  And which we create. So if you go to Google news,  you see there's a huge redundancy of stories from the New York Times.  And when, and when, even when you go to the New York Times and say,  I blocked you out, it says you cannot read the story unless you're registered.  You can cut and paste the headline into Google and find 45 other instances of  the exact same story running in St. Petersburg and Atlanta and Austin and every  place else around the country. These people,  once the New York Times puts itself onto the little iPad,  I don't see why they wouldn't do the same thing and they can just undercut the  New York Times. This is,  this is what's what's cannibalizing the potential for the New York Times is its  own syndication and the fact that it had set out to ruin the newspaper industry  years earlier.  The New York Times and Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post decided to  syndicate their content and their columnist incidentally.  So all the papers are in the middle of podunk USA would say, well,  let's just fire all our local columnists and just run theirs.  Cause it's a lot cheaper and they kind of ruin the entire country.  But now with the internet is turned back on them.  I think it's one of the great ironies that's undiscussed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's undiscussed. I mean,  I think everybody is kind of aware that if you start to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can see Leo is listening to my diatribe.  What did you say, John? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well I had the wrong picture. There we go. Yeah, look at that.  It's pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good. Yeah.  Any old fuzzy black and white photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what we're talking about. I totally forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Whatever you said, John, you're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No,  everybody knows that the big argument against the idea of charging for,  you know,  this idea some sort of premium journalism product is that you can find that  journalism product in some form all over the web. I mean, I don't, I don't,  I don't think that's undiscussed at all.  I think that's probably the thing that's that has been keeping everybody up at  night, including CNET. I just think that there is,  I think it's worth it to experiment.  Like it may be that there is a market for higher quality news and people want to  pay for it. And by the way, I should clarify, I don't like,  I don't read the Times. I'm not a fan. I do. I love it. I pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I pay 10 bucks a month. Easy. Not 20.  I wouldn't pay that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They put into that newspaper and I think that they may find by trying this  experiment that people are willing to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think there's evidence to the contrary. Newsday put up their wall and  their, I mean, they're fairly big in their own market.  35 people subscribe to the Newsday Online Edition.  Yeah, classic story.  Say this again.  I don't know if that's exactly the number,  but Newsday put up their paywall and within, I think,  nine months 35 people have subscribed to the Online Edition.  Total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was something really low like that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Wall Street Journal makes a ton of money on their online subscription  in their newspaper, which is outrageously expensive.  And I pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they are profitable.  For a good reason.  Why?  It's a good paper.  Because it has specific targeted financial information about companies you  may have invested in and you need to know about.  You make money on it.  They target rich people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Well, you're rich, but also that information makes you money.  So you're willing to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also it's a high quality journalistic product.  And that's what the New York Times is trying to say, too,  is we're a higher quality journalistic product than, you know, blog XYZ.  And so we think and mind you, I'm just playing devil's advocate, right?  Like we they're saying we think people are going to be willing to pay for it.  And the market will decide whether, in fact, people are willing to pay for it.  I still think it's worth them trying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to New York's Daily Intel,  Steve Jobs had a top secret dinner at Prana in the Flatiron District.  The sometime pescatarian, some reading from Valley Wag, the sometime,  the sometime pescatarian, Jobs is actually a vegan.  I don't believe he eats fish.  Dined with 50 New York Times company executives in the cellar dining room,  sat with Times publisher Arthur Salzberger, according to Daily Intel,  showed off his new iPad and ordered off menu.  This wasn't on the menu. He ordered a mango, lasi and penne in case anybody's  interested. Also according to Daily Intel.  And I think this ruins the whole story. Jobs showed up wearing, quote,  a very funny hat, a big, a big top hat kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's just trying to entertain his new biographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A top hat? That would be something.  Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.  Where's the paparazzi when we need them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was he like in disguise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, as Mr. Peanut, apparently.  There was also a tweet that got Steve a little upset.  Alan S. Murray, who is a online executive editor  on February 4th, tweeted from an iPad. It says,  this tweet sent from an iPad. Does it look cool?  Immediately deleted it.  A tipster tells Valley Wag that deletion ultimately traces back to a furious  Jobs. Valley Wag asked Murray for comment. Murray wrote, quote,  I would love to talk about this, but can't. In a later email he added,  I will say that Apple's general paranoia about news coverage is truly  extraordinary, but that's not telling you anything you didn't already know.  So if you get an iPad, do not tweet from it.  Now I've been told, and this is where I think I'm getting my comeuppance,  because I've been told that-  Who'd you just look at, Leo?  Nobody. That was a, I looked off to the right, but there's nobody here.  There's somebody over there.  It's Steve Jobs in a top hat. How did you know? John,  you're so perspicacious. I, I, you know,  I went there to the iPad thing. I, I, I streamed out audio, I confess,  and video from the iPad announcement. Nobody told me not to.  I never asked and nobody said no. So I didn't break any rules that I know of.  However, I have a feeling I'm getting, because Seenet did ask, apparently.  I found out later and it was told no.  But I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like somehow I'm going to get  it. Right. So I found out today that my arch rival, a radio host,  Kim Commando, who does a nationwide syndicated computer talk show,  claims she is getting an iPad review unit next week.  Not I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And second place is two iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You don't really care. The iPad, apparently on the 25th,  the rumors say will be available for a pre-order. I take it.  You're not going to pre-order, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got that correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am. I would. I can't wait to get my Molly.  Well, you buy everything. You don't count.  I don't count, but I would buy it even if I were a normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, he's hopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm bouncing on my ball. I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's like Kevin Spacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just don't fall over like he did last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I fell off the ball last week. It was quite humiliating.  Molly, I take it you're not going to pre-order an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to pre-order it. Come on.  Even if I thought that in its current form, it is all that a tablet can be.  It's first generation hardware from Apple.  That alone is enough reason not to pre-order it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Millian, come on, you're going to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I probably won't get one.  But before I tell you why, I want to thank you for that live stream of the  the Apple conference, because I was tasked with blogging that remotely,  which is usually the hardest thing in the world.  But I just followed your stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you hadn't followed my stream, you wouldn't have gotten it anywhere.  We had 150,000 people watching that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was valuable.  I was refreshing the GDGT live blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But aside from that, they were it was it was me and and GDGT.  Because Ryan Block, because  everybody else was using Cover It Live and it went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course. But no, I'm not.  I'm not getting an iPad because I can almost envision no scenario  when I would pick up that device  versus going to my laptop or going to my phone.  I think it would be great for like my mom, who has a desktop and a phone,  but just has no in between to use like the couch or whatever.  But I just for me, I don't really think it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to order one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there I don't mean to discourage you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to order two.  And I don't even have to ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cannot discourage him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. You can ask me what?  I guess you already said you're not going to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to order one. Why would I?  I don't need another piece of equipment.  I got enough stuff.  And by the way, since I'm here, since you got me on the camera,  I have a new poster for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. Let's see it. OK.  Look, there's the Barney that got one point two million views.  One point three, by the way, singing in John's bathtub.  What is this?  It says the Captain Zilog poster.  Oh, I'd buy that from the 70s.  Zilog created the Z80, which was one of the early microprocessors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it says Captain Zilog, the fireworks have just begun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Handsomely framed.  He looks like Captain America.  And is this to promote the Z80?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is when Zilog was a big shot company.  They came out with these posters and this is extremely rare now.  So yeah, some guy in the chat room typically bid a dollar.  I'll bid a dollar.  Yeah, nice try.  So anyway, that's my latest.  So I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I am sure your house is full of that crap.  So what? I got a Barney back there.  I mean, you know, you got a Barney.  Is that a is that a code word for something?  I got you a Barney right here.  I got a Barney back here.  So how could somebody if somebody wanted to buy that, what would they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just email me and make an offer.  And if I see something I like or, you know, anything like somebody just bid  five hundred bucks, I'd sell it for five hundred bucks.  That'd be a good deal.  Somebody just bid a thousand. Yeah, sure.  Name monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, you're like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. Oh, I have some breaking news.  Yes. About the New York Times and the paywall, actually.  Yes, it appears that Arthur Salsberger,  Janet Robinson and Martin Niesenholtz of the New York Times at the Paid  Content Conference today said that and this is where now I'm not.  I'm not even going to try to devil's advocate them anymore.  They said they will include blogs in their metered paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does that mean?  No, no.  We're going to pay. This is some blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, they have some blog.  They have their if you look in bits, they have a number of blog tech blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is mostly a tech blog.  That is where the entire argument falls apart, because that is where  there are a million different publications that are doing the exact same thing  as the New York Times blog.  And there is absolutely no way that they can try to convince me  that that is worth paying for over another blog.  See, that's just annoying because I was just kind of playing the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually, that's a bad mouth.  What they should do is make the blogs free and have the blobs  constantly referencing the paid site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, something. Yeah.  Freemium or model. Yeah.  Freemium. Yeah.  I mean, this idea that really like their blog is so much better  than somebody else's blog that I'm going to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, forget about it.  So what's the next story?  We're going to show you the next story.  It's a time to screw the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break for audible.com.  But meanwhile, this moment just you made me think of this  from Antique Roadshow, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think about five years ago.  This is a big antique junk shop and click on wheels.  And I had to have it just couldn't pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was actually disgusting, which was a lot of money for me.  It's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I thought to myself, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unique object, the kind of crap I'd have around the house if I had the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing is unique in our business.  But sometimes you see something you've never seen before. Right.  And I must say, I've never seen this before.  It's generically a pull toy.  Cast iron wheels and probably made in.  What is going on?  Made around 1895 to 1910.  Most pull toys you see from Germany are like the iPad in 10 years.  This big little wooden platforms, sometimes land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'll leave it as an exercise.  The eye pig.  You guys got a good material in that room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you seldom see platform toys this big.  I mean, this is really exciting.  Life size pig.  You sell them finals.  So cute and so animated.  Oh, yeah.  So so push them over here.  I listen to him and you see his mouth go.  I mean, this guy is really a little.  The mouth goes up and down.  Goes up and down.  Snout and teeth.  That's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scare the crap out of some little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolute charm.  My hunch is at auction, this could easily bring 2000.  OK, that's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're calling for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this moment brought to you by my friends at Audible.  We'll be back in just a moment with our great panel.  Mark Millian from the Los Angeles Times,  John C.  Dvorak from Channel Dvorak dot com and a bunch of great podcasts.  And of course, Molly Wood from CNET.  She's back on Buzz Out Loud and has her own page of rants  at CNET dot com slash Molly Dash Rants.  You know, audible, I've talked about I talk about audible a lot.  I'm sure you know what I'm talking about when I say audible dot com.  It's a great place to go to get audio books.  You guys seen Shutter Island yet?  The new Scorsese movie?  Can't wait to see it.  Have you seen you won't go because it's too scary.  Well, you don't have to bring Eli.  You could go by yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'm a bigger chicken than Eli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait to see it.  I'm so excited.  But you know what I always do before I go see a movie  is I check audible dot com because I love listening to the book first.  Now, especially because listening is a little bit more of a visual,  believe it or not, visual thing than reading.  It doesn't. It's kind of counterintuitive.  But when I'm listening to a book, I feel like I'm in it.  I'm living it. It's very much like a motion picture.  And I hate to spoil the book by seeing the movie first.  So this is the recommendation of the week.  You can get this book free.  Let's just listen to a little bit of Shutter Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They planned it survived peach and pear and chokeberry,  but no longer bore fruit.  And the night winds often came howling into that valley and screeched like cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tom Stetshult is reading it.  He's one of their best readers.  Dennis Lehaen wrote the book.  I'm telling you, you listen to this and you will get chills.  How do you do it? You get it free by going to audible dot com slash tweet.  A U D I B L E dot com slash  twit buzz is making that noise.  I'm sorry about that. Let me let me turn off buzz audible dot com slash twit.  No, I'm sorry. Twit, too. You get two books.  We're going to do the. Yeah, that's right.  Let's do the gold plan on the gold plan.  You get I'm sorry.  The platinum plan, you get two books a month and the first two are free.  You can cancel it any time and keep them.  He's got another book, Dennis Lehaen, called The Given Day.  I would get this one first and listen.  You know, you have a month to use the credits.  Shutter Island, our pick of the week.  Go to audible dot com slash twit to get two free books.  iPod, iPhone, Zune, Kindle plays on most electronic devices.  But if you go to the device center at audible dot com,  you can see if it'll work on your device.  I think you're going to love it.  I listen all the time. Audible dot com slash twit, too.  We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.  Look at John Seast.  He thinks that looks like Veronica Lake.  That doesn't look like Veronica Lake.  It doesn't even look like June Cleaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't look like, it's just a round free head.  It doesn't look like anybody.  Kind of looks like that pig, actually.  That was scary.  We got to keep track of that pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Worth two thousand dollars.  If you get a direct message on Twitter today that says,  LOL, is this you?  And has a link to a site.  The site is bzpharma.net.  Do not click the link.  Do not click the link.  Twitter, once again, subject to malware.  It puts up a fake Twitter login page.  And you know, I almost fell for this.  I actually, somebody sent me,  and because I, you know,  it's not unusual for me to be on the Internet  in a video doing something stupid.  Somebody sent me, I thought, a direct message saying,  was this you in the video?  And I clicked the link and I got a Twitter login page.  And if you don't think about it,  you might just say, oh, Twitter is always doing this.  And login, well, you would, of course,  giving your credentials to somebody else  because it isn't twitter.com sending that login page.  That's how this works and that's how it spreads.  Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  You never answer your email,  but I find it peculiar that because somebody sent you  what perhaps is a video of you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  Okay, I'm an egotist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying?  And what is that picture of you with a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  floating around the Internet?  That's a picture of me with a camera.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not staged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, these things are staged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw Leo bouncing on the ball.  It's because he didn't catch him last time  falling down on the camera  because he knew he'd get like 1 million hits.  So I was hoping I'd fall again.  Is that what you're saying?  I am now hoping that you're saying,  Is that what you're saying?  I am now accusing you of that yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Lord, John.  What kind of cynical media manipulator do you think I am?  That's what I said.  That kind, huh?  Let me see if I can find the picture of me with a camera.  It was just a picture.  It was an innocent picture of me.  Oh, please.  What are you talking about?  It was just...  It was an innocent picture of me and my camera.  Now I admit for those with dirty minds  it might be the kind of thing,  let's say Apple would ban from the iPhone,  but I don't think there's anything offensive about it.  But it is the pencil in the school district

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  would totally be behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I could see I'd be called  into the vice principal's office for sure if I had that.  I can't find it.  It must've been banned from...  Oh no, here it is.  It's just me and my camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all.  Oh, honey, really?  What?  You guys have...  Let me go find that picture actually.  Where was that?  It was just so silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the look on your face that gives it away  that you set it up.  No, it's a setup.  I know what I'm doing.  That's not a look you normally have  unless you're putting something out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might've also had something to do, John,  with the buzz comment that I put in there  that said they say it's not the camera,  it's the photographer.  I say it's not the photographer, it's the lens.  Yeah, well, definitely a nice lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we know that this right here  has been a perfect demonstration  of how social engineering works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And social hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just for fun, but you know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why it works so well for them to send out a link  that says like, oh my gosh, this is a picture of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the joke of it, Molly, is that Leo paid me  an extra hundred bucks to bring this topic up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no, this is how you get 10,000 followers  on BuzzFriends.  No, so I buzzed that.  I thought it was funny.  I buzzed it.  I thought it was funny.  What's really funny...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a casual seductive knee on the trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's rakish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's rakish.  So what I thought was funny is that most of the people  on there go, ha ha ha, is that a camera in your pocket  or whatever, they get the joke.  But a couple of people go, oh yeah,  is that a 70 to 200 Canon L lens?  Do you use the 2X extender with that?  Some people just, no sense of irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I call that the literal internet.  I'm surprised that you didn't have someone who was like,  dude, did you know that that camera lens  is totally in your pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised you're right.  And I haven't gone through all 121 comments yet, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, someone is in there.  Someone from the literal net is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're exactly right.  Boy, I'm so glad you coined that phrase, Molly.  Thank you.  There is this, there are,  it's just probably a small percentage of people.  Maybe people who have some sort of brain damage  that gives them no sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish it were smaller.  They seem to be all of my Twitter friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all, the painfully obvious,  they observe the painfully obvious.  They have no sense of irony or like,  they don't get the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or they're so, or maybe they're just so anxious  to have something to respond with,  but I feel like they don't get the joke.  I mean, I Twittered one day about watching The Hangover,  right?  I'm watching The Hangover, my new favorite movie.  I had to stop it because I peed my pants laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they think you literally did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  32 at replies, oh my God, did you seriously pee your pants?  I can't believe you put that on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeez, that's just bizarre.  Speaking of bizarre,  here's a couple who met and fell in love at the Apple store  and they got married at the Apple store.  In fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he just slap her on the butt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did.  Which is, I think, so romantic in a wedding.  Now, of course, they've replaced the audio on this.  The guys, by the way, the minister's reading off an iPhone.  Apparently Steve Jobs was quoted in the vows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, look at him, he's dressed like Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he is, he's wearing jeans and it's black tunalack.  You know, the bride quite sensibly has her back  turned to the camera and I'm sure we'll never.  The smart one.  We will never see her face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so embarrassed for those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Josh and Ting Lee, they confirm it was their real wedding.  They first bonded over a mutual fascination  with all things click wheel, Josh says.  We got to know each other because Ting was looking  to buy an iPod and I managed to strike up  a conversation that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Romance.  They were both in the place dressed like that  and they got married on the spot when they first met.  Oh, they came back.  Romance.  Yes, John, literal net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Literal net.  I love it.  Is it literal.net or just literal net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think just literal net.  It's just like a truncation of literal internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I'm gonna see if I can get the domain name literal.ly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's gone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Never mention it.  I used to joke, says Ting, or maybe this is Josh,  I don't know.  I used to joke that the Apple store is my church  because I'm not religious and I loved everything Apple.  Ting.  Ting then came up with the idea  of having the wedding there.  And apparently they quote Steve Jobs and the vows,  but those vows have been removed from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like how the note says that it's because  of the personal nature of the vows,  which were not so personal that they couldn't put them  on the internet.  You know what happened?  Steve Jobs was like, uh-uh.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have your quote, my quotes up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The audio was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just wise up and stop loving him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  The audio was on the video before and YouTube changed it  or they changed it to put a copyright song there instead.  And they said do the personal natures of the vow.  But wait a minute, you're absolutely right, Molly.  Steve Jobs complained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not, I'm seriously, I'm not buying that for a second  that all of a sudden it was too personal.  I mean, you had your wedding in the Apple story weird.  I was like. Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no sense of shame there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WordPress is down, was down WordPress.com  9.2 million blogs down.  Boy, that's a little scary when you're on a site like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was only down for like a minute.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was down for 110.  110 minutes.  It was down for 110.  Two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was down, it was just back up like it's in five minutes.  I must have caught it at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know why I got it.  I just wanted to say it was down for 110.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why it was a big story?  Cause TechCrunch was on it.  That makes it a story.  Heaven for you.  Oh yeah.  TechCrunch was down for two hours.  Sony CEO, Sony Ericsson CEO says,  Google asked us to build the Nexus One, we refused.  We declined.  Sorry, what?  Bert Nordberg says, Google came to Sony Ericsson first  saying, will you build our special phone?  He says, Sony Ericsson is committed to building  only its own branded hardware will not be a subcontractor  to anyone.  So there.  Well, that's stupid.  He was wearing a top hat at the time and a monocle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have done nothing but good.  It had been besides the goodwill.  It would have gotten them nothing but publicity.  And sold a few phones.  Yeah.  They're idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Idiots.  They don't need to sell phones.  They have those headphones that'll change everything  about the way you listen to music or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's right.  They're so good.  I threw out my stereo system.  Is that the pig on wheels you're doing right there?  No, that's music on it with Sony headset.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was the pig on wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want pig on wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if there was something to that manufacturing deal  with HTC that Sony didn't like.  I wonder if it was more than just the name.  Maybe the revenue cut or something wasn't quite in Sony's paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this Nexus one though, I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a good article in Market Watch this last Friday  that I wrote about the change in the paradigm of phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he gives me a hard time about posting a picture  with a giant lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying it's a good article.  People should read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should click it several times.  Sex.com's for sale.  Hot nap.  Remember, wasn't this the most expensive  domain name ever sold?  It was, but I thought it was like 25 million.  The original price was 14 million,  according to rumors, $14 million.  But apparently this is a foreclosure  because the people who bought it didn't pay up.  So it's now going to go to a foreclosure auction  on March 18th.  In person, you have to go to get it.  Opening bid for sex.com.  Dollar.  A dollar, no, $1 million.  But I bet it goes for more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an investment right there.  Or it's just a scam to get porn purveyors  all in one place and then arrest them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they Twittered it?  Hey dude, I just got sex.com.  One more story, a good story from the LA Times.  Wait, wait, Leo.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a Twitter auction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get everybody to sign up for your first,  you come up with something,  then you get a bunch of people to follow the auction  so you get a whole minimum number of people.  And then you start auctioning stuff off on Twitter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clever.  Mark, I like this story in the Times  in the technology section.  Bad memory card could be a ghost.  Bunny Huang, we all know, maybe we don't all know,  but Bunny is the great guy who first hacked the Xbox 360.  No, I'm sorry, the regular Xbox.  And Bunny got a bad memory card.  And he didn't like it.  So instead of doing what we would do,  he was just throwing it out.  He tracked down the story.  He was in China for his company, Chumby.  He owns Chumby or runs Chumby.  Overseeing production of the Chumby 1.  And there was a bad batch of Chumbies.  He said they all had Kingston branded memory cards  from a single batch.  Tried to exchange the batch, Kingston refused.  So he went to an electronics bazaar in China.  And he tells a story of one surreal scene of a child  and his parents sitting in a stall cramming loose SD cards  into Kingston retail packages.  He bought a few of them, ran tests,  found out that these were mostly bad.  They were, in fact, he concluded that the cards  were probably produced on the same line  as the certified goods, but using defective materials.  He says that some of these factories in Shenzhen  have ghost shifts.  Rogue workers during their off hours runs a few batches  of chips using materials rejected as defective  on the day shift and then sells them to these bazaars.  Gee, welcome to China.  It's wild. Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kingston says- That's why,  you know, when you see some of these crazy looking watches  that you used to be able to find routinely  on Canal Street and other parts of the country,  and you look at the watch and you say,  why would somebody bootleg this watch as an exact copy,  except for the guts or whatever, like of a Rolex  or any number of these crazy watches?  And it's like, and I've been to Korea where I've bought stuff  where I know it's made in the same factory.  I mean, it's just the extra stuff.  They run in a few extra thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  You might want to be careful about, you know,  buying these cards from a reputable source, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that would be, yeah.  I'm sure there's a lot of defective stuff floating around.  There's no quality control.  Why would there be this stuff's dirt cheap?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even my not dirt cheap HPNV has serious quality control.  HPNV 15, by the way, you don't want to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it weren't for that though,  we wouldn't have the great leave it to beaver Molly Wood.

So if you know of any comics, talented people  with a tech bent in the big apple.  Yeah.  I'm really excited about this.  We want to do a three hour morning show.  Monday through Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a great idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got a morning zoo with a tech spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of a social media morning zoo.  Well, you know what I realized is that I get up every morning.  What do you do the first thing you get up every morning?  You read Twitter to see what happened, what's going on,  what people are talking about, what's the haps, right?  So what if we did a show where we just read Twitter?  Get John Hodges.  Well, that's what CNN does.  Yeah, no kidding.  No, because John's in Brooklyn and Colton and a lot,  I mean, there's so many great people in New York.  Because it's a morning show,  you want to do it six to nine East Coast  and repeat it nine to six to nine West Coast.  So a lot of reasons to do it in New York.  So anyway, that's what we're thinking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make sure you get a place that's got a couple bedrooms  in there for guests.  I don't care about the show.  Let's face it.
