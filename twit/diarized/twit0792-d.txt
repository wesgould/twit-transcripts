Timing couldn't be better for this. There's Phil himself.  It gives you a virtual background you can use with your Zoom calls, your Skype calls.  It's kind of got a presentation field as well, so you can have over-the-shoulder graphics and stuff.  Very cool. Very cool. I'm glad you're doing well with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a...actually it's a little slow this week.  Perhaps because everybody's waiting to see what Apple does on Tuesday.  We are getting an Apple event.  You know, I suppose we shouldn't even spend any time talking about it  because all will be revealed day after tomorrow.  It's amazing though, Christina, you've been an Apple fan for years.  It's amazing how we pretty much nowadays before these events,  even with Apple, which was famous for its secrecy,  we pretty much are not surprised by these events anymore.

Start time: 354.54
End time: 377.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the Apple part is the thing that I guess has been surprising me.  And that's really been something that's only been, I guess,  maybe the last three years or so where it's been consistent.  Like before we used to always get some kind of leaks in advance  and some kind of predictions.  But at this point, like it's now very accurate to the point that  and sometimes Apple themselves have been like the source of the leaks,  which is obviously always the funniest part.  So that's interesting.

Start time: 378.10
End time: 388.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think why would...so they leak out stuff...  No, no, no, no.  There was always a rumor to Wall Street Journal.  If the Journal had a story about an Apple event,  it was probably from Apple, that kind of thing.

Start time: 388.24
End time: 437.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. No, no, no.  What I meant was there have been instances where there have been like  unprotected source code or things on their website that people have found  that have been referenced as a thing.  Oh, yes. Right. Mistakes.  Mistakes, exactly.  Or they will have references to new hardware in certain iOS or macOS builds,  that sort of thing.  And I think in one case there was actually like an entire,  almost like outline of a full release of some sort of product or something  that again was...it was a mistake.  But what's happened recently,  like the latest leak comes from someone in China, which that's interesting.  And I have to wonder if that is partially impacted because of the pandemic  that maybe they don't have as many people on the ground there as usual  to kind of like be protection-ish, so to speak, around leaks.

Start time: 438.08
End time: 572.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they've been doing, according to some of the resources  like Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, is chartering flights to send Apple employees to China,  but also for the most part, putting people on Zoom calls or whatever,  probably Apple uses FaceTime, but on video calls to look at parts, inspect parts.  And this is a big part of the process of manufacturing in China,  is they make prototypes, you have to approve them.  Exactly.  It's a fairly elaborate process.  And I presume by now Apple's making the phones.  Although if the rumors are to be believed,  and 9to5Mac has a rundown of all the rumors,  only a couple of these models will be available to order this week,  particularly the iPhone 12, which is the base model,  the 6.1-inch iPhone 12.  Pre-orders will be Friday, according to the rumors,  and available the following week, as is often the case with an Apple event.  Also, oddly, the Pro, but not the iPhone 12 Mini,  which is I think one of the most interesting things.  They're selling a 5.4-inch display, but that won't be available until November,  order November 6th or 7th, available November 13th or 14th.  That's a month off.  And the big one, the most expensive one, the iPhone 12 Pro Max,  it starts at $1,100.  Pre-orders, according to 9to5Mac, according to the rumors,  November 13th, a month after the event,  and shipping the following week, November 20th.  So you're going to wait a long time if you're going to get the top of the line,  or even the bottom of the line.  It's the middle phones that will be available,  all OLED and all with 5G.  And this is one thing that's bothering me a little bit.  We saw this with the Pixel 5.  Anybody who's selling through Verizon, which obviously is both Google,  in fact Google I think has a Verizon exclusive with the Pixel 5,  and Apple has to put in millimeter wave.  Phil, I have a feeling you would know better than I do,  but I get the sense millimeter wave is available in a tiny proportion of the country,  corners of NFL stadiums, a couple of floors on Manhattan high-rises, that kind of thing.

Start time: 574.72
End time: 594.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's kind of weird how the whole 5G industry in this country has just become just all full of lies.  There's a good way to put it.  Because everyone just lies about it.  Like AT&T.  Yeah, like my phone right now says I'm on AT&T 5G E.  Liar.  The E stands for lies.

Start time: 595.30
End time: 595.53
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Liar.

Start time: 597.02
End time: 609.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the industry has intentionally for some strange reason completely destroyed their credibility with it  to the point where I just have a hard time carrying now because I just assume any time I hear the word 5G,  I assume someone's lying to me.

Start time: 609.00
End time: 639.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like blockchain.  The thing that bothers me is apparently these millimeter wave radios are an extra $100 on the bill of goods.  So you could make the Pixel phone $100 less.  You could make each of these iPhones $100 less.  You're paying a premium for a feature you probably will never have access to.  Or if you do, it'll be for a limited time.  That's really disappointing to me.  But I guess that maybe some of this is because all of these phones will be sold in China where 5G is more available.  I'm not sure.  It just seems like almost a tax.  The 5G tax on users.

Start time: 643.68
End time: 655.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it might be, you know, it may increase the cost of the bill of materials,  but having fewer SKUs may decrease the overall cost of everything.  So it's not actually clear that it would be cheaper if we needed to have multiple versions some with and some without.

Start time: 656.64
End time: 680.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they do have, I mean, this is unusual for Apple to announce.  If this is the case, again, it's just a rumor, four phones at one time.  They've had good success with an iPhone SE, which they would update every few years.  Those have always been very popular. That's the less expensive iPhone.  And then they'd have like a base model and a big model.  But four phones in one.  I can't remember them doing that any time in the past.  So they do.

Start time: 680.57
End time: 681.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one of them is going to be transparent?

Start time: 682.33
End time: 728.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None of them.  Thank you, Robert Scoble.  None of them.  He still owes me dinner for that.  That bum prediction for two or three years ago.  All OLED.  Apple is finally moving to all OLED.  Just when the world is about to move to mini LED, I don't know what even Apple's moving to mini LED for its computers.  All OLED. New colors.  The mini will come in red, white and blue, as well as black and green.  So will the 12.  You'll get gold and silver on the pros, as well as graphite and blue.  So colors are...  Whenever I see colors in a phone, it tells me that the new features are not enough to distinguish it from last year's models.  So they have to do something.  How dare you?

Transcript:  Rose gold was a feature.

Start time: 734.72
End time: 760.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There isn't much to tout on this.  I presume they'll use the A14 chip they have in the iPad Air.  Anyway, we'll do our normal stream.  Our normal challenge to Apple to take us down.  We do that every month now, it seems like.  And according to Mark Gurman and Bloomberg, he buried it in a story a couple of days ago.  There will be yet another Apple event in November to announce Apple Silicon, the new Macs.

Start time: 761.16
End time: 763.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the laptops or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 764.63
End time: 768.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three events.  Apple's just going crazy.

Start time: 770.38
End time: 812.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they've done multiple events before, but I can't remember them being this spread out.  Because usually what they would do is they would combine the iPad with the Mac events or the iPad with the iPhone event.  But I have a feeling, I mean, as with everybody, that everyone's...  They had these phones in development for years, obviously, before COVID.  And that had massive implications on their manufacturing, which I'm sure is part of the reason why there have been delays.  But also changes, I mean, some of the features that you're really excited about are maybe not going to be as relevant as they were when they were in development 24 months ago.  Right.  Just because the nature of how we use things is different.

Start time: 813.51
End time: 840.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out.  We'll be here 10 a.m. Pacific time.  That's 1 p.m. Eastern time.  Micah Sargent and I, right after iOS today, we'll start that early.  We'll sit down and watch the event.  Try not to get taken down by Apple and the Mac break weekly immediately after that.  Phil, you've led many companies.  Do companies look at what Apple does with its events and its marketing with Envy?  You certainly seem to be that way in the Steve Jobs era, where just nobody would command attention like Steve at one of these events.

Start time: 841.86
End time: 866.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And we worked with Apple pretty closely in the early Evernote days.  And we basically synchronized our whole release roadmap around Apple events and what we thought would be important to them.  We used to play Apple bingo in the office where we would distribute bingo cards for what we thought they would announce.  It was a significant part portion of our own planning.  It was nerd Christmas, right?

Start time: 867.04
End time: 884.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's some of that still hangs out.  But without Steve, by the way, 11th anniversary of his passing last week, without Steve around, it's not nearly as exciting as it used to be.  However, you can't say that Apple is not a juggernaut.  You think it's as exciting as it was?

Start time: 885.14
End time: 916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think like WWDC this year was the best one they've ever had in terms of like just from the from an audience perspective.  I think Apple is great. Love WWDC.  And they were the first company to kind of come out and say, like, well, let's not whine about how it has to be virtual.  So it's not going to be quite as good as the in-person events.  It was just better. Let's make it better.  Yeah, I've been to most of the in-person events and Apple said for WWDC 2020, we're just going to make it better than it's ever been.  And they did it. Yeah.  So it's kind of amazing. So, yeah, I think I think in many ways it's more significant than it was before.

Start time: 916.62
End time: 972.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From the point of view of end users for sure, but also for the press, having the time to carefully craft these videos seems to have benefited Apple quite a bit.  I think that a lot of us are saying, you know, you should just keep doing it this way, Apple.  It's funny because Google, I don't know what's going on.  We talked about this last week.  Google, like it said, we're not going to do I.O.  It's just it's it's too much trouble.  And so they not only did they delay it, they canceled it.  No, not only in no in-person, no video, nothing.  And then this last Google event, and actually the Pixel 5 was the most unkind way to put it would be relaxed.  It was the most kind of laid back presentation I've ever seen.  And they barely spent two minutes on the on the Pixel 5.  It feels like Google's just not has lost the thread.  They're just not that interested anymore.  Well, it's hard. Go ahead, Christina.

Start time: 973.04
End time: 977.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say it's difficult.  I mean, I can only speak from the perspective of I've you know, I worked with Microsoft.

Start time: 977.12
End time: 981.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Microsoft's doing a good job on the Microsoft events.  I really have enjoyed those. Yeah.

Start time: 981.04
End time: 992.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. And I mean, and I've worked on Microsoft Build.  I worked on Ignite.  And, you know, I definitely think that I'm just saying I can understand like it's difficult.  Like if it's not something, especially the events.  Yeah, but Google's a big company.

Start time: 993.12
End time: 995.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft could do it.  Google's going.

Start time: 996.14
End time: 1042.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would say even though Google's a massive company, I don't know how important events have historically been to them as like a core competency.  Whereas Apple events have always been like a really known thing for them.  You know, WWDC is a known thing.  Their iPhone events are a known thing.  With us, with shows like Build and Ignite, those are really big like shows that we and we have lots of other events throughout the year too.  And I'm certainly not trying to say that Google doesn't do other events, but I owe so much of it, like at least traditionally was about kind of the live spectacle that I can understand that having to figure out how you're going to transition that could be difficult.  And maybe they just decided it wasn't worth the investment.  I do agree with you, though, that the the pixel events was interesting.  Right. Yeah.

Start time: 1044.30
End time: 1051.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, probably really hard to get excited about a new phone and selling a new phone right now because the phone would also.

Start time: 1051.20
End time: 1055.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you don't, how could you?  I mean, then customers aren't either.

Start time: 1056.22
End time: 1075.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, maybe they're just putting out too many new phones too frequently.  My 10 finally died a couple of months ago and I had to get an 11 and we knew that the 12 would be coming hard on the heels of that because I had to get an 11.  Right. So I knew as I was buying the thing, oh, the new one will be here in a matter of months.

Start time: 1076.00
End time: 1081.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sure enough, but did you feel bad because you had to buy what will be an obsolete phone?

Start time: 1082.00
End time: 1090.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I still feel like I'm living in the future.  There is no way that I'm using all the features of this phone.  I'm probably using 10 percent of the features of this phone.

Start time: 1092.00
End time: 1106.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's an easy fix for Google for this to reinsert excitement into their shows.  I suggested this before.  They need to start pronouncing it as Google.  Just do the mental experiment.  The new Google.

Start time: 1108.02
End time: 1118.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we need to do.  It sounds like a nice Italian company.  Maybe they should be making typewriters.  Google.  The company can say Google.

Start time: 1118.37
End time: 1120.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just the event.  It's not Google.  It's Google.

Start time: 1121.30
End time: 1125.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you wanted to change the name of the company.  Now that I would find just Google.  Google.

Start time: 1126.00

Transcript:  Google I.O. is the world's most boring event.  It's so close to greatness.

Start time: 1130.00
End time: 1173.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So close, Google I.O.  I love it.  Well, you get, Christina, you get a little bit of a pass from the House of Representatives.  For some reason, Microsoft left out of this.  But we're going to talk a little bit about the congressional report that came out this  week after an 18 month investigation.  They've talked to everybody.  They got a lot of evidence, a lot of emails, and they came out with a 450 page report condemning  big tech and saying we probably ought to break up Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple.  They didn't mention Microsoft.  Did you feel left out a little bit?

Start time: 1174.24
End time: 1189.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, it was interesting because I did actually do a search for Microsoft.  If you do a search in the document, it's like mentioned 400 times.  But not as one of the focus things.  It's interesting, though, because a lot of the things that are cited were the Justice  Department case.  Yeah.

Start time: 1190.02
End time: 1194.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, like you've been through it already.  So we don't have to bother you again.  That was sort of the interesting thing.

Start time: 1195.24
End time: 1266.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm obviously not a lawyer, but this is the thing that I think to me is kind of instructive  about this is that we've kind of gone through this before.  And I think that at least the cynical part of me is going regardless of whether or not  it would be even feasible to split some of these companies up.  Like taking that aside, let's pretend that it is and it might not be in some circumstances  the way that they would want to.  But let's pretend that it would be like the cynical part of me doesn't think that it's  likely in the slightest for lots of reasons.  But the biggest one being that when there was a Justice Department investigation and  to be clear, this is not a Justice Department investigation.  This is just Congress basically wanting to maybe push the Justice Department to take  action.  What wound up happening was a settlement and most of it was overturned.  And so it obviously had a massive impact on Microsoft as a company and I think changed  the way that they've done business going on.  I think had a massive change on their trajectory in terms of maybe slowing certain things  down or certain things happened that maybe wouldn't have happened if that trial hadn't  happened and if that settlement hadn't happened.  But ultimately the company remained intact.  And 20 years later, it did not break them up.

Start time: 1268.40
End time: 1269.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were some who said it didn't break them up.

Start time: 1270.22
End time: 1300.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And 20 years later, they're mentioned repeatedly in this report, but not as the subject as  one of the companies being targeted, which is interesting.  So the cynical part of me kind of says, even if you accept the idea that these are things  that should be done and it's feasible for this to happen, I don't actually think that  we will see these big companies split up, at least not the way that people might envision  it being split up.

Start time: 1301.10
End time: 1377.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to take a little break because I do want to get deeper into this and thank goodness  we have an actual attorney present so you can analyze this a little bit better for us.  But the House Committee on the Judiciary's Headed Trust Subcommittee finally came out  with this very long report, a report that was not, by the way, bipartisan as we thought  it would be initially.  It was a report from the Democrats.  Republicans would not sign on to it because they didn't like the idea of breaking these  companies up, which is a kind of traditional Republican point of view.  And they didn't like the fact that it didn't mention censorship of conservative voices,  which apparently was a big issue for some of them, particularly Jim Jordan and Matt  Gates and people like that.  But we will take a break and give you a chance to get your thoughts together.  And maybe if you want, we'll give you a minute to read the 450 page report.  I actually went through it on this week in Google almost page by page.  It was gripping, gripping.  We'll do that in just a second.  Denise Howells here.  It's great to have you, Denise, from This Week in Law.  Phil Libbon, one of the CEOs of Evernote, almost creator of Evernote, creator of Hattie  of Evernote, creator of half of Evernote.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you as it often is by our friends who put me to sleep.  Casper.  Now this is a case where you really do want to get nice and quiet and sleepy and not too  over agitated.  Every time you go to bed, you're going to spend hours, a third of your day in bed.  You ought to have a great mask mattress.  You've all heard of Casper.  You know, I've talked about Casper.  There I am with my brand new Casper King size mattress.  Look at that in the surprisingly compact box.  They are the sleep company with outrageously comfortable products at far less than outrageous prices.  From award winning mattresses to pillows and sheets and duvets, Casper is transforming the way we sleep once.  News at a time.  Oh, I love our Casper mattress.  We I use the Casper pillows.  We had a Casper dog bed.  They have bedding bed frames.  Yes, dog beds, everything you need to build the bed of your dreams.  Every Casper mattress is designed with one thing in mind to react and adapt to your body all night long inside.  Precisely.  I counted them.  One thousand five hundred one perforations to create a cooling system so effective you won't even notice it.  But sleeping cool is so important.  Only Casper mattresses are made with eighty six supportive gel pods.  So they align to your spine, eliminate aches and pains together.  It's the cooling, supportive comfort you need for the most refreshing feeling come morning.  And one of the ways that Casper works is it's you don't have to go to a showroom.  You know, those mattress showrooms double the price of your mattress.  So Casper saves you a ton of money.  And instead of trying a mattress in the showroom for a few minutes, you can try it for a hundred nights risk free.  They're risk free sleep on it trial with free shipping and painless returns to the U.S. and Canada.  But you know what?  They're never going to get my Casper out of my hands.  I love my Casper mattress.  Twenty thousand reviews on Casper, Amazon and Google.  An average of four point eight stars.  Casper is easily becoming the Internet's favorite mattress.  And now with zero percent APR financing options, there's no reason not to try a Casper tonight.  It really is fantastic.  It's almost as if they were planning for this thing.  You know, someday people won't be able to go to a mattress store, but they'll want a really good night's sleep.  We'll be there for them.  Casper.com slash twit one.  If you'd go to that special address, that would help us.  So they know you saw it here.

Transcript:  I cannot claim to have read the 450 page report.  I think it's funny that your lead in is the Casper ad because are you trying to suggest that the national antitrust findings are sleep inducing?  Oh, Lord.  I would beg to differ.  I would beg to differ.  And I think that the point that that you and Christina were making about Microsoft is not just interesting, but actually super important and a good sort of I don't know overview gloss on considering all this is when you go back and remember that Microsoft was under Microsoft or sorry, antitrust scrutiny from 1990 through 2002.  12 years.  Yeah.  So it just dragged on.  And now they're not even the mentions in the report are referencing all that past stuff we learned about going after a tech giant in antitrust proceedings.  And and they're so it reminds me of most of all is that famous quote from Ferris Bueller that life moves pretty fast.  And if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.  I feel like in this industry, life moves very fast and life has moved quite fast for Microsoft and they are not no longer an antitrust threat as far as Congress is concerned.  And if they looked around a little while, they might find that Google and or Facebook and or Apple and or Amazon might be less of a threat a little ways down the road to I'm in some very fluid kind of business.  Does anyone really feel that Facebook is going to be the be all and end all of social networking, say 12 years from now?  I don't think so.

Start time: 1739.56
End time: 1782.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm going to say something controversial, I guess.  I think that the DOJ action against Microsoft was a success.  And that the consent decree that Microsoft eventually did sign up for which include by the way somebody on site, an ombudsman on site, monitoring their behavior to make sure that they didn't behave any competitively helped Microsoft a lot.  It steered them in the right direction.  It opened up the paved the way for things like Google and Facebook to emerge.  And Microsoft's done very well.  I think that it was actually a success on both sides.  It was good for Microsoft and I think was good for the country.

Start time: 1783.40
End time: 1841.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that not going to dispute that at all.  But but I do feel like what Congress has done here is basically take on these companies for being big, as opposed to being monopolies and or engaging in anti competitive practices.  And and that's that's sort of where I feel like they lost their bipartisan support and where I feel like this could just sort of peter out.  I guess the biggest part of the report, the biggest ask that it makes is for Congress to alter the antitrust laws so that they have more flexibility and maybe the antitrust laws resemble more or relate more to what's going on in the current technology industry,  which they're they're very ill fitted to right now.  And you had that great piece in the rundown on anti monopoly versus Ben Thompson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He quotes a scholar in economic policy, William Letwin, who wrote a book on the evolution of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  And actually, I want to read this quote because it kind of gets to the the heart of the matter.  Letwin says that hatred of monopoly is one of the oldest American political habits.  And like most profound traditions, it consisted of an essentially permanent idea expressed differently at different times.  Monopoly is the word was used in America.  Met at first a special legal privilege granted by the state like your cable company has a monopoly.  Unfortunately, later it came to more often mean exclusive control that a few persons achieved by their own efforts.  But it always meant some sort of unjustified power, especially one that raised obstacles to the equality of opportunity.  And I think that that is a legitimate fear.  If there is a failing in the free market economy, it is that it is possible in a free market economy for a company to become so powerful that its dominance allows it to enter and control other markets, which essentially destroys the competitive competition that makes free market work.  And so I think that that is one of the few controls that the government must exert on a free market is this control of monopoly.  Now, Phil, I don't I have no idea where you stand on this.  I'm going to let you tell me I'm full of it if you want.

Transcript:  I think I think this is the the man with a hammer syndrome.  Right. You only have a hammer. Everything looks like a nail.  Right.  I think that the big tech companies are doing a lot of harm to the world, a lot of good as well, but clearly some harm.  And I think they're looking into the kind of harm that they're causing and trying to figure out ways to to mitigate that harm.  That harm is super important.  I'm just not sure that breaking them up actually achieves that in any way.  I think. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think but I think the harm that Microsoft was doing, even allegedly, and I kind of agree with you that it was probably the consent agree was probably a good thing overall.  But that was like, OK, I guess they're shutting out some competitors.  The harm that, you know, Facebook's doing is much more to do with the harm they're causing to the rest of the world, not so much on companies that may want to compete with Facebook.  Yes. I think. Yes.  Anti-trust is a very narrow lens to look at this through.  And the idea that like the reflexive reaction is let's break the companies up like I I think that's going to make a lot of things worse.  Yeah. I think Facebook broken up into 10 parts is completely not clear to me why that's not 10 times worse than Facebook right now.  Well, it's just it's just like the easy answer.

Start time: 2021.06
End time: 2042.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As then he's pointed out, I mean, the good news is, A, this is not even a nonpartisan report.  The Republicans disagree about the breaking up as well.  B, Congress has a few other things to think about.  See, there's an election three weeks away and they're going to be a lame duck.  Congress, it doesn't look like anything's going to be happening anytime soon.

Transcript:  And I really like Phil's point that that we don't necessarily need a hammer.  And this isn't necessarily a nail.  There are a lot of other laws that are available.  I'm thinking that California pops to mind has a really broad and sweeping unfair competition law.  And it seems like some of the things that are complained about in the 450 page report, by the way, Wired has a really nice 14 juiciest quotes from the House.  If you're looking for a cheat sheet, that is clearly link bait.

Start time: 2072.58

End time: 2113.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking for sort of the meat.  Yes, thank you.  From the coverage I've read of it, and as I said, I did not go through all 450 pages.  But what commentators tend to come up with, having read through it, and God love them for having done that for us, is that there wasn't a lot of concrete example given of anticompetitive or monopolistic behavior.  The complaints seem to be we've got big companies doing bad things.  If we've got any company doing bad things, we have a lot of laws we can use to address that.

Start time: 2113.70
End time: 2139.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I think that we... Phil, you nailed it, so to speak.  Because, for instance, the problem with Facebook is not that they're so big.  It's not a monopoly.  And Facebook defends itself, saying, well, you know, there's the whole Internet to compete with us.  It's just that they have such power and dominance over the discourse in this country that's scary.  Well, not just this country, but the world.

Start time: 2140.57
End time: 2236.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The world. Yes.  I think there's a class of problems that can be solved by restricting what companies do in general.  There's a different class of problems and a much smaller class of problems that could be solved by breaking up a single company.  And we just, I think for historical reasons, just immediately go to the, oh, they're big.  And so they break them up. And it just never made any sense to me.  If you had 10 companies and they were all just dumping cyanide into the water, because that's what they decided to do.  But there was 10 of them.  Clearly, none of them were competitive, were a monopoly.  There were just 10, and they were equally sized, and there were 10 companies dumping cyanide into the water and killing everyone.  Right. That's a problem.  Anti-trust is not the solution to that.  You would just be like, hey, no company can now dump cyanide into the water.  You wouldn't take the biggest one and break them up, which wouldn't necessarily fix the problem.  This is what we have now. We have social media makes money by keeping you upset.  Social media makes money when you are upset.  And that's a problem. And it's a problem if there's a monopoly doing it.  And it's a problem if there's 50 companies evenly distributed doing it.  The problem is that business model is deeply detrimental to the world and shouldn't exist.  So, yeah, I'm like, I share, I think, a lot of the suspicion of big tech and the desire to improve it.  But I think, A, the only people I trust less are probably the Congress.  And B, yeah, I think antitrust is just a it just doesn't seem like the right fit, the right framework for this at all.

Transcript:  Here's one example from that 14 juiciest quotes piece in Wired that jumped out at me.  One of the things the report calls out is that certain employees at Microsoft, not Microsoft, Amazon,  other Seattle company, were getting information about the third party sellers marketplace due to their role at Amazon,  the data they were able to access because there were employees there.  And then they were establishing their own side hustle where they could compete more readily as a third party seller on the marketplace  because of the information that they're getting straight from their employer.  Well, that's not the employers problem, except for those people should be fired and disciplined.  That's not an antitrust issue.

Start time: 2287.76
End time: 2309.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I should also point out, as others have, that, you know, Walmart does the same thing.  Every grocery store in the country can do the same thing.  They know what's selling.  And when grocery store came out with generic goods, you know, unlabeled goods,  I'm sure they use data about which products sold the best to determine which generic goods to sell.  That's called retail.  Right.

Start time: 2312.73
End time: 2372.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to Nisa's point, you know, if other if employees are going to be taking information that they gather in the course of their job  to establish a secondary business that competes against, you know,  That's the employees fault.  Exactly.  Like that's exactly it.  It's like, okay, you know, and I'm sure that it's in, I would be shocked because I know my handbook, like we have very set out rules for how  moonlighting works.  And in our agreement is actually really robust and allows us to do a lot of things that you would think maybe you wouldn't.  But there are very clear lines.  And like that would be a clear line, which is to be like, okay, if you have access to this information, you can't create,  it's kind of like, you know, SEC rules around, you know, insider trading and stuff like that.  Like it's to me, that seems like, okay, that should be about either enacting laws that make people who break, you know,  handbook guidelines or whatever, things like that illegal or, you know, working to mitigate that in some other way.  But it doesn't seem like it's antitrust just because someone has access to something and then chooses to act in a way that is unethical.  Right.

Transcript:  I remember actually when remember Bezos and Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook were testifying via Zoom to Congress.  I remember when they asked Jeff Bezos about this very subject and he said, well, if that's happening, that's not that's against the rules.  And I don't like it. I don't know if it's happening.  He I don't think he'd be too pleased to know that that was happening.  So that's a ridiculous.

Start time: 2398.81

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that there there was and I don't know if this was in the report.  I skimmed the report. I read portions of it, but I have to admit it was long.  I did the same. Who could read it? It's 450 pages. No apologies.  Exactly. And like I have other things that I want to read.  It's not the most exciting.  Right. But, you know, there were some allegations in the Wall Street Journal that Amazon itself was taking some information based on products that people were selling to then directly create their own competitive products.  Yes.  That I think becomes a little bit trickier.  And and you could point to the Walmart example of like, you know, maybe white labeled goods or whatnot.  I think it's a little bit different if you're talking about saying, hey, we're going to create an Amazon basics or we're going to promote these things in the same way to go after this market segment.  That maybe becomes a little bit swishier, but I still don't know if that becomes an antitrust thing because as you said, like this is retail.  This nor nor is it used to break Amazon up.

Start time: 2451.36
End time: 2454.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, I don't know how you would break up Amazon.

Start time: 2455.14
End time: 2478.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing, too.  How do you break up any of these companies?  I mean, this is one of the interesting things that has kind of happened in response, I would argue, to the Microsoft stuff was that a lot of these companies started to form themselves.  I would definitely cite Facebook in this way.  And maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like they form themselves and kind of have, you know, made themselves operate in a way that would be very difficult to extract.

Start time: 2478.55
End time: 2483.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook is clearly doing that.  They just did this by creating a single sign on for Messenger, WhatsApp, Insta.

Start time: 2484.00
End time: 2544.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, the messaging, they've done everything they can to basically say yes.  So I think that if anything, I mean, in some cases, again, it really does come back to how feasible would this actually even be?  Like, what does that even look like?  And Amazon, you know, what's interesting to me is that they talked a lot about its dominance in e-commerce and there was a section on cloud computing.  And obviously it's on my Chiron and I will disclose I work at Microsoft, which is a competitor, and I work in cloud.  And I'm not trying to comment on any of that except to say that although there was an entire section on cloud computing, cloud computing wasn't the focus area of, you know, where they were kind of looking at wanting to break things up by dominance.  Most of their like kind of focus on the monopoly aspect was still around retail.  And to me, that was sort of interesting because if you look at, I guess, the future of tech and where things are being invested, maybe that seems like off.  I don't know. But again, it just kind of indicates like how do you how would you separate these companies?  Like, how would you separate Google?

Start time: 2545.64

Transcript:  Well, I could think there's a for instance, you could easily say, well, we should never have let Facebook buy Instagram.  We should never have let Facebook buy WhatsApp.  Clearly, what's up?

Start time: 2556.00
End time: 2567.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you could say Instagram.  I don't think you could say that.  I think that Instagram, that was a billion dollars.  A lot of people criticized them at that time.  I was all I thought it was brilliant when when they did it.  But it was anti-competitive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it anti-competitive or was it prescient and a lifeline to the future?  Because as I mentioned before, I just don't see Facebook as a platform.  I kind of see it go in the way of Friendster and other things that we've been long farewell to in the rear view.

Start time: 2605.02
End time: 2643.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't have to agree.  I think WhatsApp, you could make the argument, right?  WhatsApp was forty seven and a half billion dollars or something by the time everything was said and done.  WhatsApp was clearly a threat to Messenger and was already an establishment of business and Facebook was already established enough at the time.  I think you could make an argument that maybe that should have had more scrutiny.  Instagram, I agree with Denise.  I think that was prescient.  That was them saying this is going to represent the next wave of social interaction.  Our own attempts at doing photos doesn't work.  So we are going to buy this company that has 13 employees and spend a billion dollars on it and turn that into our future, which is what they've done.  That's an interesting thing.

Start time: 2644.28
End time: 2662.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would Instagram have been as big a threat if they hadn't?  I mean, this is clear.  This at least is a clear part of antitrust law.  Right, Denise?  Is this idea of you're not allowed to acquire competitors to reduce competition and consumer choice.  That's actually against the law.

Transcript:  If we come back around to this notion of unfair competition and the notion that they want to sort of revamp the antitrust laws, and maybe it's that that Congress should do, or maybe there should be sort of a national standard for unfair competition and more concrete definition as to what that is and what sort of practices, you know, I mean, you could call them anti-competitive or not.  But maybe they're just unethical, you know, when you're using the data that you have on your party sellers.  Is it legal to be unethical?  I wonder.

Transcript:  I mean, when Instagram was bought by Facebook, and I kind of remember that day, I was talking to a lot of the principals as it was happening about all this stuff.  I think what Instagram had like what, 13 employees or 18 employees?  Yeah, it was very small.  Yeah.  And yeah, I think I think to say that you start, you know, you make a startup, you grow to 13 people, you have your pre revenue, and you can't get acquired because of antitrust like that's borderline.

I think it's not I think it's not unacceptable to say to Google, you need to divest YouTube, because I think there's it's it's tarnishes the search results that Google owns one of the biggest content creators on those search results.

And that also is illegal.  Well, exactly.  So so there's like, that activity could be regulated, right?

And I think that as a result, Google search should be treated as a very special category.  And in a way, I think I don't know what the answer I don't know if there's any governmental solution to this.  But Google search should almost that should be.  Yeah, I think that should be.

Transcript:  So I think this is like there's a there's a very large number of things that I could hypothetically be upset about that are like hypothetical problems, problems in the future.  Oh, well, maybe if they do this and they'll be really bad if they do that.  And then there's like a small number of things that are actually terrible and actually happening.  And we don't have to guess about.  And I think there's like enough actually terrible things.  I'm just I'm just much more animated by like the actual harm that's happening instead of the hypothetical harm.

You know, we also put stuff up on Instagram and Twitter and everything else.  And there's a whole team that tries to figure out what to do for which I don't know that the world has ever been less friendly.

Transcript:  Christina, you've been trying to say something.

Start time: 2976.02
End time: 3120.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, all I was going to say is that I do feel like Google is I mean, and I agree with Phil, like I think that there is something that's interesting to separate, which is OK, when you look at some of the actual atrocities that big tech can create, like I think of the situation in  Myanmar and the role that Facebook played with genocide, which is a massive problem.  And that to Phil and Denise's point, like antitrust action is not going to solve that.  Right.  Right.  Like that's actually like a much bigger and much more difficult problem to look at.  But I do actually think that Google is interesting in that you can find like Yelp, you can find actual business cases, any of the travel companies where there has been disproportionate impact on businesses when Google gets into those areas and the way they prioritize their own results and their own features over any of those competitors, regardless of like what might have the most accuracy or not.  Like I do feel like in that context, some of the anti-competitive stuff, Google probably has some good examples there.  I don't know about, you know, I don't think I agree with the splitting of YouTube.  I think that that is a bigger conversation.  I mean, it's interesting.  The number two search engine in the world is YouTube.  And I think that there's for a certain class of users, you know, YouTube is their front end or Twitch or anything like that, like even Facebook.  Like is that that's their front end to the Internet as much as Google is.  But I do feel like there are interesting things to look at, such as with, you know, things like flight data where Google actually owns the company provides almost all the flight data that every other company has to license.  And Google owns this and has their own competitive product.  The fact that the Google, you know, the way that they're listing for different restaurants and other businesses will take precedence over those own restaurant or businesses websites or will take precedence over things from places like Yelp and their shopping portal stuff where they prioritize their links and the companies that they have affiliations with over the number one online retailer, Amazon.  Right. Like there are some interesting things I think you could say there that you could look at and look at trying to regulate in some ways.  Like I think that it would make sense maybe more than breaking things up to say, OK, there needs to be a Chinese wall that is part of the search product where the search product is not able to prioritize the Google products over other things, which for many, many years was the case.  And that stopped being the case.  Yes, they merged.

Start time: 3121.06
End time: 3132.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did the same thing Facebook's doing right now.  They merged the accounts.  Right. So it's all one account, one Google account and all the information gathering happens from all the platforms.

Start time: 3132.08
End time: 3177.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. But you know, but in the old days, like Google used to limit on their search pages, like how many how much the portion of the things would be their own stuff.  And at this point, if you Google something, sometimes the first page will just be, you know, various Google blocks.  And it's all done for like the user's interest, but it's also done for Google's interest.  And I mean, maybe maybe the solution is there should be some sort of again like Chinese wall limiting some of that intervention.  But I don't know if having that solution requires splitting the company up.  And also to Phil's point, I don't know if splitting these companies up will necessarily like I don't think I don't think that splitting up Facebook is going to end the atrocities that are happening because of, you know, disinformation being spread and propaganda, you know, campaigns being spread by foreign governments.

Transcript:  Well, OK. What is the difference between being acquired by Google and going public as a publicist company?  Like which one of those is better for the world? Which one of them is less of a scam? Right. They both have aspects of both.  Yeah. Of those things. The what's the negative going public?  Well, I mean, IPO processes are quite scammy, right?

Start time: 3259.22
End time: 3271.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, OK. But but but in principle, the notion that you have the public is investing and becomes part owner of your company.  That's in principle good because now you have to be much more open about your financials.

Start time: 3272.24
End time: 3278.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  But if if they engage in behavior, that actually hurts any aspect of the community, right?  That actually hurts the larger world, which is the thing that ought to be looked at.  But for me, I can have three buckets for this. I think there's companies who are actively designed to be harmful.  Like, I don't know, I hope none of these are advertisers with you.  Like let's say Deal Dash, like you see that on TV.  Right. Deal Dash obviously needs to be legal. People behind it should be in jail.

Oh, illegal in most other countries. Yeah, not here. Yeah.  And there's a bunch of companies like that. And like those are just terrible places, terrible companies.  They specifically and intentionally exist to harm people.  I think you could make a case. And again, I hope this is nobody's personal pet.

Transcript:  Well, just like look into it for five minutes. It's just horrible.  So that's like category A. Bucket one, category one is like these are just companies that are just actively just trying to make money.

Transcript:  Category B are companies that aren't they didn't set out to be horrible.  They were just drawn that way. Like their business model just makes everything like kind of a structural conflict.  Right. And a lot of the big social media companies fall into that bucket.  Yes. They're not evil. They're not trying to be.  In fact, they're trying to be good, I would guess. Yeah, they are.  Twitter is actually doing I think heroic work to really like seriously try.

Start time: 3417.88
End time: 3511.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's but there's aspects like take Google, for example, the Google search product is pretty well aligned.  Like Google search ads make money if you click on them.  But you're likely to click on them because you're searching for the thing that the ads came out for.  So there's a high amount of intentionality. So like there's actually not that many problems with Google search.  And it's where most of the revenue comes from.  The problems come in with their indirect business model companies like YouTube, like YouTube's model is they want you like riled up.  So you keep clicking on links. And so they're just going to recommend things that are up and you get the echo chamber and you get all of the social media stuff.  So even like something like Google, like it makes most of its money in search ads and a thing that isn't actually that terrible.  It's pretty good. Yeah, there's there's hypothetical problems with it.  But for the most part, it's OK. But then there's stuff like Facebook and YouTube and other things which are just like actively doing a lot of harm.  Not because they're bad people. Unlike Dealdash, we're just bad people.  Just because their business model makes it very hard not to do harm. And so that's like bucket two.  And then there's bucket three, which is like the Google search stuff and Apple, where there's things that we can say are hypothetically going to be problematic if they act certain ways.  And we should put in the safeguards so they don't act in those ways. But it's not really a big problem right now.  And I'd much rather see like regulators focusing on bucket one and bucket two.  Probably antitrust is not the answer to any of them. The answer to bucket one is that those practices should be illegal.  The answer to bucket two is there ought to be like significant reform in the companies.  And maybe maybe sometimes it's OK to break them up. But I'm not sure what that would achieve in these cases.

The thing that came up over and over again for Microsoft over its 12 years was its tying of the browser to the operating system.  And people just looked at that and said, no, you know, you can't do that.  You're the dominant operating system.  This is the computer everybody uses.  If you're making it hard to get to another browser, that's just anti-competitive.  And so, yes, it wasn't just being the dominant player that was the problem.  It was the deciding they were going to leverage malfeasance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so I mean, the thing that we just keep coming back around to is, you know, how do we limit bad corporate behavior?  And there are certainly laws out there, you know, that that ban bad corporate behavior.  They can't commit fraud. They can't do false advertising.  There's a whole myriad of things that will get a company in trouble.  But it's, you know, the little individual case of a decision that looks shady that tends to sort of fall under this lazy, fair, free market blanket that we adopt.  And that's why, you know, you throw enough of those at the wall and eventually someone says, and I trust.  And maybe what we need is more of a corporate governance.  You know, I mean, we took such a handoff approach to the Internet at the beginning so that these companies could rise to the levels that they've now achieved.  And maybe now it's time to just say, OK, you know, now we now we need some guidelines.  We need some we need a rule book for you guys to play by.

Start time: 3649.06

Transcript:  OK, I should say, of course, that I don't actually know the deal that people and maybe wonderful human beings.  Yes. Robin Hood is doing the God's work to make it possible.  I actually know a bunch of them and actually like them a lot.  And I think Robin Hood is like I don't think they were even by design at all.  I think it's interesting to think through what the actions are, what consequences there were.  Right. Deal that I don't know at all.  But in my observation, it feels like it's just a really exploitative product.  Robin Hood, like, you know, this is like so far is like a good example of that.  Right. I actually know some of the people that are good human beings.  So far, right. Really good mission.  They want to like make student debt cheaper for people.  And they had this observation where, you know, if you if you're a computer science graduate from Stanford and you come out with a lot of student debt, like they could pay it off for you at a much cheaper rate because you're such a good credit risk because your your future lifetime earnings are going to be great.  And, you know, it's a really good product for people who fall into that category.  The unintended consequences by removing those people from the pool of student debt are making student debt more expensive for everyone else, not for your customers are doing anything wrong for their customers.  For the people who aren't their customers, they're making it worse.  And they might be like I'm not sure. But they might be.  This is like saying, you know, Uber, like Uber has a responsibility to its drivers and to its riders.  Of course they do.  But they also have a responsibility for people who ride the bus.  And, you know, if Uber's actions make life worse for people who can't afford Uber's in the first place, that's also a type of thing that they need to be responsible for.  So I think this is like there's there's a lot of things here.  But I there are so many things that are clear to me that we ought to be focused on.  And then what you know, then antitrust and Facebook and Google, which I think is giving one thing we should be focused on.

Start time: 3753.08

Transcript:  I think the damage being done by the indirect business models, the ad supported micro targeted business models of social media and really a lot of media right now, I think are very harmful.  Yeah, the problem is you do advertising the way you do advertising is like the only way I agree actually isn't bad.  That's why we do it that way.

Transcript:  But the problem is, it's really hard to pass legislation on the first one.  So it's hard to know what to do about it.  And I think this is really the problem is that Congress, I don't think Congress, this is a good parallel.  I don't think they're acting evilly.  I think they're trying to figure out how do we solve this problem.  But I think as you pointed out, they have a hammer and maybe it takes more.  Maybe it takes a scalpel.  Maybe it takes more subtly.  Maybe maybe there are other solutions.  It's a very difficult thing to solve.  In general, are you against the notion of government getting involved in this film?

The problem is we don't have our government lately has not been super competent.  I very much would like it to be.  Yes.  I'm happy to consider all sorts of smart regulations as long as there's like a way to measure it.  Like have a hypothesis about what this regulation is going to achieve.  Measure whether or not it's working or not.  Reverse it if it's not working.  But we just don't do that.  There's other countries that do.  We don't do that very well in the US.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a thorny problem.  And I think I guess my stay tuned is to see if Congress picks up the thread that they dropped down that, you know, maybe we'll revisit antitrust laws and see if we can refit them.  So watch for that.  Otherwise, I don't see much happening here in the near term.  I did.

Start time: 3872.07
End time: 3894.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was toward the end of the report.  And I did read that carefully because they had some very clear, I thought well written recommendations for ways to perhaps amend our laws to make them more effective in this light.  And maybe that would be the solution is to say, look, here's what we're here's what we want to do.  And now you guys were going to be watching to make sure you do it.

Start time: 3895.32
End time: 3945.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the most positive thing for me out of that report was there was a section where they basically said that they think antitrust laws auto encompass harm to not just consumers, but also employees, investors, just the rest of the world.  And I think that's key.  I think this, to me, is similar to something that happened, I think, last year, right, where a bunch of companies came out saying that they're not they're not just looking for this first for investors as shareholders.  They have a broader set of responsibilities.  I think this like expansion of the circle of human beings to whom we have responsibility to not only include shareholders if you're a company and to not only include consumers.  If you're a government regulator, but to always include everybody else is like that's very positive development.  And so I definitely am.  I am encouraged by that, that our responsibility is always to everyone.  Yes, not just to the people who, you know, are either our customers or our or our investors.

The tech industry are very smart.  And I think as individuals, they all believe that they believe in trying to help forward the greater good.  Some people are just in it for the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think I think as as as Denise pointed out, I mean, I think it'll be interesting to see if there is any change to the legislation and some of the rules around this stuff.  But as it stands, I mean, I think it's it's a really it's an interesting experiment.  It's a good document.  I still stand by what I said in the beginning, which is that I'm cynical and I don't actually see this at least in the short term having any impacts.  But I do think that potentially a good impact would be if this were to make big tech companies more considerate about the way that they do things.  Yes.  Which is part of what happened with the Microsoft legislation or not legislation, but, you know, lawsuits two decades ago, then that would be that could be a net positive for everyone.  If even this experiment, even if it's just a paper tiger, makes big tech companies more considerate about what they're doing in the world as a whole, whether it relates to these specific areas or the broader and more important concerns that Phil mentions.  And that could be a good thing.

They had testimony from all the players.  And I thought there was a very thoughtful report.  And I wouldn't be surprised, Christine, if that really wasn't the intent.  If they didn't know, look, there's no way we're going to break these companies up.  That's just not going to happen.  Not with our current legislative agenda.  But we should at least make these points.  And maybe they will.  And it's clear that Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos kind of didn't hear what they said and are kind of paying attention.  If that's the upshot of this, that's a that's a good thing.  They're paying attention.  Let's take a break.  Go ahead.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, we could spend a lot of time, maybe we will later in the show on Section 230 because it continues to be under assault.  And that is a very important basis for everything that happens in the internet, including everything we do here.  And boy, it always makes me nervous when I and even Joe Biden said, yeah, I think we should really reconsider Section 230.  President Trump is currently saying we should eliminate 230 under the guise of this.  It's exactly the opposite of what he thinks, apparently, because it would in fact make it very easy to censor conservative thought.  But OK, we're not going to talk about that.  We will a little later.  But later on, I want to mention our sponsor.  In fact, we're breathing clean air in here.  Thank goodness.  Thanks to our molecule.  We're all spending a lot more time indoors.  And if you're unlucky enough to be in an area where the forest fires, the wildfires have been raging, you know that the indoor air as bad as it is, it's better than the outdoor air.  Actually, indoor air, according to the EPA, can be five times worse than good outdoor air.  And so it's really important that you do what you can to make sure the air you're breathing inside is clean.  That's why we use molecule.  It's not just an innovation on existing technologies.  It's not really a filter.  It has filtration, but it's actually more than that.  It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification.  They use a very interesting technology called Pico photo electrochemical oxidation.  It traps harmful pollutants, even particles too small to be trapped by filters, and then destroys them.  Particles like virus, bacteria, mold and chemicals is not collecting them.  It literally destroys them with light.  Molecule air purifiers are designed to protect homes, businesses, even medical spaces.  You know they're destroying pollutants and providing clean air.  There are a variety of molecules you can choose from at the molecule website.  Some are designed for large rooms.  That's the one we've got in here, up to 600 square feet.  There's a newer, smaller one, the molecule air mini.  That's for a bedroom or a smaller room, 250 square feet.  There's the mini plus, which has a particle sensor and auto protect mode that adjusts the fan speed based on the sensor.  And if you're in a medical office, you ought to know about the Molecule Air Pro RX.  This is FDA cleared as a 510K class two medical device for medical purposes to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air.  Many of us live inside these days when the air is bad outside, so clean indoor air is more important than ever.  That's why we have a molecule in the studio.  We've got one, another one for the house.  Molecule's Pico technology meets the performance requirements in the FDA guidance for use in helping reduce the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus.  Now we didn't buy the molecule for that, but boy, it's kind of nice to know it works in healthcare settings.  By the way, you can, as you see on the website, there's a big research tab.  Read the research from DOE labs like the Lawrence Berkeley labs.  Molecule air purifier and independent testing was shown to reduce concentrations of a proxy virus they used to stand in for COVID-19.  It wouldn't be safe to test it on COVID, obviously.  So they use this MS2.  The labs showed that concentrations of MS2 were reduced by almost 100%, 99.9% in an hour.  So of course, you're still going to do all the other things like wear masks and wash your hands and social distance,  but it is a very nice feeling to know there's an extra layer of virus protection in your spaces.  Molecule's technology and filtration systems have been tested and verified by independent third-party labs  for the whole home and beyond. Molecule now offers its breakthrough Pico technology across a range of products,  providing a clean air solution for a range of environments.  Pick the unit that's right for your space, or you can put together a bundle and get a discount to protect your entire home office,  medical or dental practice, or business against pollutants.  I want my people who come to work here are pretty important to me.  So we want to make sure they're breathing clean air, safe air.  That's why we use the Molecule here in the studio.

End time: 4559.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I did not listen to the audio, but I read a little bit of the transcripts.  The issue, ad issue, is a fairly important issue for the tech industry.  Whether Oracle can copyright its Java APIs or whether Google could use them as a fair use defense.  That's Google's defense.  And they, of course, use them in the creation of Android.  Rewriting the code in a clean room environment, just duplicating the API.  That is really important to how the Internet works.  But the consensus seemed to be, and I've had experience in the past,  listening to oral arguments or reading transcripts,  where you can't necessarily say which way the court's going to go based on what the justices ask.  But ours, Technica, for instance, among others, Timothy Lee writing,  Google's Supreme Court faceoff with Oracle was a disaster for Google.  Do you agree, Denise, from what you read?  I tend to be in the camp that you mentioned a moment ago,

Start time: 4563.84
End time: 4599.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and that's that it's really hard to read the court based on the questions that are asked.  I mean, you can kind of get a feel for where the justices are going,  but sometimes they're very strategic about the questions that they're asking,  and they've made up their mind, but they're trying to flesh out points for members of the court that they know are undecided.  So there's a lot of stuff that goes on in that courtroom that's sort of under the surface.  And it's hard to just say, oh, Justice Alito didn't seem to like that at all.  I mean, we might have another agenda going on.  So it's really tough to say.

Transcript:  Yeah, it could be a few months.  But yeah, I mean, this is another thing I talked about Microsoft being in litigation under investigation for 12 years.  This case has gone on for 10.  And yeah, it's and when you wind it back down to the trial court level, Google actually won.  And that's that's where the court could go with this.  There are two big issues.  It's whether APIs are copyrightable.  Google says no, Oracle says yes.  And that's really the crux of that part of the case.  But assuming they are copyrightable, Google won on fair use, which is a factual jury issue that got undone at the appellate court level, which is really, really unusual.  So the court could just kick it back down to the trial court, make them start all over from square one, even though they had trial 10 years ago and say, OK, you're going to have to retry this fair use issue because that's where we're going with this.

Start time: 4669.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worth reading the Wikipedia article on this because it is such a tangled long and back and forth thing.  It's been to the Supreme Court before and they kicked it back down to the lower court over this fair use thing.  It is kind of an amazing story.  Let me ask Phil, though, because you have good standing to talk about how important is it that that APIs can be copied in software?  What would it what would an adverse decision for Google mean to the software industry?  Would it really be bad news?  You're muted, I think.

Start time: 4708.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the I think the way this works is the most influential book that I've ever read is The Clock of the Long Now.  It's by Stewart Brand.  Yes.  And he's got one chapter, chapter seven.  In fact, like this, like one page in chapter seven, like one diagram that is like the most important thing I've ever read about about anything.  It's called The Order of Civilization.  It basically shows these like seven concentric circles of how the world spins.  And its main point is that like government and commerce are supposed to spin at different speeds.  And it's supposed to feel frustrating.  Like business people are supposed to feel that government is way too slow and like not useful.  And if they don't feel that, then you're living in a much worse society.  And I think like this case really shows that.  And I think part of what that means is court cases are almost never resolved in time.  Important ones are almost never resolved in time where the decision is actually relevant to any of the companies that are part of the suit.  They're kind of at best like an internalized deep learning that we apply in the future going forward.  And so I think like the discussion around this, the fact that it's taking so long, just like with a Microsoft case, like that's the important part.  And I don't know that if that decision had gone one way or the other, it would have actually had that big of a difference to either Google or Oracle right now.  But the fact that the whole thing happened and took, you know, ten years or however long it's been and caused the discussion about what is desirable for APIs like that's shaped the world in an important way.  So to me, this is like Stuart's brands, you know, seven layer diagram in action where it was kind of anticlimactic.  Like it almost didn't matter which way the decision happened to go.  Like the actual lessons were already learned and internalized from it.  And those lessons are that APIs are super critical for the functioning of the world and they need to be there need to be more of them and not not fewer of them.  And they need to be as, you know, as open as possible.

Transcript:  I think back to when IBM created the first PC in order to create a PC compatible, I think was Compaq.  It was Compaq.  Yeah, they sent some engineers into a sealed room and they said, you may not look at the BIOS code that IBM's shipping, but here are the things.  Here are the calls and here are the responses.  Here's what a compatible BIOS would need to do.  And they were able to reverse engineer the IBM BIOS and start making compatible computers.  And because of that, the PC revolution happened.  Right.

Start time: 4879.12
End time: 4960.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sure was.  Although it's important to note there are two things.  One, and obviously I'm not the lawyer, so I'll defer to Denise here, but one, I believe that if there was anything that would have happened from like IBM's side, that would have been a patent thing and not a copyright thing.  The second thing is that that was reverse engineering.  Whereas in this case, this wasn't a reverse engineering.  This was just strictly reusing the Java SDK verbatim when creating Android.  So it wasn't a reverse engineering situation at all.  It was, in fact, there had been discussions.  And I think that this is where some of the questions kind of went into and certainly what parts of the litigation were about in the multiple trials that have happened over this.  There had been discussions between Sun and Google over how they would partner or not partner over the use of this.  And Google didn't want to be an official signee to having licensed access to Java's for mobile, whatever it was called.  I can't remember now.  They wanted to create their own implementation, but they used the same API so that applications that were already written could run either without any modifications or with very limited modifications in addition to being able to go to existing developers and say, hey, you can, you know, use a language that you already know to develop applications for our platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you are going to try and read the tea leaves from the argument, it does seem like if you're going to take the questions at face value, that a lot of the justices had a hard time making the distinction between declaring code, which is a real fascinating way of putting things and a method and process that would not be subject to copyright.  And so trying to decide what an API is depends on what you decide, whether you decide it falls into one of those buckets.  And one of the things that Timothy B. Lee points out in his Ars Technica article quite correctly is Google hired one of the most famous, most renowned Supreme Court advocates who has ever lived, Tom Goldstein.  But he maybe wasn't the right guy for this job because they needed to get that explanation and they needed to get it clearly.  And it doesn't seem like they were really getting it.

Start time: 5020.77
End time: 5043.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as Kavanaugh asked an interesting question.  He so this is over that idea that you're not copying the code.  You're copying the API.  He said, well, but you're not allowed to copy a song just because it's the only way to copy a song.  Why is that principle not a play here?  Does that show a lack of understanding?  I think so.

Start time: 5044.46
End time: 5073.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so because I thought that's because the really way you should look at it is that, OK, if you if you were to copy a song verbatim, that is one thing.  If you were to copy a program verbatim, that's one thing.  But the API is really the notes.  Right.  So, you know, I personally do think that it was a misunderstanding, although by the same token, I don't think that it's in any way reasonable for us to expect the jurists to have a full understanding of all these things.  I think that's what the lawyer should do.

Start time: 5073.32

Transcript:  But I did remember Judge Alsa famously learned how to write a sort routine in Java.

Start time: 5078.40
End time: 5145.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what I was going to point out.  I actually think that's what's really interesting about this is that when you look at the lower court decision and when you look at the initial decision,  which Judge Alsa did, he actually took on upon himself like he learned Java and he learned he'd spent a significant amount of time really going above and beyond to get these things right.  Those obviously were not things that then the appeals court took into consideration.  And these aren't things that we can expect or should expect the high court to do.  But him doing that, I do really think was commendable on lots of levels because he really went above and beyond to understand the issues.  But to Timothy Lee's point and to just say what Denise said, based on my listening to the hearing, yeah, it really did strike me as thinking, I don't know if you got if you had the right guy for this.  You had a really experienced lawyer, but I don't know if you had the right guy for this because this is frankly not just a very technical argument, but it's also really tricky on like there.  It's technical in multiple ways. It's technical from like the actual level, but it's also like there are a lot of technicalities about what you're trying to express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, right. Because, yeah, I mean, I think it was Breyer who brought up the QWERTY example, which is a good one to bring up.  And that did kind of, but it's like your lawyer should be breaking this down and making the better analogies, the more colorful things, or at least being able to fight back when the justices are trying to kind of come up with their own analogies to explain why that is different.  And to me, and I could be wrong here, but I hear the musical analogy and I'm thinking that that's assuming there's only one way to write a song, which is untrue.  But it's also confusing the notes in music with like the product that comes from from those notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, you can even argue I saw this a lot of places like that. They're using IBM's SQL to create flagship programs based on SQL.  Yeah. I mean, because really, I think this is fundamentally and this wasn't really the question before the court.  But really, I think what this whole case has been about has been about a licensing thing.  It's been about the fact that that Google didn't initially pay to be part of the licensing process and then didn't settle, which frankly, I think they should have.

Start time: 5264.26

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, hopefully, I mean, I don't know, my person, my best case scenario here just have incurred it.  And I agree with Denise.  I mean, you know, you can't judge based on just the questions they ask, but given like what could potentially be on the line here, I hope they punt and they just like, you know,  bump it down to, you know, either affirming or rejecting the lower courts opinion.  But don't make any decisions on like the actual questions, because if the response were instead basically say that, you know, you can you can copyright APIs.  I don't think that's a good thing. I don't think that's a good thing for the industry at all.  Yeah. And I actually think it could be really interesting against the backdrop of the antitrust discussion.

Start time: 5343.63
End time: 5462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think there's a difference here between what I want the world to be like and how the law is written and how to like bend, you know, how to like bend the current issues into the current law.  I'm very clear that like APIs ought to be interoperable.  Things should not be forced to be different just for the sake of being different.  That regardless of how this decision goes, it's like the realistic worst case scenario is that it just adds additional complexity, because now you just need to have more translation layers between APIs and you'll have to make them different just for the sake of getting around this law.  And all of that is going to get automated anyway, so it won't have a practical effect other than, you know, there'll be like an extra layer of things to introduce bugs and complexity and some, you know, some expense.  I think the important thing is that there's more interoperability rather than less and that APIs are crucial to the world working.  And I think like people learn that from this case, but that's not the role of the court, right?  The court is not trying to say like which way should the world go.  They're theoretically saying, well, what does the law say?  How do we apply this law to the current thing?  And they're like, I just don't know.  And honestly, it's not that important to me.  I think regardless of which way this decision goes, yeah, there'll be some additional money that'll pass hands between lawyers on one side and lawyers on the other side.  And then the industry already knows what the answer is, which is more interoperability and not less.  And yeah, we may be if it goes the wrong way, then maybe there's, you know, maybe there's just a little bit of extra layers and some more bugs and some more expense of getting things to work together, which would be unfortunate.  But I don't think it's going to reverse this trend towards more interconnectivity.  And then what effect it has on things like, you know, copyrights for music and stuff like that is also like, you know, I don't know.  I don't know. And I don't think it's I don't think it's going to affect more than just the lawyers.  It'll just be yet another full employment back for the lawyers and all sides.

Transcript:  Right. And the other way and the point I was trying to make by talking about what Congress might do with this and how it might view it is it might encourage Congress to view this as, oh, well, here are large companies getting even more power.  Maybe this gives us even more incentive to start addressing how we can revamp antitrust law, even though we're talking about copyright here.

Oh, my God, I'm terrified.  But have you, are you prepared? WWT can help you prepare to combat next gen threats.  Their team provides resources and the platforms to make it possible.  They've been doing it for over two decades.  They've got the track record. We were so impressed.  Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis to visit WWT back in March was our last trip before quarantine.  And I was just blown away by WWT's commitment to systems, to how things work, to understanding.  They built that amazing advanced technology center, half a billion dollars worth of enterprise gear so they can test.  They can roll out proofs of concept for their customers.  They're amazing. WWT worked with a large health care organization to conduct a security risk assessment of their certified electronic health record technology.  It's something a lot of health organizations are trying to do.  But boy, you've got to be really, really careful.  WWT's consultants use their expert knowledge, state of the art tools, in depth analysis, skilled training and repetition to complete their assessment.  You'll actually be glad to know that 90% of the vulnerabilities they found at this health care organization could easily be fixed by putting in a comprehensive, systematic approach for patching.  It was that simple. But that's the kind of thing you need to know.  And I think a lot of companies just hide their head in the sand and say, I'm sure we're doing the right thing.  You need to go to WWT. They worked with a big retail bank to help them achieve their primary goal of establishing an infrastructure that could prevent.  And if they couldn't prevent, survive a catastrophic cyber security event, WWT helped them reduce system outages by 40%.  And by the way, save the money, ongoing cost savings of 48% through infrastructure automation.  Whether it's endpoint security, network security, identity and access management, or creating the latest zero trust architecture, which is what we talked a lot about on Thursday, the idea that there is no perimeter.  Assume that everybody could be malicious. You could build a next generation security architecture based on strong identity management, encryption and segmentation.  This is what you need to thwart the most advanced attacks.  No matter what business you're in, security has to be job one.  See how WWT can protect your business assets and intellectual property with a holistic security approach.  And of course, they partner with Cisco to give you the best tools to get it done.  Go to WWT.com slash twit to get started.  Let Worldwide Technology help you. WWT.com slash twit.  WWT, delivering digital outcomes and modernizing IT infrastructure all over the world.  They're really a great group of people. I'm really proud to be partnered with them now.  This is a good year for us, the two of us together.  They were much needed all over the enterprise.  Let's see, John McAfee in jail.  Oh my God.  It happened to a nicer guy.  What a story. The DOJ indicted him for tax evasion, of all things.  That's what they got Al Capone for too.  Who owns it, McAfee? Is it IBM now?  The company that owns McAfee Antivirus was quick to say, we have nothing to do with him.  SEC filing with 55 pages.  Apparently McAfee was promoting fraudulent ICOs.  Those are internet coin offerings.  Initial coin offerings?  It's like an IPO but with a C instead of a P.  Initial coin offerings using basically cryptocurrency to fund offerings.

I had to sell for $200 a coin or something.  I did well, but it was not what it would have been at all.  What's 15 times $11,375?  It's over a million dollars. It's over $100,000.  It's good money.

By the way, this was a good year for women in the Nobel Prizes.  I think the first Nobel Prize to physics to go to a woman went to, right?  Am I right? Was that the first time a physics prize has gone to a woman?  Roger Penrose and, I can't remember his collaborators name, Nobel Prize for their work on black holes.  Okay. Nothing to say about that. So moving on.  Speaking of digital currency, I was surprised to see this.  Apparently the Federal Reserve has joined with seven other central banks  to talk about how, if you were going to do a federal digital currency, how should it be designed?  The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank for International Settlements.  26 page report, the foundational principles and core features of central bank digital currencies.  They want to get in on the act.  They're not saying they're doing it.  But they're saying if we were, if we were going to do it, if we were going to do it, the Facebook buying Instagram.  Yeah, this is a good time. Get in on it. I have some Bitcoin I could give you.  So they are for tenants of a central bank currency.  They don't want, for instance, a central bank to compromise financial stability by issuing coins.  It would need to coexist with existing forms of money.  Core features, convertible to maintain singleness of the currency.  A CBDC should be exchanged at par with cash and private money.  It should be as easy to use as cash.  You shouldn't have a wallet with a password.  You can't remember you tapping a card or scanning a mobile phone.  It should be accepted and available.  It should be usable in many of the same types of transactions as cash.  And then I just got a pop up ad from Firefox blocking the fourth one.  It's not that important.

Start time: 6266.90
End time: 6281.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm guessing not because these are central banks.  And the whole point of a central bank is to centralize all the information in one entity.  And the whole point of blockchain is to decentralize.  Right.

Start time: 6282.80
End time: 6303.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess it becomes an interesting thing, which is like, okay, you want it to have all these, you know,  tenants of cash, except presumably anonymity, right?  Presumably, that's not something they actually want to preserve with this,  because I can't see that being one of their tenants, right?  Like, I assume that they want it traceable.  I don't see anything about blockchain here.

Sweden, Switzerland, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada.  Just thought I'd pass that along.  Slack. This is good.  This will really help productivity.  We might have to switch to Teams.  We might have to switch to Teams.  Slack is introducing Instagram-like stories and push-to-talk audio.  So that's great.  Slack is supposed to be for work.  We use Slack, but maybe we should, Teams doesn't have stories, does it?

Start time: 6346.46
End time: 6415.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. I mean, and I hope not.  I hope that's not a feature that we copy.  The way that they've positioned it actually is less bad than the headline.  The headline, I mean, it seems like it would be just a terrible and awful idea.  The way they positioned it is to say that it would be like replacing kind of like Loom,  which is a startup that kind of lets you create asynchronous videos  so you could replace your daily stand-up with short videos that people record  rather than having to have everybody meet it at one time.  That could be useful.  My concern is that by them saying stories, that indicates to me that the interaction model would be like  the Snapchat Instagram stories motif where you see someone's icon and you have to tap or click on it  and then watch the update.  And if that's the case, then that to me completely ruins the productivity aspect.  If it were instead just like you can, everybody can upload a very short video clip to this channel  or this conversation or whatever, then maybe that's interesting.  That's, again, there's some potential.  There's some use for that. Yeah, there's some use for that.  Right. But yeah, I mean, I was very much enjoying some of the Twitter conversations  where people were like, can we fix some of these other things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congress has introduced 17 different bills attacking section 230 this year.  The White House has two executive orders or two proposals.  This was after his his Facebook and Twitter posts saying that the flu is more deadly than COVID-19.  Spoiler, it's not.  So now maybe he doesn't like me either because Twitter put a misinformation warning on it.  Facebook, surprisingly, because they've been pretty tolerant.  They removed the post entirely.  But ironically, neither Biden nor Trump seem to understand what section 330 does.  Both of them seem to not like it.  As as Mike Masnick points out in Tech Dirt, it would create the exact opposite of what he thinks would happen.  Rather than putting pressure on social media companies to leave his posts alone,  it'll make them more likely to put it down because their safe harbor would go away and they could be sued right now.  And it would be a problem for me.  We have a chat room and we have a forum and I would immediately shut them down if 230 disappeared  because I could be sued over any of the content that's there.  230 provides protection for social media, for chatters, for everybody.  Otherwise, who would run a chat room?  The Internet would barely exist without 230.

Start time: 6575.62
End time: 6589.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And as Mike points out, they would have to I mean, not only would it break the Internet in so many ways,  but specifically it would break the Internet in that anything that someone tried to post would need to be vetted before it could get posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the examination that every company is going to have to have.  For every sort of instance where they allow the public to use their platform to post something, they're going to have to decide.  Do we still want to take on that liability?  It would be as though if we use a real world example, you know, a library or a grocery store would have to ask you or require you not to speak with the other patrons when you're there because you might defame them or some such thing in your interaction with them.  And if the store or facility were going to be liable, they wouldn't let you do it.

Start time: 6697.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Denise, would it become a First Amendment issue if it were that broad?  Would that potentially, because usually these things aren't First Amendment like speech issues in terms of what the private organizations will allow or won't allow.  But if there was some sort of law passed with these sorts of things, would that potentially become a First Amendment issue?

Start time: 6717.06
End time: 6732.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It could as to government sites.  That's really where the First Amendment kicks in.  Private entities like Facebook and Twitter, etc.  They're not really impacted by the First Amendment.  They get to call the shots.  I understand.

Start time: 6734.52
End time: 6755.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should have been more clear because I understand obviously that private companies aren't bound by that.  But since the message of speech is being transferred using, it's not quite a public utility, but it certainly has backing, the Internet itself of publicly funded things.  Does that change it at all?

Start time: 6756.42
End time: 6814.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a really interesting question.  Section 230 doesn't just apply to private entities.  The language is Internet Service Provider, I believe, something along those lines and not meaning ISP in the way that we understand that term.  Right.  But the platform on which you're interacting.  And yeah, that could be Facebook providing a platform for a congressperson, say, to interact with their constituents.  And then they can't because Facebook's shutting that down.  That's where courts have said the First Amendment kicks in and protects that kind of speech.  You can't block people, etc.  So yeah, the First Amendment could well come into play there.

A judge, California judge, has denied Epic's request that Apple be forced to reinstate Fortnite in the App Store.  They did say that on the Unreal Engine cannot be, you know, harmed that Apple because Apple was threatening to revoke developer accounts to Epic Games.  The judge said this was actually they had this has already happened in a preliminary injunction.  And now it's been reaffirmed that you know, yes, Apple can kick you out of the store.  Or no, they can't take away your developer certificates for for the Unreal Engine.  So I don't know.  Is there more to say about that?  This one we're going to hear a lot more.  The trial is until May 3rd.

And whether Congress needs to step in because Apple's control of its App Store is a huge part.  It's the primary part of what Congress is concerned about Apple.  Right.  On the antitrust front.

Oh, God, I hope I didn't get you in trouble.  No, no, no, no, you're fine.  You're fine.  But it's actually really interesting.  I interviewed a ton of people in different different industries, education, health care,  sports, e-sports, music and other cities and whatnot.  And we talked about what some of the challenges around connectivity are and not talking about  solutions that might fix it in the near term, but solutions that technology could empower  to maybe solve some of those or help with some of those challenges in the future.

Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a bunch of new stuff.  Yeah.  New stuff coming out just about every week.  I just got to say I got a plug.  I love whatever it takes.  It takes Denise's idea of a world where people are not allowed to speak to me in a grocery  store.  Just stay out of my aisle, man.

Transcript:  I don't care.  I don't even want you in the aisle with me.  I want to be all alone and I want my aisle to myself.  It's the weirdest thing.  Sometimes you go shopping and you're all alone in an aisle and suddenly five people come  and they get and they come nearer and nearer and nearer.  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.  And I'm like, and I'm masked up.  I got a face shield.  I'm going to have to get more scary stuff to protect me.  OK.  No one can ask Phil anything in the grocery store.  OK.  If you see him, just wave, say, I know who you are.  I appreciate your work.  All-turtles.com.  It's always great to have you on.  You're so smart.  You've got so much history and so much knowledge about the industry.  Thank you.  It's always good to be on here.  Our show this week in tech appears every Sunday.  We do the show.  We record and you're welcome to watch us do it live Sunday afternoon, 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC.  The live streams, there's audio and video and their variety of each at twit.tv slash live.  So by the way, if you're watching live, you certainly should be in the chat room because they're all chatting at the same time.  And it's IRC.twit.tv.  The live stream sometimes has recorded material after the fact, after the show's over, like later tonight.  But the chat room seems to go on all the time.  They're talking at me.  They're pretending they're listening.  I'll sometimes sneak in there and go, I hear what you're saying.  And just to throw them off, it's a great place.  IRC.twit.tv.  Most people, though, listen or watch on demand.  We have on demand audio and video available in a variety of places.  Our website's the first place to look.  IRC.tv.  Actually, all of our shows are there.  We also have a YouTube channel for this and every other show we do.  Just go to youtube.com slash twit.  You'll find links to all the individual channels plus twit bits and other features there.  Or search for twit in your favorite podcast application and subscribe.  And that way you'll kind of get it automatically.  We are putting together our best ofs.  In fact, I think, you know, we're getting, believe it or not, getting close to finishing them.  I know it's only October.  But we run these at the end of the year, kind of our holiday specials.  If you have a moment from this show or any of our Twitch shows that you say,  Oh, that it has to be from this year.  But I know this has been an interesting year.  It has to be in the best of at the end of the year.  Go to twit.tv slash best of.  And you can fill out a form there.  You don't have to fill out every every field.  But anything you can give us will help us figure out where that clip was from  and perhaps include it in our best of episode, which will be coming up later this year.  Thank you everybody for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  As I have said now for 15 years in a row, another twit is in the can.
