Transcript:  All right. We are gathered together to discuss the week's tech news. There is an unlimited supply.  But let's start off with the breaking story, almost breaking, about Apple's iPhone and the mass killing in Texas, the Texas church shooting.  Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General of the United States. I want to see if I'm going to get his quote because his quote, I think, is something we can kind of analyze here.  So let me let me pull that up. The gunman's cell phone is locked.  Locked. And here's the here's the quote that Rosenstein gave the Washington Examiner.  No reasonable person questions our right to access the phone.  Should I stop there or do you guys want to say anything about that?  Oh, man. Here we go again.  But the company that built it, which we believe is as Apple, claims that it purposely designed the operating system so the company cannot open the phone, even with an order from a federal judge.  Rosenstein said lamenting only maybe eventually will federal investigators be able to access Kelly's phone.  But this is the one that, of course, got all the headlines. In addition to costing a great deal of time and money, a delay surely costs lives.  Apple is costing lives.

Start time: 460.79
End time: 479.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a I mean, it's more of the same BS from from law enforcement, right?  It is first off, he says supposedly or or they claim that they can't access it, which is suggesting what?  That there is actually a secret back door and they're just playing possum, which is ludicrous.  Apple also pointed out that it was a good point.

Start time: 479.04
End time: 485.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should underscore that word.  The company claims it can't access it like he doesn't believe it.

Start time: 486.53
End time: 515.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's super sketchy.  And I think somebody pointed out, I think even Apple pointed out that they had that moment where they could have.  So you've got the shooter, he's dead and you've got the phone.  He had touch ID on his phone.  There's a two day timeout for touch ID.  So if they had contacted Apple, Apple could have done something like tell them to put his fingers on it and see if they could get it unlocked that way.  But after that, then the passcode is in there and the encryption is locked in.  And it sounds like they didn't ask Apple.

Start time: 517.78
End time: 597.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is exactly what Apple said, though, in the San Bernardino case, they said, well, if you just asked us, we would have told you how to how to back.  He could bring his phone home and would back up to iCloud.  We could give you that data because we do have access to the iCloud backups.  Apple seems to be this position seems to be well, shucks, guys, you should call us sooner.  Well, now this is going to be this is going to precipitate of I would imagine the same kind of back and forth that happened after the San Bernardino killing.  And I guess we look, there is a point to be made that there may be something on that phone that would help the investigation.  Perhaps, for instance, there were others involved in the shooting and those people are unapprehended.  But the phone might indicate that with text messages or phone calls.  We do think that he called his father after he was shot in the chase that ensued after the shooting.  I'm not going to say his name.  You know what I'm talking about.  We don't need to give any more publicity to that.  But there's the larger question of why doesn't our Department of Justice understand that a back door to any phone or any encryption would be dangerous?  It would solve this one problem, but it would open a Pandora's box of other problems.

Start time: 598.64
End time: 671.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the other thing that's interesting to me, at least, is like, you know, first of all, this is one of those stories that makes me say, OK, what year is it again?  We already did this.  We already had this entire conversation granted their new phones out and the touch ID is part of this.  But like I just I a lot of these examples that that were these tragedies that we are experiencing still seem to be mostly, for lack of a better term, lone wolf situations.  Right.  And I think that trying to make this argument that you're going to get information and clearly this information is important in the case.  Right.  Or the information that law enforcement wants to get is important in the case.  All information that they can get is important in a case like this.  But at the same time, it just doesn't seem like you like any of these examples have shown that you're going to actually get that much more from unlocking a phone like this.  And as the security community makes, I think, a valid argument, it's a really slippery slope.  And as soon as you build the back door, as soon as you open this stuff up, it's just that much more vulnerable and more harm comes than good.

Start time: 672.96
End time: 747.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I really wish that politicians would step in and say we should wait a little while before talking about security and unlocking.  It's too soon.  God, that'd be so nice if they use that tactic.  But, you know, like you were saying, Sirus over at Ars Technica, he quoted researcher Bruce Schneier, who was just saying there's the restaurant analogy.  Yeah. Poison all the food in a restaurant.  You may get a terrorist, but you're going to make everybody else sick.  And that's missing the point of the Constitution.  Investigators don't like the Constitution because it gives us freedoms that sometimes makes their job a little difficult.  So sorry, we live in a free state and are afforded very important freedoms.  And that includes, in my opinion, the ability to have high level encryption in a telephone and that evidence can be gathered in other ways.  You know, innocent until proven guilty, prove guilty.  So that's it's I'm not saying that I am super stoked about really bad people being able to more cleverly hide information that could be used to prosecute them and render justice.  But we're in America and I think that is way more important than these one off cases.

Start time: 749.42
End time: 766.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's also, you know, the argument to be made.  Well, what did law enforcement do before smartphones?  I mean, this is a this is brand new stuff.  This this contains more information than anything we've ever had before.  Location and all sorts of information that's being gathered.

Start time: 766.32
End time: 800.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the things they did before was search the house, right?  We didn't have all of that personal information.  The you know, it was just the stuff that was in your brain.  But encryption makes this a little bit different.  And I understand that.  And in fact, this guy in one of his more kind of deep interviews did unfortunately what I what the Washington Post editorial board did not too long ago to which is this weird wish casting where they say, surely there's a way that we can have people have privacy but also have a way for law enforcement to get in.  And the answer is no, that's not how cryptography works.  That's the biggest problem.

Start time: 801.50
End time: 836.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have a fantasy that there is a way to do some sort of escrow or key escrow or something that would give law enforcement a backdoor.  They still have that illusion even after the NSA accidentally released all of its exploits to the wild, causing the massive Petra ransomware epidemic that they somehow could do this magically.  I don't I don't know what we.  I don't know what we do.  I hope this doesn't.  We don't get a San Bernardino Redux here, but it feels like we're headed that way.

Start time: 837.35
End time: 843.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  I've already seen this movie.  I don't I don't feel like we need to see it again.

Start time: 843.34
End time: 850.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But is he accurate when he says no reasonable person questions our right to access the phone?  No, he's not accurate.

Start time: 850.16
End time: 858.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, so many people question law enforcement's right to access the phone.  In my opinion, you know, I think all of us are saying so.

Start time: 858.02
End time: 858.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 859.12
End time: 859.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Start time: 860.40
End time: 881.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I think on the if there were a perfect world where you could you could say, yeah, there's a way that they could get the phone without risking all of us without poisoning all the diners in the restaurant.  That's a great analogy.  If there were a way to do that, I wouldn't be against them having access to that guy's phone.  That's if that you know, that's that's evidence, right?  Fair. Yeah, I would agree with that.

Start time: 882.52
End time: 900.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just I just look I really fear the day that, yeah, like you're saying, something leaks and every bit torrent site I can imagine just says, yeah, all these tools that the government has gotten that all reasonable people believe they should have access to.  Well, now they're just available on any random Russian server.  And boom, that's it.

Start time: 903.06
End time: 940.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also the larger issue of if the American government has the back door, every other government in the world is going to ask for a back door.  If they don't have it already, if they don't have it already.  But if Apple demonstrates there's a way to do this for law enforcement, then China's going to want it.  Russia's going to want everybody's going to want it.  And it's going to be used in ways that here in the United States, we would consider reprehensible to round up dissidents to spy on the populace, things like that.  You can't do you can't you can't do this selective unlock, I guess.  But why doesn't Rob Rosenstein?  He's a smart man. Why doesn't he understand this?  Why is why is why are we having this conversation?

Start time: 941.46
End time: 952.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Politics. I think he understands it.  But he but but he's like trying to do the job that he's tasked with doing.  And he just he's trying to you know, he's trying to move the goal lines.

Start time: 953.20
End time: 1008.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But he's going to whip up.  The problem is that there are, you know, of the vast majority of Americans don't have don't hear this conversation, don't understand.  If you don't understand why it's bad to have a back door, and most people don't, then there then it doesn't make sense that Apple says no, you don't understand.  Why would Apple not want to help the FBI?  What's wrong with them?  But if you understand this back door issue, this math issue, but I don't think most people do.  Right.  So we need to spread the word.  Tell everybody you know, there's no such thing as a secure back door.  A back door is a back door.  I love the restaurant analogy.  I get it Bruce Schneier touring America telling everybody about.  Let's see.  All right.  Well, we'll move on.  But I thought that was probably the big story of the week.  That or sending your nudes to Facebook.  I can't decide.  Oh, man.

Start time: 1014.00
End time: 1040.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is wrong with Facebook?  By the way, I have to say, so Facebook's proposal is that if you are worried about revenge porn,  where you have a bad breakup, boyfriend has nude pictures of you, he gets his revenge by posting them on Facebook.  If you're worried about that, Facebook's solution is, well, send us the nude pictures you're worried about.

Start time: 1041.48
End time: 1043.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why are you struggling to say that without laughing?

Start time: 1045.08
End time: 1047.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do it.  You do it in Messenger.  You flag the picture.

Start time: 1048.08
End time: 1051.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then God, you have to do it in Messenger.  Yeah, that's secure.

Start time: 1052.72
End time: 1094.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then a human at Facebook review it to make sure that it's not just a picture of Hillary Clinton or something.  And then they'll hash it.  We'll delete it.  We promise.  And we'll keep the hash and we'll just monitor all future uploads.  Now, immediately, by the way, as soon as I read this story, Jeff Jarvis, a very smart man,  probably there are engineers at Facebook who are at least as smart.  He said, well, that's backwards.  What you should do is, I mean, that doesn't even make any sense.  If you see revenge porn, then you should upload it and they should get the hash and they can compare the hash.  They should never.  You don't need to send them the nude pictures for this to work.  Duh.

Start time: 1095.10
End time: 1127.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the problem ends up being that most of these Twitter and Facebook largely are letting the robots do the work.  So if you're sending legitimate issues to either of these companies, they get lost in the sea of things unless you're a verified account or some other thing brings your request to the top.  Whereas they're listening to a when there's a ton of wave of complaints, those end up getting pushed up to the top.  So this sort of system where they say, give us this data to put in our robot, that lets them skip out on hiring the number of people necessary.

Start time: 1127.51
End time: 1151.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Jeff said, here's what you do.  You distribute a program to everybody that's the hashing program and you say, well, you do the hash and send it to us so that we have the hash.  If we get a match, then a human can look at it and say, no, that's Hillary Clinton or that's revenge porn and yank it.  But you don't have to send them the pictures.  Just send them the hash.  Run the hash locally.  How hard is that to do Facebook?

Start time: 1152.60
End time: 1164.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would also maybe say, you know, get the an emoji in there.  Get your iPhone 10 down.  It can do all of the volumetric mapping.  You can attach maybe the monkey or hippo face to it.  And then, you know, Facebook can just use that idea.

Start time: 1165.08
End time: 1176.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why don't we just all use face ID to map our bodies and send the hash to Facebook?  If you see my body, has anybody seen this?  Never mind.

Start time: 1178.70
End time: 1249.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do feel like this is an example of something where and we talked about this around the celebrity iCloud account hacks.  At the end of the day, I do still think it's true that the best possible solution is like don't put things on your phone that you wouldn't want people to see like nude pictures and nude video.  And now I know there's some debate about whether that's an issue.  I mean, that right.  Right.  And so I think it helps.  But I do think like this is another example of of of like when a tech company thinks that there is a technological solution here and maybe there is with with like actually allowing the user to hash this stuff.  But I just feel like at the end of the day, again, there's a there's a human solution, both on the Facebook side, which is actually hiring people to to work harder to to keep this stuff off of Facebook.  And then there's a human solution on the user side, which is do not put stuff on your phone that you don't want people to see.  And don't let your boyfriend take naked pictures of you.  Yeah. Or your girlfriend, for that matter.

Start time: 1249.87
End time: 1251.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think most revenge porn comes from men.

Start time: 1252.28
End time: 1268.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, the machine learning thing like nude pictures are probably not really part of the terms of service anyway.  So should they not also be just improving their machine learning to blot out any photos of this kind of content so that they all get just kind of knocked out in advance?

Start time: 1269.44
End time: 1279.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was a while back that there had been disputes and complaints about that because there were nude images that were deemed culturally relevant that were automatically taken down because the robots.

Facebook's anti-revenge porn system.  Here's the poll on the register.  As it stands, you think the Facebook system is a good idea or a bad idea.  Overwhelmingly in order because you had to vote to get that.  Well, I think it's a bad idea.  I'm not sending Facebook my nude pictures for some human to review.  By the way, who gets that job?

Well, they're in there outsourced to pennies on the dollar countries where you just they log into the cloud and go, well, everything terrible.  And then, yeah, yeah, don't don't look that stuff up if you want to feel good about anything ever again.  But it's very fascinating coverage out there.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by The Ring.  They call it The Ring Video Doorbells.  Really more than that now.  Ring is an amazing company with the doorbell, which I've had for a couple of years that I have right in my front door.  I replaced my old ding-donger with that.  It was easy to do and I'm no handyman.  It took me about an hour.  They say you could do it in half an hour, but I work slow.  And then all of a sudden I've got not just a doorbell, which still rings, you know, the chimes in my house,  but attached to it is a camera, high def video camera, a microphone, a speaker and motion sensors.  Now anybody comes up my front to my porch, I see them.  I can talk to them.  If they ring the doorbell, I can pretend I'm in the house.  I'm in the bathtub.  Leave the package.  If they leave the package, I could keep an eye on it.  I love this.  Ring has created a new neighborhoods program where other people with your permission and theirs in your neighborhood  who have ring doorbells, you can have kind of a neighborhood watch.  It's brilliant.  This is so great.  And now they've expanded.  They're getting bigger all the time.  They've taken the ring doorbell and they've created the ring floodlight cam.  It's basically one of those floodlights that you have on the, you've always had on the side of your house.  The house is motion activated.  The light comes on.  You've seen those before.  Well, first of all, these are LED lamps.  So they last a really long time.  They're beautiful.  They're very bright.  And they got the camera, the speaker, the microphone on it.  So somebody comes down around your house, the lights come on.  You can see them.  You get a notification wherever you are in the world on the, because it's all on the internet.  You get pinged.  You can see them.  You can speak to them.  And if they don't get out of there, you could sound 110 decibel alarm all from your phone,  no matter where you are.  When things go bump in the night, you don't have to get up and go check.  You just take your phone out and say, well, who's out there?  Hello.  Raccoons get away.  The ring floodlight cam was named Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.  And now we've got a deal.  The ring of security kit that will include a ring video doorbell, either the original,  which is what I have, or the new pro.  Your choice of either one, two or three floodlight cams surround your home with security.  The doorbell works with your favorite smart locks and hubs.  It works with Amazon's Echo too.  So I actually have the Echo show with the screen and I can say, show my front door or show my backyard.  I named the, it's, it's fantastic with ring.  You're always home no matter where you are anywhere in the world.  Save up to $150 off a ring of security kit, but you got to go to ring.com slash Twitch for that deal.  Ring R-I-N-G dot com slash.  Twitch.  Everybody ought to have one.  And you know, as we get closer to the holidays, this is a very nice gift to give your parents, your family.  Ring R-I-N-G dot com slash.  Twitch.  We're talking the week's tech news.  Apple had an amazing quarter.  The numbers are in.  Is it there?  Not only is it one of their best quarters ever.  I think it was a record, but they say get ready because next quarter's going to be a big one.  Yeah, that's the big thing, right?

Start time: 1948.16
End time: 2006.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like Wall Street is not interested in what's happening now.  They want to know what's happening in the future.  And so, yeah, it was their biggest fiscal fourth quarter ever, which is like their, that's 10.  That's their sleepiest quarter ever to every year, but it was the biggest one of those.  But the holiday quarter is always the biggest one.  That's the first quarter of their next fiscal year.  And they, the guidance they gave to Wall Street when they made their announcement about this quarter was that that will be the biggest.  Apple quarter of any kind ever, which means that you can do the math about iPhone sales.  It's probably like, I don't know, 85 million iPhones.  It's so anybody who's writing that narrative like a while Apple is has peaked and they're headed back down.  It looks like that's not true.  They're continuing to grow.  They had that one aberrant year where they were way up, but the growth is is back in action and they're going to they're going to sell a lot of iPhones.  They're going to break eight.  I think for the first time and it'll probably be by a lot.  Forty six million with the iPhone eight and whatever other models were sold.

Start time: 2008.00
End time: 2022.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I would say probably mostly iPhone eight.  Yeah.  And now the next quarter, they got the iPhone 10.  So yeah, the average selling price is going to go way up, which means the revenue is going to go way up because they're going to have a more iPhone eight and eight plus sales and they're going to have iPhone 10 sales.

Start time: 2022.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so the money is going to keep going up.  The iPad has had two good quarters in a row.  That's kind of sad.  It had been as you can see, it had been shrinking.

Start time: 2030.02
End time: 2033.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a bad few years, but they've had two consecutive quarters of growth.

Start time: 2035.28
End time: 2102.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last quarter was big, but the average selling price was down.  It was big in units, which meant they sold a lot of the cheap iPads.  But this last three months, they the average selling price went way up, which means that the iPad Pro was starting to kind of kick it into gear.  It'll be interesting to see if they can keep that momentum for the holidays, which traditionally is the case.  So they really have a chance between the low cost iPad and the two iPad Pro models to kind of keep the momentum going on the iPad.  And another thing that happened is that Apple pointed out that this is the best financial year of Mac revenue ever, not quite on units, but on Mac revenue.  And so the Mac businesses, even though we just kind of ignore it because it's such a small part of Apple's business, is also back in growth and doing a lot of the business.  And I think they said they sold a record number of Macs in China last quarter.  So they're doing really well kind of across the board after a year.  There was a year where they were down year over year every single quarter.  And then for the last couple of years, there's been a question about the Mac and the iPad and whether they're kind of shaky.  But right now they're firing on all cylinders.  I was curious if anybody has noticed anecdotally iPad Pro use going up just among people you might not expect to see.

Start time: 2104.00
End time: 2137.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because that's what I've noticed in the past couple of weeks.  Just hearing friends mention casually about people, younger friends of mine having to train older folks about in their workplaces or families about how to use the iPad Pro that people seem to be really interested in laptop level size and functionality and speed.  But, you know, don't need the keyboard.  Just want to have this big thing that can kind of do a lot.  So I don't know if anyone else has noticed that or if that's just my small sphere of the world.  But that does seem to be happening.  And that's really good news for an iPad that, as we've all kind of noticed for years, has just been slumping.  I've noticed that for sure.

Start time: 2138.14
End time: 2201.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And what's interesting to me, not only the kind of narrative change, just like in the past few quarters, but also there were there were folks for a long time, you know, be be first or be best.  Right.  And there were folks for a long time that were really like gravitating towards the surface and the surface pros sort of line of stuff.  I had a lot of friends who were who were Apple users for a long time, but the surface was just more useful for them in terms of what they were doing.  And then more recently, I've heard a lot of people who have kind of finally gotten into the iPad Pro.  So I think I definitely think at least anecdotally, that seems to be happening.  You know, Microsoft was in some ways, I think, first in terms of this actual tablet that was useful for business in a way.  But but Apple seems to be gaining on them.  And maybe that's because in some ways, the iPad is better for folks.  Yes, surface revenues, the Microsoft quarter surface revenues, I think, are the most important.  So while I'm using a surface studio right now, but I don't think this is the surface you're talking about.

Start time: 2203.00
End time: 2214.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is their all in one. You're talking about the the surface notepad.  Yeah, the surface for pro. I mean, that's like the last major one.  Really, we've you know, Peter Bright over at ours has just been like, when are they going to do something that excites that sector?

Start time: 2216.22
End time: 2239.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because it's been a good product.  I mean, I think it's been a good product.  And saying, hey, every time it's getting a little better and we're going to include more people in that promise of a business useful lap, lap tab, whatever you want to call it.  Conventional wisdom was that the iPad pro sales are slowing, not because people don't like it, but because they've saturated the market.  And you don't need to get a new iPad, particularly.

Start time: 2240.06
End time: 2251.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that it's been down so long that maybe we've reached the point where now it's sort of back into a normal kind of replenishment.  And also, let's not forget Apple this year did some differentiation of the iPad for the very first time.

Start time: 2253.10
End time: 2302.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was always like, well, it's the iPad and there's an old model and there's the mini.  And this year it's like, no, we have to we have the iPad pro and they're going to be more expensive.  And I think that's the point where we're starting to get into a normal kind of replenishment.  And this year it's like, no, we have to we have the iPad pro and they're going to be more expensive, but they're going to have a you know, you can add a keyboard and they've got the pencil and all of that.  And then we've got the iPad, which is going to be a lot cheaper than the iPads ever been before.  And if that's all you want, you can get that.  And I think that clarity has really served them well, that you can get the cheap iPad or you can go up to the iPad pro and get that keyboard.  The existence of that. You can always use a keyboard with an iPad, but the existence of the Apple smart cover keyboard, smart keyboard,  I think triggers a lot of people into buying being like, oh yeah, that's good.  It can be a real computer if I want it to be, even if they don't ever use the keyboard.

Start time: 2302.00
End time: 2334.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it also would require a couple of things happen.  IOS 11, which gave it more desktop style features like a dock and multitasking.  So but also I think eventually you would expect app developers would start to accommodate the new form factor and provide more productivity stuff.  There's affinity pro, which is a pretty close to Lightroom.  There's good video. There's a plethora of good video editors there.  You could do more and more, I guess, is what I'm saying with an iPad.  And so it can be used more and more as your main computer.

Start time: 2334.14
End time: 2356.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's matured as a device for sure. I added a lot of podcasts on the iPad pro now, too.  It can handle uncompressed audio.  The adding a keyboard is easy and there are a lot of keyboard accessories, too.  There's a lot to be said for it.  It kind of evolving as a platform and not being afraid of saying, yeah, pros in the name.  You can actually do work on this so people don't shy away from it.

Start time: 2356.54
End time: 2372.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So well, and Apple is also figuring out the market, too, right?  It's figuring out where it can sell to some of the stuff, who it can sell to.  And I think that that is another part of this, that over time, you know, Apple has kind of started to figure that out when it comes to the iPad suite of products.

Start time: 2373.10
End time: 2398.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to be bullish on Apple, obviously next quarter, because that'll be the first quarter with the iPhone 10 sales,  which seem to be very strong just by how hard it is to get and the number of people raving about it.  And all the reviews have been very positive. So that's going to be a big growth quarter.  And I would imagine, well, you talk a little bit about it, Jason, in the most recent post on Six Colors,  that at some point, first of all, all iPhones are going to look like the 10.

Start time: 2399.64
End time: 2405.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it'll take a while. But the home button, I think all iOS devices are going to get rid of the home button eventually.

Start time: 2406.02
End time: 2421.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Once you use the 10, once you use this new user interface, you don't want to go back.  It feels old fashioned to use even an iPhone 8. My two month old iPhone 8 feels old.  And the iPad needs to be updated. You imagine a bezel-less, touch ID-less iPad in this year?

Start time: 2422.54
End time: 2440.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there was somebody who did some mockups on Twitter that I linked to.  Elgin and Geskin.  Yeah, they're very nice. The idea that you can make the bezels a little bit narrower.  It's not going to be an OLED screen or something.  And Mark Gurman did a report this week because they're really expensive and hard to get in quantity at quality in the size of an iPad screen.

Start time: 2440.04
End time: 2442.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have an OLED 15 or 14, no, 13 inch laptop, the Lenovo X1 Yoga. And I love it.

Start time: 2448.10
End time: 2496.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've seen that Apple's really conservative about rolling OLED into other products.  And the Gurman report says it's so expensive that they're like just not going to do it.  It would double the price or something.  Yeah, exactly right. But they are going to do face ID in next year's iPad, according to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg.  And so that's really interesting.  There are some issues with the smaller bezel that they've already had to deal with a little bit the last time they redesigned the iPad,  where they need to do some kind of hand rejection stuff so that if you're gripping the side of it, it knows that's not actually an interface touch and you should ignore that.  And then let's not leave out the iMac and the laptops to face ID.  I feel like more than touch ID face ID is going to be the thing that comes to the Mac and like with Windows Hello,  this idea that you can kind of like just smile at your computer and it'll unlock.  And I think Apple's going to go down that route with the iMac and the MacBooks to a little bit of a pain.

Start time: 2497.24
End time: 2505.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This uses Windows Hello and the camera, but I have to kind of tilt it to get at the right angle.  It's not I mean, Apple will do a better job. That's the challenge with the iPad.

End time: 2516.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You got to get it like a portrait and landscape and the angles are a little different.  You got to make sure that that infrared sensor can see you or the jig is up.  So they got to do it right if they're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you guys all use face ID and touch ID and these kinds of things?  Because I always avoid it. I do you enter a passcode, Ben?  Yeah, I'm a passcode guy.  I think actually the last time that we the last time we talked, Leah, we talked about this idea that that actually Sirus is at ours has done.  Sirus Faravar has done some reporting on this idea of like, you know, what you are versus what you know.  Yeah, but are you afraid the feds are going to demand?  Well, you know, it's like one of those things. It's again, it's like I'm worried about the feds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you think about it, it's a it's a like a shortcut, though.  I mean, you Apple's pretty diligent about this.  Anybody who's used biometrics on an Apple device knows that every so often it asks you for your passcode.  And one of the nice things about having the biometric on there is that you can make it more than a four or six digit password.  I do.  Alpha numeric passcode on my iPhone.  And it asks. So, you know, there is a limit to it.  It's not going to unlock all my secrets forever for a limited time for convenience sake.  But I would be much more hesitant about it if I knew that my thumbprint would always unlock everything no matter what.  But that's not as we mentioned about the shooter in that earlier case.  After a time period, his thumb, even if you've got his dead body, won't unlock the phone because there is a knowledge element, which is his password that's involved.  So I'm not as I'm not as worried about it.  But the nice thing is it is a convenience feature and you can turn it off.  But I'm loving face ID because it it is it just kind of drops that layer of inconvenience in repeatedly putting in a passcode.  I look forward to the viral video.

I was just going to say, don't you get scared of giving your your like I guess for me, like I don't want to I don't want to give Apple or Google or anybody my fingerprints and I guess facial recognition that ship has sailed.  I know I trust. Well, yeah, you walked down the street. You're giving him your face ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not. They're not even I think that's fine.  They're not even storing your face print or your fingerprint on the device.  They're doing a mathematical construct that's removed from it.  It's basically like making a cryptographic key.  And then that gets stored in the secure enclave and never gets synced to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the thing is that Snapchat and third party apps don't get access to the face ID system.  They get access to a lower resolution infrared based depth system.  So they're not actually handing over the keys to the whole store.

Transcript:  There's an API, I presume that because because the Apple clips app, for instance, uses the front facing face ID camera to do some really spectacular kind of right.  Presumably that's like a private API.  But I think the law for that to face to Snapchat because boy, I bet Snapchat would love this.

Transcript:  I'm sure they would. But right now, Snapchat is using a kit.  So they're using this like it's not the it's not all of the crown jewels.  It's like a it's like a limited version and they have to go through Apple's system to do it.  So Apple's I mean, that's why I do trust that there I believe what they say,  which is that they put a lot of security emphasis on keeping the stuff on device and not giving it to people who can't be trusted.  And so, you know, that that reassures me that my thumbprint isn't just like floating around the Internet right now.

I think there is absolutely room in the crazy tech dreamer world of making something that is on your person at all the time connects you to your work in your social life digitally.  That could be transformative.  I say this as someone who has really fallen for cool things in VR and then tripped over cables and bulk and all this other stuff.  I just see that I'm not saying that's going to happen in two years, but I do think that is the race right now, whether that's really possible in terms of size, price, heat.  Like there's all kinds of factors, but it doesn't shock me that Apple would say, yeah, we can go quote unquote magical because we've essentially been making the same sort of slab device with a phone for a while.

Transcript:  Lisa Schmeiser will be here next week.  She'll help me.  You know, we tried to do a podcast on Reddit.  I thought it was a great idea, but we just couldn't make it work.  And then Reddit didn't get enough upvotes.  You didn't get enough upvotes.  And Reddit did one that didn't get enough upvotes either.  So I hope you do a good job with that.  I think I look forward to the Schmettit show.  The Schmettit show.  Our show today brought to you by WordPress.  If you want to if you're a business and you don't have a website, shame on you.  How are your customers going to find you?  Oh, I have a Facebook page.  I have a Twitter account.  That's not how you do it.  First of all, they own your page, not you.  You need to have a place on the...  Sure, you should have a Facebook page.  You should have a Twitter account.  But they should all point back to your website.  That's your presence on the net.  That's where customers find out what you do, how to get a hold of you, who you are.  They get to build a bond with you that really makes a difference.  And when you do it on WordPress.com, you don't have to spend any energy learning, you know, web technologies and SEO.  They do it all for you.  They make it really easy.  You could focus on your content, focus on building your business.  The other reason I use WordPress.com, the other reason is because that's a community.  It is there are lots of people on WordPress.com and the WordPress follow button means you're going to get more people.  They make it easy for your users, your customers, your fans to share your content on their social networks.  They've got great plugins, built in search engine optimization.  They take they do all the technical stuff like they have a great help team if you need them.  You probably won't.  24 hours a day, Monday through Friday and weekends to I use them.  I just wanted to try them out and I got some great stuff.  I said, what?  Here's what I want to do.  What template should I use?  They had a recommendation, hundreds of beautiful templates to choose from.  Prices very affordable.  In fact, I used to run my own hosted WordPress site.  I had my own server and all that.  And I was spending more for that than I spend right now for my WordPress site.  They do the hosting and then they do something that I got tired of doing, which is keeping it up to date, making sure everything's working and flowing.  And they support me, which is fantastic.  You know, 28% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.  Maybe your business should consider it.  WordPress.com slash twit.  If you go there right now, you get 15%.  Wait a minute.  Is it now 29%?  It's up.  You know, I want to take credit because we started doing these ads.  It was 27%.  And then it went to 28.  And now it is 29%.  I think we those that extra 2% is twit right there.  WordPress.com slash twit.  We're going to get you 15% off any new plan purchase.  WordPress.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for making Leo Laporte.com possible and for doing a great job making the web 29% of the web possible.  That's kind of that's kind of mind boggling.  Yeah, that number keeps going up.  So Sean Parker, he is the first president.  He's the guy in the movie.  I don't think he did this in real life.  He said, you know what's better than a million dollars?  A billion dollars.  He's the guy in the movie who kind of took Mark Zuckerberg under his wing.  And I think somewhat did.  He had been at Napster, had startup experience and kind of brought some adult supervision to Facebook, was its first president.  Now he seems like he's having some regrets.  He spoke at an Axios event in Philadelphia.  He's currently he's doing kind of philanthropy.  He is the chair of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.  But he said after he left the stage, he said Mark Zuckerberg will probably block my Facebook account after hearing about this.  Here's the quotes.  And I thought these were really interesting.  When Facebook was getting going, I had these people would come up to me and say, oh, I'm not on social media.  And I would say Sean Parker would say, oh, you know, you will be.  And then they would say, no, no, no, no, I value my real life interactions.  I value the moment, I value presence, I value intimacy.  And I would say, we will get you eventually.  I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying.  Because when a network grows to one or two billion people, it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other.  It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways.  Yes.  God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.  The thought process that went into building those applications, Facebook being the first of them, was all about how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?  That's the metric, right?  It still is for Facebook.  Engagement.  How do we engage you?  How do we keep you on the newsfeed?  And of course, thanks to big data, thanks to algorithms, they automatically get better and better and better.  He says, it means we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented a photo or a post or whatever.  That's going to get you to contribute more content and that's going to get you more likes and content.  It's a social validation feedback loop.  Exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like me would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.  The inventors, creators, it's me, it's Mark, it's Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it's all of these people, understood this consciously and we did it anyway.  Kind of a mea culpa.

Start time: 3542.42
End time: 3629.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he's finally sounding the alarm.  Good job.  Way to get there.  But I got to say him talking about being a hacker that way makes me mad because, yes, there's something to be said about exploiting systems, but hackers aren't about destroying people for their own gain.  They're about understanding systems to make the world better or more interesting.  And that's not what he's alleging here.  So big.  There's a single finger I have in mind for a comment like that.  Decrying hacker nature.  Additionally, you know, we all know this about the dopamine hit sort of stuff.  I will say Facebook seems to be ramping it up, trying to find ways to make you feel liked or interacted with with your community, even when they're not there.  I'll say anecdotally, in my experience, it's been a lot of there's an event happening near you or friends are interested in an event happening near you.  They're not.  They did not hit like or I'm attending or I'm interested.  It's just the sort of way of saying there's events and you've shown interest in other stuff before ergo.  We're going to connect the dots so you get a notification when you're actually kind of a lonely loser who doesn't have people directly like you.  You know, they're not stopping in terms of that attempt to take all of the information they have and make you feel like you are directly being interacted with and valued as a result.  You've already fallen for the like button and the sad button and the low button.  And we need to make sure there's just more buttons in your life.  So, you know, he's not declaring anything new there, but Facebook is absolutely ramping that up in real time.

Start time: 3631.45
End time: 3763.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, too.  There's like there's actually a name for this, what he's talking about.  And it's it's randomly reinforced behavior.  This is what you know, we talked to somebody on code breaker informatics professor about this and email does this as well.  This way of kind of like getting you to randomly check to see if anyone has checked in with you, for instance.  And Facebook faces all of all email from email, the Facebook to Snapchat, et cetera, et cetera.  These are all programs that are really getting us as humans to to increase our randomly reinforced behavior.  And it's really hard to detrain yourself or like untrain yourself from doing that.  And I think, you know, I'll also say, like, I think that this is a really fashionable time to be talking about this kind of thing.  And and so I guess the election on fake news, I think that's exactly like it.  Yeah. And it just feels like he's, you know, so I, you know, I don't know how much he deserves.  He necessarily. Yeah.  But and I'll also say, like, you know, a statement like God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.  Now, on the other side of this, I just think that that's like one of those like randomly.  I don't know. I don't like that's not a really helpful statement.  Right. It's like it's just it's increasing the kind of irrational fears that people do have about technology.  And I think those, you know, that's that's true, too. Right.  You have all these parents kind of feeling like, oh, my God, like what what like what do I do?  And, you know, I was raised by parents who are really scared about like what TV was going to be doing to my brain when I was growing up.  And they they prevented me from watching television all the time.  And now we're a night. Come on. Exactly. Exactly.  And now if I see a television, you can't talk to me because if the TV is on, I'm completely glued to it.  Whereas my friends who were who were sat in front of the TV at age four or whatever, they don't need to look at TV.  So I think. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.  Something like that. I mean, I think I just think that like, you know, like in France, they make the kids drink wine so that way they don't become drunks.

Like I do think that that this point about what Facebook and a lot of these other applications and I would argue sometimes me like media companies, even though they don't want to call themselves that right are doing is they are sort of they are competing for your time.  And to do that, they do kind of try to increase this randomly reinforced behavior where you engage with the platform over and over and over again on this kind of random basis.  And that sort of trains you to behave that way. It's a it's a skinner box.

Transcript:  I took an arrow to the knee.  Actually, there was a really interesting piece on Morning Edition on NPR speaking of NPR. Ben, are you safe for my kids?  And it talks a little bit about privacy. I'm going to skip the privacy thing to go right to the questions.  And they're talking to a couple of child psychiatry, psychiatry, psychologists about how kids relate.  Apparently, a lot of parents let their kids talk to Amazon's Echo or Google Home to ask questions.  Why is the sky blue? Ask Echo. And that's not so bad.  In fact, Solis Shen, who's a psychologist at Cornell, says in a way, these devices are great for kids.  They can learn a lot from the devices without parents having to bring out their phones or computers.  But in the interview also, Rachel Severson, who's a child psychologist at the University of Montana,  there are some concerns that kids are very bossy with these devices and that they and that they might be learning to be rude.  And you might say, well, they can tell the difference between an Echo and a human, but maybe they can't.  They talk to one four year old who thinks the Echo is a person who lives in an apartment outside his window.

Transcript:  I mean, that's you're dealing with with levels of kids who are still believing in things like Santa Claus.  Spoiler alert. Wait a minute. What? What?  I know there are studies that really talk about child psychology in terms of understanding what is real and what is not,  which is why television is encouraged to come in at a later point so that when a kid looks at a TV screen understands,  no, that's not a real person.  And computer use and iPad use is also studying that same way of OK, there's tactility and there's some of that functionality in terms of learning about computer systems.  But your brain is also just trying to understand what's real and what is not.  And I think talking to an automatic robot like that is not going to have a clear cut.  This is great for kids or this is terrible for kids kind of thing.  I do have to remind grownups that it's not really a person.  If I'm just like, I'll just say, you know, just tell it shut up and people will get mad.  How could you be so rude? Yeah, so here's the question.

Transcript:  Do you teach? None of you have kids. Well, Jason, you have kids.  I do. I have kids, obviously, but my kids are grown.  Do you teach young children? There's two ways you could go with this.  One, be polite, please say please and thank you to Echo.  Or do you because you have to be polite or none of the services reinforce, reinforce politeness, by the way.

So Severson says children developing the conceptions of what's appropriate and social interaction.  And so if you want kids to say please and thank you, you probably want to say please and thank you to your Echo.

I find myself saying wanting to say thank you to a girl wishing that there was that she would be listening and actually acknowledge that.  But don't you just as often swear at her?  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely true. You know, shut up, lady.  I swear it's Siri all the time. But but here's the thing.  These are boxes that we talk into. And sometimes there are robots on the other side of these boxes.  There are AIs on the other side of these interfaces. Sometimes there are people.  I think it's easier to see the other side of it, which is to say once you dehumanize everything that comes through an interface to you, it's easier to dehumanize people on the other side of a social media.  That's a great point.  So that's, Mike, I mean, is it is which is worse, right?  I think maybe treating the AI like a person and being nice to them is maybe a better way if you're going to err on one side or another than dehumanizing everything that you interact with through a screen.

They have a completely robotically generated voice for the announcements on the light rail train that runs from the airport all the way to the University of Washington.

Start time: 4519.38
End time: 4535.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm I'm finding that there's there's I'm trying to reduce to 140 whenever possible  because I think we all are workers of the written word and understand that brevity  really does add something.  I like that concession of 140 characters.

Start time: 4537.00
End time: 4537.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I miss it a little bit.

Start time: 4538.28
End time: 4595.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like I actually I kind of like 160 or I like to be have one.  I like to have a tiny bit of cushion and the ability to have a link or other longer text  that would crowd out like I'd like to have that full 140 and a relevant link or something  like that.  So that is maybe the more beneficial thing.  But generally it's just people are really excited to not shorten words and to add passive  voice and other stuff that drives me insane.  So that's that's where I come down.  I don't think it's making it a smarter platform.  It may reduce a little bit of the threading kind of thing.  That's become really huge because Twitter really really began supporting threading as  a clickable usable thing in the past year I'd say.  And now you can kind of reduce down and get stuff into less of a thread.  But I still think threading ultimately lets you be a little bit more like a beat poet.  You bam a little bit bam a little bit and you kind of have that cadence.  And I don't think 280 helps that.

Start time: 4598.02
End time: 4622.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it makes I think Twitter made me at least it made me a better writer.  I feel like well you know it just it made me a little bit more direct with the things  that I wanted to say on the platform.  And I think 280 I mean again I don't want to get in.  I don't know if I would get into like finding that like oh it's 160.  That's the perfect amount.  But but I do think it 280 is it feels like too much to me.

Start time: 4623.00
End time: 4686.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah I did see somebody complaining about the 280 limit in a thread that went  on for 20 tweets and I thought now wait a second you should probably there's something  wrong with that.  But as somebody who you know I do a lot of stuff with podcasting and sometimes with writing  where I'm like citing people and like when I do a podcast with five people and I try  to mention them all I like literally run out of room to explain what we talked about.  I just say podcast names done.  So having that room for stuff like that is fine.  But I find when I'm writing them this last week when I've been writing them because all  of my clients got updated to support 280 I get really antsy after about 140 and sort  of like you know I'd rather keep it short and keep it pithy.  And the question is how long will that training last because yeah having the constraint has  been great.  There are moments where it gets frustrating but you know it's like a like writing a haiku  or something.  It's a word game that you play mentally like how can I get this message compacted into  this small amount of space.  And I will I will miss that but I won't miss having to thread posts because I can't name  everybody who was on my podcast in one tweet.

Start time: 4686.18
End time: 4700.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well that would be the responsible way to use it to be concise whenever possible when  when necessary use the extra.  And actually what's interesting that's kind of seems to be what happened when it first  was expanded to 280 it was it was horrific.  It was just everybody was over tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like I just remembered one really cool thing I did get to do was I didn't have to short  a short and a really interesting quote.  And I think sometimes people have something to say from a different perspective.  That is really hard to bring down to 140 was Ta-Nehisi Coates was talking about white hip  hop fans being sad that they can't say every word in a song that they like and why.  And his insight was you know being a hip hop fan not being able to use the N word is very  insightful.  It will give you just a little peek into the world of what it means to be black to be black  is to walk through the world and watch people do things that you cannot do.  Now that whole quote I think says a lot and shortening it loses a little bit the impact.  And there's a way more that he says in the video.  But I had an opportunity to take that entire chain of thought which is really short compared  to all the context he gives and sell that video.  And Twitter tells me that this was engaged with a lot.  People were able to see that full quote and go oh I'm going to look at the world in a  different way.  And that to me is the best thing about the terrible garbage dumpster fire that is Twitter  is sometimes it opens us up to different perspectives in a really cool way.  So if 280 got me there I'll take it.

One last Twitter story kind of a little more serious story.  Twitter has paused account verifications because it got a lot of heat for verifying a white  supremacist the organizer of the Charlottesville rally.  Yeah.  I think that's unfortunate because I think if it is if you know if this is that guy you  want to see that blue check to know it's him.

Start time: 4847.71
End time: 4907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter needs to decide what verification is.  I think this is the problem is that they vacillated between that it's sort of like a reward.  Is it a reward.  Yeah.  Well originally it was like only members of the media and there was this idea that it  maybe was sort of a reward.  And I you know I definitely got verified at one point because I was at a big enough editorial  organization that they verified me.  I feel like it would be better if they just said look everybody can be verified because  what all verified means is that yes it is this person it's not a parody account it's  not a fake we know it's this person because that was I think that was the original intent  was you were just trying to the checkmark meant it wasn't a joke account or a fake account  or somebody posing as this person from a slightly different address.  And but what's happened is it's got a status attached to it.  And I think Twitter needs to move past that.  But of course this is also just you know should should white supremacists be on Twitter's  platform regardless.  I think this just assault in the wound of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say favorite state of policy being is vacillation.  That's what Twitter loves to do.  But it's but it's also I totally agree.  I think that Twitter look to a certain degree the way I always looked at verification is  even to a certain degree it wasn't like oh this person is legit but more like this person  is a they are a personality on Twitter that is known and and they are who they say they  are.  And if Twitter would just like come out and say that instead of getting freaked out and  reversing course I think that that would do really well for the platform if they just  like said this is what we're doing this is why we're doing it.  Take us you know take a position stop just like freaking out.

Start time: 4956.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One of the big reasons the checkmark really came in was because Twitter wanted very badly  to have celebrities are hooked on their phones popping in with those one hundred forty  character tweets.  I mean Shaquille O'Neal was one of the early guys that got people excited about Twitter  because he could just grab his phone interact with a ton of fans and people knew it was  Shaq.  They knew it wasn't some fake account like other platforms like MySpace had been flooded  with.  And from there the blue checkmark started rolling out to media after that.  And my belief and no one's ever said it is that they wanted to butter our bread that  they gave us this blue checkmark.  Nobody is pretending to be Sam Skowich on Twitter if they do they're not going to really  get a payoff.  Bad news y'all.  But but now you know you look on and the comment about verification as a wider idea a wider  concept to me would be you know what could be more timely to talk about.  So right now I checked Twitter and I got a response for this tweet dot TV appearance  that I mentioned.  The response was from what appears to be a troll farm account and it complimented me.  And what it wanted me to do was hit like on it because it's trying to accrue those likes  because that is how Twitter verifies accounts in general is that it is using the hive mind  to say oh we're liking re-tweeting Jack himself got busted re-tweeting a troll farm which  is what we found out a few weeks ago.  So long as that is the currency of quote unquote verification Twitter is in the toilet in terms  of being a truly relatable and understandable platform.  So the blue checkmark has this extra weird weight and currency.  Milo Yiannopoulos is banning from the checkmark downgrading from that before he was kicked off  all the way.  I think that sent the clear signal of all it was the wrong message because yeah either  the blue checkmark is about free speech and about all these different voices as opposed  to this is a it confers benefits.  We get if your blue checkmark you get these extra filters you get extra attention from  the support staff.  It goes a long way.  So I think it's just a major symptom of a really big problem for us to trust Twitter  as a truly democratic platform speech.

It's pretty much just a blue box with a white cartridge and you just have to dip the cartridge  in the water you wish to test.  So you coded the app all by yourself.  Yes I did.  I used to the application called the MIT App Inventor software and this allowed me to use  a drag and drop code give you the status of slightly contaminated safe or critical according  to your water status.

Transcript:  Everything about it was built for the Wii U.  He carries a Wii U controller in the entire game and at the last minute they had to restyle  it to look less like the Wii U and more like the Switch because it's this tablet that magically  shows information while he's on his adventure, which was the whole point of the Wii U that  it had this extra screen.  And so it was a weird fit.  I mean, obviously it's awesome to play on a plane and also awesome to watch someone  else play and I've totally done that.  But you know, Mario Odyssey.  It is kind of lonely, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Mario Odyssey is a way more joyous, interacting with other people very quickly  kind of thing.  It's just there's always people to talk to and stuff to do and that is easily the loneliest  of the Zelda games.  Not as much music, not as many townspeople.  It's sadder, it's darker.  It's a really cool game, but yeah, it doesn't quite fit into that Switch paradigm.  You're not having a rooftop party with Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

Transcript:  Nor are you storming Normandy Beach during D-Day.  Call of Duty, a very crowded game, maybe a little too crowded.  Launch title for the Xbox One X, half a billion dollars in its first three days of release.  Take that, Hollywood.  Yeah.  That is mind-boggling.  Sam, how much does it cost to make a title like that?

Start time: 5497.02
End time: 5633.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A hundred, two hundred million?  The budgets are just going up and up, especially when these companies think that they can attach  continued payments on top.  Whether it's an expansion pass or paying for random in-game items, the practice of  loot boxes and Call of Duty World War II follows other games in this suit.  So the budgets are going up, especially when you have multiple studios working on these  games.  The game has this rolling program to have three different major studios, each making  a Call of Duty game, each taking three years to make it.  The idea being that they don't want to make it feel like the games are rushed.  So they just like, we have the budget, we keep selling them, so you get three years  go.  And then on top of that, they have other support studios that make the other bits.  So maybe they're contracting for the multiplayer battle maps as opposed to single player, or  maybe they're contracting for the co-op and kill zombies mode, which all of these games  happen to have now.  The zombies are very fun, but scary.  Yeah, so the budgets are really huge.  And this is impressive that they've been able to crack that much in sales because it is  very crowded in games right now in AAA.  If you load up Steam on PC, for example, I feel like there's 12 games a minute because  of lax standards in terms of releasing.  And PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been embracing that as well.  It's been just very busy for giant shooting games, let alone just for giant epic games.  I mean, this October and November, we've just been struggling to play them all.  And the fact that any game can still break out and sell that much is pretty monumental.  So especially this Call of Duty didn't really get reviewed incredibly well.  They just said, yeah, they're returning to the old well.  They're not returning to some of the facets of the series that made it interesting in  the old days.  Stepping back in time with World War II didn't also mean stepping forward with significantly  more interesting or fun or compelling story or gameplay or things like that.  But people still want to do Call of Duty with their friends.  It's still happening.  And so Activision is going to continue beating that drum and paying a lot of people a lot  of money to keep making it.  That may dry up.  You know, they they're the company that rode Guitar Hero into destruction.  That was a series that was huge.  And it came out every year.  And everyone said, we're done with the plastic guitars, but they're not done shooting other  kids on the Internet in the face.

Transcript:  So the interesting thing about this, this comes out on the Xbox one ten in the end of  December, end of the year.  All Xbox. It'll be on all Xbox.  Yeah, because it's not it's a PC game now only.  Right. Correct.

Start time: 5679.92
End time: 5766.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's kind of a broken PC game.  It's continued to be early access kind of buggy.  But the promise that they're making is that the quote unquote one point version will be  out on PC by the end of the year and that the early access Xbox version will also be  out in December.  So, I mean, good luck.  They've got Microsoft has really jumped in to help make this because Xbox needs a big  exclusive. They don't have one.  They've had some major cancellations.  They were going to have Crackdown 3, which was this continuation of a Grand Theft Auto  styled superhero game.  So they had to delay that.  They had an epic sword and battling game called Scalebound.  They canceled that.  They put out a bunch of connect ports that had been out on the old Xbox 360 connect Disney  kind of stuff. That's what they did to fill the gap.  It's kind of as awesome as the Xbox one X's.  And we can get to that if you want.  They really need something huge.  And Player Unknown's Battlegrounds cannot stop selling.  Not only are people buying it, but they're playing it.  This is huge for a 40 dollar game because we've all heard that you can't release a game  that costs money and sell a bunch, especially if you're small in India.  You have to go free to play or a small fee or extra micro transaction stuff.  You buy that for 30 bucks and people are buying it all over the world in markets where people  don't necessarily pay for full price games.  So it's working.  It's making money and it's going to make money on Xbox no matter how buggy it is because  the PC one's been funky and it's doing great.

Uh, Xbox one.  10. It's good, right?  You like it, Sam?  The Xbox one X is good.  It's good enough to beat PlayStation four pro a little bit.

Start time: 5786.96
End time: 5835.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is really.  Well, this is a little bit.  A little bit.  Because Microsoft has not come out and giving us a spreadsheet of saying this is exactly  how much better every game is.  This is exactly what you're going to get in every game.  There is a Xbox one X enhanced list.  So when you go on the store, it'll say these are the games that have been patched.  You can go on a website and that's a further list of what will get patches and some minor  descriptions.  So some will say four K, meaning they're really running at thirty eight forty by twenty one  sixty that you HD spec of resolution, which is four times ten eighty P.  So that's a pretty tremendous resolution.  And I've seen that in action on Xbox one X.  It is phenomenal if you have your room set up in such a way that you look at a screen  and go, I notice a difference.  Depending on how big.

Transcript:  Only about eight feet away from it.  This is a 70 inch screen.  It fills my view.  And playing Assassin's Creed origin, not a great game, but a beauty.  I feel like I'm in Egypt.

Start time: 5844.68
End time: 5913.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's beautiful and it's sharp.  But if you're just that little bit further away because you're on the couch, you're really  those some of those bonuses and perks don't pop up.  And it's also some of these games have optimizations.  And when we go in and test, we find, oh, wait, we're getting some stuttering.  We're getting some not optimized stuff, which was the same issue with PlayStation four pro  when it first came out.  And those issues have kind of mellowed out that system.  It runs sort of more efficiently.  You get what they advertise, which is usually closer to 1440 P or 1800 P.  They're not going full four K.  And they've always said that because the problem with both of these systems from a super  geek perspective is that they rely on a crappy AMD architecture called Jaguar.  It was designed to not overheat because nobody wanted another Xbox 360 red ring situation.  So they said we're going to lower the clock speeds but have eight cores and that's going  to work great. And every game developer in the world said, what are you doing when we  make stuff in X 86 or X 64?  We want higher clock speed, not this multi threaded crap.  It just doesn't work for what games demand in terms of a.

Transcript:  And you can't even do other fun, interesting, futuristic stuff like more sophisticated A.I.  Call of Duty guys are still idiots because you're trying to make it look really good.  Yeah, they're going to be dumb. You're kind of narrowing down.  So neither system is going to push that threshold further.  You're ultimately still playing games that are designed for Jaguar and its limitations.  This is not a new generation.  This is just a way to say, well, if you want to stay in this generation, we'll just make it  look a little better on your TV in some ways, hugely in other ways, somewhat.  So for five hundred dollars, this is an awesome proposition for power.  But it's also not what you might think of five hundred dollars as a new wave of, oh,  my goodness, games really are doing something different this generation.

Start time: 5960.02
End time: 5971.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's interesting about one thing as we learned last time, one hundred dollars,  which I wouldn't have thought would make a difference, makes a huge difference in console  gaming. That's why PlayStation dominated Microsoft.

Start time: 5972.40
End time: 6018.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and they, you know, they charged one hundred bucks more for the Kinect.  Yeah, that didn't work. Now they're charging one hundred bucks more for more power.  So I think both systems are good.  They both sell something that looks better on a 4K TV than the stock PlayStation  for an Xbox one.  That's that's a given. And at this point, really, it does boil down to what do you  already own games for?  Do you have a bunch of PlayStation games?  I would not tell you to switch if you own a bunch of Xbox.  Same thing. And if you're somehow coming into this fresh, then yes, I would say Xbox  1X all in all is slightly better.  But like I said, some big cancellations, some lacking in genres.  You don't get Halo or Gears of War on PlayStation and you don't get a lot of cool  Sony games on Xbox.

Start time: 6018.84
End time: 6041.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This just feels like a really long way of saying both systems are good, though.  I mean, like as a weekend warrior, I feel like  it sounds to me like this stuff is incremental almost in the same way that smartphones  are incremental now.  Like, if you're already in if you're already in a certain ecosystem and stick in that  ecosystem, it's just as good as the other ecosystem.

Start time: 6041.98
End time: 6052.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The difference is the time the time frame for consoles is years instead of every year.  True. And so, you know, you're getting incremental improvement from five years ago.

Transcript:  Five years. That's a big deal.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 6055.00
End time: 6077.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And ultimately, both companies want to make it so when you buy their product, whatever  you owned will continue to work.  That is sort of the promise.  They're trying to make it more like smartphones.  But again, that Jaguar architecture is the thing that keeps games not quite doing the  wow stuff that we really are hoping for when we want to say one is better than the other.  They're both locked into that.

Transcript:  I mean, if they come out with headsets that aren't weird, that don't isolate, that feel  comfortable. I mean, I got to try out Oculus's Santa Cruz prototype, which has a powerful  processor in the headset and no cords.  And even that is still kind of limiting.  You're not able to share that in the living room with other people.  It's getting closer.  But VR, it's good.  But there's enough there are enough roadblocks in the consumer experience, in the best  to buy styled experience.  I mean, go into any Best Buy.  If they even have an Oculus demo station still, they're collecting dust.  People have not shown that interest.

And I think these are going to be really telling.  We're going to see how people respond to those.  I think everyone is going to look at those sales and how people respond in terms of  comfort and enjoyment and go from there.  Because if those three huge games don't move the needle in VR, then that's going to tell  a lot of people that tap the brakes.

If you want to move there.  Thirty eight hundred acres will go to office, commercial and retail space.  Four hundred seventy acres for public schools.  Room for eighty thousand residential units.  Unfortunately, Bill's a smart guy.  But a a former Phoenix newspaper columnist said, Bill,  there's going to be water here in about four years.  You can't put in a town of 80,000 people.  Where's the water coming from?

Transcript:  Yeah, maybe they'll solve that somehow.  Let's see. Oh, I should mention this Bob Lutz article.  The chat room's been talking about it.  Bob Lutz, well known in the in motoring.  He's the former vice chairman,  head of product development at General Motors.  He's worked at Ford, Chrysler, BMW and Opel.  He says kiss the good times goodbye.  It saddens me to say it, but we're approaching the end of the automotive era.  Everyone will have five years to get their car off the road or sell it for scraps.  He says it doesn't.  He said people's, you know, CNBC says,  asked him about a study showing people don't want to buy autonomous cars  because they're scared of it.  He says we don't need public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.  At first, all we need is acceptance by big fleets, Uber, Lyft, FedEx, UPS,  the Postal Service, utility companies, delivery services.  Amazon will buy a slew of them.  These fleet owners will account for several million vehicles a year.  Every month they'll order 100,000 low end modules,  100,000 medium, 100,000 high end.  The low cost provider that delivers the spec will get the business.  They won't be branded Chevrolet or Ford or Toyota.  They'll be branded Lyft or Uber.

You'd come in, get the horses suited you.  You'd trade in your old horse, take a new horse home.  Car dealers would continue to exist, but only as a fringe business.

Transcript:  I mean, what are the results really in terms of level five automation at this point?  I know that we've got Waymo having its own driverless cars  roaming the streets of Chandler, very close to Phoenix.  With no safety drivers, by the way.  With actually no drivers.  Yeah.  I mean, I just don't know...  I feel a little...  Because I'm not the car specialist over at Ars Technica.  I just don't know what we're really sure about  in terms of truly dependable level five automation,  because there are a lot of people who say that that has been bandied about  to sell people on the prospect and to get the money flowing  so that level five automation will actually be paid for.  That like, let's get the money flowing and then we'll get there.  We swear, we promise, we'll make this timeline.  And if that's proven wrong, then great.  Good for the smart people designing this stuff.  But what I've sort of gathered from people who are a little more skeptical  and who know their stuff is, is it the money first and then the automation?  Are we really going to be there or is this just a lot of hot air  just to get money puffed in for those edge cases that really matter?  Because if you want to go level five, you can't have a single slip up.  It's just period, bar none.

Transcript:  Well, the money pump always comes before the slip up.  You can have a single slip up, but the challenge is you got to be safer than a human.  And that's going to be really hard.  I don't believe that this is stuff that is impossible, though.  I mean, I think that all the tech to do this exists.  It's not like we have a cloud with a question mark in it.  And it's like, well, I don't know how we're going to invent that.  It's sensors and software.  But, you know, it is going to take time.  And I think that there is this danger that Elon Musk  and maybe Ford with their level four by 2020 kind of stuff is kind of overselling  how quickly this is going to come.  And the danger there is they might get more money by overselling it.  But you risk turning the public off to being promised something  that they couldn't deliver in time.

Start time: 6610.00
End time: 6616.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but I guess that's what's this point is it doesn't matter what the public  thinks, because there's such a huge economy for these big fleets

Start time: 6617.38
End time: 6643.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they'll do it as soon as they work, as soon as it's profitable to do it.  Right. And that's the challenge is they can get an autonomous fleet  up and running for Uber and Lyft to use, then sold. Right.  But it has to be economical for them to do that, which means that the cost  of the of the hardware and the versus paying the drivers.  And I mean, all of that gets factored in.  But I do think that he's right.  I think it's just a matter of, you know, as as we've been saying here,  five years seems kind of ludicrous.

Transcript:  So my right. My concern is that we're talking about ultimately  something that is kind of a public works issue in terms of mass transit.  And we're not it's only private enterprise that seems to be leading this.  And what happens when private enterprise takes the lead on a huge socially impacting thing?  They'll leave it behind when they find something better.  They'll leave it behind when something goes bankrupt.  And so you I just worry.  I mean, I just look down.  Seattle is kind of crazy when it comes to trying and failing to adopt things.  We did, you know, docked bike sharing, and that left us just in the hole  because private enterprise said, and never mind, we're out.  And and I'm not saying that's going to happen right now.  But as we go in the five, 10, 15 year timelines,  keep an eye on how city councils and governments get involved, if they do,  whether rolling out public transit stuff, collaborating with private enterprise  in terms of these fleets are going to be driving through our cities and on and on and on.

Right.  And and what's weird to me is it's this it appears to be this kind of like  combination of like Black Friday and the Super Bowl.  Like they're creating this huge,  like almost cultural behavior all at once.  Like everybody's doing something all at the same time.  And it's I don't know, it's weird to me.  And I like it's it's just hard to wrap your head around.  Like what is actually being bought on a day like this, obviously,  because there's so much of it.

Cyber Monday was three and a half billion dollars. 25 billion dollars.  This is a lot. Nuts. Yeah.  And that leads to the next story,  which is an interesting Bloomberg story that says, get ready.  The retail apocalypse in America is just beginning.  Brick and mortar stores giving way not just to Amazon,  but the fact that they have outrageous debt,  that they've all been leveraged debt with all the buyouts.  And you're seeing huge closings all over the country.  And it's only going to get worse, which is weird because consumer confidence is up.  Unemployment is down. Stock market is up. Retailers collapsing.  Of course, Toys R Us, the latest 6.6 billion dollars, but Payless,  shoe stores, the sports authority, Radio Shack, Borders, Circuit City,  big bankruptcies in the last five, six years.

Transcript:  It's funny that we just talked about self-driving cars and now you're talking,  we're talking about this, right? Because I actually,  I sort of connect those things in terms of economic disruption.  Like one of the things that I always imagine when I think about self-driving  cars is the fact that you will order something online and it will come to you in  a self-driving car and you will try it on and it won't fit.  And then you'll throw it back into this self-driving car.  Yes. You know what I mean? Yes. So like, I don't know.  It's just interesting to think about these things happening at the same time.  And, or, or I don't think it's a coincidence. I think it's all part of the same,

Start time: 6944.04
End time: 6964.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But that says to me that brick and mortar is still going to exist,  but what's going to fall out and it is going to be devastating is a lot of  really inefficient brick and mortar where the, like,  I was thinking about like the value of going to Nordstrom and having like a  personal shopper kind of walk you around and say,  here's a shirt you might like and all of that could compete with something like a  clothing box company. I could see that.

Start time: 6964.52

Start time: 6970.64
End time: 7007.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think you could argue that there are some value in something like that,  but so many of the department stores that are left have cut costs to the point  where you just want to bring through racks of clothes.  I might as well just shop on Amazon, right?  And whole foods being connected to Amazon and being able to do deliveries and  having stuff, you know, relatively near your house and they can deliver it,  maybe in a self-driving car. Like there are arguments for brick and mortar,  but the problem is a lot of these retail stores,  the service they provide is lousy.  And the only thing they've got going for them is that they're in the real world  and it, you don't have to wait a day or two.  And that's going to fall out of the market and it's going to be devastating.  It's true.

Start time: 7008.08
End time: 7032.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually one of Amazon's strategies, it seems with whole foods,  is to use the brick and mortar for pop-up stores.  So they announced this week they're going to open five Amazon pop-up stores with  Echo speakers, fire tablets, prime memberships.  They're going to do it in Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, Florida, and California.  So I think, I think you could kind of nailed it.  Jeff Bezos sees a value to having a storefront,  but it is a very different experience.

Start time: 7033.32
End time: 7110.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's what the Amazon bookstores have kind of been,  which is that the books just collect dust and people,  especially since they require an Amazon prime membership to get the sales on  them.  And then you've just got this glut of Amazon hardware devices and they want  those in more people's faces.  But ultimately,  so long as these service driven companies fail to compete with a  mobile phone as a sales experience driver, they're going to suffer.  I mean, what we're just looking at in terms of Alibaba sales, you know,  mobile shopping over in China, way higher than here in the States.  And that is a number that people are going to be looking at when they say,  how can we increase our market share?  And that's going to be through how do we get America? I mean, this, uh,  thing I'm looking at Forbes is saying about 30% of American shoppers used,  uh, their mobile phones on prime day last year. And for Alibaba singles day,  So that is a gap that's going to continue to need that people are going to look  to and get excited about and drill about how do we get that number up?  How do we get the mobile phone use up? And yeah,  not necessarily at a store unless it's like the Amazon shopping automation store  where you just tap your phone and then cameras watch you shop,  which they still haven't gotten out.  I'll be curious to see when that system gets started,  starts get rolling into whole foods.

Now, of course,  culturally mobile phones are much more popular in Asia.  They don't have computers as many, uh, and so forth, but that's still,  you're buying 25, $22 billion worth of stuff on a phone. What?  That's amazing. Crazy. Crazy. All right, let's take a break.

He's tech cultural,  cultural editor over there at Sam read Jason Snell, six colors.com  and the incomparable at J.  Snell our show today brought to you by tracker.  According to news week, we spend on average 50 minutes a day  looking for stuff we have. We know we have, we just can't find like our keys,  like our remote controls, like your bicycle, like your, your briefcase.  The tracker is here to save you finding stuff.  Eight years ago tracker changed everything when they released their first  tracking device. They've done it again. The new tracker pixel is out.  I love it. It's smaller. It's, it's lighter.  It's it's ringed with LEDs. So if you, you know, as,  as often happens the keys fell down a crack in the sofa, the LEDs and the,  and the little sound on it make it very easy to just press the tracker app on my  phone and it makes my keys beep. And there they are.  You can also look on a map on your phone and see the last place that your phone  saw the tracker. Now it's a Bluetooth tracking device.  So the idea is your phone pairs with it. You have separation alerts.  So if you leave your keys behind, your phone will Blair at you.  You leave your phone behind, your keys will Blair at you.  You push a button on the tracker. It'll,  your phone will start making sound even if it's silenced. I love that.  All in all, it's very nice, easy to use system,  but it gets even better when you include the amazing tracker crowd locate network.  It's the largest in the world because there's more than 5 million trackers out  there. Eight years, there've been a lot of trackers.  That means even if you lose your keys and you walk away and somebody picks them  up and takes them somewhere else,  anytime anybody with the tracker app runs or walks by your keys,  you'll get a notification on your phone. Hey, I just saw your keys.  Here's where they are on the map. That's fantastic.  Trackers 30 day money back guarantee means you're at absolutely no risk.  I want you to visit the tracker.com.  Th is actually the hardest thing to find will be the website because they spell  it T H E T R A C K R no,  no we at the end there.com slash twit.  Take a look at the tracker Bravo, the original anodized aluminum.  You can engrave it, the new tracker pixel,  load up your cart and you'll save 20% off any order.

It's everybody loves getting them and everybody has something  they don't want to lose. Everybody needs the tracker.  T H E T R A C K R the tracker.com slash twit.  And when you go there 20% off any order, even if you've ordered before,  so that's a great deal.  The tracker.com slash twit for 20% off and we thank tracker for their support  and for, I use it all the time. I lose my keys a lot and thank you tracker.  I never lose them anymore. I don't spend any time looking for them either,  which is awesome. Uh, they have a few weird stories, uh,  musically acquired for a billion dollars.  This was all the rage with the teeny boppers.  It was a social media app that you'd sing along 60 million monthly units users.  I have to think it's at its peak right about now,  but a Chinese maker of a news app called to Tio bought it for as much as a  billion dollars making musicallys 30 something CEOs,  Alex Jew and Liu Yang.

We've already given, we've already, it's over. So, I mean,  I'm not saying that this app is the same way,  but I think that's always the question mark of when you want to acquire something  that has that potential of broadening your reach and tapping the young people and  having something that lasts for a while. Like, is it going to be using that app?  Is it going to be rolling it into a greater service that ultimately adds value  and has you compete against the current heavyweights? What's,  what's the real goal?  I think it ends up being a lot more of the ladder of take the good ideas from  that own that patent move forward. So,

I'm surprised they didn't buy musically anything that comes even close to  threatening them. Spy it. You don't care if it's going out of business.

But if they could be integrated,  they would be much more power efficient.  And so maybe on the next round of Mac books or who knows what else,  a lot of conspiracy theories about like, why do this?

I just got a, I tested a bunch of video cameras,  like home security cameras a few, like a year ago, year and a half ago.  And I got an email the other day saying, Hey,  our cloud back service for all your video is shutting down next week. Sorry.  And that's going to happen. And I think that that's the danger in, in, um,  I think it's actually going to make products from brands that are recognizable,  more valuable because you're going to believe that Apple, Google,  Amazon, Microsoft, whoever, um,  is less likely to shut off your product that you bought from them than some kind  of fly by night company.  But any service backed product could die and you would be out of luck like that.  I have a Tevo, right? If Tevo died, which are probably won't, but you know,  if it died and the Tevo service went out, that's just, I've got a luck.  That's the end of the service.  I'm doing a lot of Tevo, man.  Well, I don't have faith in Tevo.  I feel like they just got bought by Rovi and that they'll, they'll keep them,  they'll keep them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And again, I'm paying them a monthly fee.  So I feel like there's a revenue stream for somebody to probably do.  But the fact is if somebody wanted to kill that service,  all of the hardware they've sold would just be dead. And that's scary.

Transcript:  So the Lovance vibrator, which is an internet connected vibrator.  I don't think it relies on a service of any kind,  but it does allow you remotely to control it.  And apparently it for reasons I don't really understand.  And the company says it's a minor software bug.  It was recording sound files during its use and storing them on your phone.  A Redditor found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, that's that, you know, we have an acronym that's Internet of S.  And this is right at the top of that list of that, of that, of that one,  because yeah, who knows what, I mean,  if that was intentionally put in there or if somebody wasn't paying attention  and the supplier used on the circuit board had an exploit put in  and that the circuit board just came with a microphone for no reason.  This can just happen with pretty much any device.  If it happens to have any type of microphone or other input in it,  it's possible you should pretty much crack open anything,  even the slightest bit intimate and check.  I hate to go, you know, whole Edward Snowden paranoid.  But if a vibrator is going to that length, then you're probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  put your vibrator in a ferrity cage.  You're probably not interested in Lovance's.  That's the company's other product.  I don't I could show you the headline, but I don't dare.  You're not going to show it, are you, Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This does go under like, do you I just I I feel like I say this all the time now.  But just like the question with any new  technology, technological device, like one of the most important questions is,  should I connect it to the Internet?

Start time: 7806.86
End time: 7809.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's something I mean, just don't belong on the Internet.

Start time: 7809.88
End time: 7833.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But companies want so badly to have these monthly recurring users.  Like this data point is something that they can sell in one way or another.  Maybe they just want to be able to, like, anonymously say  how many people are using this vibrator every month.  Just like those sort of practices really matter.  You go to conferences and people talk about this stuff really seriously  as if they've never had a friend in real life before.  It's terrifying. Maybe not.

Start time: 7833.98
End time: 7913.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I also think it's it is also like it is worth saying that there are users  that want this, right, that there are people who want to remotely control.  You know, I think there's some value to it. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.  So I think it's worth saying that on the user side, there is some value to it.  There are people that benefit from this sort of thing and use it.  And I think, you know, you know, that that's that's  that could be potentially a good thing.  But I also think the sex toy industry and not, you know, not to strangely relate  this, but but also just the regular toy industry.  There is there is like this huge push to connect everything to the Internet.  And part of it, and it's very connected.  What Sam is saying that like they want data, they want sort of monthly active users,  if you will. Hopefully it's a weekly active user in this case, at the very least.  But but but you know, they they they want to.  You know, I just think you have to be really careful if you're in an industry,  if you're a company in an industry that hasn't traditionally connected  what you're doing, your devices, the things you're making to the Internet.  You have to be really careful about how you build this stuff,  software and otherwise. And, you know, I just this is a perfect example of,  you know, that the mantra of like, should I connect it to the Internet?  And if so, let's do it very carefully.

You guys at ours got a pair. I don't know how magically.  But they're starting to arrive in people. Oh, look at that.

End time: 7996.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's pretty. These are the this is the case.  And this is the bud. Anyone listening?  I'm really sorry. I'll do my best with words.  The bud is designed in such a way that this little  there's a smaller black portion that fits in your ear.  And then you push. Sorry to hit the mic.  This cord you push to like fit the rest of it into your ear canal.  I'm pushing it all the way. Interesting.  But it doesn't. You know, I've only I've only had it for about 24 hours.  So I'm not going to say anything definitive.  You'll have to tune into Ars Technica dot com later this week for more thought.  I want to read your review. But it's a weird fit because it doesn't.  There's no instruction.  It just says put it in your ear and stick this in.  But this this hard plastic part, if you don't like these sorts of things,  like in an Apple AirPod or otherwise, this is not necessarily going to win you over.  And you can't adjust this for the size of your general ear canal.  And it's hard to tell whether it's supposed to sit in the front or the back.  But it's not just that, you know, you're paying 160 bucks.  It comes with a case that has its own charging in it.  Like it's got a little battery.

Tap to play and pause.  Hold it down to talk to it.  Just you hold it down and you say a voice command to Google Assistant.  And you can do a double tap if you've gotten a notification  and it'll read it out loud to you.
