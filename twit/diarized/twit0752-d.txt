Start time: 497.56
End time: 557.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and that to me is  The real value if you know if there is value in ces it isn't actually the products  That are on the floor. It's more the fact that  All of your peers are there and all of the companies are there and so you can book meetings with them and talk about  What they're going to be doing in three months six months nine months in a year  And and then the the products themselves there's you know, there's usually a bunch of  kids who work for blogs  Who have to do, you know  22 posts a day who are just running around like crazy snap and pick and and every booth that you go to there's  Somebody's standing there, you know holding the product in front of them with a you know  With a camera like this and saying so i'm you know doing this and but you know  I'm doing and and you know really earnest and and you're trying really hard not to interrupt  That's you know, that's gonna be me this year

Oh boy  So they can count their privacy  but the home kit thing is interesting because they're really you know apple is kind of really lagged behind on some of the  other protocols  google and apple and amazon are kind of putting their heads together to create a  a joint protocol for home  networking and chip right c-h-i-p  And but if that's a long ways off and so  In the meantime, they've got to get out there and really hustle to get people to pay attention to home kit product

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one of the trends i'll be looking for certainly 5g and debunking 5g will be a great sport  You know, I I went into the t-mobile store took my son's going traveling to asia and I said well  You you need a t-mobile phone so you can get some, you know free text and data internationally  so we switched them over and I asked the guys they were selling the 5g phones they have the  the  one plus mcclaren edition and I think they had a samsung 5g  Note 10 and uh very expensive  Expensive plans and I said, oh, this is great. Can I can I get it here? No  Can I get a 5g in san francisco? No, I said, where can I get 5g said ukiah  Which is a tiny town like 80 80 miles north of us. That's it  And they're doing all these ads five two t-mobiles rolling out 5g everywhere. Everybody's gonna get it. No, it's a lie

Start time: 699.52
End time: 752.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's in a lot of places. We have it in houston  and it's fairly um  it's fairly uh  Disappointing i've got a i've got a one of the mcclaren phones here. That's a nice phone, but oh, it's a beautiful phone  But what's the battery life on 5g is bad too, right? Isn't that yes, and it was bad in on early 4g phones, too  So this is kind of the nature, but this is the 600 megahertz 5g, right? Yes mobile 5g and it's about it is about  Um t-mobile said that you'll get told me you'll they'll get about 20 better speed. You won't get that much more  What are you getting? It's houston in well in houston  I'm getting a I mean it's you can see it's a little better  But it's not something to jump up and down about they don't yet have the network set up. So you  Have the lack of lag which is supposed to be a big deal with 5g

Start time: 753.20
End time: 766.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and part of the reason you're getting better speed is because you're about one of five people has a 5g phone  That's right. That's right  You wait till everybody has a 5g phone in early. Yeah, right. Well and at some points if if

Start time: 767.10
End time: 798.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, they get the merger with sprint they'll have more than just the 600 megahertz spectrum  They'll have you know, the faster spectrum that isn't quite as as intense as millimeter wave  And so they'll be in better shape and these phones apparently the ones they're selling now will work  Uh when that combination happens if it happens, we're still waiting for the judge to to rule on that  Yeah, but but it's it is not so far it is not that impressive well houston and ukiah so that's good

Start time: 799.78
End time: 807.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and and and a corner of certain nfl stadiums not the whole stadium just right next to the hot dog cart  it's

Start time: 808.56
End time: 844.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see. I'm you know, it's better. It's better than verizon, you know verizon you have to be  Outside you have to be within sight in order to get it when you get it. It's like 1.7 gig  I was they had they gave me a demo  You know in a parking lot on this on this suburban street in in houston  And you could see the tower up there and it was and they downloaded a two-hour netflix movie in five seconds  It was really impressive. But then you know, you go inside the building  Next to the parking lot and you can't get it. So it's so you can watch your netflix movie

Start time: 845.56
End time: 856.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so you know what you have it download yeah, is so here's the question is 5g hype  Or is it kind of what lte was when it was first announced? It's just early days. Yeah, it's pre-hype

Start time: 857.30
End time: 903.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it's pre-hype  I mean I was I was just trying to remember how they you know how they marketed lte and and even 4g and  And wondering whether this is always the case whether they sort of like everybody's talking about it before  It's actually a thing and in the beginning it's actually kind of crappy  But eventually it starts to get up to speed quite literally and it starts to work  But I was trying to remember that because the it there just seems to be so much chatter about 5g  um and and marketing about like  You know to us the consumers for 5g, but it really doesn't seem like it's anywhere yet  And also there's the proof of concept, you know, i'm sure will come but it's just doesn't seem  I don't know. It doesn't seem palpable to me at least I guess the question is almost is it lte or is it ymax?

Start time: 905.24
End time: 933.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because both were highly hyped ymax was hyped just like 5g's being hyped right now. It turned out to be  The worst thing sprint ever did I remember ymax in las vegas at ces or comdex being completely unusable  It was a man. It was really what held sprint back  So I guess that's the question is is this a real technology? There are some real problems, of course  The problem you're talking about dwight is with millimeter wave. It's such a high frequency that it can't go through walls  Yeah

Start time: 934.12
End time: 997.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not very good. Well and the whole  the uh, the implementation strategy for 5g  Basically depends on having far more  Of four times the size hours. Yeah, four times the sites  uh, so, you know, but and  and  Good luck with that. Like, you know, I live in I live in an area where we have a really strong  community of people who think that uh,  Mobile cell phone signals are you know telling us either the devil or or you know, they'll they'll cause cancer  There's a big nimby problem with uh, yes 5g a lot of people think just just getting answer  Yeah, just getting towers in  To uh to get decent 4g coverage in parts of santa fe, you know  There's parts of downtown santa fe where you know, the the 4g coverage is terrible because there's so you know, it's very very organized community  resisting the uh, the deployment of more towers just for lte. Yeah

Start time: 998.42
End time: 1027.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I picture it working really well in new york city, right?  Like I was I lived in new york city for 10 years and like new york city  There's so much stuff going on all around you that like weird, you know  People hacking cable and stuff like that that it's like you just walk through the city. You don't notice that stuff  So I feel like I can see it working in cities and also people not really noticing it or caring that much  In cities, but I yeah, it totally makes sense that they're organized groups fighting this in certain communities

Start time: 1028.54
End time: 1086.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so one of the interesting things about houston is that a lot of  Services like this and 4g and 5g they they come here first because it's flat  Right and dense and so we'd say they're able to get uh, uh towers in here and you know, there's not a lot of obstruction  But um, and the city of houston has just been incredibly friendly  To uh the carriers because they have no zoning laws in houston. You can do anything you want  So so so the other thing that is happening is that houston is the hometown for crown castle  Which is the company that owns most of the cell towers in the united states and leases them to the carriers  and so  crown castle works with the city of houston to get a lot of fiber laid and to get their towers up here and so  houston is kind of on on the forefront of a lot of this but it still doesn't mean that 5g yet  Uh has any traction or it could even be called good. Yeah

Start time: 1087.24
End time: 1107.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I I remembered that apple was at last year's ces in in what turned out to be in a somewhat unfortunate  Way, they bought the side of a hotel  For a big ad that says what happens on your iphone  stays on your iphone  Shortly thereafter, of course, it was revealed that that's not the case

Start time: 1109.08
End time: 1116.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that yeah, it was bad timing all around. Uh, i'll be curious to see  If they do anything like that this year

Start time: 1116.64
End time: 1124.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do someone actually tweeted a photo of that same building I think last week and was like doesn't look like apples bought an ad  someone tweeted that last week

Start time: 1125.46
End time: 1138.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not on a myriad anyway  so  Uh, but I do think security and privacy will be kind of at least  Tangentially one of the big topics of ces this year. Yes  Yeah

Start time: 1139.08
End time: 1142.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there is that privacy besides the privacy panel

Start time: 1143.26
End time: 1144.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right that apple will be at

Start time: 1145.26
End time: 1169.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't know, you know, I mean it's it's I think that people will say  I think you get a lot of lip service for it, but i'm not sure that there will be anything  Uh that essentially says  Here is a product that enhances privacy or improves privacy. I think everybody will say yeah  You know, we'll we'll be transparent about what happens with your data, but we're still we'll still gonna sell it

Start time: 1169.42
End time: 1200.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one thing though that did happen just a couple of days ago is going to make a big difference  Which is the california privacy law which went into effect january 1st  Basically our version of gdpr requiring companies disclose what information they gather and giving everybody the right to have their data deleted  Of course, that's only for companies that do business in california, but so many companies  Are doing it and most companies don't want to have a separate california version of their product  So I I suspect this will  This will change. Uh, I this will change the conversation a little bit

Start time: 1202.38
End time: 1247.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's two things about that though  I think you're right to the extent that it's going to be like  Like gdpr in the sense that it will become the default  for anyone who doesn't have the the budget or the technical chops  to uh segment their  Their app or their service or or whatever you say if I can meet these standards  Then everybody gets them by default  But the other thing about it that I find is sort of interesting is that there's still six months before  Enforcement kicks in right?  uh, it's  There's a there's some weird there's like a bunch of the regulations aren't even written yet. I think

Start time: 1248.56
End time: 1316.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting and and just like gdpr. There's also a a pause while people see what kinds of prosecutions happen  Because are they going to go after?  Bloggers or only google or only facebook who's gonna?  Facebook says we don't have to do anything. We're already compliant  Which sounds a little self-serving  mozilla says  Well, we're gonna yeah  We are going to give you a delete all the telemetry data that mozilla collects not personal data  But telemetry data we're going to put that in our browser and we're going to do it in every version because we don't want to make  a california version  of mozilla  So, you know the other reason I think you're going to see this at ces is because I think you're going to see a lot of iot  Stuff and that is a big story, especially now because of the ring  Doorbell, oh the ring still looks crazy. And I think by the way somewhat unfair. We've talked about that before  I don't think rings any worse than anybody else. Nevertheless, I think it raised the general public's awareness  If you put a camera in your house  With speaker and microphone people might be able to hack into it  And so I think that all of these iot companies will be at great pains to say oh, no, no, no, we're safe, right?

Start time: 1317.76
End time: 1355.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, one of the stories on your list today is the wise  Database they got hacked. They got well what happened was  An employee put a database of their customers information  Online without securing it it had been secured. They turned it off for them for what reason  Then it became discoverable. Yeah, what's funny is my daughter?  Gave me a wise  Camera for christmas so that I could look at the cats in the other just in the nick of time  Yeah, I didn't set it up until the 26th when they found it. So I didn't have an account till then so

Start time: 1355.92
End time: 1397.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think wise's response was exactly right on this. First of all, of course, it was an error  They weren't hacked but somebody did publish accidentally details of 2.4 million customers  But wise immediately reset all the tokens so that that data would no longer be useful  To a bad guy trying to get into your camera. That's the right response  I think a lot of our listeners I have wise cameras everywhere  They're cheap and I think a lot of we've recommended them like crazy over the last year  And they work well, they have a great rate and you don't have to pay a monthly subscription  There's a lot of reasons to go with it  I feel like wise did the right thing wise responded appropriately  And that's more important than just not having a breach. It's it's how you respond

Start time: 1399.18
End time: 1404.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yes, and they responded quickly, right? They were they didn't delay with it. They were out there with it

Start time: 1404.74
End time: 1423.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, and they had to because unfortunately the company that uh,  Published it told wise at 921 and then published their article at 935  So right. Yeah, they weren't given a whole lot of time to respond  That piece of it was weird to me, right? Like yeah, that's yeah, that's it. That is not traditional disclosure

Start time: 1424.30
End time: 1453.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Protocol. Yeah, because that that seems like way more focused on  Publicizing the problem than allowing the company to actually patch it. So  Yeah, I was sort of struck by that that that seemed kind of strange and I mean whatever  but it just seems like usually if you're  If you're a self-respecting security person, hopefully you're you're actually trying to help the company  Improve its security before you tell everybody about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I agree with you. I feel like comcast saw this coming, which is why they put one terabyte limits  On my bandwidth. I have a one that's nothing that's nothing if you write  And so the idea is you you you put the bandwidth cap on now  When people say oh that's fine because my streaming of netflix is only 25 megabits  I can easily get in under the one terabyte and then the minute you go to 8k you're and you're absolutely right to it. There are no 8k  Physical media players and frankly, I think there probably won't be right isn't physical media like history. It's going to be streaming  You'll be you'll need if if you need right now for 4k netflix says 25 megabits  You'll need 100 megabit four times more 100 megabits for 8k unless they have some super duper compression

It'll be  Uh  I mean the the other thing about 8k technology is that it is literally  beyond the physical limits of the human eye  To to discern those those differences, you know, I appreciate that you can indeed tell the difference between  of  Full hd and 4k  But you know i've looked at 4k versus 8k, uh  and and I I don't  You know, I I don't think you can really see enough of a difference to justify  the  You know the you know the energy usage the the the manufacturing differences and especially the bandwidth, right?

I don't  Anyway, our show today brought to you by this is actually talking about health. This is a really good sponsor health iq  It's a life insurance agency that specializes in helping healthy people get insurance  Turns out every insurance company all the big insurance companies offer special deals for people who are healthy who?  Get a minimum of eight hours sleep for example or or eat right or exercise four or more times a week  The problem is getting those big companies to give you  Those benefits they don't want to you need a life insurance agency to step in health iq  They use science and data and they will get you lower life insurance  Rates for people who are health aware health conscious who take care of themselves  And I know that's you you can get a million dollars of insurance as little as thirty six dollars a month  The reason is healthy people subsidize the unhealthy people, right? It's not a conspiracy. It's just it's actuarial science  It's statistics  You might be healthy. The key is does your health insurance company know we for instance  Is a great example is aunt pruett who is very healthy. He lifts he's buff  But because he is so strong and has such big muscles his body mass index is through the roof  And a health insurance company is just going to look at that number and say well, you must be obese  He's not he has very little body fat  So health iq steps in and says no, no, no, no, you don't understand that number is not the number to look at  This is the number to look at and gets him that great rate  If you're a runner if you're a cyclist you're here to crossfit you're an athlete if you're a vegetarian or a vegan  You're working hard to preserve your good health. You should get better life insurance rates physically active people have significantly lower risks or heart disease  cancer diabetes health iq is basically  To say they're a life insurance agency is not enough. They're a they're a concierge service. They give you white glove service  They'll walk you through the entire process  They will have their policies are underwritten by the all of the top 30 insurance companies  So it's you know, they will take you to the right insurance company the one that's going to give you the deal  And these are savings by the way, you can't get on your own. They're exclusive to health iq  These companies have said to health iq yeah, find us those healthy people. We want those healthy people  You got to qualify to get the special rate. So here's how it starts you go to health iq.com  Slash twit and take their proprietary health iq quiz. It's not a quiz about your health. It's a quiz about your knowledge  How much you know about good health they've put this together with a team of the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts  Depending on your score as well as other qualifying factors. For instance, they said  Can we leo can we get the health data from your phone or your watch and they said yes  That's when they can get you up to 41 off your life insurance premiums compared to other providers now. There's no commitment  You're going to learn  Everything you need to know about the opportunities to be rewarded because you live healthy  Let them help you toward getting the life insurance you deserve go to health iq.com slash twit take the quiz  See if you qualify once you complete the quiz you'll give them your phone number your expert your guy your  Concierge will call you and walk you through the process and help you save a ton of money  It was a great experience. I really enjoyed it health iq  dot-com slash twit somebody somebody sent me an email said but yeah, but but  life insurance companies rely on on the healthy people to  To support the sick ones. We're not taking you out of the insurance pool  We're just making sure you get the appropriate rate. You're still in the insurance pool  Uh, this is a really good company health iq.com slash  Twit we thank you for their support of this week in tech  We thank you for supporting this week in tech by using that special address health iq.com slash  twit  Wednesday was public domain day 2020  Uh, we've started to celebrate this the first of the year is when the copyright for a lot of stuff  Uh, it goes public domain including rhapsody in blue by george gershwin silent films by buster keaton  And harold lawy thomas man's the magic mountain  em forster's passage to india  The uh a milnes when we were very young  They were supposed to go into the public domain in the year 2000 the normal copyright term used to be 75 years that was until  Walt disney company said well, wait a minute  Mickey mouse is going to go in the public domain.

I have entered the public domain as of uh wednesday and there's a lot of it dante's inferno  Which is a movie obviously the book was a long time into the public domain  Some really uh interesting stuff. This is a worthwhile  This is a the duke law school center for study of the public domain and they mention this  And I mention it because it's really important to understand that while copyright is good  It's also good if works enter the public domain so people can remix them can build upon them  disney itself  Almost all of its great movies are based on public domain fairy tales and then they pulled up the ladder behind them and said but you  Can't do anything with it  So I think this is uh, this is good to know and rhapsody in blue. We should play that  Just to celebrate one of my favorite works of art, uh, of course no performance  Because those are  Those are copyrighted by the performers, but you can now play it if you're if your little student band wants to play it  You can play it without paying any royalties  Uh, let's see what else  The traced act also went into law a lot of things happened at the beginning of the year  I am wondering how much this will change things  But i'm glad they passed it. It is a bill to make it harder for robocallers  To continue their practice  Uh chuck schumer tweeted that last year  There were 48 billion robocalls  And this traced act is a bipartisan bill that was signed by president trump into law on  Uh, I think it went into law january 1st  First  It will do a few things extend the fcc statute of limitations  uh  help protect consumers  With fcc rulemaking robocall enforcement fcc has been you know, agit pi's been on record saying  I hate those robocalls, but has done very little about it  Requires a shocker.

Oh my god and and uh, and like and turn yourself surrender yourself  And he was so aggressive  And I was so taken off guard that I was immediately for the first like 15 minutes  I was taken in by this thing because I was like, yeah, I had a weird text guy a few years ago  Um, hmm.

That seems to be a good system  Stir and shaken will at least prevent phone number spoofing, which is very easy to do  That's why you get all these neighbors spoofing. It's also illegal, but most of these people are offshore  By the way stir and shaken one of the points of this bill is carriers cannot charge for it  And in return they're shielded from liability for reasonable mistakes. I think that's fair  Uh, oh, this is the big one the attorney general is going to convene an intra-agency task force  Okay, maybe that's not the big one we got a task force look at

Start time: 4301.54
End time: 4332.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4393.92
End time: 4419.36

Um, I  I think they were scamming  Uh, they were over promising  Uh a lot of the things that they could do but they were certainly capable of of doing some very bad things  And the thing that is most disturbing to me  About the technique that they're using which other people can and do use is the micro targeting  and the problem with micro targeting is that you can  aggregate data from facebook from online activities, uh,  You can integrate it with real world activities  And and then you identify people and then you start sending messages to a group that may be as small as you know  there's 20 people in  Oshkosh, wisconsin that you want to discourage from voting because you know, they'll vote for your opponent  And the trouble with micro targeting is that it goes  So far below the radar.

The thing that's great about fresh books is it's a it's a  It's an online service. You get a great fresh books dashboard which they're and they're always adding new features  It's always getting better  I mean the fundamentals are there makes it easy to do the invoicing makes it easy to send out notes when you don't  Get paid makes it easy at tax time to assemble everything you need for your accountant  But but now they've got all sorts of project management features  You can assign project due dates you can get an overview on a project status track team expenses manage team products and deliverables  You can assign rates or hours to specific projects. You have yes keep track of hours  Absolutely, and they automatically go into the invoices and even  Different projects can have different hourly rates for the same client  You can deliver accurate job and project status to the client because they've got a thing now called time entry report which you send off  You have complete control over what members of the team can see and cannot  And their mobile app is fantastic. I would use it to take pictures of my expenses get them right into the invoice  It does it in every possible currency help me because I was sending invoices in canadian dollars  But every currency in the world effect fresh books is used worldwide over 24 million people have used fresh books  It is the easiest way to manage your business.

They were contract workers  But it's ended up really hurting a lot of my friends  Who are tech journalists who can no longer well ant pruett for example can no longer work for tech republic because he moved to california  And the rules here about contract workers are so stringent  That tech republic just doesn't want to deal with freelancers. I've seen the same thing  um sb nation had a number of editors who  Were part-timers submitting to their sports blogs who quit or were fired because the because of ab5  uber lift and door dash  suing as one might expect it postmates  Suing as one might expect it and then there's a bunch of money being raised  For a ballot initiative to try to reverse ab5  This is a complicated one because I also I I understand  How companies can take advantage of contract workers to avoid paying benefits to avoid paying them well?  and there have always been you know  some you know series of rules that you had to  Satisfy to be a contract worker, but this now basically says  you know  Everybody needs to be an employee and not every company can have employees

Yeah. Yeah, and it's and it and it really is  Exploitative and  And you know, I really would love to see that addressed. I'd love the I'd love to see a system where  So where people created some actual where businesses like sb nation and like tech republic, which I work for by the way  Uh, if they you know that they did  um more  You know hired more full-time employees because that's what  The country needs is jobs not gigs  You know ultimately gigs should be  The thing that you do to make spare money  But they it's turned into the thing where employers have figured out that they can use the  the you know the gig labor system to basically just  Avoid hiring hardly any employees at all. The only employees they have to hire are managers and accountants

It's zdnet  And uh, and it was and and they did the right thing by him it wasn't that their fault  But he was caught between and that's where that's where this is an issue is that it also restricts choice for people who do want to work  For a variety of reasons as contractors  But people will choose

Oh you do  and you do to the california legislature and and i've and i've read the  Um, and i've read ab5  From start to finish several times and it is a very specific sentence that is in there  And I think that if the legislator were interested in solving the problem  In identifying the problem and solving it that it can be solved. Would you do a carve out for journalists or what would you do?  Well, I I don't know what the answer is.

That would be I you can't expect it to be perfect out the gate  You you fix it and the courts can help fix it  Uh, the legislators can help fix it  Unfortunately, as you know add to here in california. We have a referendum process. It's highly broken  uh, and that's what's going to fix it, but it's not going to fix it in the right way because it doesn't take very many signatures to get a  a proposition on the ballot in california  and  Basically, uh, you can anything you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but the 2017 tax law included  They lowered they lowered a lot of corporate tax rates  But they lowered one in particular for repatriated profits with the with the goal of say because they looked and they saw that  You know  There were all these companies that had all these billions and billions of dollars that were held offshore  And the reason they were offshore companies had them on their balance sheets, but they couldn't spend them right except  Overseas, right?  You know as soon as they brought them back into the country  They were treated as ordinary income and had to be taxed at you know, whatever their 30 marginal rate was and so they  They gave them a special repatriation rate

Transcript:  And and the theory was and I remember this was a campaign promise  Of the trump administration the theory was these companies will take that those billions in apple's case almost 200 billion dollars  And plow it back into a research and employees hiring  What apple did almost entirely whether it was stock buybacks to increase the value of its stock?  Not just them either. I think most of them and I don't yeah an increased executive pay and so forth  It doesn't really seem to  Do much to increase employee pay or build more jobs or any of that  So anyway, I I guess it's good news. Maybe it's not but they're gonna stop  I think it's bad news because I just like saying double irish dutch sandwich  Just a lot of fun for me  What do you i'm curious what you all think of the medium post by the former head of international relations at google?  Who said?  Yeah, it was pretty harsh  I don't like to weigh into employee issues  He was let go or left. He says the company's motto used to be don't be evil, but things have changed  He says he was lobbying  google constantly  to be a better global citizen  things like  You know the china search engine putting human rights ahead of the bottom line  and he felt that because he was  so vocal about that  They fired him

Um, but the  This the thing that struck me  was  A lot of that stuff really sounded on point, right? You could see  Like developers are so you know, it's like the it's hallowed ground that the developers walk on right and if if developers  Um, you know if they if they really want to if they and if and the same with the people who are selling the products  Right, maybe that's not hallowed ground  But but those people you know if you're making money off the product that carries a lot of weight, right?  And it sounded to me like this guy  Had was really trying to uphold the sort of moral standards. What whatever that might be?  at the company and  When the developers want a thing and when the people who are like selling the products want a thing  That's really tough to push back against that

There was no follow-up in any of these cases  Until the day I was accidentally copied on an email from a senior hr director  In which he told a colleague I seemed to raise concerns like these a lot  And instructed the colleague to do some digging on me instead  And then after 11 years, he was uh, reorged out of his job

It is absolutely  Yeah, it's yeah  I wanted to hear the full story of like why the heck anyone at the company would think it would be okay to have a diversity exercise  where you separate people into these groups and that's almost seems like a  I don't know.

I had a great night's sleep on my casper  You will too casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost because they figured out a critical insight  They looked around in mattresses and said wait a minute  The the mattress store the place you go to sleep on it or lie  You don't even get to sleep on it lie on it for a couple of minutes is taking  100 markup we could do it better by selling direct  So they obsessively engineered a great mattress now several great mattresses  Designed to mimic human curves providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies  The original casper I slept on for years combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with just the right amount of sink  And bounce you want a little firm support, but you also want your bony bits to kind of sink in and it does both  It's breathable. So you sleep cool. That's really important  Star reviews across casper amazon and google 20 000 reviewers. That's about as good as you can get  It's become the internet's favorite mattress. They now have some new ones and I love the hybrid  But there's also the wave and the essential I sleep on the hybrid  It combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam with durable yet gentle springs  Watch this it comes in this surprisingly compact box. They all do even with the springs you open it up and  The mattress just full-size. This is a king size  And man is that comfortable the essential will save you a lot of money too. So if you're a student  We actually sent us essential to our  Son when he was in college, you didn't want to sleep on the mattress in the dorm for good reason  But it was affordable. So I said leave it there when you when you leave after four years  You can be sure of your purchase because casper knows you don't get to sleep on it in the showroom  But you do get to sleep on it for a hundred nights  risk free  If at any point you say, yeah, never mind even the kitty cats love the casper if at any point  You say that it's not for me call them they'll come they'll get your mattress. They'll refund you every penny  Casper offers free shipping and painless returns in the u.s and canada get a casper mattress today  In fact, we're going to save even more right now  If you use the twit one offer code go to casper.com  The offer code is twit and the number one a hundred dollars towards select mattresses.
