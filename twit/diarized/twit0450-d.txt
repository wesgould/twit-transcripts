I think you have to be I  Still have you in it. We appreciate it  We were talking before the show began  It's really kind of an old story, but and yet. I don't think we ever really followed up on the Newsweek cover story  That proclaimed Leah McGrath Goodman proclaimed that she had found the creator of Bitcoin  Hiding in plain sight in Southern, California  Dorian Nakamoto Nakamoto has issued two denials now and  You pointed me  Jeff Jarvis to Felix Salmon's article in on Reuters why Newsweek isn't convincing  This is from a couple of weeks ago  What is the what is the latest here we are a month later from this cover story and Newsweek stands by it as does Goodman  Nobody has really proven otherwise except there is an interesting email from the address that  Nakamoto is used in the past the Nakamoto is used in the past saying I am NOT Dorian

End time: 280.44

Yeah, and he was falsely  Named as he was he was at the scene. He was that he actually turned out to be a hero  and he was originally identified as a hero and then  One or two sources said no, he's actually a suspect and before you knew it  there was a rush to judgment and so you haven't I mean the analogy is is  falls apart in a few cases, but it is the example of a guy who is  thrust into the news against his will and  And has a false story told about him and he doesn't get the chance to  Press the rewind button  He eventually won a fairly substantial and a fairly influential

What was a search result? What was an ad they do have a yellow ad button?  I think that's clear early  But they no longer have the box they had a box and this is it didn't just say ad more now it says  But wait a minute Jeff look on the right-hand column where it does say ads at the top  But as I scroll down those ads are indistinguishable from the actual results

We did talk about that. That was  Right, right, right  And and so and the point of that is that people are recognizing that native advertising is crap and they're not scrolling it  They're going to the page and leaving it and and so thank goodness the public is smart.

But first and we've got a great panel  Glad to have Ed Bott and Jeff Jarvis here to talk about the week's tech news on to it  But first a word from a company  That I knew about in a product I'd heard about but I didn't really know what it did.

He said Freud's nephew  Yeah, he invented modern-day advertising and I said, yeah Henry, that's right  And that's why we don't do ads the same way we used to do it in the old days where we'd scare people or you know  Use use their secret needs wants and desires to sell a product. You know what we do on Twitter is so different  We tell you tell you about the product the features the benefits and then we let you try it for free  And I think that's kind of old-fashioned, but I really like how we do that. He said yeah Edgar Bernays  fascinating fella  Let's talk about Turkey  When I when we were we were in Turkey when Lisa not so long ago a few months ago  And at the time I our guides a lot of people were talking to especially the women  We're very concerned about a return in Turkey to Sharia law  The rise of the Muslim government  and  Of course there were the protests that in Tahrir Square, but not to rear was it?

Transcript:  It certainly if you're starting out in a country that is that is open  That has a tradition of open communication  When you have to ratchet things down and and shut them off. It's there's too many pipes  There's too many pipes  Too many tubes. Yep, you got to get a deal with there. It's much easier in a country  Where the state already controls the means of communication the incoming pipe to the country like China?  Yeah, like China as and I think in Libya  When that was happening a couple years ago?  That it's a little it's a lot easier in an environment like that  But introducing repression into a country that's used to Western style communication is  Kind of doomed to six doomed to fail  It's not gonna succeed and interestingly I'm going to be and I'm gonna be visiting Turkey in about I think five weeks or so  So I want to I'll get a chance to see how things have speaking there in June myself really

Start time: 1379.70
End time: 1424.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's just freedom of expression. It's having a  multitude of  channels for that so the first things that people said you can do is  You can text your tweets, right?  Now you might not be able to read things from other people but you can publish stuff to Twitter immediately  by enabling it on your SMS feed and then boom you just send something to a  Particular number and it's on Twitter and you've just bypassed it. So you have so many  Again, it's not a repressive country in general. They don't have an iron fisted control over the communication channels  So how do you block all of them? There's way too many, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But she wrote a wonderful piece during the innocence of the Muslims Ruha as she puts it  About and I could use her words here  why free speech is baffling to many that the idea that this speech could come out of the country seems like it's endorsed because  normally speech is  Approved yeah, and if you're living a country where speech is approved then to see it come out in the country like ours where it's not  You assume that it's approved and thus it represents what the view is and that's that's a lot of what in her argument  Leads to different worldviews around something like the innocence of Muslims

Transcript:  She writes in in medium the day the Turkish government banned itself from Twitter people in Turkey have banned the ban  She says that during the day Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had said Twitter Schmitter will wipe them all off  I don't care what the international community says  She says I had muttered you might care what the people in Turkey will think  Twitter is not just a protest tool in Turkey nor just a place where the growing corruption scandal is discussed  It's also used by large number of government supporters  Including almost all of the leading officials and parliamentarians from the ruling party. It's an entrenched part of the network public sphere  She didn't she thought it was a good perhaps. It was a glitch doesn't make any sense  What happened next should be a lesson to any modern country that wants to ban social media after it's already been incorporated into everyday life  For the next three hours. I slowly watched my turkey list on Twitter go from quiet to resurgent to defiant to jubilant to very very  crowded people circumvented one by one and then in a flood  You can't you can't  You can't you can't shut it down people in Turkey had banned the ban  So in fact, the only people who really got banned from Twitter  Are the pro-government tweeters?  Who didn't want to openly circumvent?  They in effect shut down their supporters  while amplifying their critics  whoops  The people the only people not on Twitter at the moment  She writes are ardent pro-government supporters who do not want to circumvent and people who may not have the fairly minimal skill required to circumvent

Anyway, she says people are also backing up their networks to whatsapp to vibrate a Facebook and whatever else  I probably don't even know about the country is fairly wild  Wired massive media censorship of the past few years has met social media as a lifeline many have adopted. That's interesting  so official censorship of the official media and of the press has  Merely amplified the importance of social media  Seems like you try to shut this stuff down it just squeezes around  Barbara Streisand's you know, yeah the Barbara Streisand effect. Yeah  And then the official tweet from the official government agency of Turkey  Twitter was blocked to prevent abusive rights

Maybe nothing but Twitter trying to get rid of what Vivian Schiller calls its infrastructure of  Our teas and hashtag, yeah, that's terrible this comes from the Guardian. Yeah, I want to be careful  Well, it's Guardian elsewhere. I would be careful in speculation. And so I don't know if it's true  But hey, this like CNN we might as well speculate  That's our job

She just came there about a month ago. Yeah, Vivian's very smart  Oh, yeah, she said at a media conference at the at reply and the hashtag were arcane and  She said the Twitter was working on a way to hide them while retaining functionality  We are working on moving the scaffolding of Twitter into the background  I didn't maybe that's it is a little arcane, but I think everybody gets it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is what what could but but look how people used it to gather around and do things they created movements around the hashtag  And and so there was an example of one design that there was one small test evidently that if I replied to you  It just didn't have the ad sign, but it was still tied to you right tied to you in their client  As data it may not be as apparent. I don't know but I get I'm speculating  So I understand the one hand the geekiness is off putting and Twitter desperately wants to grow its audience on the other hand  Look at the power of what the hashtag has done that led to occupy Wall Street  It led to a few Washington that led to you know all these things  And so it you know it might be in a geek  hankering for something that's  That that is too arcane and is too much of us or or am I right to worry that this I wouldn't worry about this

Transcript:  You only have 140 characters and and  one of the  Most interesting things to see on Twitter is when when somebody gets a good Twitter canoe going right?  What's a Twitter canoe a Twitter canoe is when you have so many names?  Involved in the conversation that there's no room left  Or actual for actual content. Did you make that up? That's good. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no  It's it's it's been around for for a while and in fact sometimes people do it on purpose  And you know you start adding people on to the end of a discussion or you know people just come in themselves so  the same thing so when you have at signs and  Names, you know, Jeff Jarvis is a takes up  What's a lot ten characters plus the at sign is eleven eleven characters plus the space before that that's twelve characters and boom  I'm out of that where I can have a more substantive conversation with at ev  Then I can with at Jeff Jarvis or at Leo Laporte because your names are interfering

Start time: 1850.08
End time: 1877.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if the idea let's see that but if the idea is to remove the the  The names from the character count and still leave them visible in the conversation  That makes perfect sense and it also makes perfect sense that somebody  Would botch the description of that when they're bringing it up in a place where it hasn't been approved by  Marketing or it hasn't been fully thought through yet, right? Yeah, maybe they just won't count them long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know for a long time people said hundred forty characters. It's so arbitrary. It doesn't make sense. Why don't we have more?  That's one way to give you more characters  While preserving the content is make the hashtags and the at replies free  Basically, yeah, I mean here here's an example of a tweet  With one two three four names  He says I I don't know which voice is Ed I think Ed sounds distinct Ed from now on would you introduce everything by saying?

I've called it. You know it could be Armageddon on April 9th  But then Steve calmed me down a little bit  So you know if you know what you're doing you can still run XP safely where do you come down on that?

Start time: 2732.19
End time: 2830.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think Steve is  Is is right on security issues he usually is  And I don't think there's any question that he's that he's got it here, too  ATMs  ATMs in general are single-purpose devices on dedicated networks either VPNs or  direct dial-up connections to a banking network  people get  viruses and malware by surfing the web and reading email and you know either  Opening attachments or going to dodgy websites on unpatched machines  You're not going to do that on an ATM the fact that an ATM is running Windows XP is  You know basically kind of irrelevant. Yeah, so I'm not worried about ATMs  Among the rest of the people the overwhelming majority of instances of malware infection these days are coming through  Vulnerabilities in  Third-party products things like flash  Acrobat and and especially Java  Yeah, those are the places where and again you don't you're not running those things  If you're if you're running those things and you're keeping them up to date  Even on an XP machine, you're not going to be exploited  in addition you have  Anti-virus software that will continue to be supported from third parties and even from Microsoft for a period  After XP goes out of support. So yeah, you know if you're if you're running XP, I think you're making a bad decision  There are a lot better choices that you can make

It's not all 13 year old machines  Some of these people using XP  In fact, I would say probably the majority of them are not sophisticated users  And so the fact that they can't update Internet Explorer the fact that they won't be getting patches. They're gonna be pretty vulnerable

No, I'm just joking see now. I'm not gonna get to do it. That was just a joke  NSA has breached  Huawei for years  The federal government says don't use Huawei equipment because Huawei is owned partially by the Chinese government  But as we found out now the you know  What comes around goes around the NSA has been creating its own back doors right into Huawei's networks according to information by Edward Snowden  The the operation code name shot giant  Was looking for links between the People's Liberation Army and Huawei  To exploit Huawei's technology so when their company sold equipment to other countries  The NSA could roam through those networks freely  NSA is good at this

Transcript:  Unbelievable it is amazing now. There's some contra evidently there's some controversy about the story being revealed the New York Times did the story, right?  I'm glad Glenn Greenwald has been defending snow people are arguing with Snowden and and Greenwald says don't blame Snowden Snowden  Headed things to journalists the New York Times decided what to reveal not reveal Greenwald agrees with them revealing this so do I  I think it's hypocritical as hell. They went after Huawei and and and turns out that they themselves are  drilling into the Huawei equipment  but  Snowden himself, you know as long since given up the documents of control of them

Transcript:  You know Claire Kane Miller had an article that appeared in the New York Times that initially the headline of the article was Edward Snowden  Yes revelations cost US tech companies. I saw your tweet. That's how I found out about they've changed the headline revelations of NSA spying  Costs US tech companies. I would just take that revelations off and just say NSA

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't you saw Snowden was I quite disliked Snowden's interview at South by Southwest it had the  Problems up my southwest keynote interviews always have where they were the interviewers take too much time  So Ted that I've made fun of Ted I would confess but I give give big credit to Chris Anderson from Ted  he interviewed Snowden as a  Traveling bot as Sheldon Cooper  At Ted I tell this year and it was really good interview because he gave stone the time to talk and and Snowden is now in his coming  Out phase really interesting. I think  Where he's he's talking about why he did what he did why he would do it again why he defends the Constitution  How he handed things over the journalists he doesn't talk about things unless journalists decided to reveal them, right?  Really really interesting talk the half an hour. I'd recommend  That was just that was just at Ted just adjusted Ted three days ago. Yeah, I'll have to watch it

Transcript:  I'd you know, I'm not  Up to date enough on what exactly he said I'd be doing a disservice  Yeah to the community by trying to summarize it but it was but I think  It was a good set of bookends that if you're going to watch one you should watch the other because they were done  On the same day as I recall or one day apart and they were very specifically done with the idea of being  Not so much a debate as two sides of the same issue and both were well done

Start time: 3728.38
End time: 3793.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But maybe the tenor of the conversation is changing a little bit. I think it is and I think that's why he was you know, I  Don't want to make us into a cynical  Analysis, I don't mean this in any way, but but it couldn't have been handled better by the world's best PR guy  Snowden  Handed it over  Came out and open didn't didn't play cat-and-mouse with the world said I'm a guy who did this  This is why I did this gave a video statement  Disappeared waited out the whole Russia thing  Russia wasn't his fault  People are quick to point out that that he was stopped there by the Americans essentially  Didn't bring anything with him to Russia insists he has nothing there to hand over to them  Waits this out and then now comes out south by southwest  EU  and Ted and  Comes off as I think a very thoughtful  reasonable  caring  Patriotic American my view and obviously my views on the story are apparent  But but I think that yeah  But I think that yeah  I think I think the he waited for the moment when the tide had shifted enough that he could support

Start time: 3794.04
End time: 3868.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That changing view of him. It's really interesting to watch the chat room because there is quite a difference of opinion  Oh, yeah one right after the other. He's an American hero. He's absolutely a traitor  You know, there's great  amount of  disagreement over  Snow yeah, and in our chat room a lot of people think he's a traitor  On the other hand, I feel like the information that we got from him  Yeah, some of it we knew but a lot we didn't and the extent of spying on US citizens is rather dramatic  Mark Zuckerberg and other tech execs including Eric Schmidt  Met on Friday with President Obama to talk about this very issue Zuckerberg has slammed the White House for working too slowly on an essay reform  Read Hastings of Netflix  Dropbox box Palantir all were there a bunch of cloud companies  This is the second time in four months. The White House has met with these guys in response  I think to the feeling that it's costing US businesses a lot of money  And yet we're also hearing  People from the NSA say oh no  These companies knew we were doing this all along including the upstream gathering  Let me see if I can find this because it's not in our rundown

Start time: 3870.77
End time: 4009.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a story from Spencer Ackerman and the Guardian  Yeah  I believe is the one that you're the one that you're looking for and I've read that and all I saw in that story was  Someone saying all of the tech companies that participated in this program did so with knowledge  Because they had been handed some had to or individual right, right and they were for individual  Request to hand over data and the biggest number that I've seen come up is  tens of thousands of emails over the course of one year and that is a far cry from  The story that was incorrectly reported last year about the prism program  Allowing the NSA to have direct access to the servers of Google Facebook Yahoo  Microsoft Apple Skype  And the two others that got thrown in there that nobody even knew about up until that point there's that story  In my opinion has been completely discredited and never retracted  Right prism was and and that's that I what I think about the situation that we're in now  Snowden's revelations is that we've become almost numb to them and  They're now coming out  They're now coming out so fast and furious and so  scattered that had they've been done skillfully in the beginning to focus on the issues that  affecting the privacy of American citizens where they were probably  Violations of American law affecting American citizens. You actually had an opportunity to have  Hearings and legislation to have those specific things addressed now  It's just become this big mess  The NSA is spying on everyone and you have situations like you have in your chat room there where it's basically polarized along  Party lines, although it's the Snowden party. So either either you're a Snowden Greenwald  Defender or you're a you're a you're an NSA defender  There's no room for nuance and especially I don't see any evidence that anyone is doing  Is making a substantive effort to reform these procedures and change US law  And I think that's a a huge lost opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this though is testimony by the NSA's general counsel  Rajesh D in front of the  Privacy and civil liberties oversight board which is a board  Designed by law to give some oversight to the NSA  And he of course we know that the these companies complied with legal  subpoenas they had to or little or national security letters the issue is did they also know about  upstream collection of communications that is  Communications outside of their own network that you know taps into places like they've been pretty clear that they did not  And they say they did not yes  As and Apple said we never heard the term prism

Start time: 4059.24
End time: 4139.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that that one's a bit of a dodge because prism was actually a program for  Accessing data in the store after it had been collected so that so that's I mean that's like  Saying right, you know, you're you know, the the credit card processing company isn't going to know the name of the program  That's running in the bank, right?  You know, those are those are two different things but I I find it  Nearly impossible to believe that the leaders of any of these companies would willingly  Allow the traffic coming in and out of their data centers to be handed over  with no warrant, you know that these people in general the people in the tech industry are  Are  fundamentally  Libertarian it you know  They tilt towards the libertarian side and they've been dealing with these issues long enough that they know what the effect would be of  Them and they know what their they know what their legal rights are as well and they would push back hard on these things  I think that I think that story if that's the impression that you came away with from it  I didn't see it in I didn't see any evidence  That that's true in that story and I don't see any evidence that that's true and anything else  That's been revealed so far

Start time: 4140.22
End time: 4148.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there you go. The story got out there. It got repeated on Twitter, right?  And and we're not going to talk about how many times it was retweeted  We'll talk about how many times it was seen because I'll bet it's in the millions right of times, you know  You can't take back something like that. So even though  Journalistically, they did the right thing to lie correcting the story. It's too late. The impression is out there and  once again, we've got this  Situation where people are going to believe what they want to believe despite the fact that that that the available evidence  Says the exact opposite  Well done, thank you Ed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, I get wound up on this  Yeah  No  In fact the first time we talked to you about this that was you were very clear and I think you did a very  Good job of saying this was misreported in the first instance  Yep  Boy I hate to bring up the iPhone 5c at this point, so maybe I  Did I did thought I think it was very interesting there's another controversial subject and we talked about it on this show  the issue of Comcast and  Netflix  That's got their variance in now. Yeah  Initially we had I had reported I had said yeah, it feels like this is a violation of net neutrality  But then a lot of people responded  Saying no, no, this is business as usual fact we had a guy on Twitter from a streaming media site  Dan Rayburn who was an expert on this saying now this is how business is done with peering on the internet  Well read Hastings now, maybe this is a self-serving but read Hastings in his blog  Called for stronger net neutrality rules and said in fact we were squeezed by Comcast

Start time: 4265.80
End time: 4277.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We didn't want to do this this wasn't said that net neutrality has been talking about the last mile  We've got to talk about far far more upstream from there and have that neutrality apply and end which is exactly true. Yeah

Start time: 4278.86
End time: 4300.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess our initial it's hard to say but our initial  Thoughts about this that the Comcast had turned the knob and slowly decreased Netflix bandwidth over a three-month period  In order to squeeze money at them were not inaccurate  At least read Hastings seems pretty unhappy with the way Comcast and he also calls that AT&T

Start time: 4301.62
End time: 4313.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AT&T then responded. So now we got we were where we always are which was that neutrality said she said yeah  And what we need is government and the FCC to step in and protect. Hello folks us

Transcript:  Well, you know what's fascinating about this to me?  Yeah, I think Jeff Jarvis is absolutely right about this. We do need the government involved in it  We have people who have created a  paradise of capitalism on the internet  handing it taking it away as much as possible from  Delivery mechanisms pipes and tubes that are owned and controlled by the people and not-for-profit and handed them over to  profit-making  Organizations and now we are surprised that there's huge money in different  Segments of the network and that people are arguing over who gets to divvy up our money  and the only you know, it's it's the the genie went out at the bottle a long time ago when  when the internet was privatized and I  I can't decide whether I should laugh or cry at the at the capitalists who are seeing  You know be careful what you wish for in action

Transcript:  So in the AT&T public policy blog Jim Chichoni writes that  Reid Hastings is arrogant  He says we all know there's no such thing as a free lunch and there is no cost free delivery of streaming movies  Someone has to pay that cost. Mr. Hastings arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix  That may be a nice deal if he can get it, but it's not how the internet or telecommunication for that matter has ever worked  Yeah, it really is a he said she said I  Feel like we pay for Netflix to AT&T to comcast by buying bandwidth from them  Netflix pays for its bandwidth through its providers and  It seems like putting up a toll on the road that prevents Netflix from getting to us  Its customers when Comcast says you got to pay extra  But there's a lot of technicals. Just mumbo-jumbo. There's a lot of technical stuff involved here

Transcript:  There's you know, people have been using CDNs content delivery networks  for a long time to insulate themselves from the  costs of  Sudden spikes in in traffic right because this the CDNs have been paying for this stuff all along  And I'm not I am not up to speed on all the issues involved here  But I do know that Netflix has had long-standing relationships with the CDNs and and now are big enough  To essentially be a CDN of their own right? Well in fact they have an open connect

Start time: 4474.12
End time: 4539.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  System designed to do that  In fact cable vision is a participant Hastings writes in his blog post some major ISPs like cable vision already practice strong net neutrality  And for their broadband subscribers the quality of Netflix and other streaming services is outstanding  But on other big ISPs due to a lack of sufficient interconnectivity Netflix performance has been constrained  Subjecting customers who pay a lot of money for high-speed internet to high buffering rates long wait times and poor video  Quality he says once Netflix agrees to pay the ISP interconnect fees, which they have agreed with Comcast  Sufficient capacities made available and high quality services restored if this kind of leverage is effective against Netflix  Imagine the plight of smaller services today and in the future  He calls it an arbitrary tax  It's complicated and I know I I don't know which side I fall in you know  I I've gone back and forth on this a couple of times. It's probably a little much for us to understand  but  We'll try the way I put it in the way

Start time: 4540.74
End time: 4594.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put it in public parts at the end is that if any bit is  Stopped detoured or slowed down along the way to its destination  Then no bit can be presumed to be free all bits are created equal on the net. Yeah full stop  That's that's the principle seems to me. That's pretty basic  Yep, yep, and and so the argument well, but but you know video costs more. Okay, well people are using video  You know figure it out, but there's gonna be other applications that come down the line and  we don't know what this net thing is yet and  It's a strategic necessity of the country to grow the capacity of the net and if we get hung up just over some stupid videos  When there's so much more data to be had out there more that can be done  We're holding up our future. So that's why  Yeah, I want competition. I agree that that's the way to make this work in the long run right now  We don't have competition. So it's time for government to step in and uphold some principles

I think  It will be a big I think it will shut up a lot of the people  Who have been saying Microsoft refuses to let go of its cash cow, right windows?  Yeah

I've been looking at it pretty carefully  Here's the executive summary  The FBI filed a criminal complaint in federal court last week against a former Microsoft employee  They they arrested him in Seattle  At roughly the same time that they filed that complaint and he's being held right now without bail  and they charged him with  leaking not just pre-released Microsoft code but of leaking  the software development kit and  binary code for Microsoft's activation server  That's the product that generates and validates the product keys for Windows and Office and it is literally  The linchpin of a multi-billion dollar business.

And so what you have to do is you have to have processes  And you have to have really good processes in place  The much bigger risks for people frankly are not that  Microsoft is going to poke through your email or that and the NSA is going to the much bigger risk is that a rogue employee  Right is going to start going through email  Randomly and using it to commit identity theft or to blackmail people or or or whatever

I think and I've said this on Twig  I think we've got to get to the point where there's a principle of law that says that private communications are private unless  that the same protection that's given to your first-class mail should be given to email and chats and Skype calls and phone calls and  So on and and obviously  Cops and spies don't like it  But with the death of the first-class letter  You know you have Jimmy Carter this week saying that he still uses mail because he can't trust the internet  Then there's no means of private communication  That's that that is given a legal guarantee of privacy

Nobody else even can get to it  It's that they're not they're not allowed to get there  Access is restricted by biometric control and every single  access of anything that has to do with customer content is  Logged with the employees name the reason for it in the time. Those logs are saved for a number of years  I'm not sure how many and they're randomly audited by internal and external people at regular intervals  I bring that up for Microsoft only because it's the one that I happen to know but I am certain that  Apple and Google and Yahoo just to name three have equally  rigorous data protection procedures in place in their data centers because you cannot do that in  In the year 2014 you cannot be anything less than rigorous with that kind of protection
