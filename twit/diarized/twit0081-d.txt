Transcript:  This is Tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet.  This Week in Tech, episode 81 for Christmas Eve 2006, the early years.  Hi, this is Leo Laporte.  We weren't planning to put out an episode of Tweet on this Christmas Eve 2006, but thanks  to the work of one Alfred Chan of Hong Kong, Intertextus on the Tweet message boards, we  do have an episode.  This is kind of an early years compilation, Alfred put together, episodes 0 through 9.  You'll hear some of the really earliest Tweet stuff.  For those of you who haven't heard these early episodes, it might be kind of fun to hear  how far we've come in some ways and how little we've changed in others.  As always, this episode brought to you by the good folks at Dell.  Remember to check the Leo's Picks page at twit.tv slash Dell.  This will be the last Dell commercial of the year, and unless they renew, maybe the last  Dell commercial ever.  So let's get some clicks.  Just go to twit.tv slash Dell, click any of the links there, and anything you want to  buy, whether it's one of those great Dell 24 inch displays, I'm really loving them,  or a Dell XPS desktop or laptop, or a Dell Dimension, any of the Dell products, even  a TV set we get credit for.  That's twit.tv slash Dell, we thank them for their support in the year 2006.  Once again, thanks to Alfred for putting this together.  Thanks too to all the folks who have made Tweet possible over the past couple of years.  Too many to name, of course all the Tweet panelists, but even people like Ashley Witt  who created the great Tweet ending themes and songs.  I'll play that in full at the end of the show.  Mark Glasgow who did the Tweet opening theme, the Tweet artwork.  Dr. Zack and Snaggy have done the current version, but a number of other people have  worked on it.  Of course, Dorothy Yamamoto who did our original Tweet logo.  Folks at Lullabot and Archetype who did our website.  You can see I can go on and on.  We couldn't do this without all of you, all of you who've donated, all of the folks who  have helped with both money and contributions of other kinds.  Also to our agency, Pod Tractor, who helped sell the Dell and T-Mobile and Visa commercials.  Altogether it's really been a group effort.  Thank you very much.  Have a great Christmas, a happy new year.  We'll be back in 2007 with many more Twits to come.  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

Transcript:  Where the hell are we, David Prager?  Right now we're at the 21st Amendment Bar which is about mere four or five blocks from  the Moscone Center where Mackerel just kicked off early this morning for 2005.  And who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's Patrick Norton.  I have no iPod shuffle, but I'm buying a Mac Mini as soon as I can get to an Apple store.  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what does your lovely wife, Sarah, say about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He can have the Mac Mini, but he can't have the shuffle.  Sorry, not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the shuffle is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, their first fight live on podcast.  So Sarah told me that it was either the couch or the Mac Mini.  So which is it, Sarah?  Couch, Mac Mini?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We'll just take every single PC tower we own and we will build this glorious couch.  It'll look like something out of Ready Made magazine.  Do you really have a Beowulf plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Hey, we want to make a big announcement here though, don't we?  I think we have a big announcement to make.  Go ahead.  They're all looking at me.  David Prager is pregnant.  No, no, no, that's not it.  Oh yeah, we were thinking that maybe we should...  Are you announcing a web ring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is that what you're announcing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think, yeah, well, this is a web ring.  That's kind of trivializing, but I think we should do some sort of alliance of former  tech TV people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So it's not really a syndication of content.  It's an aggregation of content from very select few sources that we have a lot of trust in  and belief in and we know that...  How would you like to be the VP marketing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David sounds like he's a marketing guy, doesn't he?  He just has the keywords, right?  I think he just spun the announcement.  That's funny.  He's the spin dog.  This is the Slate Revenge of the Scrap-A-Bits, April 17th, number one.  Take one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  That's right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cut the chit chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, I don't know exactly what this show, this Revenge of the Screensavers is  going to be.  I mean, it's fun just to sit around and talk and I'd love to invite more people.  Right now we're using Skype to do it, which seems to work fine.  I mean, we've got four people.  The quality is good, you know.  Is it secret that you do DIG or is that known?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's pretty much known.  I'm a fan.  Well, I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DIG, for those who don't know, is one better than Slashdot because instead of some random  taco editing it, the humans who use it, who read it, choose what stories float to the  top.  Exactly.  As more and more people have joined DIG, it's become really better.  I use it as part of my Newsbeat check because I get the most interesting stuff that doesn't  show up anywhere else on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of it's kind of off-eat stuff, but it's cool like that.  There's some articles I find that I haven't seen anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DIG.com.  Hope you'll tune in then.  Thanks to Wayne and Wax at WayneandWax.com for our theme.  Have a great week.  We'll see you later.  Wayne and Wax on the beach, yo, we're in that.  The NED singing sweet, yeah, in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Welcome to the return of the P***y.  Episode 2 for April 24, 2005.  I'm John.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.  I'm the man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hope you'll tune in then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay?  We gotta come up.  You've got a very vocal one percent.  Yeah, they are.  So somebody suggested that we should call this the revenge of these green saviors.  What do you think?  No?  No.  So we got a cease and desist letter.  So what are we gonna call this darn thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'd say we send it to the users, let them come up with a name.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should have a contest.  All the listeners.  All right.  We'll have a contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And what will the prize be?  The glory of having named us.  I will send them a box of stuff I'm clearing out of my garage.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  It's a surprise package.  What's in Patrick's garage?  Find out for yourself at gmail.com.  Send us your submissions.  In the subject line.  In the subject line.  You're right.  Good thinking, Kevin.  You've done this before.  The name of this dang show, and we will consider it a box of Patrick's old crap, will go to  the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy.  They were assigned very hazardous duties.  But I took them away from all that.  And now they work for me.  My name is Charlie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, angels.  This is Leo Laporte welcoming you to the last edition of the Return of the S**t.  Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose, Robert Heron,  and from beyond the grave, John C. Dvorak.  And this the last edition of the Return of the S**t, etc.  We got a lot of good suggestions for the show name, but one of the ones I liked the best,  Patrick, was Sledgecast.  Wouldn't that be great?  It's a Sledgecast.  We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.  We got so many creative, clever submissions.  You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?  Absolutely.  Al Hill said, saved by the geeks.  That's kind of keeping the screensavers idea.  In fact, a number of people did that.  Claudio Flores said, WWSSD, what would the screensavers do?  There was also a G4 eats its young, but in deference to G4.  We'll leave that one out.  Kurt also suggested This Week in Geek, which is the closest to the one we're I think going  to actually use.  What do you think of This Week in Geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's not bad at all.  We can call it Geek Week.  Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, T-W-I-G.  I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to, I think we're going to go.  Robert, you weren't in on this conversation because you were busy finding headsets, but  I think we're going to go with the boring This Week in Tech.  T-W-I-T.  And the only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name what it is because  otherwise when people look at it in the directory, they'll have no clue.  Is that so boring that we should just say no?  Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.  Dead silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the Skype just faded out again.  Oh, it's yeah, it's the Skype problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Same here, Leo.  Same here.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sunspots.  So I've registered twit.tv.  We are all Twits now.  Twit.tv will be the domain.  Real quickly, I just want to mention we've decided not to take advertising, at least  for the time being on the show.  We want to support the show and there are costs associated with it.  So we thought it would be better if we asked for your support, your donations.  I want the podcast to be free and always free.  I think we all agree it's going to be that way.  It'll never be a subscription podcast.  However, we wouldn't mind if you subscribed as a way of donating.  So what I've set up is three buttons on the podcast page and on the feed for your choice.  Not required.  Podcast is free, but if you'd like to support the podcast, you can subscribe for $2 a month  in a recurring subscription.  Now, that's less than a latte a month, less than 50.  It's 50 cents a show.  We see less of it because of course PayPal takes its cut, I think 36 cents.  But I wanted to make it small so that everybody could participate.  The Windows Hardware Engineering Conference was this week.  Bill Gates revealed some details of Longhorn and I know Patrick Extreme Tech sent some  people up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, actually Lloyd Case was up there and I'm sure a couple of the other guys.  It's kind of interesting how much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lloyd's got the softest hair of anybody in showbiz, by the way, I just want to mention.  I'm going to take your word for that.  I myself have never touched Lloyd's hair.  Really nice hair.  I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry, I have this vision of you petting his hair.  I haven't petted your hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You used to pet me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, because your hair is magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Everybody thought it was fake, Leo.  That's why we all had to check to see if it was fake or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that why everybody was touching me?  It was just to see if I was wearing a wig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It could be a badger, it could be the man's hair.  But if it's fake, it's glued on really, really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have like Ted Koppel hair.  I think my hair looks like real hair, doesn't it?  You have a magnificent pet.  I paid a lot of money for this hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, the Longhorn beta was released and everybody made fun of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Avalon looks pretty cool.  That's the graphics layer that's going to replace DirectX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And other than that, they yanked a lot of the really interesting stuff that was supposed  to go in the Longhorn.  No WinFS, the file system, that's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're going to release that afterwards.  2008 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else did they yank out?  I mean, it seems some people are starting to call it Service Pack 3.  So, Bill did speak and he said that even though Longhorn will run on existing hardware, it  won't run beautifully if you really want Avalon and all this, you know, if you really want  the animated icons, which I know I look forward to, and the transparency on the desktop, you're  going to want a 3 GHz processor and a pretty hefty video card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But at this point, you know, by the time it actually ships, dot, dot, dot, you know, that  3 GHz processor should be well down into the $100 range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, meanwhile, while Microsoft's talking about vaporware, Apple comes along on Friday with  Tiger.  Did you upgrade to Tiger?  Kevin, you've been using it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been using it for a little while and I have to tell you, I'm getting more,  I love it.  I really do.  I finally, for the longest time, you know, I watched OS X from a distance and I thought,  oh, that's cool, I like that, but I never really wanted to make the switch.  And with some of the features like Spotlight and some of the other new things, it's just,  it's making more and more sense.  What else do you like about it, Kevin?  The conferencing with the iSight is pretty amazing.  The fact that you can do three people now, the H.264 codec is just, it's amazing.  I've been doing some comparisons for the different videos.  I've been taking portions of our video that we've shot and recompressed them with QuickTime  7 using the new H.264 and it's creating better quality videos, the same bit rates that I  would typically have to bump up to get that type of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on just a second because it looks like we've got a special guest stopping by.  Let me answer the phone and see if we can get him into the Skype conference here.  He's calling me from his fortress of solitude high atop the Berkeley Hills.  Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Dvorak.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  We don't need hecklers.  We got him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Heron.  All with us.  And John, I told John he could be the Bob Hope of the show.  Anytime he wanted to stop by with his golf club, he's welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Absolutely.  The question is, you know, this thing is my Skype is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ASP cuts it off.  Oh, well, one thing you've got to do is turn everything off on the damn computer.  You're cutting off a little bit, actually, as you talk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, now, John, you wrote three columns that we want to talk about today.  One saying podcasting is no big deal.  One saying Skype is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  And the most recent one saying there hasn't been anything new in gaming since first person  shooters were invented.  Do you want to pick one of those to address?  Wow, that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're actually reading these once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why I read them?  People send me irate mail thinking I have some sort of conduit to you saying, can you  tell Dvorak he's full of s***?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, they do that all the time.  They send that to my wife, too.  And I'm so hard to get a hold of.  I've only had the same email address in the past decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Robert is a gamer.  Robert, you want to ask any questions of Mr. Dvorak here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought some of the points were valid.  It was just when it comes to what everyone harps on in the gaming world, like a new title  like Half-Life 2.  I honestly didn't see Half-Life 2 as really pushing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of sequels, but that's true in movies.  It's true in books.  I mean, John, you've written a few sequels to your books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Never.  No, I don't believe in them.  Really?  Is that true?  No, I think everything should be original, one shot only.  Wait a minute.  I've never been a fan of recycling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never did a second edition of any of your books?  Well, yeah, but that was...  Oh, yeah, we lost him.  I was too hard on him already.  Can you hear us, John?  Oh, man.  Okay, now everybody, when John comes back, let's be real nice to him, okay?  This is ironic because the one thing that he liked in those three articles was Skype,  and it's the one thing that's not working for us right now.  It's got to be on his end.  We've been fine.  Oh, you can hear me, John.  Oh, that's weird.  You know what, John?  You could just type and I'll read your answers into the podcast.  I think it's Windows.  Well, anyway.  We were talking before we tried to get this working.  John, I'll tell you what, hang in there.  Maybe you can get it working and show up.  Otherwise, just...  He says the settings shut themselves off, so maybe it's something weird going on with Skype.  You might want to try rebooting.  Dvorak says, rebooting?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I still have my Dvorak in a can recordings that we used on the radio show.  I could probably just fill those in.  I have about 10 quotes from John.  I just play them randomly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get a good soundboard program made up.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Soundboard?  That's a good idea.  I bet you it's out there.  There probably is one.  I bet there is one.  John would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All I can think of is, do you have Dvorak in a can?  Let him out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have some questions for you guys if you'd like to answer them from our listeners.  This is something we'd like to start doing to get a little more interactivity into the show.  Yeah, John says, do you think I'm spidering around five sites right now?  Do you think that's an issue?  Yes.  Don't do anything else.  You're killing your bandwidth.  What was I saying?  Oh, if you want to ask a question, the best way to do it, email us, thisweekintech.gmail.com.  Record your question and we'll play them back on the show.  And our panel of experts will answer them.  You're potted up, John.  You can say anything you want, but we just can't hear you.  John says, can you hear me?  Because I know John's just, you know, this is torture for John, for us to be talking about this.  Totally.  John can't get a word in.  Go ahead, try talking, John.  We're listening.  Let me get another question in for the Twits here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, Patrick, Kevin, Robert Herring, Yoshi, whoever's there.  Anyway, my question basically is, Kevin Rose, you have a Mac Mini.  Did you ever do any kind of like video editing?  I know it's kind of, you know, only a one point something gigahertz processor, but I mean, how is it?  With Tiger on it and iLife O5, I mean, how does it hold up?  Is it worth it?  Or is it worth me going for Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these guys are asking Mac questions.  What's the problem here?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You know, as far as video editing is concerned, I really wouldn't recommend going with the Mini  just because the hard drive is only a 5,400 RPM hard drive.  You're going to have a little bit of a problem if you're looking to do something with a little more production value  where you're actually going to have to sit there and render out frames.  You'll probably want to beef it up a little bit and go with at least a low end G5.  My editor, Keith, in the background is yelling at me not to recommend it.  He's a Premiere Pro type of guy.  He's like, just stick with the PC and get Premiere Pro.  Well, I have to say that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Premiere Pro is just like an editing system, only harder.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Premiere Pro is nice.  Dvorak says, Premiere Pro sucks and the caller sounds like a mass murderer.  I agree with that one.  This Week in Tech, episode 4, May 8th, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it looks as though we're into a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th upper class Twitter of the year show.  And now for something completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are all Twits now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What a great Twit!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we want to thank all of you who have subscribed, by the way, and I'm very happy to say that we had our 1000th subscriber in less than a week.  1000th subscriber was on Saturday and it was Joseph Jan of San Diego, California.  Thank you to everyone who subscribed.  And we thought we'd honor Joseph as our 1000th.  We're going to give him a total bit head headphone amp from Headroom.  Did you see this article?  Malicious applets can install dashboard widgets on Tiger.  Malicious webpages.  You can go there and they'll install these new dashboard widgets.  That could be a problem.  But this is a huge hole that Apple just, you know, basically installed on everybody's system.  If you go, I'll put a, there's a link on slash dot, stefan.com slash widgets slash Zaptastic.  If you go there on a Macintosh, it installs the widget.  I just did it on my system.  And the thing is, the way widgets work, they are installed automatically.  Now this one's not malicious, but it's a good demonstration of the fact that it works.  So what if this widget, the icon of it is, you know, a casino or a porn site?  And you click on it and it brings you to the porn site.  I mean, that's spyware.  That's exactly what's happening on the Windows side.  That's spyware.  I think Apple's got to fix it.  Hey, did you guys know there's a couple of big Google stories in the news?  One, Google was down yesterday for about four hours and for a while was being referred.  Really? Yeah, I saw that.  It was being referred to a site, SoGo site, which is apparently a New York marketing firm that has a Google.net, I think.  Or no, Google.com.net, I think they own.  Google says it wasn't a hack.  It was a DNS error, but it was, I was shocked.  To go to Google and get a 404 is shocking, don't you think?  That's pretty scary.  I felt like I couldn't, I felt debilitated.  I can't use the net.  The broadcast flag.  It's over.  The broadcast flag is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, is the FCC going to appeal that decision?  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't think so?  You think they're going to lie down?  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want to outlaw every piece of hardware that's been sold.  I guess it wouldn't outlaw what you currently own, but suddenly every broad,  every receiver out there that could accept, say, an over-the-air HD signal,  you're going to suddenly make that illegal to even own or resell in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless it has copy protection built in, it has to have the broadcast flag or it's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but everything up to this point, especially on the PC side,  just simply ignores the broadcast flag, ignores it outright.  I just think the FCC says, you know what, how can we possibly go back at this point  after we've let it out of the box?  Cable Industry Association meeting a couple weeks ago,  one of the engineers on the download just said, you know what,  even Microsoft has fully acknowledged that every piece of video technology  they have out there can be cracked, and they expect not simply if, but when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the mod master himself.  What have you been up to these days, Yoshi? We miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Personally, I'm actually out on air here.  I am getting married soon, and I am soon to be a father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, congratulations. Whoa. Yay, Yoshi. That's great.  So can you tell us who the lucky lady is?  Don't say her whole name, we don't want to expose her too quickly.  Carrie, yeah.  Carrie, that's great. Congratulations to you and Carrie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's been pretty much the best thing that's ever happened, so it's pretty cool.  Well, Yoshi, that's...  And everyone that's around me has told me that they've seen an invisible change in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As all of us here will testify, there's nothing like a good woman to tame a bad man.  That sounds like a Johnny Cash song, doesn't it?  I want to mention that Megan was going to join us. Megan Maroney, another longtime friend of ours  and a screen saver, and it is Mother's Day. Her mother is in town, so she couldn't make it,  but she'll come in sometime soon. You know she had twin boys a month ago.  I had dinner with her on Friday night. She and her husband and the three kids,  they had an instant family, came over and it was so great, and her mom too.  So she wishes you all the best. She's just doing great, she's very happy,  and we expect to get her in here doing the show very soon.  We might be able to kind of recreate the screen savers.  I mean the, you know...  I think one by one we'll drag them back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That show we used to do. Let's take some questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to have to bleep that, Leo.  I'll bleep it. God damn it. I got to bleep that too.  Never ending, and that too, and that.  Yeah, I mean this is just for the Twitcast, but it's a central location where people can find out more.  If you want to eat... You like that, Twitcast?  Did you just say Twitcast?  That's it. This is a forget podcast. The future of radio is Twitcast.  It's a Twitcast.  It is a Twitcast. What do you think?  No, I got it. I recorded it in two different ways, so I think we have a Twitcast.  Episode number five for May 15th, 2005.  Alright, who watched MTV Thursday night?  For the big Xbox 360.  Yeah. So what do you think?  I wasn't that impressed.  No, wait a minute. Now three power PC processors, a 500 megahertz ATI processor, 20 gig hard drive.  It's going to be the most powerful computer in your house, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Until the PS3 comes out. I was impressed when I saw the spec sheet.  The games that they've shown, the little clips that they've shown so far don't really look all that impressive to me yet.  But, you know, that's just the way it is. Anytime a new console comes out, the games obviously don't take full potential of all the hardware that's available.  So we'll have to wait a while until we really see some cool games coming out for it.  But I like the way that they're actually going to be tying into some things like the music store so you can download music.  They're actually making this device for the hacked Xboxes that are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in other words, they're giving it media capabilities. You can run music and pictures and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Has anybody been following the MPAA announcements that they're suing?  Yeah, they put BT.  They're taking action against television show Theve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they put BT EF Net off. About six or seven trackers are gone now, nitwits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to hit stuff like that one video aura services like that that are like, oh, you'll get all your sites you want and automatically mines them for you.  So they're seeing that there's a lot of activity there, but I think they should really see the positive side of that and exploit it as a promotional tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing with music for me.  Sometimes I'll download music that I didn't pay for and I'll enjoy it and go out and buy the CD or buy the CD online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to talk to these guys and you'll realize that they see blood. They're furious. It's not it's an emotional reaction.  It's not a rational business decision. The record industry and the movie industry are livid.  And you try to talk to them and say, but they're stealing our stuff. They turn red in the face. Smoke comes out of their ears.  They're not listening. They're not thinking, you know, long term by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With all the MP3 downloads, the Napster's and whatnot, it didn't really affect the sales of CDs.  I mean, they tried to say that it hurt them, hurt them, hurt them. And yet the CD sales still went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I think you can you can make a good case that it's just promotional. It has promotional value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  From what you've heard is 1080p, is that going to be HDD or Blu-ray?  Are they going to actually offer 1080p DVDs to purchase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing yet from the movie studios. They're still focused on 720p 1080i.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get a question in from one of our Twitter listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey everyone, I'm Jonathan from New York City. I just have a question about the standards for between Blu-ray and high definition DVD.  And do you think that there will be a chance or an opportunity to say that both standards might unify into one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was talks of the HDDVD and the Blu-ray converging and then Toshiba denied it.  And then they announced their new triple layer HDDVD. It's up to 45 gigabytes now. So I don't see that as a convergent step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to have universal players. Can you do that? Oh, yeah. I mean, at CES, they showed off two and three pick up systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's got to be much more expensive and complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You only have to once it's built. As all the engineers say, you build it once. That's the expensive part.  As soon as it's built, they tape them out at cheaper and cheaper costs.  They can do it all. They're going to have the multi-format drives because there's no way Sony is going to just suddenly say, oh, let's just join forces and co-create a new format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to do my best Bill Gates impression now.  I don't think the success of the iPod can continue in the long term, however good Apple may be.  I think you can draw parallels here with the computer. Here, too, Apple was once extremely strong with its Macintosh and graphic user interface, like with the iPod today, then lost its position. Sour grapes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the same person who said they'll never need more than 120K memory.  I have that somewhere. I'll play that for you. I think it wasn't even that. It was 640K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like, you'll never need more than 640 kilobytes of anybody will never need more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's only a matter of time. With the latest release of iTunes 4.8, they've added the ability to play videos and download video content.  Now, there's certain albums when you buy them now, they actually come bundled with video.  So it's only a matter of time before they add a portable little handheld player that plays videos as well.  And Apple will do better than anybody else. And that'll be the new rage. And everyone will have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve doesn't think people will want to watch portable video. Now, Steve could change his mind. I think there's probably a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Steve also said that they weren't going to have a flash-based iPod.  And then they came out with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Steve also said it was better to be a pirate than join the Navy and took over the Macintosh project in the dark apple campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve also told me I was a lousy spiker, but that's another matter entirely.  That's right. You played volleyball with him, didn't you?  I did, yeah. This is my one good story in my whole life. And he's very competitive. I was on his team and I didn't play well enough, I think.  Another question from the Twitch. Now, we're the Twits, right? What are we going to call the Twitch listeners?  The Twitch army.  The Twitch army. Ladies and gentlemen. How about you, Yoshi? Are you still building PCs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't built a new one lately. I'm still using, I mean, I'm running Linux as an OS, but I'm running PCs.  I have one that's sitting idle. Get some more hardware for it. But I'm running 6800 Ultra. I haven't tried one of the new 512 Ultras.  I'm a big AMD fan, though, as far as CPUs. I still think for the money they're the best CPUs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're all in agreement on that. Anybody think they'd rather have a Pentium 4, a Prescott?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The last four systems I built were AMD 64s and they're all awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything exciting coming down the pipe? Anybody have any expectations?  A new version of the system is coming out.  A new version of system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yes, it's coming out one week from Monday. It's going to be a device that we built from the ground up.  It's a custom circuit that we created to do something that's never been done before.  Holy cow.  I have another major announcement we'll announce here on Twitch next week that has nothing to do with that, but is big news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Episode number six. Let's take a look, though, at the top stories of the week, starting off with Steve Ballmer.  He gives an interview in Business Week in which he says, Google, ah, they're a one-hit wonder.  Yoshi, what's going on with Google in China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're opening offices over there because they like Yahoo move over there. They want to move their search market into China.  Yahoo actually agreed to censor the results. Now there's talk of, will Google do the same?  A lot of people are really kind of going, hey, Google's like, it's like the press. They want freedom information.  They don't want them to say which information you can get. It's like an ethical thing. Is it right to censor the results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But China could say, no, if you don't do it, we're not going to let you in.  My feeling is I think Google should say, then fine, don't let us in.  It's the biggest market in the world, though, isn't it? I mean, billions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes down to, is there a company about the ethics and the information they provided and the reason why people like Google is because you can get a lot of good information.  Or is it just a matter of making a buck?  Has anybody used the new Google portal?  I started playing with it. I like it a lot. It's really cool. It's real simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing I like is, as you say, it's simpler, so it doesn't clog up your page, but it's got news.  You can have Slashdot or the Times or Wired News or the BBC or Google News.  My favorite thing is you can drag them around live, which you can't do on Yahoo.  So you can rearrange your page, just dragging it around. That's so slick.  It is. I have it as my homepage now.  Yeah, me too.  Yahoo announced this week that Yahoo will have music, will have unlimited downloads for $5 a month, $4.99 when you sign up for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mark Cuban said that, well, if you get an unlimited number of legal music downloads,  that means the RIAA can no longer sue anybody for more than $5 per month.  They were violating peer-to-peer file trading because obviously the value of the music,  of an unlimited amount of music, is $5 per month indefinitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now the issue, of course, the issue, and I asked the lawyer about this, and you're right,  that the compensatory damages are now effectively $5 a month because that's how much it's worth.  But they still go for statutory damages and punitive damages.  So this doesn't let you off the hook.  What it means, and this explains why the record companies in the movie industry go to Congress with bags of money,  because they need there to be statutory penalties so that they can get some, you know, these lawsuits carry some weight.  You don't want to go to prison for that, man. They really treat you poorly.  Oh, he's a file trader. Go get him.  Predictions for you, ladies and gentlemen.  Next month, WWDC, I think Apple's going to pull the switch.  I think Apple has to do a subscription model now on iTunes Music Store.  I think they're going to, in order to do that, they have to announce new iPods.  I think they will, and I think they may well do a video iPod this next month.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I guarantee they're releasing a video iPod. I don't think they're doing it next month.  I'd be surprised if they did that quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe August in Macworld?  A lot of people are saying that the next iPod major development is going to be wireless headphones,  which I've heard from two or three different directions.  There's a lot of people who are saying that Steve is still really, really down on creating a video iPod,  and a lot of people don't think that there's the cooperation there from the motion picture studios.  So it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what I think. Microsoft's just kind of on the offensive, and I mean they're offensive.  You've got Balmer saying Google's a one-hit wonder a couple of weeks ago.  You've got Gates saying the iPod's a one-hit wonder.  I think this is wishful thinking at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And their new Xbox is a big friend to the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point. Hey, you know what? It's time to get our E3 roundup from Roger Chang.  So David, that means I'm going to put you out to pasture. I want to thank you for joining us.  What are you doing these days? You're still at the G4, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, still working there with the current incarnation of screen savers.  Attack of the Show.  Attack of the Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now one more time.  Traeger! Traeger! Traeger!  He turned into a pretty darn good producer.  I mean, he's the guy who arranged the web server up the guy's colorectal area.  He booked the surgeon and everything. I mean, that's, you know...  There's Roger Chang, ladies and gentlemen. Roger, welcome.  Okay, we're going to say you're working at where you're working, but you do not represent them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yes, I work currently for GameSpot in the division of CNET.  It's a very good show. A lot of people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the mainstream media obviously covered the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Microsoft basically went out of the gate with the MTV show that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think they were trying to get the attention before E3.  Exactly. Exactly.  Because they were afraid of what Sony's PlayStation 3 announcement would look like, and I think they did get scooped.  And you know who I really feel sorry for? Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It's interesting because Nintendo really didn't have that much compared to the other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They announced a handheld and a console.  Well, they announced a lot of airs.  But they didn't get any attention for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  They basically announced something they did not have yet.  They announced the Nintendo Revolution, which if you've seen pictures of it in the USA today,  for that, I think it was Wednesday or Thursday, it looks like a broadband modem on its side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So which is the better machine? Is it the 3.2 GHz, 3 3.2 GHz power PCs plus a 500 MHz ATI in the Xbox 360,  or the cell processor running at 3 plus GHz in the PlayStation 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  How do you decide? I mean, they're different architectures.  I mean, you have a multi-core G5 in one, then you have not only a power PC derivative,  but basically entirely new cell architecture.  No one's ever kind of seen that before in a home entertainment device.  The expectations are high, but the expectations high were for the PS2.  When they announced the Emotion Engine, everyone was expecting to be bowled over.  And when it came out, developers having the first games are always going to be kind of a little shotty  because developers haven't had time to exploit the power.  It's been what, four or five years later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The first year of the PS2, it took them to figure out how to program to it.  It was so hard.  And all of a sudden the games got spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  And that's where Microsoft is trying, I think they're trying to leverage is like,  hey, we have a tangible product that you can touch that will work.  When is the Xbox 360 hit the...  It's supposed to come out this fall basically in time for the holiday shopping season.  And it's not till March of next year for the PlayStation 3?  It remains to be seen if what the price point for the PS3 will be.  Most people are probably speculating around 300 bucks,  because any more than that you're going to price yourself out of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to make you spend money, guys, imaginary money on imaginary game consoles.  Robert Heron, PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360?  PlayStation 3.  Yoshi?  Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  How about you, Roger?  Just because it supports... it will act as a Windows media extender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, Xbox or PlayStation 3?  Oh, boy.  I think it's going to be the PS3.  All right. So I've got two PS3s, two Xboxes.  I'm going to break the tie.  It's Xbox, but I might get a PS3 too if the games look that good.  Question from Dorothy.  This is the woman who, by the way, designed our little twit that's on our webpage.  I love that little twit guy.  Isn't he cute?  I think when he's on his side, I think that's an electrical symbol for...  She told me it was like an inducer or something.  And then you turn him around and he's a little guy.  So thank you, Dorothy.  Here we are at the beautiful Kit Kat Club in downtown Toronto.  I'm sitting across from screen star Kevin Rose.  He's the babe toy magnet or the toy babe magnet.  What are you talking about?  That all the girls go for.  The king of the dark tip.  Kevin, tell your loving, adoring audience,  what is it, this big announcement that you can't be on the twit for?  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Okay, so the big announcement is that I'm leaving G4.  What?  You can't leave G4.  It's true.  Are they firing you?  No, they actually...  Tell the truth.  It's okay.  You can tell us.  You're my friend.  The truth is I've been in negotiations with them for the last,  negotiations with them for the last probably close to a month now to get out of my contract.  Really?  So what's the deal?  Well, the deal is I really want to do my own thing.  It's like I've, for the longest time now, it feels that I've just been doing content that I'm not happy with  or haven't been able to get as really as geeky as I want to get with the content.  Right.  And I miss a lot of the old screensaver's days and I just want to get out there and produce and create  really solid downloadable tech content for the web.  And the only way to do it is to actually have some time to do it,  and that's to get out of my contract with G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, this twitcast is really becoming the venue for big announcements.  Yoshi announcing his impending wedding and baby and Roger,  I think I can compare with either one of those.  Roger, you getting the sex change operation?  Anything you want to tell people about or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Not to my knowledge, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, Yoshi said something.  Yoshi said, speaking of sex, I've got to hear this sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of sex, I found out the sex of our baby is a boy.  It's a boy!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  I've already got the URL.  It's a couple years off, obviously, but I registered myfirstmod.com.  It's open now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Episode 7, June 4, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just got that 45-inch Sharp AquaSand.  What a lovely display.  Nice.  1080p.  It's 1080p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  45 inches? How much?  Yeah, eight grand.  Eight grand?  Well, that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's state of the art for what Sharp's doing right now,  and there aren't many displays you can buy right now.  I don't think there is one larger that is actually out on the market yet.  The cool new trend is with smaller flat panels, the 37-inch.  Everyone's shooting at 37 inches with 1080p now,  and they're all for around two grand or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they doing any plasmas with that resolution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure, but it's up in the 70-plus inch range, which is $50,000 on up.  Okay, so if you want 1080p,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you're going to start seeing more and more 1080p high def,  LCD is the way to go.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is like the part in Wizard of Oz  where it goes from black and white to color.  Patrick Norton's about to go from Skype to high quality audio.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  That's better.  Patrick, you're going to be mad at me.  I bought a tablet PC.  I'm not mad at you. I'm laughing at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the worst part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least you're away from Tiger now.  I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you using it to browse in the bathroom?  Do you take it in the bathroom with you in the mornings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there needs to be a 12-step program for me for tablet PCs.  I can't stop using.  So are you drawing on the screen all the time?  Well, you know what I bought it for is for the TV show.  Hey, one of my sponsors on the radio show is a DSL provider.  Just announced that they are now offering normal DSL,  you know, 1.5 megabit DSL, for 15 bucks a month.  I read that.  For how long?  Well, SBC's done it, and so now everybody's dropping.  Can you believe?  Is that for six months, or is that indefinitely?  I don't know what SBCs do.  I think SBCs do it for a few months,  but these guys are guaranteeing for a year.  15 bucks.  That's great.  I really think we're going to start to see big-time price wars  in the high-speed Internet.  I used to always like cable better. I don't know.  What do you have, Kevin? Do you have DSL or cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have cable modem at home, and it's terrible.  You have Adelphia?  Early in the morning, no, Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's too many people in your neighborhood?  In the morning it's fine, and in the afternoon, yeah.  There's too many people in your neighborhood.  I love cable modem.  You like it?  Robert, you said you like it or you don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I think I just cut off on him.  So now...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the cable modem.  There's the answer, right?  So, Kevin, big, big rollout for System last week.  You want to tell the world what happened?  It was just madness. I can't believe what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There was how many people in the chat room, Leo?  We got up to 800 people in the IRC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but you couldn't do anything because we were being bodied the whole time.  However, I've never seen 800 people.  You know, it was like skiing.  The tech's gone by so fast, you feel like it's like blurring.  You feel like you're downhill skiing through text.  It was amazing.  Yeah, so basically we had a little get together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  There was probably about, I don't know, Yosh,  what was it, like 15, 20 people, something like that?  Yeah, about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, when we were there, there was over 800 people in the IRC,  and we were like, whoa.  Do you know how many downloads you got, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to BitTorrent, it's a little over 60,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's great.  We have obviously all the mirrors that were set up.  And how big is the file?  In between 50 to 150 megabytes.  So 60,000 times the speed of light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  60,000 times, let's say, 100 megabytes is 6 terabytes.  Is that right?  Yeah, 6 terabytes.  That's a lot of data.  Holy moly.  Jiminy Christmas.  Good golly.  That's crazy.  Holy megabytes, Batman.  Have you seen, anybody seen the new Batman,  Batman Begins or whatever it is?  It comes out the middle of the month.  Everybody's getting excited.  They say it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that 10-minute preview they showed at the end of Smallville,  the season finale, was, it was awesome looking.  I cannot wait.  That excites me far more than Star Wars did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they've really built a business around it, which is kind of neat.  Something I'll never be able to do because I don't have a head for that stuff.  But it looks like you're doing it, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, we're trying to.  I mean, we've put together a really good team,  and we're excited about cranking on as many episodes as we possibly can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you go there with an unpatched computer, they run,  what they run is PGP, and they encrypt your document files with their password, right?  And they leave a note in your hard drive saying,  you want to get into these files, it will be 200 bucks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is really clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, that's just funny.  What's funny is that it's not one million dollars, it's 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they'll send me the young Russian women's spam.  Yeah, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First you've got to take the Viagra and the Rogaine.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Did you hear about that Viagra that's blinding people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, do you think that's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll go blind if you do that.  Oh, it's true. Your mom was right.  You know who invested in Cialis?  You know, Cialis is one of the competitors for Viagra.  Oh, Bill Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bill Gates.  Anybody been using the new BitTorrent search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're doing. It's called trackerless search.  The reason it's possible for the Motion Picture Association of America  to go after the BitTorrent sites, the supernovas and the TV torrents and all that,  is because there's a tracker.  These guys don't stay up because who can fight deep pockets?  You know, you can't afford to fight it.  But tracker sites aren't hosting any content.  I mean, there's nothing illegal on the tracker site.  It's just putting people together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's going to be interesting to see what happens because now that we're seeing trackers,  because when it was tracked, they were still responsible  because they were actually operating the tracking servers.  So there's somebody you can go after.  Completely trackerless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although you could still, if you could, look, if you're looking for Star Wars  and you start downloading Star Wars, you can see the IP address of the guy you're getting it from, right?  Right.  I mean, that's identifying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's even been addressed now.  I mean, on Slashdot this morning, there's a new BitTorrent replacement, quote unquote, called Rody,  which is written in Java and it actually includes full anonymity.  So you can basically use a third party to block your IP address.  There is no way to figure out who's doing what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could also, you know, there are tools out there to anonymize you.  I'm actually getting one to review and I'll let you know how it works.  There's a product called iFandom that is very slick, which gives you full anonymity.  This is a little box.  You would put it outside your router.  It's not doing that.  It filters all your traffic through their servers.  And their servers look for viruses, spyware, but also because you're going through their servers,  it's in effect a proxy.  It's not a proxy, but it works like an anonymizing proxy.  Nobody can see your IP address.  And this is iFandom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's called iFandom.  Leo, I have a guest here I want you to talk to.  He's sitting right next to me, Mr. Dan Huard.  Yeah!  It's Fufu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Hey, Dan.  Hey, how are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  How are you doing, Dan?  You're working on system full time?  Yeah, if you're so kind.  Yeah, if you're so, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's what the boss tells me.  You're getting a paycheck?  I think so.  It's checks in the mail, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so great to talk to you.  You know, on Mother's Day, I tried to...  On Mother's Day, I saw you come on IM, so I started typing it.  It was your mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, my mom.  She came on.  That's right.  She told me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very sweet.  We had a lovely conversation.  We've had a relationship with ThinkGeek for ages and ages, too.  And they want to do some merchandising.  And Jinx just does t-shirts, right?  Yeah, they just do t-shirts.  So we'll give Jinx the t-shirt concession, but I want action figures, and we'll get ThinkGeek to sell those, okay?  Sounds good.  Yoshi, you can have a lightsaber on your action figure.  I wanted the samurai sword.  Okay, okay.  I want Kung Fu grip.  Okay, Fufu's Kung Fu grip.  Try to say that three times.  Fufu's Kung Fu grip.  We'll call it the Kung Fu Fufu grip.  I want the string that comes out of my back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Names!  Names!  Dan doesn't like Fufu.  You can't call him that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too late, dude.  You are Fufu.  You are the Fu.  Big Longhorn.  Are you ready?  The big Longhorn announcement, right?  They took out the file system.  They've taken out anything good.  But they do have a new feature you're going to love in Longhorn.  No more My.  It's no more My music, My pictures, My folders, My network.  None of that.  It's now a computer.  It's just going to be documents, music, pictures.  No more My.  Amazing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Amazing selling point right there.  I'm up for it for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Then how many years is this going to push back development?  Well, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.  By the way.  They just picked up six months of development time.  Yeah, sorry.  But no My.  It's going to be worth it.  We didn't really get to talk about this last week, so let's talk about this week.  Pentium D, the dual core Pentium.  Going to the desktop.  It's the end of the line for single core processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then there's almost a performance improvement if you use a couple of obscure benchmarks.  Robert, you probably have been following this closer than I have, but I'm not seeing  much that doesn't make me want to go for a much less expensive Athlon 64 compared to  the Pentium D.  I was going to say Intel who?  Is Intel in trouble?  Is this it?  I mean, for desktop CPUs, it's losing favor with the hardcore group.  Definitely.  With AMD's X2 coming up, that is the most powerful processor you can buy.  But anyway, all our performance numbers for video encoding, audio encoding, gaming, everything  just puts that chip at the forefront.  Well, I bought a Pentium M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this type of this pad is a Pentium M.  I mean, that's the best laptop chip still, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Another reason I'm buying my IBM's.  I love IBM's notebook keyboards.  I'm nervous about the Lenovo takeover on IBM though.  Yeah, I mean, that's the Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of governments, look what the did you see what the MPAA announced today?  Said they're putting up 10 surveillance cameras on the streets of L.A. to catch DVD pirates.  Can a private group put up surveillance cameras on the street?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it even possible to know how much money they actually lose worldwide to piracy?  But it's kind of like funny because they're always doing really nickel and dime things.  Because maybe the only place they can do them is inside the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how much money are they spending trying to enforce all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the lawyers are already on retainer.  I wish they would just simply put that effort into creating more formats for us at better quality and cheaper prices.  And I think the problem would solve itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sunday, June 5th, 2005, episode number eight.  Tomorrow, June 6th, Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the Worldwide Developer Conference.  And if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed, if CNET is to be believed,  he will announce that future Macs will not have PowerPC chips in them, but will have instead Intel chips.  That, to me, is a huge story.  Frankly, I've been saying this is the end of the world for Apple.  That Apple is, this is Apple shooting itself in the foot, committing harry-carry.  It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.  And the first person I thought of to call was John C. DeVorek.  I actually used this technology. They called a telephone and called John.  And I asked him what he thought about all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you sure make this sound dour. I have just the opposite of take that you have on this.  I mean, you're making it sound like, first of all, let's go over this.  And I did have this written up in 2003.  And I expected it to happen last year in 2004 based on what I heard that was going on.  It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part,  which is going to be the things that allow some of the software to run on the new platform,  much the same way the PowerPC made its transition.  I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for Apple that the companies could ever imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what do they stand to gain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, what they stand to gain, first of all, is they can bring out a standardized Intel platform running this OS X.  They can also manufacture standard PCs for people who want to maybe still use Windows,  even though I think that there may be a swing toward OS X for Intel, which I call a Mac Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think they're going to make a dual boot system that runs both Windows and Apple? Is that the...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think it's doable. And I think also if I had a choice, I could say for most PC users,  and I've just written this up for PC Magazine, it'll be running tomorrow,  I think most of these computers that we have on our desk, the PC users, have all the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.  I agree with you.  People will spend a few extra dollars to have a good-looking computer.  That means Apple can sell against Dell and HP the same machine with a premium price,  getting the margins that those other guys will never get, and pretty much decimate the market.  I think this is probably the biggest thing Apple has ever done in terms of potentially becoming a dominant computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's? Are they going to rewrite their software? What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, they've done it before. This is a recompilation thing anyway.  Adobe already has this software running on the x86 system. How difficult can it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it could be very difficult because their Windows version relies on Windows API, which is non-existent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's a middleware company that Apple is involved with right now, and this is going to take care of that issue.  This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the middleware company I think you're thinking of is Transitive.  In the change from 68,000 to PowerPC, these were very similar chips.  They were able to make it possible for the operating system to run both with something called fat binaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Of course, my argument is this, is that Apple, this is the time for Apple to do it.  They can suffer through a transition like this, which I agree with that part.  It's not going to be easy. But with the iPod iTunes thing making tons of money for them, this is the time to make this move.  Because this long term is a fantastic idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's gutsy. I think we're going to look at tomorrow as the day Apple committed suicide.  And here's why I think the exact opposite, John.  First of all, they're on a platform that is far from moribund.  I think that the cell chip, which is a PowerPC based chip, is a very exciting future chip.  I think the Intel platform, on the other hand, has run out of steam.  I think they're moving to a processor platform that is seeing the end of its line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The new multi-threaded, multi-core Intel chips are nothing to be sneezed at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. The new, the Pentium D and the hyper-threading and then dual cores, they're trying to keep this chip family alive.  But it's not a long term solution.  What about the notion of Intel maybe doing something new for Apple? Do you think that's credible?  No.  It's going to be an Intel x86 chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It has to be. If they did something like what you just described, which nobody said, that's purely just off the wall.  Highly speculative, yeah.  Yeah, it's totally. There's no evidence of this. Of course, you never know. But we would have known about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you believe the CNET report. You think this will happen tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. And the Wall Street Journal is also kind of saying it's a done deal.  And then there's a blogger out there, which I link to in my blog, if you go to dvorak.org.  He made this observation that he found a language observation.  He looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't, neither CNET nor the Wall Street Journal had any weasel words in their stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They seem adamant, yeah.  You know, it scares the heck out of me. It doesn't seem like it's necessary. I think Apple's in a good position right now.  It is a very gutsy move. I mean, your scenario is attractive.  If they could start shipping computers that would run both Windows and OS X, I think there's a big market for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think it's a huge market for it. And I think the other upside for Apple would be that they get...  One of the problems they're always going to have with only selling one million computers a quarter,  compared to the 100 to 175 million machines that are sold every year, this is a ridiculously low number,  is that you can't get the developer interest that you can to a market that has 100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think that that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys for rewriting all of their software?  You think Microsoft's going to play along? Office is critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think Microsoft... No, I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.  And besides that, if you bring out a dual boot machine, who cares?  But the point is that I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath...  I mean, that's why they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft products.  And ever since Macintosh Basic, the product that was killed by Microsoft,  the people in the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their own thing.  And there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on Unix machines.  I mean, some of it has crappy menuing systems, unfortunately, because the Unix guys, they think weird.  But, you know, except for that picadillo, I think most of this stuff,  I think you can outfit an OS X machine with no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is the kind of machine that if I was a computer buyer and I had the lineup of different machines out there,  and Apple, which has already developed its name as a kind of a, like I mentioned in the column tomorrow,  kind of the Lexus compared to the Fords and Chevys, Dell and HP, I think I would buy a Lexus computer.  I mean, something that's a little nicer, definitely a better looking machine with a lot of cache,  I would get the Macintosh in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there you have it, John. Thank you on such short notice for coming on the show.  Anytime, Leo, you know me.  So there you have it, John C. Dvorak. He says it's a done deal and it's a great idea.  You know, you heard me. I just don't buy it.  You think it's a good idea, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they've got to be able to get the chips cheaper.  They've got to have access to better chipsets.  It just seems like Dvorak had a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, if they're tapping into an architecture that's going out to 125, 175 million PCs a year, it's a lot easier to get deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying they had to for economic reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they've probably had to for economic reasons and it's probably getting really difficult to compete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the third reason. I think it's a very compelling reason. It's the Osborne effect.  They're announcing now that in six months, the Mini will be based on Intel and in 18 months, all of their products will be based on Intel.  They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.  No, I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  All right, Kevin, you explain it to me.  This is so exciting. I'm stoked.  I mean, I have two Macs, I have three PCs, and the only reason I don't just have one computer is because I want OS X and I also want to be able to play my games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do like a dual boot. I do like, and Dvorak brought that up, a dual boot PC Mac is attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's a total fantasy. You don't think that'll happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It can happen if it's based on Intel chips. And the other thing is you don't have to do a boot at all.  They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside OS X.  That's a good point.  You can be native on the x86 based processor, so you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you were running it in like a processor emulation type mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're exactly right. You don't have to do a dual boot. You could just have two Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll buy emulatable or hackable, but I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual boot Macintosh system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple hardware.  If you take apart a G5, open it up, play with it, upgrade it, everything is laid out so clean and so well.  The power supply, every piece of that computer is so well engineered it blew me away.  And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that could run not only my Mac applications, but my Windows as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we've done this to death. Let's just go round the horn and cast a thumbs up or thumbs down.  Good for Apple, bad for Apple. Kevin Rose?  Thumbs up.  Robert Heron?  I'd say thumbs down for the hardware side.  Roger Chang?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I'd say thumbs up for software and thumbs down for the hardware.  Oh, you little weasel. Patrick Norton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it makes for a cheaper Mac, great, but I still don't believe it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple. I'm very disappointed.  A special midweek edition, episode 8A for June 8th, 2005.  We decided to release an extra edition of This Week in Tech this week due to the big Apple Intel announcement.  Patrick Norton joined me at the Thirsty Bear Brewery next door to the Worldwide Developer Conference at Moscone Center.  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean for podcast people, this is like rock stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These are the guys with the clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From the folks at iPodderX, Ray Slikinski, who does the back end Python stuff, and August Trumeter, who is the UI guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tremendous work developing the podcast community on OS X with some brilliant software that's been available for everyone.  So now the professionals are going to take in and we're going to put it inside of iTunes where it belongs  and hopefully we can monetize it to the greater glory of the Apple community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We knew that iTunes was coming, but we didn't think it was coming as soon as it was.  But we angled iPodderX to be a media aggregator.  It turned out to be a very fortunate thing because now we can compete with more features than iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did Steve say? Did he give us more information than he did on the Wall Street Journal thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not really. He gave a quick demo where he showed a screen of where you can, within the music store, to select and choose podcasts.  You would buy them?  There was no buy information. It was just click and then it was added. He mentioned that it was for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick, we haven't seen each other since we talked about the Intel announcement.  It was speculative the last time we talked. It's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But isn't there some sick little angry part of your heart that sees this great, you take the Apple style,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you throw it on an Intel compatible processor, you get it out in the market, people can use the OS X,  people will be able to, God help them, run Windows XP on it, assuming unless the Apple never ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this earlier. Phil Schiller was very clear that we will never sell OS X without an Apple box.  That's our business' hardware. But he did say that you'd be able to buy a dual boot platform.  Now Ray, who's by the way a hacker at heart, how long, I know you're not doing this anymore,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but how long before somebody figures out how to separate the heart?  Six months to a year, if that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then at some point you'll be able to download OS X Intel and put it on your PC.  You're all Coco? You're 100% Coco?  Yeah.  So the pitch Steve gave is that, well, if you're Coco, it's 20 minutes work. True?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I think for the most part pretty much. It is as easy as a checkbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? In Xcode? In Xcode 2.1?  Yeah.  I mean obviously when you start a new project in Xcode, it probably says, does it say FAT binary,  what does it say, PowerPC, Intel, what is the, do you have a choice when you do a new project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's when you build, it's part of the target properties. So when you're building, you choose if it's going to be a universal binary.  That's what they're calling it now, not FAT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I thought that was a good marketing term. We're going to call it universal instead of FAT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better idea.  The Rosetta part actually does work quite well.  What's Rosetta? Tell me about that. Is that the transitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the transitive software?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  You can run your PowerPC binary on Intel through this.  It's middleware. Yeah, it's an emulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an emulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We actually, we ran a...  Do you run on it?  Yeah, we ran iPod or X on an Intel machine through Rosetta, the translator, and it's completely transparent.  Rosetta is Apple's name for it, but end users will never know about it. And it worked just fine. Everything ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the general reaction on the floor from developers? Dismay, excitement, worry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spend a lot of time in the Intel room kind of listening to reactions, and for the most part it's positive.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Even the little guys who are going to have to spend some money on this, they're saying this is something they want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this is a developing machine and I'm not sure how much I can actually say about it, but it's fast.  It'll make porting applications from Windows to Mac also a lot easier, I think, because just the processor and the low-level stuff that you'd be working on would be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. VMware is still around. I mean, that was what VMware was, was it allowed you to have a virtual engine that you could run multiple operating systems in Windows.  VMware.  Now, that's exciting. I would love to see a VMware or Intel that had... I have OS X. You'd have to buy it from Apple.  Obviously, the hardware would have to be Apple hardware. You wouldn't have the OS X part, but if you could buy a Windows disk and stick that in there, man, that would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm wondering how long that's going to last.  You think Apple will stop that or Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that...  You think Apple will sell software?  No, I think that home hobbyists, hackers, will have that running on a white box. It can probably last in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  August, it's really been great to meet you.  Great to meet you. Thanks very much.  I love iPod or X and someday I know, Twitter will be number one on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  Hacker.  You hacker.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love iPod or X and we really appreciate what you've done. It is the best way to get our podcasts.  We're in the directory, right?  Yes.  And we're actually... No, we've been an iPod or X pick for at least a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And you're in the top picks list as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. That's what I mean. You guys have picked us. And that's you, not...  Yeah, that's not user...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We're not influenced by anything you might say here today at all.  The suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fish cheeks, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gave you fish cheeks. What more could you ask for? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we disappeared off the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Episode 9, recorded Sunday, June 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems like too, the less you pay for a computer, the more extra crap you get installed on it.  Either through deals made, through the manufacturer or something to that effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're in a crap... This is a crap society. We're in a crap generation.  There's crap everywhere. There's ads everywhere. There's no... You know, there's... I'm cranky old man. That's all crap.  You okay there, Leo?  Crap.  Hey, did you see that the OS 10.4.1, the Intel OS 10 is apparently on the wear sites already?  Yes, that's awesome. I can't wait to get a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Less than a week.  I have to get a copy. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is this about Apple being a hardware company when now all the focus is on their potential takeover...  Not anymore.  ...in the OS world?  Who predicted this last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did. You did.  I didn't think it'd be cracked so fast. This forces them to sell it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It hasn't been cracked. This has just been leaked off the developer system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you run this 10.4.1 on a white box PC now?  From what I hear...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's the rumor.  I was speaking with a friend of mine who's a Mac developer and he was at the conference and he said he actually got a chance to play around with the machine.  He was looking inside of it and it's just a standard Intel motherboard, standard onboard Intel graphics, you know, off the shelf kind of stuff.  So I don't see any reason why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, the minute it's cracked, if you think it forward, then Apple's going to have to do a shrink wrap release of it.  And then all of a sudden they are a software company.  They screwed the pooch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're just not a happy man today, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They screwed the pooch, I'm telling you. I hate Windows. I hate Apple.  What's left? Linux?  Pfft.  Piece of crap.  Alright, well let's change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AMD details early quad-core plans.  Core plans.  Story of Friday, they did an analyst briefing.  Specifically, multi-core microprocessors and 64-bit processing.  Whole idea of like four processors on a chip is a little disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, is it... they're just going to leapfrog right over the penny MD.  I mean, obviously this is a marketing move.  They're not going to do two. They'll do four.  Is this aimed at workstations or is it aimed at servers?  Is this desktop?  This is more the server end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  During the first quarter of 2005, AMD captured 28% of the total market for four-way servers.  It's simply that it's cheaper to build more cores than it is to keep shrinking the process at this current time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just strikes me as kind of capitulation from the chip manufacturers.  They're saying, yeah, well, we just really can't get our chips much faster or much more efficient, so we'll just put more of them on a die.  It's like, it's a clue.  They're good for servers because you're doing transactions, but they're not great for desktops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what the Intel guys were saying over and over?  The dual-core Pentiums, you're going to feel a difference as an end user.  And I remember this guy I used to co-host a television program was an early dual processor system fanatic.  It's true. And I still have that right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was Leo LaForte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was me. I still have my dual Pentium 3s, and that's why I know how crappy it is.  But that's...  I think dual processors are fine. It makes a lot of sense for a certain class of application.  It works where there's a lot of things happening simultaneously.  I do think it's in a way saying, yeah, we just really couldn't make these processors any more efficient.  We have no other way to go.  It just seems to me that, right, I mean, it's more of a marketing thing than a...  Well, it's all marketing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you rather they accelerate it to a 6 GHz processor that was 4% faster than the 4 GHz processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right. You're right. We haven't seen much improvement.  I'm still using a Pentium 4 2.4 GHz, and it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Don't you feel as though that this is a good step, though, in the right direction?  I mean, we have so many...  This is something that Apple did a long time ago with the G4s.  Remember, they couldn't really get the speed of performance that they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Apple did that because they were flatlined on their processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's happened to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's what's happening with Intel right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. More to the point, I mean, you've got Prescott, which is really a flopped chip  because the pipelines were too deep, the branch prediction wasn't good enough,  and it generates 1,000 watts.  Things like a little... It uses a hair dryer.  If they had the choice, I mean, you'd want to have a faster processor as well.  Are we not going to have faster processors?  Is that the end of the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think processors are definitely going to get faster.  And then the scientists are just coming up with the new single atom switching  using quantum mechanic, or the quantum spin.  So hopefully we'll have... That's another way they could reduce heat.  Well, on the PC side, they have their Crossfire motherboards that they're showing off already,  and the chipsets that support two cards in the same system.  And it's SLI.  A nice advantage that they have over Nvidia's SLI is that the cards don't have to be exactly matched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Man, I'm not going to touch those for a long time.  Have you guys run into the same problems?  I know we tried to do a couple demos on the show of the SLI,  and it was just buggy, and certain games didn't work right.  At its launch, there were some issues.  Are you guys recommending any of these SLIs or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd say we're past that very first bleeding edge generation of motherboards that supported it.  So now there's, I'd say, a half a dozen good options out there.  But right now you can only buy Nvidia's solution.  That's mature enough to recommend.  ATIs was just announced.  I don't believe you can actually buy anything right now regarding that.  I'm getting in two more displays this week.  I'm getting in Pioneer's new 50-inch Plasma.  I find Plasma's better for video.  Yeah, but...  If you plan on watching video, Plasma is hard to beat.  I mean, LCD's coming on, but where LCD matches Plasma,  the pricing level and the size level, it's almost twice as much money.  Like, you looking for 50 inches or bigger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. It could be smaller than that.  I just want a nice screen. I want a 1080p.  Like, 42?  Yeah, 42's fine. I just want 1080p is what I really want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one nice advantage of LCD, at least for that sharp, in normal viewing light, bright, brightly lit rooms.  I think it's awesome.  Actually, I think it looks a little bit better.  Because sometimes with most LCD technology, you don't get the really, really dark blacks.  And if you're sitting in a dimly lit room, but as the brighter the ambient lighting becomes...  By contrast.  Say if something looks gray on the screen, it'll get darker and darker looking.  So your eyes tend to see things darker the brighter it is with the ambient lighting itself.  So for brightness, yes.  For all the bells and whistles of a $7,000, $8,000 display, it is...  I'm pretty impressed. I'm writing up a good review of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Patrick sent me a link. Is this a Tech TV On This Date photo blog?  What is the deal on this, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, somebody... It's a collection of stills from the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, this is awesome. And the spy cam, too. I see it.  It's techtv-otd.texthamerica.com. It's techtvonthisdate.texthamerica.com.  And it's kind of cool. It's like, what's going on? What happened on this day in tech TV history?  What is this about DVD Decrypter? Did it go out of business? What happened? The website's down, right?  They got a cease and desist. You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, they did. Gone.  I think they gave it to the wrong guys, though. Did you guys... I never used Decrypter. I was always a shrink guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that the problem? Was the DVD Decrypter was a company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were... What was it? A Lightning UK?  Basically, they were given a cease and desist and anyone hosting the file was told to take it down.  And the person who was the author of the application said that, you know what?  They don't have the time or the resources to put up any kind of defense against this. So...  Yeah, the CD Freaks posted a letter he wrote.  If 321 Studios can't do with millions, what chance do I have to fight this 50-pound sterling?  Totally.  Although the rumor is that Sony served him the notice.  Because the slash title is the best quote, as it is rumored that he broke their new copyright protection within 72 hours of its release.  Wow. That was my favorite thing about that app.  It didn't matter what DVD you had ahold of. You could just strip it, get it on your hard drive,  and you don't have to worry about region codes or do I need the disc or am I going to scratch the disc?  Sure, it can be a pirate tool. Everything can be a pirate tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Robert's pirating DVDs to sell them on the streets. He wants to make backup copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo, you're saying, you know, we're the well-behaved people that are disciplined and only backup copies for our own use.  But look, there's no way to establish the relationship between file trading and piracy and lost sales, right?  But if you think about it, there's an entire generation of teenagers that look at you like you're on crack if you talk about buying music, you know, because they download it all.  I mean, it's going to be interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm tracking though. I just launched a new version of system, by the way.
