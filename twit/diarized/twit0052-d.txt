Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 52 for April 30, 2006.  Bandwidth for the TWIT.TV network is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  He's back from Brazil and looking sharp, got that Brazilian wax I see, John C. DeVore, hello John.  Ouch. What were you doing in Brazil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I write for a magazine down there called Info, which is short for Info at Zemi.  And it's, I'm one of the lead columnists and they had the 20th anniversary party so I was there and helped them celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds like a good party. Robert Heron is also here, he had some advice on what to drink in Brazil.  What was that that you wanted him to?  Ooh, what was that?  Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-nanya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ca-cha-cha-cha.  Did you have any John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'd have that stuff around all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, with a good bottle of Bordeaux there's nothing better than Ca-cha-cha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's essentially the Brazilian's version of rum.  It doesn't taste like rum, it's a distinctive flavor and all the variations all have this unique taste.  So it's made with an alambic still and it's more like, say if rum was like a brandy, this would be like an Arminiak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, alright, the Arminiak of rums.  Yep.  David Prager is here who probably has something to add to this conversation as well. Hello David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey there, I'm all about different types of alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is turning into DIG, Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh god, I don't know. No, in DIG they'll be talking about the illegal alcohols.  What is it that they can't sell here that's got warm wood in it?  Absinthe.  Ask Kevin about absinthe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, you can get warm wood based absinthe in the United States. That law changed.  Oh really?  Not as powerful as it used to be. But yeah, you can go again and there's various brands available.  Isn't it highly poisonous? Isn't it just?  No, it was over, that's exaggerated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's because it's hallucinogenic and they don't want people hallucinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I think that's exaggerated too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well John, you can try it for us and let us know.  I've tried it.  Did you do the whole thing with the green lady and you pour it through the sugar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's overrated, it was something that was cool to learn in 1900.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the turn of the century. Here we are talking about turn of the century technology.  The story of course, I guess, I mean it was kind of a slow week this week.  If this is the biggest story then that really proves it.  Nintendo and the Wii.  Actually, I put an article in the show notes that I thought was kind of right on saying that this is really just a bogus attempt to get some publicity as we approach E3.  A bogus attempt by Nintendo?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A bogus attempt. How can it be bogus? We were given them publicity now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right, it's not bogus, but so what? I guess there's nothing new to say except that they've changed the name from Revolution to Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think the main problem aside from the fact that I'll even agree that Wii is kind of a stupid name is that they have a significant amount of branding that's invested in Revolution.  Everyone is familiar with Nintendo Revolution and everyone seemed to like it.  So what basically I think a lot of people have said about is that why throw Nintendo Revolution away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wii is friendlier. It's a more friendly name than Xbox, it's a more friendly name than PlayStation.  And since it is in fact a kids...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well look what happened with Windows Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me and Wii. Oh it could go down, it could be like the Coke classic of technology, Me and Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think Nintendo stands by the merits of their system as a gaming machine and not a home media center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aaron McKenna writing in Tom's Hardware said that Wii is not even pronounceable in Japanese.  That the Japanese can't even say it. Although they like it in France because it means yes in France, right?  Wii.  Wii. Say Wii. But he also points out there's nothing really to say about it and it's just a tempting...  Look I guess E3 is May 9th. Microsoft's going to try to get attention by announcing a Blu-ray for the Xbox 360.  HDDV.  Oh it's HDDV not Blu-ray.  Not Microsoft.  Oh that's right. I can't follow it all. Sony is Blu-ray. Microsoft is HDDV.  Although a lot of computer manufacturers like Blu-ray because it stores more on the disk. It's a better data format, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Supposedly. But what's available and what are the costs per disk? That's always the big question for blank media.  None of this stuff is available yet although the drives are supposedly coming in another month or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually I'm told that you can, in fact I think you can buy Blu-ray disks, writeables. They're 20 bucks a pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Rewriteables or just write-ables?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're just one write right now.  I could be wrong but my understanding is it's a one write verbatim disk. I think it's 25 gigs for 19 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how much data do they store?  Well that's not much. And Blu-ray is what 47? 40? How much is it?  Oh no, Blu-ray will be 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a 25 per layer.  Oh per layer.  There's going to be two layers but with these first writeables I think there's only one layer available so it's going to be 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what is HDDVD? How much does that store?  15 gigs.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then each layer. And then so they were looking at a three layer disk for 45 or combinations thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Something like that. It's kind of a confused mess right now.  The players are out though. If you can find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a Blu-ray? I know HDDVD is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HDDVD is out, yes.  Blu-ray is still not out.  Yeah, actually you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Blu-ray is another month and a half. The HDs are sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got a flyer in a magazine. It's May 23rd and it's official Blu-ray disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh really? They moved it to May 23rd?  So there's actual advertising out in the place now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know they had to place that.  I mean I just got a brand new home theater magazine.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a place that had three months ago. I think that's probably when they thought they were going to have it out, right?  How quick, what's the turnaround for ad time in magazines? It's months, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not anymore. Actually the ads go in last.  Oh, alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was one you could actually pull out of the magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course.  Oh, it's a blow and that could go really at the last minute.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are most of these magazines, like PC Magazine, using Quark to put all their publishing together or what? Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I was just running into, I was at a magazine the other day and they were using Quark, which I think still most people do,  but everybody seems to be talking about or moving to InDesign and I think that's really the future of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh absolutely. They use Quark because they have used Quark. They have Quark.  There's a lot of inertia, but InDesign is so much better.  Although ironically, Quark came out in an Intel dual binary before they were able to do that with InDesign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well before Quark it was PageMaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, PageMaker's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, Quark, people don't like working with them. They're quite arrogant.  Oh really, is that part of the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've found it to be the case.  InDesign is from Adobe of course and if you're already in Adobe House it's an easy thing to do.  I shouldn't say PageMaker's gone. Adobe owns it. I don't know if they, I mean I don't know if people still use it, but it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually I think FrameMaker's also owned by Adobe now and I think that's still available.  I think book publishers still use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. If you've got a workflow all tied into one particular program, it's a lot to change it over.  How do we get to this from Blu-ray? I don't know.  Oh, I don't know. That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking about the pudding to add.  Nobody knows how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So HDVD's already, I already got some movies released though, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just the hardware right now. I haven't seen it for sale since the initial launch, those initial 10,000 units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the interesting press release that came across my desk this week was the announcement by Warner Home Video that they will be producing all their DVDs with DVD9 on one side and the flip side will be an HD DVD disc format.  So you can flip the thing over and use it in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  DVD9 is Microsoft's DVD Extreme format, is that right?  Well, no, DVD9 is just dual, two-layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, standard DVD.  Yeah, standard DVD.  So that's what it's called, DVD9?  That's the term for the dual-layer version.  You have DVD5 for single-layer, DVD9 for dual-layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're going to have hybrid DVDs then. They'll have one that plays in the old player and you flip it over and it plays in the new player.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's not only cool, but it's a stroke of genius.  This is not really nothing new.  If you remember when there were no such thing as a DVD9 early on, just a DVD5, they used to bring out, in fact, I have a few of these, a disc with one side would be normal, the ratio is 4 by 3, and the flip side would be a letter box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I have a few of those. I still get them from Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So they have the equipment to make those and you can use the old equipment to make the new HD DVD so that makes it easy to do this process.  And so I think this is like really a dangerous situation for Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want that just for comparison purposes. It would be nice to, you know, if you have a good enough TV, compare the quality of the DVD format versus HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are Blu-ray and HD DVD so different that you couldn't do the same thing with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem with, technically, the HD DVD is the old fashioned style of making this where the reflective coating is deep inside the plastic, usually all the way on the other side on the back, although you can push it down a little bit because of these dual flipables, they can put it in the middle.  But the Blu-ray, the reflective coating is on the top and in other words, where the Blu-ray is hitting as opposed to underneath the label.  And, you know, I was thinking about that myself. I think it's almost possible for the Blu-ray to make the same kind of thing, but the problem there is the equipment.  Because the compatible equipment for HD DVD makes it kind of simple and brain dead to do this flippable work.  It's so similar to the old DVD format.  Right. It's the same equipment, the same stamping equipment. With Blu-ray, it's new equipment and you'd have to have a hybrid type of gear. I just don't think it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sony did do something similar with SACD where they would, on the top layer, it would appear to be a standard CD audio disc, but if it would read below that first layer, it would be the SACD part of the disc.  And that was kind of neat because you'd have backward compatibility on the single side, but I don't know if they can do that with video or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some real issues. A year ago we were talking about this, it seemed very clear and everybody seemed confident that there would be dual format players, so you wouldn't have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that came up in the conversation a couple of times. I did actually have this happen on Cranky Geeks too. I think we've talked about it on this show a couple of times.  What happened?  Well, what happened, it turns out that if you license Blu-ray, there's provisions that don't allow you to do the other formats.  Oh, jeez.  If you're a machine man. In other words, if I'm, that's what happened with Samsung. Samsung said, yeah, we're going to do a dual thing. And the next thing you know, they pulled the plug on it.  It turns out that because they signed up with Blu-ray, they can't make a dual machine because their contract, which was non-disclosed, by the way, which is why nobody knew about it because of some non-disclosure agreement, wouldn't allow them to make a dual machine.  So even if somebody makes the mechanism, it doesn't mean you can produce one legally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The greed of these companies is going to bite them in the butt now because this is just, the whole thing is going to fall apart. Who needs it? I mean, I don't think American consumers are going to go for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, LG claims that they're still going to do one. And I don't know how they're going to get away with it, but that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw some specs for a Pioneer drive too. I don't know if it's a rumor or not, but the generation coming up this October, November, and it literally supported every disk format. It was a PC drive, granted, but HDV, Blu-ray, CD, DVD, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I had a conversation, curiously, that you mentioned Pioneer with Pioneer just like a week ago, the guy who's the head of the Blu-ray division.  Andy Parsons?  I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, he told me that there's no way they're going to do a dual thing and he thinks it's a bad idea. And in fact, both sides say they think it's a bad idea, but who knows, that may actually even be in the non-disclosure agreement if you have to say that.  You have to say it.  I mean, you can't trust anything anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to say it's a bad idea. Why would it be a bad idea? I don't understand, because it costs so much?  I was baffled by this.  It's a good idea. It's what consumers want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was he smiling when he said that?  You know, here's the reason why the conversation went like this. It would be a bad idea because it would be bad for retailers because they'd have to stock both formats. And I'm thinking, no, they wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, that's the whole point. They wouldn't have to stock both formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no, I mean, this is just completely baffling. If you read the literature, apparently somebody at Sony blew up at a press conference about this idea that you can do a dual format. You know, I don't know. I don't know why. Believe me, this is just going to be a bloodbath for about two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just so ugly. And I think consumers are just going to say, throw up their hands. Why should they have to choose sides in a war that didn't start? I mean, they're just going to say, fine, I like DVD 9. It's fine. I'll just stick with that.  I think the smartest thing to do is this HD dual format. I think that's the first smart thing I've heard in this whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, since no single format is the official winner and they couldn't narrow it down to a single format for consumers for high definition next generation optical disc formats, I think it's up to consumers then to wait for a dual format player.  For the most people, I mean, if you're an early adopter, you buy what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, there's 10,000 people who are willing to spend 500 bucks for it. But I can't imagine that a lot of people are going to run out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's another aspect to this, which is that the computer users need some sort of a device for them to collect more data than put them on these discs for storage.  But the consumer side, it was either Prager or Heron. I can't remember which of the two mentioned somewhere that, you know, if you use MPEG-4, you can put HD on a regular DVD with room to spare.  Maybe that is probably the short-term alternative to all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have a player in from JVC. It's manufactured by another company, but it supports Windows Media 9 HD and Divx HD formats, as well as being a network appliance where you can plug it into your home network and access your media center PC or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know where it's going to be the big winner? That's who's going to be the big winners out of this is the computer companies that come up with, whether it's H.264 or Windows Media 9, come up with electronic high-def formats.  It could be distributed over the net and nobody will buy a disc again. Right? Or is it just, are the file sizes too big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's the broadband issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are the file sizes too big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the files are huge, especially for that kind of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm downloading my high-def versions of Lost in 24. They're about 350 megs for 40 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, you do it over and over again.  You do it a bit torn. It's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And some of the estimates I've seen, just simply going from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4 for high definition, it's not a doubling or a doubling of savings in terms of space on the disc, but they're saying it's more about maybe a good 20% at this point as well.  So it's either you take the high bit rate like HDVD is doing with less compression or for some of the early Blu-ray stuff I've seen, they've used significantly more compression, but at slower bit rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what, you're right about the bandwidth. You see this from Forbes. They estimate that right now YouTube is spending a million dollars a month on bandwidth alone.  That is insane. How much money do they get in VC?  Well, at that rate, they got 11 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they got well, well, well under a year to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they got $11.5 million. If their burn rate for bandwidth alone is a million bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's their money making scheme? Is it all they're supposed to support themselves on advertising or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's what everybody's doing. If you build it, if you get eyeballs, you'll somehow make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's just like the dot com bubble 1.0 for YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They got to sucker somebody into buying them. That's what their scheme is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think anybody's going to anymore because I think people are realizing how much this stuff costs.  I mean, when you see a story in Forbes that says a million dollars a month of bandwidth, Yahoo is already burning from Flickr.  They're not going to spend more money knowing that it'll cost them a million a month just to keep the site up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only problem is that obviously it's proven that there's a massive demand for this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's going to break my kid's heart. They live on YouTube.  Well, what is MySpace spending?  Oh, it must be similar, right? I mean, they don't do video.  Let me think about the advertising involved on MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all I see on MySpace is like datesomethingrather.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MySpace is doing, I think, pretty well. There was a good article I just read, was it in the Times?  Yeah, it was last Sunday's Times about MySpace.  You know, one of the saddest stories about MySpace is the founders.  When Murdoch bought it, the founders didn't get any money.  They got a very small amount of money.  Well, then they screwed up.  Yeah, no kidding. The parent company, Murdoch, in order to keep everybody happy, gave them bonuses, multimillion dollar bonuses.  But the payment, the big payment for MySpace, what was it, half a billion dollar payment,  went to the apparent company, not to the founders.  However, I think MySpace is going to do just fine.  I don't think there's any question that MySpace is making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every story I see about MySpace is about sexual predators. Every story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there was just, you know, and it's kind of bogus. I just read an article by a mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What was it, the LA Times? I can't remember where I saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the LA Times. She was talking about how she struck a deal with her daughter,  and she is to monitor her daughter's space on MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is right, by the way. If your kid has a space on MySpace, you should be able to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that she was able to almost foster a better relationship with her daughter by both of them.  Like, her daughter helped her mom create an account on MySpace.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. It's all pretty sweet.  What, communicating with your children works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is nothing new. My wife did the same thing with my son when he was in high school.  He was on a, she'd go on Live Journal where all these kids were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Live Journal was the MySpace of a couple years ago. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she would just look and see what all these kids were.  You know, if he's going to hang out with some teach, she could do the research.  And I think it's a great thing. You can kind of, you know, it's a funny kind of spying,  but it's no different than seeing who shows up at the door, you know, with a bone in his nose.  Ladies and gentlemen, that laughter is Patrick Norton, who's just joined us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been moving furniture all day, but is taking time out to take his sweat and pain soaked frame  and join us on This Week in Tech.  We must be talking about, like, spying on children in MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, congratulations. You win the prize.  Oh, you missed the good stuff already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. This is like, I was on an email thread when I checked in and found out about the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was, there was another email thread going around where a friend of them is like,  I don't have kids yet, but I'm looking at this person's, this adult's response to their child's activities in MySpace.  And some part of me is like, you know, there are kids who are smart enough to hide it from their parents  and there are kids who aren't. And if you're, you know, if you're talking about who is in the closet giving who, you know.  What?  No, it's just like, you know, yeah.  In other words, if you're not smart enough to hide it, you're nothing to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's just, you know, you're, guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if your parents don't approve of you having, you know, pre-med, pre-med, pre-med, pre-med, pre-med,  you know, pre-marital intercourse at a party at the age of 14, maybe you shouldn't blog about it in a public space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. On the other hand, if my daughter were doing that, I'd sure hope she blogs about it so that I know, so that I could do something about it.  What are you going to do, Leo?  Spank her. I don't know. Block her in a room until she's 18.  Well, you know, it's a nice theory.  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nice theory.  Well, let me-  Put those personal anecdotes out there. Let the employers take a look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think that kids need their own place, and I think MySpace is a great place.  I'd rather her have her own place to act out than, you know, go down to some, you know, sleazy part of town in the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or just a neighbor's house at a kid, bunch of kids getting together for a party.  That was last night, actually.  Well, I mean, but this is, you know, MySpace isn't, MySpace just makes it easier for you to find these people, you know, all over the country instead of just, you know, high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember, I have a 14-year-old daughter. This is a very sensitive topic for me, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I literally-  I'm not saying it's not sensitive, but I remember, like, you know, one of the funniest conversations I ever watched my mom and dad have was like, you know, or my dad told me about it later, you know, me and a bunch of guys at Senior Week had met a bunch of women from the University of Vermont.  And we went to a party at their house, and my mom was like, oh, you know, I trust there was adult supervision there.  My dad kind of looks at me and I immediately riff off, of course, mom.  Yes, mom.  I'm not pointing out that the adult supervision were the, you know, the group of 21-year-old women whose house we were having a party at.  They're adults. That's adults.  They were adults. They were certainly in charge.  The word adult is great.  I mean, how many irresponsible adults can we all think of amongst our immediate friends, much less examples we run into, you know, in the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, look, I think it's important kids have their own place.  I think MySpace is important.  I think a lot of the negative MySpace stuff is just hysteria and bogus.  But every parent I know is worried in this conversation.  I hear it everywhere. Every parent is talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, are you worried as a parent, are you worried about MySpace itself?  No.  Are you worried about becoming, are you worried about predatory behavior of other people?  It's a facilitator for predatory behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  But it's the same. You know what? It's the same anywhere.  If they're online, even if they're in the mall, it's the same.  I mean, it's not any different.  It's also for stupid people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, no, the predators being the stupid people.  If you're, it's not anonymous.  The people that get caught are ridiculous.  Honeypot pervert.  They say they're damn, they say exactly who they are.  And they're wondering why someone finds them when they go to meet someone at some pier on the beach.  I mean, give me a break.  I think that's OK, man. Just smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every local municipality in the country now has at least one undercover cop in MySpace.  The chances are better of meeting cops in MySpace.  I think so, too. Everyone's on their own stakeout mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you if you went on a mission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all have like these little funny little dinky electronics crimes units.  And that's exactly what they're doing there.  Most of the time they're in MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are we going to do about cops who are predators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another problem.  That's true.  Hey, speaking of which, did you see that the EFF's lawsuit against the against the NSA and AT&T is probably going to get thrown out because the Bush administration is going to assert the rarely used state's secret privilege?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you're mispronouncing it. That's Star Chamber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? You say that, but it's a vestige of English common law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I'm saying that. That's just the spookiest thing I've heard of in forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the rule is it's like executive privilege.  It's just something an executive can assert that if this civil he can quash a civil suit, if this civil suit were to continue, it would be at the risk of national security.  So we're just going to quash it.  And now they haven't done it yet, but they say they will when they file papers May 12th.  And the government says the fact that the US will assert the state secrets privilege.  Get this should not be construed as confirmation or denial of any of the allegations.  But if it says but if it is somehow revealing state secrets, clearly the NSA is spying on us at the AT&T, right?  Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It's it's like, you know, if the president does it, it's not a crime.  It's very, you know, there's some spooky stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Encrypt, encrypt everything. That's my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, was the EFF trying to find out who was being monitored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The EFF was suing AT&T over the fact that it's been asserted, although not proven, the National Security Agency was using AT&T's lines to spy on American phone calls and American Internet communications.  And so the concern of the Bush administration is if this lawsuit were to continue, national security would be put at risk.  I mean, you have to read into that that something will.  We talked about this whistleblower last week or the week before that who says he installed this room in AT&T's offices for the NSA.  I mean, I think all you can say is it proves it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I mean, just to play devil's advocate for a moment, you know, what if they were legitimately, you know, listening in on the works of Al Qaeda cells in the United States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they didn't want Al Qaeda to know they were doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, they can probably assume it by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But of course, with state secrets privilege, we have no idea what they're doing or who they're listening to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're only listening in so they can find out who's going to vote against them and then have the IRS come down.  Yeah, it's not such a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we laugh, but, you know, for a lot of people, there's a lot of nervous people in the United States that think that's a perfectly reasonable exercise of authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the issue.  I mean, nobody is against trying to track down terrorists this way.  What we're against is the misuse of this kind of power and the fact that it's not.  And now they're using they're asserting this ancient privilege to quash it, to keep a lack of public oversight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's go over it.  Now I can get my plug in for the blog at the Dvorak.org slash blog.  But if you go to my website, there's another story that's similar, that got very little play, which is the fact that the Bush administration is trying to get, make it so if somebody leaks a secret document, even though they wouldn't even know it was secret, journalists, they just get thrown in the slammer.  With no recourse?  Pretty much. I mean, this is very Hugo Chavez style, you know, dealing with the press by just jailing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, wouldn't the president then be putting himself in danger of going to prison because, I mean, he revealed a secret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's allowed to declassify secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, because wasn't it finally traced back to the president asking someone to leak that CIA operative's name?  It's okay if he does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't the CIA operative's name, it was the Niger uranium story.  But nevertheless, he's allowed to declassify, they say he's allowed to declassify docks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, aren't there channels for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, he can just do it unilaterally, I think.  By Thea.  You're right, he can, that's what I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good to be the king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least that's their position.  I mean, I don't think we'll see this go to court, but if it were, I think that that's their defense.  It's good to be the king.  I thought we got rid of kings.  We got rid of kings.  Hard.  Wikipedia's being used by a political campaign, what a surprise, by political dirty tricksters.  You know, we knew that Capitol Hill staffers were making revisions in their bosses' bios to make them better,  but apparently they're also going in there and modifying the opponents' bios.  The entry for Democratic Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia labeled him,  this is his biography in Wikipedia, too liberal for his state,  partly because Hillary Clinton's political action committee donated money to his campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this sort of thing was predictable.  Oh, absolutely.  There's just too many vandals in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in fact, I'm surprised it took them so long.  But I guess it underscores the point that if you're getting your information from Wikipedia alone,  you probably should consider other sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, for a while, Wikipedia was turning into quite an extraordinary resource.  Well, it still is.  As long as you stay in like, you know, non-scientific evolutionary political, you know, religious...  As long as it's non-controversial.  Yeah.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're talking about armadillos, it's good.  Wasn't it the journey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as long as you're talking about armadillos being created, not evolved.  Oh, yes. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there a study done that just as many falsities were found in the average scientific Wikipedia entry  is in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about the nature study.  Although Encyclopedia Britannica's response was that the nature study was very flawed.  What they didn't talk about was the fact that nevertheless, there were many flaws found,  inaccuracies found in Encyclopedia Britannica articles.  Look, every source has flaws in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but most sources can't be rewritten by people at whim, on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you talking about Adam Curry here rewriting his own bio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Adam Curry, the offices of various senators and, you know...  I have a confession to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not know that you weren't supposed to work on your own bio.  That is apparently the unwritten law of the Wiki.  Maybe it's written somewhere. I didn't see it.  Well, it's a selfish thing to do.  Well, no, no.  Somebody...  A guy correcting his own bio.  I corrected my bios.  So what?  I didn't put a puff piece in there.  I wouldn't take out anything that was negative about it.  There was a factual error, which I eliminated. That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it going to get to the point where you go to a Wikipedia page  and you'll have an option to flick on a little overlay  that shows you every edit that everyone made?  That's not a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can in a way, if you look at the revisions history.  To a certain point, you can track it.  Yeah, if you look at the revisions history.  I mean, the other thing is, you know, it's pretty easy to have, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, most of us can probably come up with at least one friend  to make the edits in our bio for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we know Patrick has his friend's bid on his eBay auctions  just by that comment.  I don't think my...  I'm kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's a case. This is an interesting one.  Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor of Georgia.  His bio was amended not inaccurately.  It was just extended to include the fact that his son was arrested for drunk driving.  Now, that stuff was accurate.  They're not denying the accuracy,  but it was added because it made him look bad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What other reason could there be?  I mean, if I'm digging up a bio on somebody,  I'm not looking for their children.  It might mention that they have a child, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's an interesting thought.  If I've got somebody who's like...  And I don't know anything about the person in particular we're talking about,  but there have been political operatives that have made big honking, you know,  my family is superior because of my political and religious beliefs,  and this is what I am standing my campaign on.  And if it turns out that their own example, their children are rampaging maniacs,  I think that has a really tremendous bearing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as the information is factual, it seems like it belongs, right?  His office said we feel that's out of bounds, but it's his biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This also can be embarrassing and hurtful the way people do it.  Of course.  Yeah, you know, and the only thing worse than having somebody send you  particularly nasty emails for somebody to post it publicly like that  or to modify a wiki, I can only imagine what our wikis are going to look like  in a week, other people.  Get through with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I guess the real theory is that it's self-correcting, right?  That others will come in and fix errors and that it somehow tends toward accuracy.  Has that been your experience in Wikipedia, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what you're talking about.  I mean, a lot of articles it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the system too big at this point for Wikipedia to have a set of vetted editors  that check all changes before they go in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they do have a system like that.  They actually have a deputized group of people who will take responsibility  for a certain category of inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the scope and size of that site is just incredible.  It's huge. Yeah, you can't police it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't expect it to be perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I ran in there and edited that helium is lighter than hydrogen,  someone would catch that within an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, the Seigenthaler bio went for months and nobody picked it up,  even though it was obviously blatantly ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I'm almost saying that it shouldn't even make it to the...  If you click on a definition for helium or hydrogen,  it shouldn't have that misinformation on the top page.  That should be something somebody has to look at first before it's applied.  And maybe it is that way right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should students be allowed to use Wikipedia as a resource?  Probably not. Sure.  Some schools say it's plagiarism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should be able to use it as a resource.  You better attribute what you say to it.  Therefore, if it's wrong, at least you say it's Wikipedia's fault  because that's how you footnoted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but there's a difference between...  I mean, Leo, some schools think of it as plagiarism.  Yeah, I was talking to a kid whose school...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The rules are you cannot use Wikipedia.  It will be considered plagiarism if you do.  Which I think is, again, an example of somebody who doesn't understand technology  overreacting to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also the context is, I mean, having seen a number of junior journalists  cut and paste stuff from other places online.  Yeah, but I mean, was his school saying,  don't cut and paste Wikipedia because it's plagiarism?  Or were they saying...  Any use even cited of Wikipedia will be considered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words, I guess their feeling is  because you don't know where the information in Wikipedia came from...  Well, this is...  You're not talking about...  It's kind of indirect plagiarism.  I don't know.  I'm not justifying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not plagiarism.  That's nonsense.  It's not.  That would be ignorant on the school's part.  That's fact checking, not plagiarism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To make a blanket roll like that.  Because there's lots of books that plagiarize.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, look, if a student uses misinformation within Wikipedia,  and that ends up in the paper, and the teacher reads that,  and they know, oh, okay, well, you know what, this is clearly wrong.  I don't know where you got...  That's true.  Because, I mean, if you're writing a paper,  and you say with the atomic...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, going back to the molecular stuff,  Right.  And I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  And now that we know that nothing is reliable, I mean, how do you judge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's also...  I mean, you start to look back, you look back at some of the...  you know, it's always kind of fun to look at older, you know, non-fiction books.  And you kind of think like, wow, you know, this was published  and this was relied upon, and you just start snickering to yourself, you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're B monsters, right?  That's like the great Woody Allen movie, Sleeper,  where, you know, they start telling him all the stuff that was wrong, you know,  like the healthiest food is chocolate and...  Aturated fats are good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, that's comedy.  That's the difference.  And we can laugh at it.  And we can laugh at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you know, the leading agents in medicine used to bleed people.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, they go back to it.  I keep a vial of leeches around just in case.  No, they've gone back to leeches.  Leeches are good for microsurgery.  They're using leeches now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not for colds.  They're not as effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of leeches in Silicon Valley, too,  that makes it very usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking about the little tiny, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Chinese businessman has bought a MiG-21F plane on eBay.  That lucky dog.  For $24,000, a good deal.  Holy bargain.  Well, it must be empty.  He says he's going to use it to decorate an empty space at his offices.  However, nobody...  According to...  I guess this was the USA Today,  nobody's talked yet to Chinese customs officials  about whether they'll be able to get it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That guy probably doesn't have to talk to any customs officials.  Yeah, one would think.  There's a number of Chinese businessmen that are pretty much above the law, as it were.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently...  You'd think he'd be able to get one in-country, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, there is a Chinese company that once bought a retired aircraft carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't they go to business or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was able to get it in.  It was a Soviet-era Minsk-class aircraft carrier.  They converted it into a floating theme park.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, the company went bankrupt.  The ship is for sale, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't need an aircraft carrier.  I could use a submarine.  Maybe we should let Paul Allen...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to YachtWorld.com.  There used to be a bunch of D-class commissioned Russian submarines for sale on YachtWorld.com,  which I always thought was great.  $600,000 and you can own a retired submarine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did anybody ever during the Tech TV era get on Paul Allen's boat or his submarine?  John, did you ever get invited to any of that stuff?  No, I don't think anybody likes me anymore.  Greg Drebben, our former fearless leader, flew to Moscow.  I think...  I heard about that party.  He's with a couple of other Tech TV execs for a Paul Allen party in Moscow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he does his yearly parties.  He actually has three yachts, the second biggest in the world, the fourth biggest in the world,  and about I think the 13th biggest in the world.  I don't know what you need more than one of these things for and why you need these monsters.  Because you have size issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.  That's the amazing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must have been looking at the same yacht list that I was looking at  where you had like three of them belonged to Saudi princes and two of them belonged to Paul Allen  and of the top yachts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, yeah, well three of them.  There's a number of lists, but Paul actually has three.  I happen to be writing a blog thing on the fact that on these yachts,  because in Oakland, you know, these yachts cost $200-300 million or more,  but in Oakland, the old President Roosevelt's old Potomac...  Oh, that's a beautiful yacht.  ...the site www.potomac.org, or I think it's USSpotomac.org.  It's anyways, you will visit the thing in Oakland.  It was rebuilt.  It was sold for like $15,000 of junk, and then the Oakland...  Nobody bought it.  There was an auction and the Oakland port bought it for this low amount of money,  and then they dropped $5 million into it, and now the things that, you know, actually works.  Historic.  Meanwhile, there's these guys, like the biggest yacht right now, supposedly, motorboat,  is Larry Ellison's new boat, the Maltese Falcon,  and this thing is just an unbelievable monster,  and it's...I don't...you know, meanwhile, I think it must cost $300-400 million for this thing,  and by the way, the rule of thumb is...you can tell I've been reading too much about this stuff,  but the rule of thumb is that whatever the price of the boat is, if it's like $500 million,  it's 10% of that per year for maintenance.  So besides the fact that you have to have a full crew lunch.  40 million a year, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Paul Allen apparently has a recording studio with a studio musician sitting,  waiting for him in the hull of the boat at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Larry's got that beat.  He's got a full basketball court in his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but does he have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar waiting for him at all times?  Possibly.  In Michael Lewis's book, The New New Thing, he talks about Jim Clark, who also has a yacht fetish,  in fact, was in a competition with Larry Ellison to have the tallest yacht,  and Clark had one with the highest mast, and I think Ellison beat his by a foot or two,  and now Clark is building a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, those guys were in the fully automated systems too for the boats, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, Ellison's big boat is a stink pot. It's not a sailboat.  Oh, okay.  Jim Clark's is a sailboat, but he's got...and it's apparently the biggest, it's 300-something feet.  It's so tall it can't fit under the Golden Gate Bridge.  It does on low tide, it supposedly can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think around the turn of the 19th, 20th, beginning of the 20th century,  that everybody looked around and talked about Lipton and Shamrock and the Americas.  Oh, we're right there.  Yeah, you know, being like, what's this guy doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Astors and the Vanderbilts all over again.  I mean, I'm surprised they don't have Newport, Rhode Island-style mansions on the...I guess they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, does Greg Norman do something besides play golf?  Because he has a boat that just blows me away.  He had it built, I think, a year or two ago, $70 million craft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He probably has endorsements. That just shows you how much money there is in golf.  It's a lot of golf accessories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is enormous. I mean, I don't know how long the actual boat is,  but he has like a 42-foot custom boat that can be dropped off the main boat for fishing,  and like another 30-foot boat, a 22-foot boat, two 18-footers, and a rescue boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the standard once you get over the 100-, 200-foot level.  It's just gorgeous, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you've got to read about Paul Allen's 400-something foot boat.  Four times bigger. It's got an eight-man submarine on it.  Oh, you're talking about the octopus.  And two helicopters. Yeah, the octopus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Greg Dibbin told me the reason Paul Allen told him that he built the submarine  is that when he goes scuba diving, he doesn't like to splash into the water.  He likes to emerge into the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I looked it up. The submarine has the capacity to sleep eight for up to two weeks underwater.  What in the hell?  That's a getaway, man.  When Paul Allen liked Tech TV the most, I mean, he had all the billionaires like to compete in the sailboat racing,  and he actually put Tech TV as the main sponsor, I think, on the sale.  I think that was so we could write off the donation to the America's Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was a really good use of the money for promoting Tech TV. That really went over it.  All those people that are into those shot races were Tech TV viewers, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a little debate. They were considering actually buying a NASCAR endorsement,  which probably would have been a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot more expensive, too. No, NASCAR endorsements are expensive.  Yeah, a couple mill a year.  Well, yeah, a couple mill a year for like a bumper sticker on the end of a NASCAR vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the badge on the guy's headrest. No, you want to have the side of the vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still recovering from Talladega this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why can't, what happened at Talladega?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just a good race. That's where NASCAR was this week.  Were you there?  No, no, no. It's the fastest track though in the world as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why can't these billionaires be competing on the best tech channel that they could build?  Why can't there be some boasting points in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't get them ramped up on this, Leo, because I'm pretty sure they can find prettier, smarter people than us to host on it.  If they throw enough money at it.  They let loose the funding. I think we're out of jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. Keep them out of the business.  I've got a 600 horsepower hydrogen Corvette. That's what I want. Hydrogen powered Corvette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's still back in Talladega, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like the fact that the latest model Corvettes have like 400 horsepower engines and 30 miles to the gallon.  Yep. 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the top of the line one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome. But does it still get like 30 plus miles to the gallon highway?  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems unlikely.  Ransomware, the latest trend in viruses, Trojan Ransom Dash A, once run on your computer, freezes the system and threatens to delete files every 30 minutes until you pay $10.99 to the virus author.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Aha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is done through Western Union. I think the executives of Western Union should be taken and arrested.  No kidding. Well, they have to find some business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the last telegram was sent about a month or two ago. The very last Western Union telegram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? Telegrams are gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're gone.  Yeah, they've been gone for a while.  Not that long. The last one was just a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they never told anybody they were going to do this, so they couldn't even do a souvenir telegram. It was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. This is the third Ransom Trojan. There was another one called Cry Zip and then Zip OA, which sought payments of $300.  But I guess this guy's figuring out he'll make it up in volume, right? So $10.99.  Wow.  And then you get a, you get a, by return telegraph or whatever, you get the, after you pay the ransom to the Western Union account, you get a CIDN number, which allows you to unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? You're never going to get the, this is just like the eBay scams that run through Western Union.  You pay Western Union, they cash the Western Unigram, and you never hear or see from them again.  Yeah.  There's just, there's no.  I think it's kind of funny actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't give in to ransom demands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the $10.99. It's like.  Yeah, marketing geniuses.  One million. Yeah, why 99 cents? Why not $11?  What, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a cheap, it's a good deal.  They won't notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or there's some, there's some, you know, legal reason. If it's below a certain amount, maybe it doesn't become a.  Maybe $11 is the cutoff point.  That would be really funny actually.  You know, when does the secret service in the postal, the post office get involved with wire fraud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, Google's got a better deal there. According to an article in the Seattle Times, Google's making a ton of money.  And I think it's obvious from these typo sites, you know, when you mistype a URL and you get a, just a list of ads, basically Google ads.  Who clicks on the ads there though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they own that generic page that always seems to pop up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you know what? Internet service providers are starting to do that.  Your ISP probably owns that. If you get a standard page that's not the Microsoft, you know, the one that you get normally in Internet Explorer that says you must have typed a wrong address, your internet service provider is doing that.  Remember VeriSign wanted to do that and started to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was just so obnoxious when VeriSign did that.  And now ISPs are doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would there be a way to prevent those extraneous sites from popping up by using a host list on the Windows PC or something like that?  Yeah, I think there would be. Yeah, that's a good idea.  It's just annoying. It's like even though I've checked, don't, you know, don't automatically search or anything or don't try to guess what I type.  I agree.  If I type in the wrong thing, give me a 404.  Give me a 404. I agree.  Did not resolve message and I'll figure out what I did. But, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a company called CEDO, S-E-D-O, which is a quote parking service.  They have more than one million unused addresses, all of which are on the Google Ad Network.  And their rationale is, well, we want these pages to function as alternatives to search engines.  So when you mistype, well, we'll tell you what you really were looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're click farming.  But I mean, that was one of the things that came out of Web 2.0 is one of the best things I heard there.  Somebody's pointing out, you know, you can pay.  There's like a certain type of cancer that is the number one or the highest per dollar, pull dollar per dollar value.  It's like 40 dollar per click on Google.  And what the guy says, a lot of people figured out is doing misspellings.  You can do similar things, do the common misspellings.  And for like one tenth the cost of maybe the proper term, you can get all the people who can't spell it but are still searching for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Cancir.com.  You know, just buy that and put some links up there and you make a bunch of money.  Melanuma.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're getting more hits on your site than that will ever get.  I don't know.  You're not making a bunch of money.  You don't think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess we won't really know unless Google tells us.  And I doubt Google would say a word about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they lose it on sales, John, but they make it up in volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just mistyped Logitech.com right now.  I transposed the T and the I and it at Google syndication.com.  Is that an actual Google?  That's interesting.  Here are some web related, some related websites for Lodja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did you spell it?  Let me try it on my I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see what I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But all the ads link to something called Google syndication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window.  And you're right.  Here are some related sites for LodjaTech.com.  And these are all Google ads.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just went to cancer.com.  There's a bunch of cancer stuff.  C-A-N-C-I-R.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's who these people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are you spelling Logitech again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H.com.  Just transposing the I.  L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H.  And I'm going to do a...  Let me just do really quickly who is on this...  Who owns this domain.  It's owned by a company in Tortola.  It says domain in Riquet or in Cary?  In the Virgin Islands.  Yeah.  It's owned by...  Domaincar.com.  Domaincar.com.  Domaincar.com.  Domaincar.com.  C-O Perthshire Marketing in Tortola, the Virgin Islands.  No income tax.  You can tell me they're not making money, John, but I think somebody's making some money on this.  Oh, they're making nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, they have every right to.  Wait a minute.  They make nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me click this link.  Oh.  I can't see anybody going to this and going, oh, okay, let me click here, I'll buy a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, absolutely...  Oh, come on, John.  You don't think so?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they have every right to.  If there's people that think, okay, I'll buy a camera, then fine.  So you mistype...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or even worse, the sponsor links.  They're going to go over here to Logitech, click smart, and then they'll get what, two  cents from ShopZilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's got to be a reason why all those Viagra ads get sent out in spam.  Of course, you don't get spam, John, so you wouldn't know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem.  John's not in touch with the real world.  So this is interesting.  If you type cancir.com, you get the, quote, cancer information center with a lot of links,  a lot of paid links, right?  And it's very nicely done.  I mean, they've got pictures of doctors and stuff.  So if you got here by accident, thinking you typed cancer.com, you might think this is  a legitimate collection of links.  But what if it...  Maybe it is legitimate.  Maybe it is a legitimate collection of links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoot, you might go to cancer.com with the I and you might click on something that's  in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why it's not legitimate.  Because also at the bottom of the page is an offer to buy the domain name.  I saw that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how much money they're making.  God, will somebody buy this?  It's such a loser.  Yeah, but if you have like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, what I've noticed is a lot of through ISPs collapsing and through people just skimming  URLs, people have ended up with a lot of URLs, the rights to a lot of URLs for apps next  to nothing.  It's cheap.  They farm them out like this.  It's cheap.  Well, cyber-squatting's been around since the day the internet...  Since the day the web started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to know how much Google makes off of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because indirectly, they benefit from it too, right?  I mean, if they're serving up all of the ads.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Yahoo or whoever, but that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30 million .com domain names registered last month.  30 million.  Yeah, but wasn't that because of the land rush for the .eu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, these are .com.  Well, it says .com names.  I don't know if maybe they are included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I find that hard to believe.  More than 90% were dropped, according to the Google search.  90% were dropped, according to GoDaddy.  Currently, there are 54 million active .com and .net addresses, according to VeriSign.  There's how many?  54 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then how did 30 million all came in last month?  It doesn't sound like a sum wrong there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but there's the difference between how many are active and how many possible  combinations you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were registered and dropped.  Most of those were dropped.  Oh, here's the deal.  I get it.  Okay.  Purchasers can change your mind within five days and avoid paying the registration fee.  So what people do is they get it for five days.  They quickly create Google ads on it.  They see if it is a valuable...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, now that's smart.  That's good.  See if it's a valuable typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.  So they're worth...  That's what's going on.  There were 30 million registered last month, but only 3 million were kept after five days,  because the rest were garbage.  There's probably a bot that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can just crank out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but five days isn't long enough to get enough of a presence on the search engines  to actually hit any of these.  You don't need to be on the search engines.  They're typos.  They're typos.  It's typos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not search engines.  It's typos.  People like me.  Time's gone too quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you, of course...  Hey, look at Google's got goggle.com, Google with two O's, Google with three O's, Google  with four O's, and Google with five O's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes sense.  It all goes to Google.  But don't you remember when all the... there used to be all those misspelled sites that  were one letter off and you'd find yourself at a porn site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now it's not porn anymore.  It's people who just think I'll make a little bit of money.  Maybe these were porn sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did the same thing to popular porn sites, though, too.  Actually, that's a really good point.  They'll be misspelled by one letter and go to some competitor's site.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They used to be porn sites.  And you see, the porn stuff wasn't working out as well as these... those sites.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what about that?  There was that story last week where there was a piracy organization that basically set  up a dummy NEC corporation where they were even fielding...  Yeah, that was awesome.  They were even fielding service calls for products in NEC's line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were commissioning research.  They basically set up an entire dummy corporation in China that was emulated, basically stole  the NEC logo, the NEC name, set up...  Wow.  Basically set up an entire false front company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how did they make money?  What was the skin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what was their revenue model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were selling... basically, the revenue model was they were selling products pretending  to be NEC.  They basically set up a completely legitimate business except they stole somebody else's  brand and trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And supposedly the products weren't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, in a lot of cases they basically...  Those are crazy Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why trademark and copyright law is meaningless unless every country adheres to  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of China, do you remember last week we had a story about the Chinese dissident  that was given up by Yahoo!  Email?  Yeah.  And apparently there's a story going around now that quotes a Yahoo! spokesperson, Mary  Osako, saying that Yahoo! was completely unaware of this case.  Oh, interesting.  And that they didn't turn over any information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe whose suspect is this Reporters Without Borders, which is the human rights organization  that's reporting this.  And I was very careful to say that they're only alleging it.  I mean, there's no evidence except from this group that this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I almost wish...  What is Yahoo! doing?  This is supposed to be some great directory search engine company, and it took them that  long to get to this story about them?  They couldn't find...  It took them a week to...  Well, that's an indictment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they listened to Twitter and it just took them a long time to get around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's throwing rocks through...  Came out on the 28th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like somebody's throwing rocks through your windows.  It takes you a week to figure it out.  A little later they noticed...  There's rocks in the living room.  Yeah, but Yahoo! has got like 42 million windows on seven continents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might take a while to notice there's a draft, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the story is actually up again because now there's another...  A fourth Chinese dissident has now been sentenced to 10 years in prison.  And the same group, Reporters Without Borders, say that it was in fact Yahoo! that provided  the information that helped jail the dissident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, these are on charges that the Chinese government says are incitement to  subvert state power, which is a crime in the country of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had set up a Yahoo! group called AAABBBCCC and was using that, I guess, to put...  I don't know, to subvert, to get together and subvert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish somebody would create a page that just keeps track of everyone who's been put in  prison or, you know...  Well, man, this is what we talked about last year.  Give us a status page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Yahoo! spokeswoman in Hong Kong said, the company requires strict legal documentation  before complying with any official request for information, but we do cooperate with  the laws of every country in which we operate.  Of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think the Chinese government actually has the tools they would need to just do this  themselves without Yahoo!'s intervention?  Well, it's the same thing as the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just go to Yahoo! and say, well, look, we've got the IP address.  We see this guy doing it, but we need to know what his home address is.  And Yahoo! knows, I guess.  Oh, you're right.  I would think that...  Isn't China the ISP, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would think that they would just simply...  They would know all that stuff.  You give us those tools if you want to do business here.  Yeah, that's probably true.  We don't have to ask you anything.  They don't have to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  They don't have to ask.  Scary as that sounds.  Steve Jobs says he's not going to run Disney.  Sorry, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think he should run Disney.  Don't you think it'd be great?  I mean, I'm not a big fan of Steve Jobs.  I think everybody realizes that, but I think he'd make a great Disney CEO.  Do better than Eisner.  Because he's got some creativity.  Do better than Eisner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, he probably looks at it and realizes it would be like trying to...  I mean, trying to just steer Disney is probably like trying to park a super freighter in a tiny harbor.  Just no maneuverability, no flexibility.  That would be a nightmare group to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple had its shareholders meeting this week on Thursday.  And one of the shareholders said, well, what's the deal?  Are you going to go run Disney?  He said, no.  He said, I don't have time.  He said, I barely have time to run Apple.  In fact, it's going to give me more time because I was the chief executive officer of both Pixar and Apple.  And now I'm just CEO of Apple and the board member of Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's he going to do with Apple?  Is he going to pick colors for the next iPod?  Hey, that's very important, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you should diminish that.  Vermilion.  Somebody's got to do it.  Black or white?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, since Steve's been on watch at Apple, he's pretty much completely turned around the company.  You can't complain about what?  An entirely additional business model on top of computing sales.  Maybe he's going to turn him back into a computer-centric company again.  So the iPod is an accessory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to sell Windows.  Come on, John knows that.  Squeak toy.  Squeak toy's back.  It's actually a little Pixar.  That was light year squeak toy that John has.  Well, my screen just went dark, so I can't, I don't know what happened here.  I can no longer tell you what news is.  But we pretty much used up our time allotment anyway for this.  There's not a lot of news this week.  It was a light week.  It really was.  We managed to milk it for every...  It was NAB and E3.  Hey, Apple announces a 17-inch...  You were at NAB.  Anything else you saw?  How about that?  We have, you know, this week in media, they talked all about the RED camera.  Any thoughts on the Oakley RED camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the...  Well, I got to talk to a couple of the guys.  One of the guys that works with the internal team and one of the guys who's going to be a dealer for RED.  And it was really interesting to talk to them because essentially what they're trying to do is, you know,  a hundred, a hundred and fifty, two hundred thousand dollar camera for 17.5 plus, you know, 47.95 for the lens, right?  And then you'll still need some kind of capture device for it or, you know, some sort of storage device for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is DLTV going to start shooting in a super high D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not until we can figure out a way to switch it, which may actually be coming from another group later on.  That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This would be good for making a movie, but not for doing a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it might be good.  You know, it brings...  If they can, one, if they can make it ship, right?  If they ship and it works and it delivers the quality they're claiming,  you're basically talking about undercutting every major digital, you know, professional camera manufacturer by like,  literally almost an order of magnitude, which is insane when you look at it.  You know, it's like, you know, depending on how you're pricing it, it's one fifth or one tenth of the cost, right?  You can use interchangeable lenses.  It's got, you know, of course, you know, if they had one and if I don't think they had any functioning ones on the show floor,  you know, they may have had some they were demoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what do we know?  What do we really know about the so-called Mysterium, which always seems like a dubious name.  That's a bad name for a ship.  Mysterium, CMOS sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to understand, this is traditional Oakley marketing.  These are the guys who invented Unobtanium for sunglasses.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's funny.  This is part of the Oakley marketing tradition and they are extending that into this new area.  You know, they have always done, you know, goofy names for the materials they come up with for their lenses and their frames.  I like Unobtanium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got a couple of meetings.  I got a meeting with Kodak and I can talk to the people at Foveon and I'll find out what this is really all about.  See what the Mysterium really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Foveon guys have really shaken up the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's sad.  What the hell happened there?  The Foveon was such a great idea.  The military got a hold of it.  It's still a great idea.  Oh, is the military using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I just assume any time a piece of good technology just vanishes from the consumer side of things.  The military is using it.  Something was really good about it and it vanished.  Right.  And then we get it 20 years later.  Yeah, that might be.  But there was a lot of cool.  NAB had a lot of cool consumer stuff, though, too.  NAB was insane.  I'm sorry I missed that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What else? Tell us some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well, one, I realized from looking around at NAB that if you have a large enough potential market, all standards can become successful.  Because you started to look around and you realized there's like 19 competing IPTV formats that are destined for everything from online distribution of video the way we do it for our shows or IPTV in the sense of wiring up a college campus or a motel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't you think there'll be a shakeout and one or two standards will, formats will survive or you think they'll all exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's, at this point, it'll be interesting to see whether or not any one particular standard becomes prominent.  But I mean, if you look in terms of there's so many different systems for localized video distribution, and they all seem to have a market, whether it's for hotels or motels.  If you get one good chain of hotels, that might be enough to keep your company going if you have a small company.  It was interesting to look at New Text, the TriCaster Pro was big for us because they've added a bunch of features into that that we've been clamoring for.  And we'll get our hands on one of those in a couple weeks.  It was interesting to look at, you know, listen to the chairman of the FCC talk who was basically, you know, I'm not going to talk about, I'm not going to address whether or not there's going to be more consolidation in ownership.  And, you know, the terrestrial radio versus satellite radio, well, since they're distributing local content on the satellite network and not the terrestrial network, there's, you know, they're within the terms of their agreement.  It was kind of funny to watch because there's just so much going on in so many different directions.  And there seems to be a market for all of it. That was the thing that kind of amazed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Media explosion.  Yeah.  That's great.  Except who's going to have time to watch all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why you got to use this stuff.  I mean, there's a, so like I wasn't there.  I didn't see how many different standards there were.  I mean, the people that have ideas have only so much really using them.  Like if someone has something that's being used by people, then it's going to, even if it's not as good as someone else is the one that's being used is the one that's going to be adopted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But if you look at a lot of the tools that are out there, the first say, let's say rendering out video in multiple formats, there's a lot of high dollar tools now that are along with the standards you'd expect like, you know, WMV and MPEG-4 and H.I.264 MPEG-4 and stuff like that.  Are also doing things like, you know, like you'd think like Flash, WMV and, you know, some variations on QuickTime would be pretty normal.  You know, maybe an H.I.264 MPEG-4, but they're also doing DivX.  They're also doing more obscure formats.  You know, they're not quite pushing out into the open source formats yet, but they all, a lot of them actually have the ability to, you know, if you want to render out in 19 different formats, they'll render out in 19 different formats.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just because nobody's, nobody's come up with a, nobody's dominant yet.  And well, that's what I think consumers want to, I get a lot of questions from consumers.  What format, what format should I use?  They don't like this tower of babble of formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except for the ones who absolutely positively, you know, I need, you know, DivX.  It's all about DivX.  DivX is the best ever.  It's like, well, I use WMV.  Well, everybody has their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, or you look at the fact that WMV doesn't work as well on, you know, Macs as it does on PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at what Rocket Boom is doing with H.264, you know, MPEG-4, and I just think it looks  fantastic, and it's really, you know, they're doing good looking video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they're, they're shooting it with, you know, they're shooting and editing it.  They're spending about, I understand, four to eight hours in preparation for shooting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the video.  Yeah.  Poor Andrew.  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because they keep telling people that they have no, there's no bandwidth costs, there's  no distribution costs.  Well, that's obviously not true.  They claim 350,000 downloads a day of their 20 megabyte file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do the math.  I mean, it's outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if that's, you know, because it's, the other thing they do is they launch the  video as soon as you open the web.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's 350,000 hits to their front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they distribute it in one format?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They make it available in multiple formats.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's one of the things that we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people are seeing the front page video, which again, if you go to rocketboom.com,  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I know that one of the things that we do at revision three and it's only because  everyone wants so many formats is we try to provide as many formats as possible.  You know, I mean, remember when twit first came out, there was always the person in the  corner screaming, Og Vorbis, Og Vorbis.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, we still get people who want the aura.  An open source format with no royalties for decoding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there a video version of Og?  The aura.  The aura.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's xvid and the aura are kind of like the two main alternate codecs.  You know, but we stopped doing xvid at DLTV because we had so many problems getting the  tools to function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you say xvid, do you mean xvid as opposed to divx or do you consider them the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not the same.  It's totally different.  Yeah.  Xvid is an open source thing out of Germany, if I'm not mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but isn't it an open source version of divx?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For all intents and purposes, yes.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you would choose one or the other.  You wouldn't do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we have people who consider divx superior to xvid.  We have people who consider the whole proprietary nature of divx to be offensive.  You can't win.  And then there's still the the aura guys yelling in the corner.  And it's like, hey, when we get tools that allow us to consistently produce this, not  even automate, just produce it without crashing, we'll be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick, did you say that you guys don't distribute an xvid version of DLTV anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we dumped it for for divx.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because at least as far as I know, like our latest numbers for, say, a video version of  Dignation, our highest quality xvid is the most downloaded video that we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've never actually had more than when we were doing xvid regularly.  I don't think we ever had more than 2000 people download xvid.  And we've got a couple orders of magnitude past that on on divx.  And that's still not even close to being our most popular codec.  Our most popular codec is is the iPod video.  It's distributed through iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's because that's what people subscribe to on iTunes.  Because iTunes dominates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it does not say that it has a heavy in our case, our audience, it has a heavy  share, but it does not dominate.  We actually have people who subscribe to the H.264 video through iTunes.  But people in some cases, from what I've heard is a lot of people do it through iTunes just  because iTunes is a little simpler, a little easier to find people than democracy or fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ants.  Well, that's why they dominate.  I mean, that's my point is that consumers are baffled by all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're looking at something like DLTV or Dignation or some of these other tech  shows that have video on iTunes, I think their percentage of those numbers are not  going to be as high for the video that's provided through iTunes as would a show say like  Tiki Bar.  Like Ask a Ninja or Tiki Bar because those are the ones that are quite frankly more mainstream  and that's what iTunes caters to more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, the DLTV audience is more mainstream than the Dignation audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe a little bit, but I'm comparing it to Tiki Bar.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you look at overall, it would be interesting to see what percentage of, it also depends  on whether you're talking about commercially hosted video and websites versus BitTorrent  versus legal movie downloads.  Like the legal movie downloads are all tied up in WMV.  Most of the sites that do distribution, whether you're talking about YouTube or Google or  Insert Name of major media company here are flash based, which is flash is its own punishment  I've discovered on a number of levels.  When flash works, it's astounding.  When flash doesn't work, it's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Patrick, why don't you use flash?  We do use flash.  On what?  I don't think Cranky Geeks, does Cranky Geeks go on flash?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's crankygeeks.com.  It's the weekly show hosted by John C. Dvorak.  Really?  At Zip Davis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you spell that?  K-R-A-N-K-E.  C-R-A-N-K-Y-G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I own Cranky with an I-E.  That's my site and I'll give you some pointers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you're making all the money, bro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's go Geeks with a Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cranky Geeks.  Cranky Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cranky Geeks.  All right.  I'm glad we're just doing audio for Twitter, to be honest with you.  It's kind of all gone away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anyone messed with that encoder from ATI that uses the video card processor to encode  H264?  It's still in beta, isn't it?  It's listed on the driver download site now and I actually have some hardware in the lab  to mess with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Forward me the link for that because some of the early testing looked really good on  that but they didn't have it for a number of the codecs we wanted to play with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's for encoding, not decoding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Patrick, I'm on the site now and I found it.  So it's like WMV, video iPod H264, MPIC 4, audio only.  I don't see there's a flash thing in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at the big, John, look at the big giant picture of your face in the middle of Cranky  Geeks.  There's a big flash there at the top of the page that says click here to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about giving us some embedded code?  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  It is.  You click to start video.  That's flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can put it on my blog.  You know what?  I'll put it on Monday and I'll forward you the links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have a meeting, guys.  Why don't you have a meeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm actually serious.  I can forward you the link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No problem.  I'm now zipping the lips.  Zip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's why I like flash because you can embed it in anything.  Nobody needs a player.  They don't need anything.  They just look at it.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you do need a player.  If you want a custom player, you have to have a custom player created.  The custom players occasionally get broken on the flash server.  No, no, no, I'm talking about consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're so focused on your issues as a producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that was what was amazing.  Somebody who has consumed flash video forever, other than the quality issues,  I've never had a problem with it until I became a producer  and I realized what a nightmare it could be producing flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and flash 8 is even better from the point of view of the consumer.  It's just really a good way to watch video.  I think it's the way to go, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you want to embed it in a page, what if you want to watch it on your home theater system?  Do you want to open up a browser and watch the stuff that's designed in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many people are watching DLTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you imagine somebody watching Cranky Geeks on their home theater?  They probably have a heart attack.  About 15 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Really watching DLTV?  According to the surveys.  On TVs.  Wow.  On TVs, on home theater systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who does that?  The guy from Hack 5 does.  He's got this all set up.  Darren's got it so that it downloads automatically in the Democracy Player on his server.  He can come into his house, he sits down, he's put a little web interface to the player on his trio.  So he sits down, presses play on his trio, surfs to the website, presses play on his trio,  and then watches it on his big screen TV.  And he does that with all his podcasts.  But see, that's too geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The key is when Apple comes out with the air, not air tunes, but air video, you download the crap and sit on your couch and just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.  But there's already the spotlight stuff that's in place.  And people are actually, people are already integrating podcasts into the Media Center Edition, or videos into the Media Center Edition,  and setting them up so automatically downloads their, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, shoot, you can use TV Tonic, which is a Microsoft thing, and watch it on your TV.  You can use the Xbox 360 as long as you hack it the right way.  You can use your old Xbox, Xbox regular, and watch podcasts on that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  David, David, don't say it's not mainstream and then talk to me about Xbox hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but how many people watch it on Xbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying it's all possible, but right now the average Joe can't watch TV on their couch.  And when they can, that's going to be a big frickin' deal.  I agree.  I mean, that's why we need a Sony.  And that's why flash video is so great, because you can go to the website and click play.  In most places you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, is there a quality limit for flash video right now?  Because it seems like whenever I watch anything, be it YouTube or Google, the quality frankly sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's, the YouTubes, but they have to, I mean, I know they do that for bandwidth, but yeah.  Yeah, they're downgrading it.  You can make it look great.  Well, they're downgrading flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're basically giving you different sizes, but I swear it's the same bitrate and everything just stretched to bigger sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what Google's video is doing. Absolutely. It just looks chunkier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Supposedly, YouTube's going through something in the neighborhood of 200 terabytes a day right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about that earlier on in the show.  You missed that part of it.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's okay.  No, Leo was talking about a million dollars a month, did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A million dollars a month.  God.  Those electrons are expensive.  Bits cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bandwidth costs money.  But I mean, David, to go back to what you were saying before, a lot of people are looking at democracy as our fire ant as being an easy way to automate the downloads,  and a lot of people are doing it straight into Media Center Edition.  Media Center Edition, I think that's pretty mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's cool. That's cool.  And you guys are talking about hacking at 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to hack at 360 if you have a Microsoft Media Center Edition 2005 system on the same network.  They see each other.  They announce each other to each other. It makes it really nice.  Okay.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm probably going to cut all this out because I don't know.  Do you think it's real inside baseball or do you think people will really like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think some people will like it.  All right, I'll leave it.  I think keep it in, Leo.  We're just running.  They would have hung up by now anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spent so long editing the last one just to get it down to like an hour 20 because we went for like two hours last week.  But this one I won't edit.  We'll just leave it the way it is.  And people can edit it with their stop button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we can finish it 420.  Oh darn, it's 421.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to 420.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus people usually aren't shy about telling us when we should have edited stuff out.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is kind of unrelated, but speaking of 420, I can't remember what university it is.  I think it's UCLA.  Some college posted a website with hundreds of pictures of kids smoking pot on 420 day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  University of Colorado Boulder.  That's right.  There's dozens of photos up there and like a fifth of them have already been identified.  And it's like, man, you can tell who's pissed off their friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  They're asking other students to say, well, who is this?  So they can arrest these people.  And it is.  It's just, it's just.  How do they know they're really smoking pot?  It's pure Gestapo tactics.  It's turning your friends in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no excuse for it.  But what they did, right, is they found out where they were going to gather on 420 day.  They closed it down.  They put notices.  Basically, they sent tied notices.  Every 20 feet to the fence around in the field.  And they basically what they've got them on, I don't even think they're going after them for smoking.  I think they're going after them for trespassing because they were they weren't they were where they were told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says Fairfield Farron Field closed April 20th noon to five video and photographic surveillance in use.  So that you were warned.  But that's the whole point of 420 is just kind of mass civil disobedience.  150 rather damning photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This looks like Nazi Germany.  I got a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pure Gestapo and they're paying 50 bucks.  50 bucks.  Hey, let me see if I can see it.  Turn in your friends.  50 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it going to make society better for arresting these people?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you get 50 bucks floating around.  OK, fine.  I'll go get them.  I wonder how many of these people are turning themselves in for the 50 bucks to find more dope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's me.  That's me.  That's my bong.  That's my chillum.  I recognize it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that this is posted on a .edu website is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's time to call it quits, ladies and gentlemen.  But I have to say we've managed to make a lot of hay out of very little news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of the whole 420 thing, the broken man, the broken's being done.  We've shot some of the broken already.  Is it a special 420, the broken?  No, it's not, but it's the broken, which is, you know.  Gosh, that's the originator, the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  The original, wow.  Who's in the broken this time?  Is it Dan and Kevin?  The same three.
