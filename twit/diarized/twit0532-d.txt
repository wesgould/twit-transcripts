Transcript:  Oh. Hey.  Oh. Oh.  The espresso is delightful, thank you very much.  It was a short, short pull.  Short and tight.  Short and tight.

Start time: 145.12
End time: 151.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Put a little amaretto in.  Also, he brought along old buddy of his.  I think you probably met when you were in Engadget, right?  Peter Rojas.

Start time: 151.40
End time: 157.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Peter Rojas and I, we created Engadget together.  Co-founders.  What are you doing these days?

Start time: 157.64
End time: 162.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am doing seed stage investing for BetaWorks.  Oh, nice.  I'm their West Coast ambassador.

Start time: 163.49
End time: 173.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Ah.  Yeah, Jason was telling me that journalists  actually make great angels  because they get access to all the deals.  And you know how to question people.  Of course, you should stop being a journalist  when you do that.

Start time: 173.96
End time: 185.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  It's kind of, you can't be a journalist  and cover the companies that you're investing in.  But what's great about it is if you have  an inquisitive mind, you know what questions to ask, right?  And as a journalist, we all had to  sort through the BS and the PR nonsense.

Start time: 185.88
End time: 189.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you started as a journalist.  Peter was a journalist.  Yep, I was a journalist.  And you started as a journalist.

Start time: 189.54
End time: 203.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know how to tear things apart.  Which I think, it's surprising actually  how many founders you meet with are raising money.  And they have gotten, I think, conditioned to think like,  oh, you just like do some meetings and you go check.  Yeah.  I'm not used to people actually trying to understand  what they're doing or pushing back on it.

Start time: 204.51
End time: 209.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That actually makes sense.  Somebody's reviewed a lot of product.  Would be a much better person at figuring out  what the next big thing is.

Start time: 209.88
End time: 221.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's, I mean,  my entire career has been about trying to figure out  what's the next exciting new product  or company on the horizon.  So intellectually, like a good fit for me, I think.  Fun.  So I'm enjoying it.

Start time: 222.16
End time: 226.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then we got a couple of ink stained wretches here.  Well, you're ink stained.  I'm kind of just stained by my.

Start time: 226.84
End time: 235.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wild, you know, we don't even do paper anymore.  Pixel stained.  That's it.  My fingers are burned from the keypad.  Hammer away at.  That's Ian Thompson from the register.

Start time: 235.76
End time: 250.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Great to see you.  Always fun.  Love having you in here.  And we don't have anything to talk about.  So that's okay, because really, if there were news,  it wouldn't be nearly as much fun with you guys.  We just, I'm a little hoarse,  because we were just defusing bombs  for the last 45 minutes.

Start time: 250.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This VR headset, I mean, I have to say,  VR is going to be a legitimate platform.  I was, you know, it's been 20 years of VR, VRML,  just all kinds of different headsets.

Start time: 260.68
End time: 277.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember being at SIGREF in 1992,  and they had a attached big ass headset,  and we were flying on a pterodactyl or something, right?  And you had the little gun that you point to around.  And it was disorienting and weird,  and mainly you thought no one's gonna wear  a giant five pound headset and do this.

Start time: 278.02
End time: 281.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now, because of these,  all the sensors has made it possible.

Start time: 281.14
End time: 290.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, I picked up the Gear VR at a day  when I was meeting with a bunch of VR companies,  and all of them were doing their demos on a Gear VR,  and I was like, I gotta get one of these.

Start time: 290.28
End time: 292.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And the Gear VR doesn't have any electronics in it at all.

Start time: 293.52
End time: 300.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just the headset with the lenses,  but all the screen and electronics and everything,  it's all off the phone.

Start time: 300.56
End time: 314.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, so Samsung makes it, 199 bucks.  They currently have two, one for the Note 4,  or maybe, yeah, the Note 4 and one for the S6.  They announced to Oculus, the Oculus conference,  they're gonna make a $99 one  that'll fit all their current models.

Start time: 314.50
End time: 316.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it has the Oculus software.

Start time: 317.40
End time: 321.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, Oculus was based on a Galaxy, wasn't it?  The original Oculus.

Start time: 321.60
End time: 344.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what happened was, what I heard from the inside was,  Oculus needed screens from the Samsung folks,  and they were like, hey, if you want our screens,  you need to give us your technology  to get this consumer thing out of our phones.  And so the Oculus people didn't exactly want to do it,  so they did that.  But Samsung has their own technology,  so they're not gonna need the Oculus for much longer.

Start time: 344.62
End time: 370.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think VR's a thing for the moment.  I think AR is gonna be much bigger for them  when they actually get going then.  Trying the HoloLens, I was very excited.  That was, with the right application,  that could be really, really good.  My problem with VR is that you're just too isolated.  You can't move around, you can't concentrate  on anything other than what's on the screen,  but it was very useful in certain circumstances.  For gaming.  Yeah, it's gaming important, basically.

Start time: 370.56
End time: 398.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So we were playing a game called  keep talking and nobody explodes.  You're diffusing a bomb.  One person's wearing, it's actually clever  because nobody has four VR headsets.  Not yet.  And, although we've seen demos where two people  are in a VR space, that's a non-trivial thing to do.  So you're in the VR, you're looking at this bomb,  and the rest of you guys have a printed manual,  and you're trying to solve this puzzle  without seeing the bomb.  It was fun, wasn't it?  Did you enjoy it?

Start time: 398.90
End time: 417.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's sort of like, if you were actually diffusing a bomb  and you were like MacGyver in a room,  and you had a radio and Wucky talking  and we're talking to somebody at base,  or you had to land, you know what it's like,  you had to land a plane,  and the control tower is telling you like,  oh yeah, pull the yoke.  You're like, what's the yoke?  You're not like, what?  It's worse than that.  There's no eggs in here.

Start time: 418.00
End time: 421.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And as you can see, these bombs get very, very comfortable.  It's hilarious.  It was fun.

Start time: 422.36
End time: 426.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We turned into 12 year old boys,  and we did not want to stop to do twit.  Yeah, it was really fun.

Start time: 426.90
End time: 433.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you really don't want to, I mean,  it's a high stress tension situation while you're doing it.  But what you see is- So much fun.  And I was terrible at it.

Start time: 434.14
End time: 457.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is that VR isn't necessarily what you imagine necessarily,  what you imagine VR to be,  which is an immersive environment  that you're running through and shooting people.  It can be, this is a very interesting use of VR.  Yeah, yeah.  An augmented reality would be similar  because you're still seeing the world around you,  but stuff is superimposed upon it.  I can imagine some very interesting, not just games,  but obviously AR is more about UI, right?  Yeah.

Start time: 458.58
End time: 465.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think, I mean, AR is going to be,  certain things like,  I'm amazed Disney hasn't gotten bigger into AR.  Have you seen the Viewmaster yet?

Start time: 466.66
End time: 471.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This thing is amazing, 29 bucks.  It's cardboard.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 471.64
End time: 473.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you get a disc.  We played with it the other day.

Start time: 474.18
End time: 509.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You get a disc and you put the disc on the table  and then you put your phone in the Viewmaster  because it's cardboard, it's Google's cardboard.  And then you're looking through it and it is AR  because on the disc, 3D animals appear  and they're moving and they're acting.  It is for kids, but it's very much of a game.  Oh, we got one.  Here it is.  And it's very much of a game.  I guess I could put my, I don't want to distract you.  I guess I could put my S6 in here  and you guys could play with it.  But it's kind of spectacular.  Oh, there's the disc.  There you go, yeah.  The disc doesn't actually do anything.  The disc is not coded or anything,  but I guess the Viewmaster probably sees the positioning.

Start time: 509.86
End time: 518.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just flashing back to my kid,  to when I was a kid and you had the things  that you press the thing and it cycles through.  You still do it.  Great photos of Ohio and the rest of it.

Start time: 518.38
End time: 525.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's got the thing and everything.  Oh my God.  What is wrong with you guys?  They're bringing me all the stuff so I can do this.  No, no, we'll do this at another time.

Start time: 526.22
End time: 540.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched the Democratic debate in VR.  I did too.  That was sickening.  To Ian's point earlier, my complaint was  I couldn't follow or tweet, follow Twitter or tweet  while I had the headset on because you can't multitask.  You have to pick one or the other.

Start time: 540.96
End time: 562.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wasn't it kind of weird though because at first I thought,  what are we going to be in the back of the auditorium?  And I'm looking down, obviously the VR camera  is just a ball, right?  Because nobody knows that they're on camera.  I'm looking down, there's a guy looking at his phone.  I'm this close to him.  I can read what he's doing.  Then I look to the left and there's a cameraman.  He's chewing his gum.  He's waiting for the thing.  They don't realize you got a few hundred people,  me and Peter Rojas anyway.

Start time: 563.72
End time: 565.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We may have been the only two people actually.

Start time: 565.60
End time: 566.19
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're watching.

Start time: 566.80
End time: 584.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then the debate begins and you're like backstage.  You see the steady, it's a lot about how it's being produced  because you see the steady cam guy.  I saw Sheryl Crow tucking in her shirt tails,  getting ready to sing the Star Spangled Banner.  But what I do like about it in theory is  you could watch a debate and look at the candidates  as you choose as opposed to the...

Start time: 584.34
End time: 591.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was actually what I liked about it  is you didn't have to focus on the candidate  who was talking or who was on camera.  You could actually look at the body language  and see what other people were doing.

Start time: 592.56
End time: 594.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But were you able to wear it the whole time?

Start time: 594.34
End time: 608.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I only watched it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes at a time.  You tire pretty quickly.  You get tired and then...  Is it the weight of the headset or the...  It's not the weight, but the resolution is still low enough  that it just starts to create eye strain.  And I don't really get seasick from it,  but yeah, you get a little bit of a headache.

Start time: 609.54
End time: 628.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the reason this is all actually working now  is because the resolution has gotten better  and the processors and the GPUs have gotten better.  The Oculus is gonna take two GPUs,  that's what I heard, like two Nvidia cards,  to really properly do it.  You're gonna do a $1,500 gaming PC.  I heard like, $1,500 is like minimum game rig.  You might be more like a $3,000 game rig.  Well, they said $1,500 for the Oculus

Start time: 630.22
End time: 648.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  plus the minimum gaming rig that you would be needing it.  So the Oculus is the thousand?  No, no, no, no.  Under $500.  Oh, $500.  $500, I would guess.  So it's a $1,000 gaming PC, a $500 Oculus.  By the way, this isn't till maybe next quarter.  And I don't even think.

Start time: 648.20
End time: 666.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be, they expect to ship, I think, Q1.  They say they will, but.  What I'd heard from talking to some people in the industry  is when you can get to 8K displays,  that's when it starts to.  You dual 4K.  Dual 4K.  Actually, dual 8K would be the ideal  because you'd need the two images.  Dual 8K.

Start time: 667.74
End time: 668.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a lot of grunt.

Start time: 669.06
End time: 672.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot, but we'll get there eventually.  But not next year.

Start time: 675.02
End time: 681.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and Ian, you said when you put on the Gear VR,  you could see the screen door effect.  You really see those pixels.  This is a fit, right?

Start time: 682.10
End time: 689.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, it was the same when it first came out.  They'd got this sort of thing  where you're going over an African safari  and it's like, ooh, pixelated elephant.  Yeah, I'm gonna pay to see that.

Start time: 691.66
End time: 694.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Was the Hololens a better resolution?

Start time: 694.32
End time: 725.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was.  It was a better resolution,  but a much smaller screen area  because with the Hololens,  you're looking at like a little patch  in front of you like that, which is great.  But the key thing was that you could actually  knock certain things out.  So you could leave a computer monitor on, for example,  and have a Martian landscape in front of you  with a Samsung computer monitor sitting there  looking completely out of place.  It's very handy if you want to check this.  If you could get a set of AR glasses  which could switch to VR, that's gonna be the killer.

Start time: 726.62
End time: 729.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can basically flip a switch  and see the real world or go forward.

Start time: 729.70
End time: 733.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, you can do that with a Gear VR  because it has lenses.

Start time: 733.34
End time: 734.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it has a pass through.  Yeah.

Start time: 735.74
End time: 737.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, actually you can use the camera and the phone.

Start time: 737.62
End time: 740.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use the camera and the phone.  So it's handy. It's a little disorienting.

Start time: 740.98
End time: 744.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, taking it off is just like, it's a testament.

Start time: 744.54
End time: 749.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You pinpointed another problem  that I'd never even thought of,  this transition from the VR world to the normal world.

Start time: 749.40
End time: 764.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really do feel like a shock when you take it off.  That's how convincing it is.  Your brain is literally fooled.  And in the test, if you try to walk off a cliff,  it's very hard for people.  Or when a car goes off to a ravine,  you feel physiologically like you're falling.

Start time: 765.06
End time: 776.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the one that really freaks people out  is the guillotine.  Oh my God.  Or like you bend over and...  No.  No.  Why would you do that?  A guillotine simulator?  A guillotine simulator?  Don't steal that one out.

Start time: 776.36
End time: 785.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's like roller coaster tycoons.  There's good news and bad news.  Your head rolls down the...  You're gonna be Louis the XVI.  The bad news is you're getting your head chopped off.

Start time: 785.06
End time: 793.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might not like the ending.  You get to be king, but not very long.  The first two acts great.  Just give it a try.  Game of Thrones is gonna be very interesting.

Start time: 793.88
End time: 816.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They said that, of course, Microsoft said at its announcement  a couple of weeks ago that it's going to be  a first quarter of next year,  and it will be a developer unit.  For the developer kit.  And it will be $3,000,  and it will not look like the video  we're showing on the screen.  Because I think this is unfair,  and we've mentioned this before,  Microsoft, to show this video at the demo,  when in fact you're not seeing that.  Are you, Ian?  Not even close, right?

Start time: 816.90
End time: 845.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I mean, well, they displayed it on stage.  I was in the audience watching this,  trying to find a WiFi signal that worked.  But I mean, it's one of those things  where they've shown how it could look.  Yeah, years from now.  Yeah, I mean, I've gotta say, with that,  actually that's not that far ahead,  because what you're looking at is a very basic game,  very basic graphics.  And once you've done the work of mapping out the room  that you're in, then it actually,  it's fairly easy to set up.  But you're gonna be seeing an awful lot  of clunky stuff in the meantime.  Hey, you know what?

Start time: 846.10
End time: 856.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The first PCs were pretty clunky.  Yeah, first mobile phones were.  Yeah, first HDTVs were $10,000 for a 50 inch display.  I mean, this is all early days yet.  But money comes down.

Start time: 857.93
End time: 862.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would love to, I mean, there's a couple of things  they have kept quiet about.  The HoloLens battery life is gonna be  the absolutely key thing.

Start time: 862.70
End time: 867.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it's a PC, the whole thing's on your head, right?  There's no wires.  Well, but there's a PC in this visor.

Start time: 868.22
End time: 891.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But every time you pick up the visor,  there's no real cooling slots, it doesn't get hot.  I'm wondering how on earth they've managed  to get anything more than 15 minutes battery life  out of this.  Apparently it does do a lot better than that.  But it's gonna be some work.  And that kind of thing only really works  if you're untethered, because the whole point of AR  is you can move around the room,  and you can do various things and pick up various things.  So early days yet, but I think it's gonna be a winner.

Start time: 892.24
End time: 901.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's the good news.  It's gonna happen about the same time  my car could drive itself.  So I will be able to sit in the car, play some games,  and I won't have to worry  because a car will be driving itself.

Start time: 901.40
End time: 907.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you've got the legislative problem.  Automatic cars are only gonna work  if you don't have to be sitting there  ready to take control.

But not only that, it turns out  that the Google autonomous vehicles  have to have the road mapped before they get there.  So that's not good.  You want a car that can go anywhere, right?  This is the guy with the autonomous,  let's listen in because he's clearly terrified.  Like that way.

So the pilot doesn't get to leave.  No.  You must stay in the driver's seat.  Gotta keep looking out the windshield.  It's assist.  Yeah.  Yet this guy's driving and it's driving for him.

All these things about commutes are terrible for people.  And it really is an impediment to the economy.  If traffic can go down to,  you reduce 10, 20% of traffic,  you don't have to build a bigger highway.  Like how many, I mean up here in Petaluma,  they've been working on this goddamn road for how long?

In a lot of places like cities,  we have this issue of people who are firefighters,  let's say teachers, can't live in the cities anymore  because rent has gone up  and more people wanna live in the city.  So if we can really make commuting easier and faster  through either ride sharing  or the cars and the existing highway system,  that is gonna be really profound  and keep the economy moving.

There was actually a great article,  and I can't remember if it was in the Atlantic  or the New York or something like that,  but when they introduced the first elevators  that didn't have conductors,  people were incredibly uncomfortable.  People didn't want to get in them.  They didn't trust an elevator  without somebody actually manually controlling it.  Which is insane.  And they had to actually change the design of elevators  and get people used to the idea  that you would press a button  and it would just go to where you want to go.

Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And then there is the climate of gambling  in the United States.  And we live in a great time of change where,  look at cannabis legislation.  We have 30 states now where you have medicals.  Just a matter of time.  Just a matter of time.  Gambling will be the next one to fall.  And for sure, because if you look at the major sports leagues,  it's going on anyway,  and it's an exact parallel to the drug trade,  which is when it's underground,  it's easy for people to get ripped off.

Transcript:  Gambling is always about getting an edge.  And so, and it has been for all time.  When you play poker, I'm trying to get a read on you.  I'm trying to just have any edge I can.  And if, in poker, the biggest edge that I know of,  and, you know, I play in a lot of these big games,  it's, how tired are you?  Did you just get in a fight with your spouse?  Are you exhausted?  How are you doing?  Are you rich?  Are you poor?  How expensive is that watch?  Like, I'm looking at those issues  to see if I can get an edge on you, right?  So now you have people who are working inside of a company,  and these are people who are drawn to the gambling business,  and then they see an edge  that they can get over another person.  A huge edge, any information edge.  And that's why being legal is so important.  The whole reason Jimmy the Greek and all this,  you know, all these people became prominent.  Tipsters.  Yeah, they were basically setting the line.  The whole idea behind setting the line  is to just even out the money in gambling  so that one side doesn't take too much.  But this is peri-mutual,  so this is a little bit different, right?  Oh yeah, these guys were getting an information edge  that nobody else has.  Explain this to me,

Start time: 1545.80

Yeah, but if you just think about,  the people I know who bet on sports  bet every weekend during the football season, every weekend.  So you're talking about a dozen weekends people are betting,  and they're betting probably on average $50 or $100  or $200, which isn't a lot of money.  It's based on minimum wage.  It's a couple of hours a week.  It's people blow off steam.  In aggregate, this becomes a lot of money.  If tens of millions of people are doing it  and they're spending $1,000 a year,  you quickly get to billions,  which is why it needs to be regulated,  and it needs to be sanctioned, and they need to audit it.

Yeah, when you use a foot to kick a ball  rather than picking it up and running it  and throwing it.  Nobody's got any equipment on.  Hand egg, you love hand egg.  Throw your shoes, you think.

Transcript:  Well, isn't this, this is an explosion actually.  This, and I love the internet  because what it's clear is happening,  and you guys can confirm or deny,  but is that smart entrepreneurs  are looking for businesses ripe for disruption.  They're looking for something that's not quite working.  And I can tell you one thing that's not working.  Going into a mattress store,  I know, cause it's not working for me,  lying on a mattress for five minutes  while the saleswoman's giving you  kind of the squirrely look.  And you say, yeah, I'll take that one.  And I did that.  And I got a mattress that was way too hard.  It was horrible.  Fortunately, Casper came along  and I'm getting not only a great deal  cause you're getting it direct from the factory,  but the most comfortable mattress I've ever had.  It's, they mix,  now some people say, I don't want a memory foam mattress.  This is memory foam and they put latex on the top.  So you get the firmness and support of the memory foam,  but the comfort of the latex.  And most importantly, it breathes.  It's a cool mattress.  It comes in, look at this as a queen size mattress  in a tiny box.  I opened it in my jammies cause I figured,  hey, I'm gonna be sleeping on it next.  Yeah.  So-  You committed to the bit.  I'm committed.  That comes with a Tyvek wrapper.  You have a little, it comes with a little opener.  Watch this, you open it up  and it was very easy to get in the door  cause it's so compact, but then the mattress,  and you got a full mattress.  That memory foam is amazing.  I liked this so much.  I got one from my kid.  He's in college, third floor walkup.  Yep.  And it worked great for him.

You gotta go to Casper.com.  And by the way, you may say, well, okay,  but what about lying on the mattress in the showroom?  How about if I gave you 100 nights to try the mattress?  100 nights.  If at any time in those first 100 nights,  you say it's not for me, they come, they get it.  They refund every penny you paid.  Shipping is free, returns are free.  I mean, there's no risk at all.

Transcript:  So YouTube's highest paid stars, according to Forbes,  this is not an easy thing because the stars don't say.  YouTube definitely doesn't say.  They'd like to give you all the impression.  Everybody's getting incredibly wealthy.  Yeah, I'm sure they would.  On YouTube.  But Forbes.  Yeah, it's completely BS.  So in fact, you probably, you wrote a great article  a couple of years ago on why I'm leaving YouTube.

Start time: 2076.50
End time: 2136.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was part of the partner program  where they gave you money in advance  against your account and all that stuff.  That was a good deal.  You were lucky to cash in a lot.  It was pretty good.  I can't say exact details, but it was seven figures.  Yes.  Ahead of time, but we then had to recoup it  and it's like three years later  and we're actually recouping it now  and it's gonna work out actually.  It was a pretty good deal.  The problem is they take 45% of your revenue,  which if you are running a business  and you have a sales team,  you know your sales team is gonna cost  anywhere from 15 to 30% of your overall cost.  So if you are getting 55 and then your sales team  has to take another 20 or 30% of that 55 that you get,  now you're down to like 30%.  So great place to build a brand,  horrible place to build a business,  completely unreasonable to take 45%.  And now what they're trying to do  is do a little damage control  because last week Twitter came out  and said we're gonna give,  the rumor is Twitter's giving 70%.  I actually can confirm that  because I know people on their side.  Interesting, 30, 70 is the split.  Just like iTunes.  30, 70.  Just like Apple.  Yeah, so and that's what it should have been  from the beginning and that's what I told them.  I said I'll stick around if you do 70, 30.  It's worse on YouTube because there's no transparency.

Transcript:  And then YouTube, their interest,  every time they make a change to the YouTube system,  it's to keep the length of views.  So when you put Twitter.  Twitter effectively artificially inflate the length of views.  Yeah, but for them.  So here's the thing, when you put up,  Twitter videos where I put up this week in startups,  all of a sudden on the side are our competitors  and then you get all these subscribers  but then you can't reach them.  And they keep obscurifying your ability  to reach your audience.  And so it's a little bit of a trap.  Once you get on, you get all these subscribers  and then they change the rules.  You never actually own your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It sounds like they might have leaked these numbers to Forbes.  Oh, they have been, yeah.  Totally.  In effect to promote the idea that you, like PewDiePie,  will be making, believe it or not, $12 million a year.

Start time: 2185.22
End time: 2203.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Completely believe he makes that much money  but consider how pathetic that is  if they're making six or $7 billion  that the number one store is making that.  And then compare it to something where you look at  something like, let's say, Iron Man, right?  He's getting paid Robert Downey Jr.  50 million, 100 million.  Yeah, but he's got talent.

Start time: 2203.20
End time: 2214.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  PewDiePie just swears at us playing again.  Even still, the audience that he has.  PewDiePie is developing.  Well, and that's the other question I have.  From the point of view of YouTube,  this is a crappy audience, right?  It's 12-year-olds.

Start time: 2214.26
End time: 2217.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's everybody.  Yeah, but it's an audience  that is very difficult to deliver.

Start time: 2217.90
End time: 2228.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nobody wants 12-year-olds.  Not yet.  Especially because most of those views  are repeated views from the same few 12-year-olds.  Well, here's the thing.  I watched my 12-year-old.  He watches the same video 100 times.

Start time: 2229.38
End time: 2262.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a billion, it's now a billion people a month.  So it's everybody on YouTube.  So you can't get everybody there.  The problem is, of course,  they're just taking so much of the revenue  and they just were able to do that early  because remember when YouTube started,  you used to have to pay for bandwidth  and you used to have to pay for hosting.  So it seemed like a great deal then.  They've tried to hold the line on this revenue split  and it's ridiculous because if he's making 12 million only,  can you imagine what he's done for that platform though?  He has brought so much value to that platform  to only make 12 million a year is a joke.

Start time: 2263.28
End time: 2268.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a joke.  But conversely, there's no PewDiePie without YouTube.  There was no other platform where he was gonna go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is, it's a great way to build a brand.  But what you'll see is you had Ellen who was making,  Ellen DeGeneres and her show had a sweetheart deal  with YouTube from what I was told by insiders,  90% of the revenue.  Then YouTube started unraveling those deals  and put her back down to 55%.  Then she created Ellentube, her own YouTube.  And now Twitter is going to her saying,  we'll give you 70%.  Where does she interact all day long?  On YouTube or on Twitter?  She's on Twitter.  Where does Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga have one?  But wait a minute.  They're on Twitter.

Start time: 2300.20
End time: 2314.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Frankly, Ellen is really there for promotional value,  not for revenue.  And so she's gonna go where the audience is  and where the best audience is.  I mean, if Fallon and Ellen are on YouTube  because it generates audience for the TV show,  that's where the revenue is.

Start time: 2315.16
End time: 2326.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you think about how much they're getting  in terms of views there,  when you get a million, 10 million views for some of those,  and you can get-  A million views is like 1500 bucks.  If it's a 30 or 40 or $50 CPM for that level of talent.

Start time: 2327.30
End time: 2328.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 2328.62
End time: 2342.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting bundled into the $2, $3 YouTube garbage.  When they go over, you know, CPMs,  when they go over to Twitter  and they can put an ad on every single view,  which you can't do on YouTube,  and they get premium advertisers  and they can sell into their own inventory.

Start time: 2342.50
End time: 2343.93

Start time: 2344.16
End time: 2354.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you want?  Well, listen, these are gonna be legitimate views  and they're going to get 30, 40, 50 dollars CPM.  View is a view, it doesn't matter.  I think for the advertisers, it's gonna be a great view  and it's gonna be a 30, 40 dollars CPM.  Because you know, on TV,

They're at 300 million or whatever monthlies.  They could go right to a billion  because if they start getting people like Justin Bieber  and Ellen to start putting their videos over there  and interacting with their audience,  nobody can interact.  Would you ever talk to the YouTube commenters?  No.  It's horrible.  Stay away from them.  But on Twitter, you get all really great considered people  and they're gonna let you control your video.

But this is in all kind of mostly,  it's under 20s.  At Teeny Bopper.  Teeny Bopper.  Retin, this is, actually I like her.  She's the dancing violinist, Lindsay Sterling.  Retin Link?  When they talk about these numbers though,  I noticed in the Fortune article,  they're also including money that Coca-Cola  and others pay Retin Link to make  kind of crap pseudo native content ads.  Oh, they're including the native content.  They're including the native content.  So I don't think they're making this kind of money  off of YouTube.

Start time: 2440.44
End time: 2457.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, at the name of the game.  That is not Michelle Pham.  That's not Michelle Pham.  This is very confusing.  The whole idea behind Michelle Pham  is making $3 million here.  She's making, you know,  much more selling  tens of millions of cosmetics baskets.  So almost everybody who's made it work on YouTube  has stuff off YouTube.  That's my point.  For Ellen, it's a promotional thing.

Start time: 2458.02
End time: 2489.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, what it comes down to is  you have to balance,  is the value that you get at  having your videos on YouTube as a platform  more or less than the value that you're able to extract  by showing your content somewhere else, right?  And I think that if you are reliant on YouTube  for the audience,  especially when you're early,  it makes a lot of sense.  You build, like Jason said,  you build your, not just your brand,  but you build your audience there.  There comes a point when your audience is big enough  and maybe loyal enough  where you can try to move them off of YouTube or-  Get their email address.  And that's when you really monitor.  That's when you check.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2490.36
End time: 2586.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to get their email address.  And so, and I-  I can't.  Can you get it from YouTube?  No. So the whole name of the game  is people are running contests and landing pages  and they'll let you click off of,  and I actually was the person  who actually got YouTube to concede this.  I convinced Saller,  who was the previous head before Susan,  to let you link out to your own site.  So they let you link out to one domain name.  And in the conversation I had with Saller,  I was like, listen, Saller,  I want to link to my website.  He's like, you can't link off of YouTube.  Annotations can only link to other videos.  I said, well, why can't I link to myself?  He's like, well, we'll have spamming.  I'm like, yeah, but I'm a partner.  Right, yeah.  You've already positioned me for trust.  You have my credit card,  you have my social security number,  you have my tax ID.  We're already splitting revenue.  Why don't you let the partners at least link to themselves?  And they relented and said, you can put in one URL.  So I put in the URL of our website,  and then I created redirects to go to our Twitter,  to go to our email landing pages,  and try to move it over.  And we moved over, I would say,  1% of our audience per month to email subscriptions.  And so what you do is, the name of the game is to just get,  if you're iJustine and you have two or three million,  well, you should probably get 10 million subscribers,  if you can just get, eventually, 10% of those,  a million of those emails,  then you will not be dependent on YouTube.  And then, what's gonna happen is a marketplace  is now emerging between Yahoo, Facebook, and Twitter  to get this talent.  And I think YouTube's not gonna go from a million,  a billion viewers down to a hundred million,  but they're gonna have serious competition.  And this talent is going to leave and go other places  and publish other places first,  and publish other places more.

Start time: 2587.26
End time: 2599.69

And just flashing that in front of a late teen  or an early 20 year old, they think, I can do that.  And of course, 99% of them won, but that 1% won't.

And the timing of it was interesting,  because I mean, the Nexus 5 is two years old  and it's really showing it.  The Nexus 6 is less than a year old,  but nobody's buying it. And yet, the Nexus 5  is beloved compared to the Nexus 6.  Yeah, well, I mean, even Googlers  don't like the Nexus 6.  The Nexus 6 was not a good phone.

Transcript:  And yet, it's so personal that I don't know,  you still have to make that decision.  Like for me, what is the best?  Because a review is only gonna tell you so much  about how you're gonna like it.  For instance, for me, battery life is all I...  I mean, if the...  And all I care about on the 6P, which I have ordered,  and I hope will come in a few weeks, is battery life.  If battery life's fine, then everything else will be fine.  If it can't get 20 hours, 18 to 20 hours,  the way, and again, this is a problem,  because it's the way I use it, not the way you use it.

These will be Google Fi phones,  at least for me, it'll be a Google Fi phone,  although it's unlocked, so you can put anything on it.  And I actually like Fi because it uses  either T-Mobile or Sprint.  So I'm less likely to be hunting.  In the city, I'll use Sprint.  Here, I'll be using T-Mobile.  I'm hoping that will also...  And Marshmallow's supposedly much better.

Start time: 2822.82
End time: 2847.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My only problem with Fi,  because I'm still testing this out,  but it seems to default more to the Sprint network  than it does to the T-Mobile.  Here, it's T-Mobile.  And you've got to carry around the equipment  to handle both T-Mobile and Sprint's networks.  Well, you do, that's the phone.  Yeah, I know, but T-Mobile is largely based around LTE,  whereas Sprint has still got an awful lot of...  CDMA, yeah.  Yeah, CDMA stuff out there.  So you've got an extra hardware load.

Start time: 2908.22
End time: 2922.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is why it's a limited rollout.  I think the carriers are still trying to work out.  But they've gone with T-Mobile and Sprint.  AT&T and Verizon would have left these people  out of the building.  Right.  Because the underdogs need them.  Exactly.

Start time: 2923.10
End time: 2937.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Sprint, and yes, Sprint historically  has been very friendly to the MVNOs  because what ends up happening is these guys do  the cost of customer acquisition and the marketing for them.  And Sprint's ended up purchasing a lot of the MVNOs.  That's right.  Like they purchased Virgin.  Virgin Mobile they purchased, yeah.

Start time: 2937.98
End time: 2950.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google doesn't need to make a profit off of us  as consumers from the service, as the MVNO.  And they don't try to make money off the phone hardware  either.  They're just trying to make money off of you doing searches.

Start time: 2950.22
End time: 2961.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean.  That's a tough business model to beat if you're Sprint  or you're LG or you're HTC or Samsung.  Or even Apple.  They've taken two layers of cost out.  How do you beat that model?  That's a great model.

Start time: 2961.30
End time: 2974.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only reason they can do this is because you guys  are getting hosed so badly on your mobile bills  by the existing duopoly.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean seriously, if you had a decent level of competition  in the US mobile industry, this wouldn't be possible.  I don't know why more people don't use MVNOs

Start time: 2974.38
End time: 2978.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  because they're almost always a lot cheaper, right,  than the big carriers.  Yeah, typically.

Start time: 2978.58
End time: 3016.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean you look at something like Straight Talk.  Yeah, or Ting, which is one of our advertisers.  But I mean at the end of the day,  MVNOs are leasing capacity from the established.  Do you think it's treated differently by Sprint?  Sometimes, I mean sometimes the customer service  can be a little more complicated.  But the quality of service is the same.  The quality is gonna be the same, yeah.  Yeah, they're not gonna throttle you or something.  It's hard for them to pass a certain point  because even if they're paying a wholesale rate,  it's not like they can just, I mean,  I guess Google could sell it at a loss  or something like that.  But at some point, they have to pay the carrier  for the capacity.

Transcript:  Google Fiber is different  because they're not renting capacity from somebody else.  Yeah.  They are building out their own.  Ultimately, they're buying somebody's.  Well, they're buying, I mean they're buying bandwidth.  They're going to level three or cogent.

Transcript:  Well, also they've been very picky  in where they put Google Fiber  because they work out sweetheart deals  with the local government in order to  either get it up onto the wires.  That's right.  Or get some kind of tax break.  But who wouldn't do that deal?  Oh, yeah, I mean definitely.  Google Fiber.  We'd love, it's, I mean,  it's frustrating writing about this  because if you live in the Bay Area,  you have to put up with such lousy wife,  lousy internet connections usually.

Transcript:  Is it because we have old infrastructure?

Start time: 3078.52
End time: 3128.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's because of the legacy.  One, it's a big country, right?  But also like the regulatory environment that we have  and the way that we've done a lot of this stuff.  So if you look at, say, how we did cable TV,  cable companies would go to a local municipality  and cut a deal where it was,  we agree to, we get a monopoly, right?  An exclusive franchise in this area from the municipality.  But then in response, the cable company has to agree  to wire up every single home.  So there's sort of that trade-off there.  And the way we've done this before in the past  was this idea that it's because of the cost  of laying the actual infrastructure,  which was wired in most cases,  that the trade-off is that you have to give the company  some sort of exclusivity.  You give a monopoly in return for the franchise.  And then there's a level of regulation, right?  They have to appeal to some sort of board or commission  to raise their rates and things like that.

Start time: 3128.30
End time: 3129.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is where, by the way, it's fallen down.

Start time: 3130.18
End time: 3167.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fallen down because what's happened is that  the Comcast and Time Warner's of the world  have figured out that they can-  They bully the hell out of these guys.  They lobby and they create this revolving door.  And so they want the monopoly without the regulation.  And I think the thing is you have to have both.  And if you look at, say, like in the UK,  the level of regulation is actually very high  and it's actually led to a better situation for consumers.  So it's the right kind of-  It's counterintuitive.  We have this idea that less regulation is always better.  That's the American way.  But it's been proven that there are circumstances,  and this is a good example of one,  where a more regulated market  actually leads to better competition.  And if we had-  Which is more capitalist at the end of the day.

Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, the TV license is a tricky one  because it pays for the BBC, which has a public education.  I don't think that's gonna fly here.  No, but on the other hand,  if you look at how much people you pay for the BBC  or the support you pay for other subscription channels,  it's a bargain.  I mean, it's about 120, 60 year or something,  I think, in the UK, and it's nothing.  People are spending 40 bucks a month on sports.

So when I got mine, I didn't have the dome lights,  and I didn't have the, and the Model S,  I didn't have like the cubby,  and a lot of pieces were missing,  because they hadn't come from the manufacturer,  or they hadn't built them yet.  So then when I sent the car in for service,  they replaced, there was like seven or eight things  that were missing, they replaced three or four of them.  I said, no, no, don't replace them.  I want the original.  I wanted to not have that, so that the car is,  and then I sent the new one.  More than that, so it's in pristine.  So then I got this person who offered me $250,000  for the first one, and I paid whatever, $1.25 for it.  So I was like, wow, double my money.  That's poker speak for $125,000.

You don't have to put an extra two stamps on there.  Because you're worried.  Because you're worried you don't want to send it postage too.  On the other hand, you don't want to overpay.

The US post office came up with this thing  where they said if you want to ship a book  or a CD or a DVD, all this stuff,  you can get it for half off or something.  It's slow.  Well, it's two to 10 days,  but here's what it turns out in reality.  It's the same.  It winds up being the same.  Because the truck's going anyway.  Because the truck's going anyway.  So they're not like, oh, I'm going to make this one go slow.  Hold this one back.  They're just like, put it on the truck, go.  So it always winds up going fast,  but it saves half as much.  So it wasn't making sense for people to resell books  because the cost of the book was greater  than the cost of the shipping.

I don't own any public company stocks  unless one of the investments I've made  in a private company gets bought by them.  And so I had shares in the company WhatsApp,  which got bought by Facebook.  How did you know WhatsApp would be big?  I didn't.  I was what's called an LP in another venture capital firm.  So I was a limited partner  in another venture capital firm that bought them.  So then when the shares get sold,  they send the shares to you.  So I wound up with some Facebook shares,  which I'm gonna be liquidating.  So that's the only disclosure I have because.  You know who owns Twitter?  He owns more than Jack Dorsey.  Steve Bomber.  And he opened a Twitter account.  This is gonna be awesome.  He's never used Twitter.  It's gonna be so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 4025.18
End time: 4040.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may have turned out to be a bad idea in the long run,  because I think that if you,  so many of the innovations in the product  actually came from the ecosystem.  Almost all of them.  Yeah.  And I also think that it put them down a path  that forced them to be an advertising revenue only business.

Start time: 4041.36

Transcript:  It's very similar to how Yahoo was put up against Google.  And if you put yourself up against Google,  you're gonna fail.  You have to be who you are.  And I think what Twitter has done really well  is they're really great for news.  They're really great for journalists  and like, let's say opinion leaders, right?  That's where they all seem to hang out and talk.  And they're really great at video  with Periscope and Vine.  And they're great at buying small companies  that have a million users  and getting them to 25 million users.  So they should be a collection of brands  and they should go all in on video.  Kind of like Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you look, I mean, Facebook now has Instagram,  WhatsApp, and the Messenger.  And they all are hundreds of millions  and they collectively, they're over a billion, obviously.  And so this is a great roadmap for Twitter  and they're great at video  and they're great at capturing celebrities.  So when you think about celebrities or journalists  or politicians, they manage their own Twitter presence.  And in a lot of cases,  they don't manage their YouTube and Facebook.  They have people do that, right?  Because it's complicated.  It's not personal.

Transcript:  Twitter's gonna have a great comeback.  Here's the thing.  Whenever a founder comes back to a company,  either they got unfinished business  and it's very similar to when Larry Page and Sergey,  although they didn't leave the company,  they had to put Eric Schmidt in charge  for Wall Street to like it.  That's who Dick Costolo was at that point in time.  Now you had Jack go off, go on his little hero's journey,  go do Square, went to see Yoda, became a better person.  Jack's a much more developed person than he was.  And because Nick Bilton's really-  Skewered him.  Yeah, I mean, he looked, you couldn't have looked worse.  He looked very immature.  Like an egotist, you're immature.  Petty, immature, all this stuff.  And you know what?  I think that really hit him hard.  He's a very sensitive guy.  I know him personally.  He's a pants designer.  I mean, he's a fashion.  He's an artist.  He's very sensitive.  He's very considered.  And I think he's become a magnificent leader now  and people wanna work for him.  That's good.  And he's got clarity of vision.  And so when you hear him speak,  he's become much more mature and he's much more,  I did that for you by the way, much more mature.  And he's got very good clarity of vision  of what he wants it to be.  Now people can debate what it should be  or what it's gonna be,  but he's gonna take it in a certain direction.  He's gonna, and when the founder takes over like that,  it tends to be a great thing for the stock.  And it tends to be a great thing for the company.  People are gonna wanna work there.

Start time: 4269.34
End time: 4284.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Jack does have that square.  So we learned from that.  And right now Twitter is so on its heels and so beat up  that I think people are gonna give him a couple of years  to figure it out.  I think the stock market will give him a year or two  because it's already on the floor.  The stock market.  First actions, he announces layoffs,

Start time: 4284.74

It's better on mobile than it is on the desktop.  It doesn't make any sense on the desktop, but on mobile.  I find it really annoying on mobile.  It's not.  It's jarring.  Well, a couple of problems.  It's nobody I know, right?  It's not made up of my, it's not like Nuzzle  where it's made up of people I follow.  It's just what Twitter's editors have decided  is the big today news, sports, entertainment are fun.  There's a lot of repetition  because the same stories show up in all three of them.  Look, here's today.

Start time: 4343.42
End time: 4359.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they obscure-ify all of the Twitter retweets  and the following the person.  It's all in ellipses,  which is a tiny little product detail.  They don't want you to click through the source.  They don't want you to engage with it.  They just want you to swipe through it.  So it's really kind of dumb consumption,  which is the opposite of the Twitter mix.

Start time: 4360.36
End time: 4371.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I understand the point,  which is that a lot of people come to Twitter  and go, I don't get it.  Even with the recommended users and all of that.  It could be an onboarding trick.  It's for onboarding.  It's so that there's something there you can look at.

But, I mean, look, what we're seeing,  we're seeing this moment where,  because of mobile and because of how bad  the mobile experience of the regular web is,  these social publishing platforms,  which is what Facebook and Twitter are,  they're absorbing media, right?  And it makes sense because they wanna keep people  within those experiences,  and they can frankly offer something that is better  than what the publishers are offering themselves.  And I think there's a,  I wrote about this a few weeks ago.  There's a reason why people use ad blockers, right?  And it's because the experience of the regular web  is pretty bad.

Start time: 4468.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The mobile browser is just so slow,  and there's so much cruft that an ad blocker  or using a native solution like native Twitter,  native Facebook video is so great.  But publishers can hack this.  So what I did with my podcast was  we take the best of clips,  and it would be great for Twitter to do this.  We put a best of clip,  and at the bottom we put a lower third for stamps  or a lower third for whoever the sponsor is.  And at the end we say, brought to you by whoever.  This is Twitter video you're talking about?  On Twitter video.  So my native videos.  So we don't have access to that.  You have access to that.  We have it, you can easily get access.  I'll talk to Adam Bayne or whatever.  You said that last time.  I'll CC Adam Bayne, you get it.  Anyway, here's the thing.  What's gonna be great about it is  you bake the ads in like that,  and then you can game their system.  So you can buy penny ads.  Oh, Adam's gonna like that.  Can you take that part out and then?  Well, I mean, listen, here's the thing.  Facebook told me,  and I had this meeting with Sheryl Sandberg  once when I was talking to her about it.  I was like, hey, I'm putting my stuff up on,  I'm putting my podcast up on your system,  and it says I can't sell ads on my Facebook page,  but you want me to pay money to promote my Facebook page.  She's like, yeah, you can't sell ads.  So I'm like, well, I have ads in my podcast baked in.  We read the ads.  She's like, you do.  And she's like, yeah, that's okay.  I was like, okay, so you're not gonna  kick us off for that so they don't enforce it.  So here's the thing.  What are they gonna do?  Go to guys like us and say, yeah,  we don't want your content on there if you bake it in.  It's kind of what YouTube told me.  Yeah, and then you know what you tell,  you put it up and say, go ahead, YouTube,  I dare you to take this freaking tech down.  Actually, we do put it up.  I dare you to take it down.  They'll never do that.

Maybe there's an opportunity to do better by publications.  Share that ad revenue.  Maybe there's an opening here  because these other platforms haven't done such a good job.  You have to go in eyes wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the big problem with,  I mean, from a publishing perspective,  as someone who's still in the industry,  is you've got pressure from so many,  so many, so many, pressure from so many different areas.  And we've seen it with other publications who've panicked,  particularly about on the ad blocking issues  and just like gone for more and more esoteric ads  to try and beat the ad blocker.  You didn't need to panic, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're trimming it.  They're not, I mean, it's all coming down to,  there's also one thing that's really encouraging  is you're seeing smart ad block use.  So people, we've been writing about this for years,  but we've seen more and more people,  if they like a site, they will take ad blocker off it  because they're contributing to that site.  Which is great, because people, by the way,

Start time: 4633.56
End time: 4645.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think a lot of people don't do it  because you just turn it on and you forget about it.  But that is a way for you as a user to influence sites  and to reward sites who give you ads that respect you  as opposed to abuse you.

Start time: 4645.44
End time: 4657.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they also do it if the site is obnoxious with the ads,  like roadblocks and everything,  it's like, okay, I'm gonna punish you and ad block you.  But if you're reasonable and the New York Times  has like some beautiful ads,  ah, screw it, I'll accept them.

Start time: 4657.78
End time: 4664.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Be nice if we could do that.  Most ad blockers don't foster that.  They're just, they block everything you never know.  You just go in and you go, yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 4704.61

Start time: 4711.62
End time: 4724.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is actually one of the things where we see  that Apple's actually not good at this stuff.  They're terrible.  Yeah, their basic apps are basic.  Yeah, and so the question then is,  do they get this right in a few years,  or is this something that they kill?  Or do they?

Start time: 4725.28
End time: 4736.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is the problem with an app.  People open it once, if it sucks, they put it away.  They throw it, they put it in the Apple folder,  which I have and everybody uses it and my phone has.  Everybody's got that junk folder.  The junk folder.

Start time: 4736.58
End time: 4768.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crud.  I think what Apple does is,  they build an app that is so basic  that it's for people who don't wanna install other apps,  like your grandfather or your uncle,  whoever doesn't wanna do that,  and they make them extremely simple  and they don't compete with the ecosystem.  Whatever comes out in the ecosystem,  two years later, they add it to their base product.  So, if Sunrise has some really great calendar thing  or swiping.  Just like Microsoft bought them.  I know, but let's say you have like,  mailbox does swiping on email, right?  Does the native-

Start time: 4768.50

Start time: 4770.98
End time: 4808.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dropbox bought that one, I think.  Dropbox bought mailbox.  But all those little features,  swiping the email left or right,  they'll add it to the mailbox,  but they'll wait two years to give the app ecosystem  time to profit off of them, right?  iMessage added your location, share your location for an hour.  They could've added that two years ago  when other people had it like Waze or whatever.  So, I think they purposely make their own apps limited.  That's a theory.  Not to compete with the ecosystem.  Not to compete.  If they just ripped off the ecosystem like Facebook does,  everybody just gave up on building apps.  Remember the verb Sherlocked?  No, what does it mean?  Oh yeah, you know that, right?  What is Sherlocked?

Start time: 4808.58
End time: 4830.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So, Sherlock was a wonderful app written by OBDev,  I believe, it was a great tool.  And then, actually it wasn't Sherlock,  it was called Launcher, something.  Sidekick?  And then Apple came out with Sherlock  putting that company out of business.  And almost every Apple announcement,  they're putting somebody out of business.  They've essentially co-opted somebody's software.

Start time: 4830.54
End time: 4836.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  You get one chance with an app.  And Facebook, every one of these apps,  people launched them once and then threw them away.  You get one chance.

Start time: 4876.82
End time: 4882.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true, but then they end up getting  something like Facebook Messenger right  where they pull it out and they got that right.

Start time: 4882.66
End time: 4898.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That was tricky because they had to force people.  Absolutely.  No, you can't use it in the app.  You have to get, install, and use Facebook Messenger.  Oh, you know why they did that?  You know why?  They got lock-in.  If your friends are using Messenger,  even if you're pissed off that you had to do that,  you're not gonna-

Start time: 4898.06
End time: 4932.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a reason they did that, I heard, from the inside.  They, you know how when you first turn on an app,  they say like, hey, can we allow this to use Insta,  allows this to Messenger you?  Well, when they launched the Facebook app,  they didn't do that.  So, and it didn't exist, I think.  So everybody had Facebook on their phones,  which means none of the users had alerts on.  So if you install Messenger again,  you get to put the alert on.  So they just said, oh, well on a growth basis,  the 400 million people who have the app  don't have alerts on.  How do we get alerts on?  But it also fits with their larger-  You can't do it retroactively.  It fits with their larger strategy

Start time: 4932.18
End time: 4938.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  of having separate apps.  And the other thing is they're turning Messenger  into a platform like WeChat that does so much more-

Start time: 4938.76
End time: 4979.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are obsessed with owning the notification layer  because they realize that that has become the top level  of the smartphone experience.  Not the front page anymore.  We actually did a whole one-day summit at BetaWorks  a couple weeks ago where all we just talk  about the future of notifications.  And it turns out that this is where users are sort of,  they're migrating because that's sort of the first-  It's the first thing you see.  First thing they interact with, right?  And so what's happening is that we're seeing apps  that are being built that are just notifications.  You interact just as notifications,  but you're also seeing that as apps are trying to compete  for attention and for engagement,  they're trying to push as many notifications out  as they can get away with.

Start time: 4979.10
End time: 4990.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And Apple's aware of this because they have spanked  developers like PCalc, they put a calculator  in the notifications and they delisted them.  Yeah, though they let that launcher one come back.

Start time: 4991.14
End time: 5006.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think what's going on is that I think that we're at,  sort of, imagine what email, remember what email was like  before we had, before Gmail, right?  Before we had good spam filters, right?  And so we're kind of at that place where we don't have  the intelligence and the notification layer in the OS,  the smartphone OS.

Start time: 5007.26
End time: 5015.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It strikes me that's probably where the Apple Watch exists  because essentially it's a notification machine.  It absolutely is.  It surfaces notifications.  Yeah, and I think that eventually-

Start time: 5015.30
End time: 5023.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I hate it.  We're going to get to a place where-  I don't want them.  I don't need them.  The notification needs to be smarter.  We'll get there eventually.  It's one of the first things,

Start time: 5023.82
End time: 5035.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  if you're going to use the Apple Watch,  you do is you prune notifications.  You have to because it's not usable otherwise.  I actually finally said, stop telling me to stand up.  I will stand up, but I'm not going to do it right now.

It must be really irritating,  Yeah, you haven't tracked the steps.  You know what, in my own OCD mind,  I have a little bit of that OCD,  I don't like missing flights.  Because it's not the steps, it's the flights.  You mean air flights?  No, it counts how many flights of stairs you go,  and the flights are hard to get.  You lose three flights, you only do 30 a day.  I don't want to lose three of my 30.  It's ridiculous, but I'll go back to that.  I just got the stand-up notice.  And the sleeping.

And I am now, when I see I got four or five hours of sleep,  like two days in a week,  I really put an effort into that next night  of getting a full eight.  How do you act on this information?  It's very simple.  When you see that you're getting disrupted in sleep,  you say, what disrupted me?  Oh, bulldogs.  Oh, I was on my computer.  Oh, I had this double espresso, short and tight.  Everything is, you start to learn what the items are,  and then you start eliminating them.  So we did the blackout curtains,  bulldogs in the other room,  no screen time like Peter was talking about,  and then I got this thing called flux from my desktop.

Everybody's talking about this blue light.  The blue light.  So it's so great.  I got a, I use the Kindle, the E Ink Reader,  because it actually doesn't produce the blue light,  because it's not an LCD screen.  It has just the edge lighting.

It's a real thing, real thing.  So what flux does is it's an app for Mac,  and it just changes your screen view  based on if the sun's down,  and what time of night is the ambience.

But first, when's, you know what?  This is a, this might help me with my sleep.  Go to meeting.  Oh yes.  Because I'm going to be more efficient during the day  so I could sleep better at night.  Go to meeting means you don't have to travel.  That's the worst thing for sleep.  Get on a plane, new time zone, terrible for sleep.  Terrible.  Not to mention expensive.  What if you could just meet wherever you are  with whoever you need to meet.  Your team, your clients, your colleagues all over the world,  your suppliers, but you don't have to leave home.  They don't have to leave home.  They like you for that.  You can meet from any computer,  but you can also meet from an iPad,  from a smartphone, from any tablet.  No traffic, no travel expenses.  Start the meeting on time.  Started on time, ended on time.  Get things done faster.  You can record the audio.  You're seeing each other's screen.  Absolutely.  I use it 10 times a week.  HD cameras on everything nowadays  so you see each other face to face.  You don't lose any of that body language.

You press one button, boom, it puts in the meeting code  and then emails it to everybody.  So I'm just like, you want a meeting?  I put it in, I press the button and it's all set up.  You don't need to have an assistant or anything  and then everybody can dial it  because most people want to dial in on the phone  so they'll dial in on the phone.

Transcript:  So Omid Kordestani is an interesting fellow.  Employee number 11 at Google.  So very early Googler.  He kind of is one of those guys who's on the beach at Google.  He still works for Google  but he doesn't have any real responsibilities.  He was employee number 11 or something like that.  He was a business guy, right?  He was a business guy.  He makes relationships so weird all of a sudden.  Well, I mean, he's on the board of Twitter.

End time: 5577.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Omid, go on over to that Twitter.  No, no, no, no.  Check it out.  Help get that into shape.  Google said. And then we'll acquire it.

Transcript:  Google is a natural acquirer for Twitter, obviously  because they felt that everything social they've ever done  and everybody believes that if the price goes down  to a certain point that Google would buy it  or it would become a potential purchase.

Transcript:  Even a hostile takeover.

Start time: 5593.18
End time: 5651.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to do.  It's harder to do.  Harder to do.  Why?  Because if you do a one.  You want everybody to like you.  But there's that.  You do the hostile takeover.  Are people gonna leave the company?  You lose the management team.  But it's just also hard to wrangle all the stock  and then the price will just keep going up.  People won't sell it to you.  But it's easier to just come in  and just give everybody a 50% premium on it.  And they can afford that.  Microsoft, when they tried to buy Yahoo,  it was just like trying to get a deal done is hard.  But he is a consummate deal maker  and in the early days of Google,  you have to remember, Google had no distribution.  What did Google do?  They got Yahoo to put Google on it.  Which I think was a Michael Moritz deal more than Omid.  But they got Google everywhere.  And they fought to get it into browsers,  into Firefox, et cetera.  And he was the guy who got them all those deals  and a lot of publishers, New York Times, et cetera,  to put AdWords on and put AdSense on rather.  And he is a consummate deal maker  and that's what he'll do for Twitter.

Transcript:  So VentureBeat has a story about how he's gonna have  a $12 million package for becoming  executive chairman of Twitter.  But remember, this guy's got $123 million in Google stock.  He doesn't really need to go to Twitter.  He doesn't really need to do anything.  He could head up to the South Pacific for the rest of it.  If it were you and me, we'd go together to the Seychelles.  We'd enjoy a little softshell crab.  That's interesting.  We'd go to the Seychelles right after this.

Start time: 5703.48
End time: 5712.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually easier for them to buy it  now that they've re-org'd with Alphabet.  Yeah, make it an Alphabet, make it a G, or a T.  They can make it a T.  Yeah, exactly, they can bring it  and not actually put it underneath Google itself.

Start time: 5712.44
End time: 5727.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the reason.  I mean, the reason they did Alphabet  was for exactly this reason, to buy things  and to let senior managers operate on their own cap table.  So for people like Tony with Nest, et cetera,  they really don't want to have a boss.  They don't want to answer in to somebody.

Start time: 5727.36
End time: 5728.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Same with Boston Dynamics, yeah.

Start time: 5729.24
End time: 5756.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what it also does is  it's gonna act as a shield for antitrust stuff,  where they say, oh my God, Google is listening  through your Nest cam, and they're gonna target  AdSense against it.  And they're gonna be like, well, those are separate companies  and they don't share information,  now they're separate buildings and separate people,  separate cap tables, separate accounting.  And so it's like just starting down that path  to make life a little bit easier with the regulators.

Transcript:  And help them avoid the strategy tax,  which Microsoft has paid and obviously shows.  What is the strategy tax?  Well, it's where you can't do certain,  different parts of your business,  can't do what's best for them  because they have to keep some other parts.  Sony is a classic example of this,  where they basically ruined the PS3 for that generation  because they had to put a Blu-ray player in,  which drove the price up,  because they had to keep the other part  of the business happy.

Start time: 5781.40
End time: 5803.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they also had that with the Walkman,  where they're like, oh, we have to release MiniDisc.  And they were all bought into that.  Remember the MiniDisc format?  So the hardware and Columbia,  they bought Columbia Records, they bought Def Jam,  or Columbia bought Def Jam, they had Sony Records.  And there was like that whole integrated,  convergence was the word we used to use.  Oh my God.  And convergence means don't do  what's best for the consumer.  And you see how that worked out for Sony.  Yeah.

Transcript:  The real thing, when you buy a company  and then you have the founders around,  it makes it harder for the management team  that bought the company,  because everybody will look towards the founder  for guidance.  It undermines management.  And it undermines the management.  So I literally have had, in the two cases I sold companies,  where we're like, you know, Jason,  it might be time for you to go on to your next adventure  because everybody wants to talk to you.

Start time: 5879.32
End time: 5887.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you think about the largest hedge funds  in the world, I think are just tipping $100 billion, right?  Like if you think Apple has $120 or $130 billion in cash.  Yeah, Apple could spend $60.

Start time: 5887.44
End time: 5889.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They're the largest.  But how does Dell even have $67 billion?

Start time: 5889.76
End time: 5897.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This must be multiple hedge funds giving them money.  And I think they did this with some bond offering,  but I think EMC has predictable revenue,  so it's a little bit easier.

Start time: 5898.06
End time: 5906.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is the business of EMC?  What the hell do they do?  Storage.  They're hard, they make storage.  It's enterprise storage.

Start time: 5906.76
End time: 5914.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But VMware is really the business there.  EMC owns VMware?  Didn't they spit it out though?  VMware is actually bigger than EMC.  Yeah, that was the biggest acquisition.

Start time: 5914.92
End time: 5955.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was the best acquisition ever  because they bought it for a billion  and it's worth 30 or something.  Yeah, it's been a hugely successful.  Or maybe they bought it for 500 million.  I don't know what the run-up is,  but they bought a company  that then became bigger than the mothership,  which I actually have a theory.  I think YouTube becomes bigger  than Google search eventually.  Because if you think about it,  how often, although search has bigger intent for purchase,  we all spend much more time watching video.  And video ads are super compelling as well.  They're equal, they only match to search ads  or really video ads in the world.  And video ads, if Google continues  and people actually, it competes with TV  and they start having Netflix-like programming on it,  hey, it's just really conceivable.

Start time: 5955.98
End time: 5959.98

Start time: 5960.32
End time: 5975.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also created Pivotal,  which was a combination of three or four different assets  that they spun out.  And that company, I believe, is worth a billion or two,  at least.  I've actually, I know a lot of people over there,  a lot of my friends work at Pivotal.

Start time: 5975.56
End time: 5981.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  The idea is that, the reason you've had this happen,  where you have a computer and it's a touchscreen  and you push it and it falls over.  Yeah, it sucks.  So the idea is it changes the center of gravity on the thing  by extending the...

Start time: 6065.76
End time: 6078.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is another reason, however,  if you're, well, you're both using Apple products,  and you notice how the keyboard is recessed  to avoid having the screen touch the keyboard.  Oh, but this was a big problem on Apple for a long time.  You had the keyboard on your screen.

Start time: 6078.68
End time: 6083.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  These keys were hitting on the screen.  Yeah.  And so the keys never touched the screen.  With a service book, the keys don't touch the screen.

Transcript:  When you hold it like this, can you see through it?  Is there like a little bit of space in there?  Yeah, there's a gap.  There's a gap.  So you can get dust or like,  if you have like cookies in your bags,  things are gonna get in there.  It doesn't see it. Exactly.  And this is something else.  So you gotta get a little bag.

Transcript:  The one I got is 2099,  because that's the lowest model you can get with a GP,  a discrete GPU, otherwise it uses the Intel Iris graphics.  You want a discrete GPU,  especially because it's a 3000 by 2000 screen,  and it's an i5, it's not an i7,  and I only got eight gigs of RAM.  All of this will add up,  but 2099, I think, is actually the price of the one you want.  256 gig SSD.

That people pay attention to it,  but the thing was, when you were Apple  and they know they're gonna have to go into Steve Jobs  and Johnny Ive or whatever and show it to him  and they know they're gonna get reamed,  even if it's good they're gonna get reamed.  Like that's the best case scenario  is that they have to do a bunch of notes and fix it.  They had to go into a meeting with HP, Lenovo,  Microsoft and Intel.  So there's executives from four companies  that had to approve this campaign.  That's the problem.  That's the issue.  It's like a consortium.

But the profits are really only in the hardware.  And only in the high end of the hardware.  The profits in the hardware.  It's the high end.  The high end of the hardware.

I was going to Canada to do the TV show.  I had to bill them for my expenses, for my day rate,  and I had to do it in Canadian dollars.  I was firing up Excel and Word to do this.  It was so bad that I stopped billing them.  For three months, I just didn't send them bills.  Month four, I sent them a bill.  They said, what is this?  I'm not gonna pay this.  You got an invoice if you're gonna get paid,  and if you're gonna get paid,  you wanna do it in a timely way.  You want FreshBooks.  It makes it easy.  It handles all the currencies.

These things were going 50, 60 miles an hour in the air.  They're not drone racing.  Drone racing's awesome.  Yeah, he was showing me the unregulated ones.  When they sell them, they have regulators on them  so they can only go maybe 20 miles per hour.  But the speed and accuracy and the ability  to not crash them on people's heads now is phenomenal.  If they lose range, they come home.  They land within three or four feet of where they took off.  And if you say, I want to go down,  you used to push the throttle down  and they came down as fast as possible  and broke into pieces.  Now if you put the throttle perfectly down,  it comes down at a graduated pace.  Oh yeah, it's amazing.  And they're going, these next versions with LiDAR  and whatever, computer vision,  you're gonna try to fly it into a wall  and it will stop and it won't let you.  So they're getting safer,  but I don't know if I'm ready to live in a world  where people are just flying these through cities  and over people's houses.  There's gonna have to be some new regulation around  how high over my house you can go.

Because we had this issue in LA where helicopters,  the rule was they can just, it's safety.  So they can go as low as they want as long as it's safe.  And they were coming to the 405 in Brentwood and Bel Air  during rush hour with five helicopters.  And all of the communities there got together and said,  listen, you guys are way too low.

But I mean, imagine the scenario  that you live in an apartment building in New York  and someone flies a drone up to your window  and just parks it right out there,  the camera on with a live feed.  I mean, is it public space?  Is that something that's,  because it's legal to walk around  and take photos of people on the street, right?  You can do that.  We all understand that.

So big unicorn, a young woman who was at Stanford  decided in 2003 that she was going to invent a way  to test blood with just a few drops  instead of the vial that they have to draw,  formed a company called Theranos in 2003,  got people like Larry Ellison to fund it  up to the tune of $400 million,  got two US Secretaries of State,  a former US Defense Secretary,  former Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  on the Board of Directors.

There's a very significant chance  that the whole thing's a fraud  from the people I've talked to.  Now this is all rumor and speculation,  Well here's what the Journal said.  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal does not put itself,  it's publication on the line.  This is not a blog.  This is the Wall Street Journal  that did a very long investigative journalist piece.  Continue.

Start time: 7263.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They, of course, blood tests are regulated.  The FDA regulates them.  And the way they generally do this  is they send samples to the company  that's doing blood tests and check on them.  It turns out, according to the Journal,  that Theranos had it's own Edison blood test machines,  but they also had other blood test machines  made by other companies which take larger samples.  And that when they got a sample,  I don't know how they knew,  but when they got a sample from the FDA,  they wouldn't use their blood test machine,  but they used the third party.  So they were able to get certified,  the implication is, kind of by skating around  the regulations.  The real question is if the Edison works at all.  Also, by the way, in order to get these small samples  to work in a larger machine, they have to dilute them,  which produces not maybe the best results.  In fact, the whistleblowers who went  to the Wall Street Journal said things like,  we would test people with potassium levels,  they'd be dead if this was the actual potassium level.  It's fatal.

And the test results from the Stanford lab  versus Theranos were actually pretty different enough  that he was really concerned.  This is life and death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big issue here is that the narrative,  exactly as you're describing it,  is people wanted her to be the next Steve Jobs.  People wanted her to be the Zuckerberg  who dropped out of college.  And we all wanna see more female executives  and we wanna see more diversity in the industry.  And this is maybe what happens  when people wanna see that a little too much.  And the investors were not sophisticated  and nobody on the board has a medical degree  and nobody has vetted the technology.  And I overheard conversations about this  in the past couple of years.  It's been a drum beat for a while.  It's been a drum beat for a while.  It's been, like I said, a worst kept secret  in Silicon Valley that this could be,  holding could be a fraud  because from what I heard,  investors who wanted to invest in it  who were serious investors,  and she has no serious investors,  the blue chip investors were not allowed to do due diligence.  Now, what is due diligence?  Due diligence is when you go in  and you verify that what somebody is telling you  has happened.  I'm an angel investor.  Of the last 100 deals I did,  three of the deals I did did not pass due diligence.  In other words, there were things that were material  in angel investing that in my very cursory,  and we're talking about putting tens to hundreds  of thousands of dollars into a company,  did not cut the mustard with me and my team.  This is hundreds of millions of dollars.  It's a $400 million crater that's gonna happen  and people's lives are at risk.  If this turns out to be the level of fraud that it is,  it is a demented, deranged situation  because what person would play fast and loose  with people's health,  and a co-founder committed suicide,  and his spouse said that she says he,  that the suicide may have been related to this  not working, the technology.  Now, the spouse, and this happened like a year ago,  or I think the suicide,  the spouse owns the shares in the company.  So the way I look at game theory,  if the spouse has equity in the company  and she is willing to say in her husband's suicide  that this company could be a fraud,  she's going to kill her own equity in the company.  Well, worse than that,  because after- So that means  she must have a big moral burden.

She hired people to help her realize the vision.  This Ian Gibbons guy, he started to develop the technology.  It didn't pan out, and she couldn't admit it.  That's exactly what she wanted to do.

If this is true, and it turns out to be this way,  this is a deranged person,  or a person like Bernie Madoff who,  Bernie Madoff may have been a great money manager  for some number of years,  then he had a bad couple of years,  and he tried to cover it up, like Peter's saying,  and the lie grew and grew and grew.

If this, in the 90 plus percent chance  it turns out to be a fraud, which is what I would,  as a journalist who's covered for this space  for over 20 years, this feels 90% chance of fraud to me.  I'm just setting a line here.  I don't know, to be clear.  Don't sue me.  I'm setting a line.  And if it is this way, then in my experience,  this becomes a watershed moment for this moment in time,  for this investment cycle of every other company  needs to be investigated, there's going to be other ones.

It's like a standard C corporation for profit,  but you have to have a corporate mission,  and then you have to live up to that mission.  And who regulates that?  That's the question.  The government is now recognizing these  in about two dozen states right now,  and they're building the regulation around it.  And what it basically means is,  you set your corporate mission,  and then your board has to hold you to that mission.  So, Tom Schuess, or before that,  what was the ice cream company, Ben & Jerry's?  They could say, hey, or Paul Newman's,  which was a non-profit, but it was a for-profit.  They say, Paul Newman's is gonna give all its proceeds,  and our job is to be organic, or whatever,  and then the board holds you to your mission statement.  I like that.  I've invested in one company that's a B Corp.  It was one of the first B Corp's called Hand Up,  and I was the first investor in it.  And they're making software, a software platform  for homeless organizations to make,  essentially, Kickstarter profiles of homeless people  who can then put on what they're trying to  raise money for to get out of poverty.

Transcript:  Well, I think what we've seen in California  is there's much more attention being paid  to the issue of non-consensual pornography in isolation  and talking about all the different ways  in which one can attack that problem.  Why do people post pictures of other people  without their consent?  Why is there an entire niche industry of consumers  who are looking for revenge porn?  That's what they're searching for.

Transcript:  Thank you, Mike Elgin.  One more thing I'd like to add.  We have the T-shirt, the new Twit T-shirt.  I'm so excited.  This is the, I think, the most interesting.  And many agree now at the office,  the best looking T-shirt we've ever done.  A great design we got from 99 Designs.  Look at that.  Isn't that cool?  So here's the deal.  It's at T-Spring, T-E-E-Spring.com slash twit.  And as always with these, this is a limited time shirt.  So what we're gonna do is we will give you a chance  to buy it through November 10th.  After that, we will never make any more.  That makes it a little bit, I think, more special, right?  So the Twit Fall 2015 shirt is now available on T-Spring.  You've got 23 days to order.  We do have women's sizes, men's sizes.  Go to the website.  T-Spring, T-E-E-Spring.com slash twit  for the new Twit Fall 2015 T-shirt.  What do you think of that hoverboard?  Is that really, can you really,  does it really hover?  It's gonna be out on Wednesday.  Are these hoverboards the ones  that have the copper underneath it?  No, not the cyberboards.  This thing floats.  Yeah, but you've gotta have a big ductile strip underneath.

Yeah, so what I was told,  because we were gonna have one of these versions  at the lunch festival last year,  and we were gonna try to have Tony Hawk skate on it.  It wasn't, I don't think it was this one.  And they were like, we've never really built  a big base for it.  So you have to build some huge copper base,  and then it will hover.  And Tony Hawk really wanted to skate on it.  Yeah, I think it did hover.
