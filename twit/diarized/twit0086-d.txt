Transcript:  And D이ON JAGE2227N  Sugar knead in a weaknesses,  The  Sound of a  It's a rainy Friday afternoon and late at night.  Well, not that late, but but after work, we've got Patrick and Robert over at DLTV.  The lights are dim.  Everybody's gone home.  It's just the two of them.  John C. Dvorak never ventures out of his fortress overlooking the racetrack and beautiful  Albany, California.  And I'm just here looking at the rain, looking out the window.  You hear a car go by once in a while in the rain.  That's me.  Welcome to Twit.  Hello, guys.  It's kind of the old kind of the old school twit here with Patrick and Robert and John.  Yeah, we actually have some substance.  Finally got rid of all those.  You were wow.  We weren't here last week.  We and in replace.  We replaced the curmudgeon seat.  We have a special seat just for the curmudgeon with Adam Curry.  That was quite an experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got mixed reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, some people.  It's funny.  I don't.  I.  But I'm sure you do too.  Radar goes up when when when you get all of a sudden I'm getting all these letters, very  similar letters saying how great Adam was.  And Adam fans.  Yeah, it kind of it's my radar goes up like is this a campaign or is this spontaneous?  Doesn't feel spontaneous.  Anyway, I don't know if you know, he might have said something on the Daily Source code  saying, hey, tell them how much.  Yeah, I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't imagine Adam himself would be organizing such a campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that he would ever do anything like edit his Wikipedia article or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, I can I can see the editing the Wikipedia article doesn't really bother  me all that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See why anybody should care about that.  You should be out of your own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is an interesting story.  Then Microsoft is kind of in the doghouse right now.  It offered to pay an Australian blogger to change articles on Wikipedia.  I mean, at least they had the sense to know they couldn't change them themselves, but  they could change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it?  What are they thinking?  They could change it themselves during the OS two wars when OS two was battling against  Microsoft's windows.  They would have these munchkins as we like to call them scattered around pretending to  be this guy or that guy and whatever, you know, invading the forums and causing all  kinds of havoc.  I mean, they have the skill set to do this.  Why don't they just send somebody had, you know, the issue is will they be objective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's here's a quote from they won't be objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But who cares?  Wiki.  What is this objective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Objective.  Wikipedia cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wikipedia has an entry that I'm quoting Wikipedia has an entry to open XML has a lot of slanted  language and we'd like for them to make it more objective, but we feel it would be best  if a non Microsoft person with a source of any corrections.  Actually, I'm sorry.  This is coming from Microsoft to this blogger saying it's slanted.  Now we would like you to unsland it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a bit of irony to the story is that apparently was IBM or at least it's rumored  that's IBM that put the slanted language in because, you know, they're promoting Linux.  I don't know whether that's true or not, but it's you know, I have a lot of people that  come onto my Wikipedia entry and they put slanted language in, you know, and I have  to go in there and clean it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's supposedly, you know, it's there's no rules.  You know, it's not like there's but it's supposedly kind of not done to edit your own  biography.  I've done it too.  I've understood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to do it.  They get the dates wrong.  They get all kinds of information.  That's not that's bogus.  What are you supposed to do?  Wait until somebody who happens to be a mind reader, a psychic that happens to know this  and that these crazy details about your life that happen to be up there and inaccurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think anybody argues that you could, you know, somebody put in my article that  I'd written an article for Hustler.  So I changed that.  Nobody's arguing that.  It's more when you go in there and you see and you kind of slant things or you talk about  great.  Or you take out negative stuff, which is apparently native stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of the negative stuff is questionable.  Now, if you want to take a look at I mentioned this, by the way, on Cranky Geeks, and I'll  mention it again.  If you want to see a site that's obviously done by minions and probably the guy himself,  go to the gnome Chomsky entry in Wikipedia and take a look at it and tell me this is  not one giant advertisement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it's funny.  I mean, that gnome would do would do that or his minions would do that.  It's kind of ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is it accurate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, it's like, is this a flaw with Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  Well, you obviously must be some flaw because they, you know, form this new thing, right?  But let me just say before we go on about the is it accurate or not?  Yeah, I don't see any evidence that it's not accurate.  But it's like me, for example, if I took every column I've written at least fourth over  4000 easy and listed each one of them and when they ran and where they were running,  which is what the gnome Chomsky thing is, right?  Every one of them says, well, it's accurate.  Yeah, it's accurate.  But who needs it?  I mean, who wants to see?  Well, you know, it's ridiculous.  Let me put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody has gone.  There's an article on on Wikipedia that has everybody who's ever appeared on Twitter.  I didn't I didn't do it.  Obviously, I don't have time for that.  Everybody's ever been on Twitter.  And that's an article on Wikipedia.  There's an article.  I mean, there's all kinds of stuff like that.  I mean, I love Wikipedia.  I have to say what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the spin off citizen nominative, whatever that all about Jimmy Wales thing.  Yeah.  The guy who started one of the guys trying to get Jimmy on the show on one of the shows,  actually, he's decided that to take the advice of some people like myself included, although  I'm semi serious about it and then creating another Wikipedia, a Wikipedia clone that  is moderated just to to a greater extreme.  So you don't get these kind of I don't think that's what that's Jimmy doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, there's the other guy.  Let me look it up.  I have it on the blog.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Already forgotten.  No, it is.  It's it's kind of a more moderated Wikipedia, I guess.  An expert, an expert Wikipedia.  Yeah, it's called.  I use Wikipedia all the time, though.  I have to say, I mean, I don't use it.  It's great for things like you look up an actor's name or TV show.  I mean, it's it's one.  What do you use it for, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Technical information sometimes.  Yes.  For me, it is.  Backside deal with sometimes the best resources for having all that data in one place is right  there.  And it's also usually the most updated, frequently updated source I use.  I mean, I always confirm what I read there.  But generally speaking, it's just it works out for me really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's the what's the story?  It's it's it's it's it's saying or Larry Sanger, who's who forked is a fork, you know,  common thing that happens in open source anything.  And it's called Citizendium, which is a horrible name.  Terrible.  I mean, which I think is going to kill it if they don't change that name.  Maybe they read one too many Dan Gilmore books, but whatever the case is, it's you can go to  Citizendium dot org and or even in Wikipedia, they actually have a citation for this thing.  And it's a pilot.  It just began in November as a pilot product and it has expert editors and expert authors.  And, you know, it's essentially creating an open source version of the real Encyclopedia Britannica  where you don't have the public and these secret experts, but you have like, you know, official  experts.  And I don't know.  I've I've actually bought into the wiki idea to a point.  I don't know if this is going to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, what's great about the net, though, is it doesn't matter.  Go ahead and do it.  There's it's not like there's a lack of room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I mean, you just do it, you know, do whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if it if it sticks, it sticks.  And if not, it just goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know he's willing to bail if it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give it a shot.  I think I like the idea.  But again, I find Wikipedia in most cases plenty accurate and very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I find it weird, though, that you're not supposed to edit your well, it's just like the consensus that you don't edit your own.  Yeah, it's John's point, though, makes complete sense to me.  It's like, look, I've I see misinformation on there and I want to change it.  Maybe it's something written about me, but who else will do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I can see Microsoft approaching that blogger because the person is considered an expert in the field or happens to do something that  there happens to represent a few point that that Microsoft agrees with.  But it's you know, you think of Microsoft wanted to modify, wanted to modify, you know, Wikipedia.  Certainly they have enough intelligence and talent and money to just, you know, secretly pay someone to modify things for them.  I mean, there's entire marketing companies that are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  Patrick, just assign somebody.  I'm sorry, just assign somebody.  That's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I mean, if you have to go outside,  maybe they want to use that site, you know, it's just it's so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems so simple, you know, because the whole eyes will look at it to where if there's any kind of ambiguous information or where are the references for this information,  it will get picked apart in that reference by the community itself that looks at that content.  I don't see a huge danger of, you know, self editing, but there's no danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I guarantee that every major corporation that has a large Wikipedia entry has somebody assigned to dog that entry and to make changes as necessary  when bad, false or erroneous or even slanderous information shows up from some disgruntled employee.  You'd be foolish not to, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's interesting.  I mean, I'm looking through the rules.  I don't see any explicit rule saying you can't edit your own page.  It just seems to be that's a cultural rule.  I've asked Jimmy about that and he said, yeah, that's that's kind of accepted norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think the biggest thing about the whole Adam Curry incident was that he was there.  They were sort of in this argument over who invented podcasting or who had the first.  Yeah, he was taking care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway, I thought Adam was a great guest.  He had a lot of great value to it.  It was funny. And you know, I just agree on a couple of things.  Well, and one of the best parts of the show were the places where you and he really went back and forth.  And I thought that was really valuable.  A lot of people thought it was great. Excellent.  And then there are people who hate me.  You know, Jason Calacanis is on another tweet on Twil this week in law this week.  And boy, you just say the name Jason Calacanis and every the people come out of the woodwork.  I will not listen to a show with Jason Calacanis.  They don't even give him a chance. They don't even listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what you know, that's yeah, it's pretty weird.  I mean, I actually have that element that's always out there like people do that with you.  Yeah. Yeah. But they don't do it to the extreme that they do these.  I mean, at least once they hear me a few times and they realize that I'm not like just a Mac basher or a Microsoft shill,  which I get accused of when that's about as far from the truth as you can get.  You know, they kind of backed off and they actually don't see too many negative comments.  Maybe I'll encourage that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say that might be a bad sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think most people just, you know, they, you know, they appreciate the fact that I'm just have a different perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the deal with AACS?  The the official AACS body now admits that AACS, well, they say it hasn't been broken.  They say it's kind of a fine line, a fine distinction.  Compromised.  They say the keys are getting out now.  But for whatever reason, you're seeing HD DVD and I think soon Blu-ray movies in full quality on BitTorrent now.  On BitTorrent's trackers.  Are you seeing Blu-ray too, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all out there now.  So both of them cracked.  The encryption has not been broken. It's solid.  It's simply that they found the weakest link and that happened to be the player software currently available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it's always the link in this kind of thing, because in order to play back any protected content, the player has to have the key.  True.  So the key is in there. It's, you know, the way they found it, it's actually kind of cool.  They take a memory dump of the, they know what a key is supposed to look like.  They take a memory dump of the machine as it's playing back the protected content and they scan through it until they find the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Well, actually you can do it, you know, let's do it side by side comparison by taking two memory dumps of two different games.  Perfect. There would be another way of doing it.  Yeah.  That's a really easy way to see some differentiation.  But, you know, the funny thing is there was another story that ran, which is kind of like this one, which is the fact there was a study done, and I'm not, the Solutions Research Group or whatever this is, that claims now that, and I find this to be bull.  I just do not believe it.  That there's this huge number of Americans just in general that are downloading copyrighted movies.  I haven't even downloaded a copyrighted movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they say it's not that they're dishonest. They're cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they're doing it.  I don't think they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they are.  Okay, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are a lot of people downloading movies.  Oh, come on, a few guys are doing a lot of it and then nobody else is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who on this panel has downloaded, I'll be the first, I've downloaded movies on the internet.  I'm not talking about myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care at all to read you download a movie.  You're not a typical, none of you guys are typical users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, are college students typical users at this point, John?  Would a college user be considered a typical user of the internet?  They know how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if they don't, are college students?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so some college kids are downloading these movies.  Some, there's a lot of colleges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So let's say there's only what, maybe 20 million people using Torrents, downloading illegal material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think that this is exaggerated.  I'm not saying that college kids aren't doing it because they are.  They can afford the time they got the connection, they put it on overnight,  even though a lot of colleges block this sort of thing, which makes it impossible.  But I just don't think, they make it sound like the average Joe who just picked up a computer at Best Buy a few weeks ago is downloading movies.  It's not that mysterious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I agree with you, the vast majority of people aren't.  And I think the studies like this are maybe more aimed at trying to drum up more support for anti-piracy stuff than they are really true studies.  But I think a lot of people do it, more than the movie industry would like.  So what do you think?  You think this is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More than the movie industry would like.  The two people doing it is more than they'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  You search any Torrent site, it's pretty easy to find that content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pirates, Pirate Bay, by the way, is not going to buy Sealand.  They've raised $20,000.  But the guy who owns Sealand, the old coot who owns this gunnery platform out in the sea is not responding to their email anymore.  I don't know, he might have fallen off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy could be out there dead for all they know.  He might have fallen off.  It's like, when's the last time anyone has seen this coot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fell off.  So anyway, they've decided now they're going to buy an island.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the thing you talked about in Cryptonomicon.  The problem when you were on an island is whether or not somebody will cut the communications of that island if you piss them off bad enough.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Move it into a space-based platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long before the MPAA has an army?  It's a little navy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may not, but they have already.  I think satellite links will work.  And also, I think there's ways of getting around...  You can't cut a satellite link.  That's true.  I think they'd be better off selling passports, personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Chinese just shot a satellite out of the sky.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That was two weeks ago.  They had their first successful test of a satellite-destroying missile.  Oh, it wasn't anybody's. They were just testing it.  No, no, they were blowing up one of their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They shot one of their own.  They had an old dog up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had to shoot it out.  Take it down.  You know, if you talk to people in the satellite business, if anybody wants to know this, most of these satellites have got enough fuel.  They have to be re-positioned constantly.  So they're loaded with fuel, and they get to move them here and there to back it up.  And then, for example, if you have satellite TV, like either Dish Network or the other one, the satellite once in a while...  Especially... What's the other one? I'm sorry.  Direct TV.  Yeah, Direct TV.  I had that for a while. And the satellites would always be moving out of position.  It would take them a few weeks before they move them back.  You could tell by the deterioration of the signal.  How interesting.  Anyway, so they move it back and forth.  And then when they get near the end of their life cycle, which is really only a limited number of years, they leave just enough fuel in them to blast them into space so they don't come down.  So once they get to the... They're losing... Their fuel is depleted.  They have just enough to launch it into deep space, and that's the end of them.  We, actually the US government and the Chinese apparently now had to do this.  Apparently somebody screws up and they leave the thing up there and it's got no... It's either never had fuel to begin with or it's just one of these things orbiting or whatever.  They don't really want it to come down for whatever reason.  Yeah, but if you shoot it, what happens?  It comes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blow it up.  Then it comes down in lots of little pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but those pieces all blow up.  They burn up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the concern we had was that all of those little pieces, it's like a shotgun effect.  And suddenly you have where there was one solid object, bigger object, now there's five, six, seven hundred little objects all flying around at 17,000 miles an hour.  That would be bad if you have a satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, whatever the case is, they...  Space is big though.  They claim it wasn't... They weren't designed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want to know if one of those satellites is going to start the international space war, the inter-universal space war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interplanetary, that would guess be the one, the space war.  You've been reading too much science fiction, Patrick.  Yeah, you say that now, but when that big ship goes...  I'm ready.  Where is that wormhole? I need a wormhole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, jumping back to HDVD Blu-ray stuff real quick, I just don't see that even those files being posted online, the file sizes are so big.  Yeah, they're not losing money.  If you wanted to burn that to pieces...  Well, they're losing money. They're losing money every time they build a player.  Right.  It's impractical on all fronts to deal with that kind of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anybody tried the new Netflix watch movies instead of renting them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had several viewers reporting to us on DLTV on their experiences with the Netflix streaming system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a Netflix subscriber, but they're rolling it out slowly through June and they haven't rolled it out to me yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty much what everybody said is it's very similar to the existing online movie streaming systems.  Netflix apparently spent $40 million developing this one to behave almost like every other one.  It's real early so far.  We had one fellow that was kind enough to write up a few hundred words and basically said,  it looks really good.  Some things stream in like 30 seconds, others take like 20 minutes, which sounds a lot like all of the other existing systems out there.  The way they charge, I think, is the biggest difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if 90% of that $40 million went toward content licensing or something,  because I don't picture any back end you're setting up costing that much,  unless you set aside some money for the streaming fees and the bandwidth fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not downloadable. You have to be online to watch it. There's no caching.  It sounds like a loser.  You can switch around. You get an hour for every buck you pay in subscriptions, an hour a month for every buck you pay in subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what gives them a chance, John, is that they're starting with a user base of what, six million people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's significant in the sense that Netflix needs a second act, don't they?  DVDs aren't going to be here forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to be disappearing anytime soon.  What was this thing that the Skype guys are doing, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Juiced is another way to do this. It's hard to get a juiced token.  I'm lucky enough one of our listeners sent me one.  If I had more invites, I would send them out, but I don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, if anybody has a juiced token, can you send it to dl.tv at zifdavis.com, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After you send one to john at dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. Well, thank you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amber covered it on her TV show in Toronto, and they sent her like 40 tokens. I was stunned.  Amber's famous.  Oh, yeah. We're just some schmucks.  Hey, I just want to tell you I'm one of the 25 top web something or others.  Influencers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're reading marketing computers again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute. It's on Forbes.com. Wait a minute. I'll tell you what I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am a web celeb. I'm one of the 25 web celebs.  Who's that? What was this?  Forbes.com. You've heard of them?  No, those guys.  Oh, you know, this is just another one of those lists. I know, and it's really stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, can we go back to how these lists are done again?  I know, I know.  You have a meeting, you sit around, eat usually over lunch,  and you start dreaming up what this list should be, what it should be,  because it's all vested interests, and then you start jockeying for positions.  I think he should be number one. No, no, no, he was number one last year.  We can't do number one the same guy twice. Let's do, let's make him number three.  That'll shake things up.  And then you make a phony baloney list, and you publish it, and everyone pants over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I'm reading this list, and they're not doing that bad.  Alright, thank you very much. Matt Drudge, Seth Godin, Amanda Cogden, Robert Scoble, Mike Arrington.  Yeah, but Leo, you skipped Jessica Lee Rose, Pérez Hilton, and Marcos Zuniga.  Jessica Lee Rose is Lonely Girl 15. Pérez Hilton is a blogger, right?  She's number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, is it in order?  Well, I don't know.  I guess it says rank two, so you're right, Pérez Hilton.  So I don't like the order here. Marcos Molitsa Zuniga is a political blogger.  He's Daily Co's, which actually is a great site.  Matt Drudge, I thought he was like Web 1.0. Drudge Report.  This isn't Web 2.0, this is Web.  Is Drudge Report still significant?  I think so.  Is this based on traffic numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's just whatever, you know.  No, it's based, hello, it's based on traffic numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Drudge Report.com, how many Web's left in those they helped impeach a president?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who is Hinderaker? I've never heard of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, well, hey, I just was glad to get on a list, any list, believe me.  Who's Violet Blue? I don't know who these people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's a porn person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I've read, I've actually, yeah, I've read it.  Amanda Cognon, she was the rocket bloom.  Robert Scoble, we know he's been on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, you know, it's interesting.  Cory Doctorow, Zini Jardim.  Yeah, at least four of these people have been on Twitter.  Jimmy Wales has been on a Twitter show.  Well, how come they only put two of the boing boing people on there instead of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They left Fraunhalferlager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fraunhalber.  Zini Jardim.  I just like to sing her name.  Zini Jardim.  Merlin Mann, our good friend, another, another Twitter.  So we actually are well represented in here.  Obviously, whoever made this list is a Twitter listener.  So thank you.  Thank you very much to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, how do you get that, Leo?  You're the only one listed that's a real true Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true, but all of these people have been on Twitter.  All right, why isn't Dvorak on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't really want to be on there.  Yeah, yeah, you say that.  But I think, you know, well, anyway, there's, I bet you we could put a better list together.  We should.  How does Jessica Lee Rose become number one?  She shouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Lonely Girl 15, I don't get why she would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was a gimmick.  It was like a short-term phenomenon, which she's doing now.  Well, she's an actress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, she didn't do it.  Right.  Ouch.  Well, she's 19.  Probably she knows how to download.  Is she cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, she's pretty cute.  Well, you know, it's an interesting thought.  How many people, you know, how many bazillions of people have watched the YouTube videos she was in total?  Hey, what's this video?  You know, I have to say.  It's not that good.  Oh, get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a girl who can get a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, don't get excited about it.  Talking.  Oh.  You know, how many people find this upsetting about dating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, where's Michelle Malkin on this thing?  She gets bigger numbers than anybody in the top 10 of this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's Michelle Malkin?  Oh, brother.  I'm sorry, I'm out of it.  She's one of the top right-wing bloggers out there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, you know, there's a little controversy going on.  She has huge numbers.  Well, where's Ariana Huffington?  I mean, there's a lot of people.  Oh, Huffington, there's another one.  She's got huge numbers.  Jarvis is good, yeah.  He's the only person older than me on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's go, let's ask the real big question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's Kevin Rose?  He's not on this list, and that's why I look at it.  He's on every other tag nabbit list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beside the point, whether you like Kevin to be on every list or not, he should be on this list.  He should be on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why he's not.  I'll tell you why he's not.  They said, oh, he was on the cover of Businessweek.  We can't use him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly why, when they had the meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said, nah, I can't do it.  He's on, you know, he's already been done.  He's been done.  We need new people.  So this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my last chance.  They chose TechCrunch instead of Dick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's manufacture some news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So getting back to Juice.  So the neat thing about Juice is full screen streaming.  But what I really like is the interface.  They have these kind of transparent widgets on top of it that allow you to, it's actually very modern because they allow you to chat while you're watching the TV.  You know, you can, I mean, it's very interesting.  I think it's quite good.  It sounds cool.  Yeah.  Now, right now, they don't have much content.  There's like World Poker Tour and Much Music, the Canadian MTV.  But their point of this is not pirated video.  Unlike, you know, as you might expect, because these are the guys who did Kazaa.  The point of it is to get deals with real content creators to get up on there.  I'd love to put Call for Help on there.  But the problem is you can't because cable companies would then say, well, yeah, but you're undermining our business, right?  So that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the business model's got to change, doesn't it?  I mean, if it's an advertising-based business model, it shouldn't matter who watches it or where or how, as long as the advertisements are still in there, right?  That's how, that strikes me as so.  Yeah.  But it's not true if you are a cable channel, as Patrick well knows.  That was always an issue for us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So talking about, yeah, you actually, you get better numbers on the net than you do on those cable channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I get better numbers on the net than in most mainstream media.  That's the dirty little secret of the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you don't get to the 10 million.  No, you don't get Seinfeld numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  You get CNN numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  CNN numbers are easy to get to.  Well, yeah, exactly.  That's my point.  Now, talking about that, you talk about numbers.  This story kind of jumped up at me.  Vint Cerf saying that one quarter of all computers are now part of a botnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Can you believe that?  When he says one quarter, he's saying there are 600 million computers out there.  He guesses his guesstimate is 150 million co-opted computers sending spam or attacking other computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does anyone but me think that actually may be a low estimate?  Yeah, I do.  Really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably half.  Half?  Yes.  From all computers.  I'd say half of all personal computers in people's homes contain some kind of malware, definitely.  Holy cow.  It's just too easy nowadays.  People aren't as critical about what they click on anymore, or if they ever were to begin with.  But it's with the way social engineering works nowadays and how easy it is to craft a site that looks like one thing and does another,  or a poorly worded dialogue box, or a well worded dialogue box, just to get you to click yes and suddenly boom.  And it's not about destroying information anymore.  It's about taking a system over and doing it in a way that maybe you won't even notice it.  And it becomes then a profit-making machine for a third party.  Well, there's a very good example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just happened in Norway.  Did you see this?  A bank admitted that it's lost millions and millions of dollars to a Trojan horse that was created by a well-known hacker from Russia.  His name is The Corpse.  I am The Corpse.  How does he launder the money that he steals from the bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't actually do it.  He writes the Trojan.  In fact, he'll customize the Trojan, if you should ask.  And then what happens is it's his keylogger.  So somebody goes to him and buys it.  He has a website.  I'm not going to give you the address, but you can go online, buy these Trojans, get them customized should you choose.  In this case, it was customized to attack that particular bank.  They collected a lot of passwords.  Now, here's the problem is you do have to kind of go in and get the money at some point, whether it's at an ATM or in the bank itself.  So they always an issue.  They have been a raise arresting some people.  But so the corpse makes his money selling the tools to bad guys who use the tools.  And I think it was 15.  It was a huge number of huge amount of money.  There's 15 million dollars, something like that.  And very reporting it is one million, one million.  What's telling is that the bank's admitting it because you know this happens all the time.  Banks don't admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  You know, I was thinking I was at CES.  What a unique idea this is.  Of course, not that unique.  Now that I mentioned it.  But so you go into the press room and there's all these computers that are wide open and they're letting people log on.  And you know, they're all, you know, if you just put key loggers on all those machines, you'd have passwords up the wazoo for these different guys who are logging into the New York Times and everything else.  Doesn't it seem to think that this is like a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of them will avoid.  Well, will they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How smart are these so-called journalists?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the caddy edition.  Angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think that most tech journalists are, you know, they're very casual about this stuff.  They don't, you know, go through a bunch of stuff.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's, I mean, how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For every Steve Gibson, there's 10,000 people to randomly click keys on keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'll tell you, I know, because we do the Security Now podcast.  Most people think Steve is kind of crazy paranoid.  I don't think I don't think you're paranoid.  Doesn't mean that there are people trying to get after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, I don't.  I don't put any.  I don't use any.  You know, I mean, it's interesting.  I'll use, you know, my Google stuff on a secure connection.  And if I can see if I can see the keyboard on if I'm using the public machine, I usually see where it's connected into the back of the machine.  But yeah, I mean, I guess I figure who's going to want to read my email.  But then they have your email login forever because how often do you change your email login?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, weekly.  You do?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure Steve Gibson does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we have that sweet random password generator, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does.  It's hard because you're remembering QX7 pound four three spiral spiral tilde.  You'll remember it.  The problem is you won't next week when you change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what's bad for me is the darn biometric thing on my IBM ThinkPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've gotten so used now to swiping my finger that I'll forget what the password was that I originally set it up as.  So it's like I'm now being encouraged to change my domain password for here at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you know what I use that I love and I will recommend this is from Zerati Labs.  It is a password, a JavaScript password generator that's fantastic.  Chris Zerati does it.  If you go to labs.zerati.org, what it does is you give it a master password and then it generates a unique password for every page you visit.  You don't have to remember it because you remember your master password, but you're not giving it to anybody.  You're just using it to generate a unique password every time you go.  Does that make sense?  It's a very handy tool.  I actually use it all the time.  That sounds good.  It's a good way to do this with stuff.  But yeah, you're right.  I mean, you know, now you can get into Canada if you let them scan your eyeball.  I watched somebody do it when I was going up to Canada last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's arguably my favorite biometric device I've ever used personally.  It's just I've had a machine scan my eye from probably 10 feet away and I didn't even know it was happening.  And it was tied into an ATM machine.  Are they accurate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can they be hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, they're the most accurate way to go.  I mean, it's far more secure than using a fingerprint in terms of hackability.  It'd be a lot harder to create an iris and get it to scan that way, as far as I know at least,  compared to say every other week you're hearing about somebody else creating a fake finger  or lifting a latent fingerprint off of a glass and recreating that a gel mold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're seeing those in movies because you keep watching them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, but they're high-def movies and they look good on a big screen.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know what's interesting about this, that bank story to go back to the security aspect?  According to the New York Times, Nordia Bank is saying that only computers whose customers were not protected  by antivirus programs have become victims and that the virus was distributed with spam e-bail,  a program to infiltrate home computers of customers at several European and American banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a line in there where one of the bank officials basically says,  our customers are stupid and that's why this is happening.  What is the responsibility? That's a very good question, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to the article, the bank has compensated all of its clients.  Steve's using the program in Sweden to fraud 250 customers of Nordia's online banking service  over a period of 15 months, says the New York Times.  And they only got a million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This notion that the customers are stupid is really kind of reprehensible.  The fact of the matter is, why is the public supposed to be able to...  Are they all supposed to be IT experts?  I mean, people buy these machines thinking that they're just a functional thing that does what it appears to do.  They don't expect that they have to become like, you know, listen to security now all the time  and become analysts and do whatever they have to do.  It's just, I think it's crazy to call them stupid.  They're ignorant, maybe, but only because these machines are kind of crummy.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the good news is, Tuesday, VISTA comes out. We don't have to worry about this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which brings us to the more interesting story.  Which is?  Bill Gates appearing on The Daily Show.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can't wait for this. That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, which would be better, for him to be on The Daily Show or Colbert?  I mean, who's going to be tougher on Bill Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, Colbert's stuff's always political.  So, you know, I think Colbert, now that you mention it, might be a more funnier interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He'd be willing to dance around him and make Bill look silly.  I have to say, I don't think John Stewart's going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's going to play it straight.  And I think it's going to be interesting to see how it works.  Because I think we should come up with a drinking game before it happens.  Because we've got to see how many times Bill says, really, really, with the two realies together.  He says that all the time.  So that's a drink if he says, really, really.  And then another one is where he'll say, innovation.  Oh, yeah.  And he'll have a bunch.  And there's about five buzzwords that he uses over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If he says Zune, you have to stop drinking for the rest of the show.  He's not going to say Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think Zune is the most sobering word in Bill's book, Fabular.  I think Windows, home, Windows personal server, or is it Windows home server?  The cheap version?  They announced it.  Yeah, the home version.  Oh, the home server's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that. Do you like that home server? I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never used it.  The problem with this interview, by the way, is that John Stewart is not a computer geek.  I mean, he serves the net, and that's about it from what I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that should be enough to, you know, that in a room full of talented warriors should be enough to give John Stewart enough.  How many people do you know haven't had a problem with a computer that they wouldn't want to blame on them?  I think he's more of a geek than you might give him credit for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet he has some good questions.  I bet he does.  Let's talk about this Windows home server.  Do you not like that, Patrick? I thought that looked like a pretty cool product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the idea is there.  I just think it's funny that I just, you know, having recently been through some Windows servers that got savaged issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea is it's network attached storage that is smart, right?  You just plug it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, like any of a number of, you know, I mean, I'm sitting here thinking like, you know, there's got to be a, like, yeah, it's the future, right?  Everybody's getting networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, nobody wants to configure a NAS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should have backups in place.  You know, people want to stream media.  And this is certainly something that, you know, all our nerdily friends have been doing forever.  But it just, I just keep thinking, you know, it's just one more Windows box to get rooted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a cool thing that it does.  It also monitors the health of your computers on the network.  So it actually you get this dashboard.  You could see how all the computers are doing, whether the antivirus is working and so forth and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, antivirus working is not necessarily a health.  It doesn't mean much, does it?  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It always goes back to the end user.  I mean, if they click on the file, there's nothing you can do to stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what the bank was saying is that, you know, if they're going to fall for phishing scams.  I have to say, though, every bank now is using this stupid almost use an expletive site key.  Are you have you been plagued by the site key?  You know what that is?  When you go to your bank, Bank of America does it.  I've seen another one of my Wells Fargo doesn't as far as I know.  You go there and they show you a picture that's a unique picture, you know, a donut or a ski boot.  And they say, remember this picture.  If you don't see this picture, you're not on your banking site.  So that way, if you go to phishing scam and I go to Bank of America and I don't see the donut.  And then there's and then there's a phrase that goes with the donut that you're supposed to say, you know, something like, oh, this is my donut so that you'll see the donut and you'll see the phrase and say, oh, yeah, OK, this is my bank.  So I, you know, I inevitably write stupid effing site key image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you know, the thing is, is that this is like treating people like it's like gardeners.  No, no, it's like, which is it going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it going to be easy to use with with things that people who study how people remember things and put together at the request of the deep pockets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, you're missing the point about these kinds of things.  This is like the the the little holograms they put on credit cards for a while.  If you went into any place, say you had a credit card number and a credit card machine that could crank out, you know, just punch the numbers on the card and put, you know, bank of whatever.  It doesn't make any difference with or without the hologram.  The thing still goes through the system the same way.  You know, the hologram doesn't have anything.  It doesn't have any code on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a it's a bad.  You're you're it's a bad or whatever they use.  Example thing.  This is this. This is to that.  What's that?  That's not an analogy.  Thank you.  It's a bad analogy because in this case, the hologram is being, you know, basically what would happen is, is, is you would have to come to the hologram is being hosted by the bank.  And you only get a chance to approve the hologram, you know, when you log into the bank.  You know what I mean?  This is it's it's you're not relying on somebody.  You're talking about the psyche.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what I mean, that's the hologram is like the CSC.  Now you everybody asks you for that three digit number on the back of your card.  Like that's somehow magical and no one could get that number.  I don't understand these.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's important about?  Well, yeah.  What the thing that's magic about that number is that number doesn't show up right when somebody's doing a credit card flimsy.  Right. Right.  So they can't like, you know, write down all the credit card numbers.  So they just have to make sure they randomly call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. They just have to flip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just have to make sure they look at them in the restaurant when they take your credit card to the back and write it down.  That's along with your your accurate home phone number, your address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you the kind of person when you leave your your car with the valet only gives them the car key or do you give them the whole key ring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can I give them the I've got a pickup truck.  I've had anything with a lockable truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the reason the reason you're not supposed to give them the whole key ring is because then they get your registration out of the car.  They get your home address.  They make copies of your keys to your house.  And then later they rob you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that Miami Vice episode too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My car key is the only key on that key ring.  See, you see, you see, you're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good.  I keep that totally separate from it.  But totally separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you didn't know anybody at Yale that was doing this kind of stuff with their gig parking cars at the restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Of course.  So a teacher is in trouble for being dumb.  In fact, actually, this is a pretty serious story.  Teachers are horrendous.  Horrible story.  Teachers facing 40 years in prison because she had pop ups on her computer, showed pornographic images.  It was a porn storm, old fashioned and old school.  She was convicted by a jury of four counts of risk of injury to a minor.  She'll be sentenced March 2nd because she let the filtering system lapse.  Somehow she's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it's even worse than that.  She went to tell, I guess, the administrators at the school that the filters weren't working.  And it's just, it's, it's, it's wrong.  She's a substitute teacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's spyware.  It wasn't that she went to a porn site.  This jury clearly doesn't know the distinction.  This woman could go to jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, her attorney was obviously incompetent.  Seriously.  Yeah.  But it didn't help.  What is the DA thinking?  I mean, the state attorney that apparently or the state prosecutor that covered this made the comment publicly, which we have, you can read this on the blog, by the way, of a pretty good analysis.  But it was like she, the guy says, well, she could have unplugged the computer.  You know, most people don't, you know, it's not, it's not that you, if you're a substitute teacher, you don't think about unplugging the computer.  If you don't know anything about computers, because most people think, well, maybe I'll ruin it.  Well, you don't know what's going on anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many, how many of you have, we've all had a porn storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I think they're pretty rare now.  I haven't seen one for a long time, but they can happen.  This also, I mean, this happened in 2004, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's when the porn storm started to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, the prosecution says she actively visited these sites.  Oh, bull.  Even if she did, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what?  How is this a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't visit porn sites while the kids are watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not sitting in a school as a substitute teacher visiting porn sites.  I don't, it makes no logical sense.  It's bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if it were all true, if that's the worst thing that ever happens to these kids, please.  I mean, it's just, the punishment does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you shouldn't even make the assumption that if it was, it's not true.  This is obviously, this woman has been railroaded and we shouldn't put up with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A computer consultant who was an expert witness but not allowed to fully testify says,  if there's an appeal and the defense is allowed to show the entire results of my forensic exam  in front of experienced computer people, including a computer literate judge and prosecutor,  she'll walk out of the courtroom as a free person.  That's the problem.  These people are completely illiterate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like this substitute teacher is not that bright either for whoever this legal representation is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the point, but why should she go to jail for 40 years because she's not too bright?  Well, even her choice of legal representation.  What is that a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like a simple open and shut case for any decent attorney to get you out of, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, as somebody who comes from a family of teachers, substitute teachers make jacks,  so she probably can't afford a decent attorney.  I'm sure it's a fair amount of years in there.  Second of all, the IT director, you're reading articles about this,  and the IT director is telling the school board that the software hadn't been updated  because Symantec hadn't sent the updated license for the software,  which for me it says that the school's not using the filtering software that should be running  or it's not maintaining the filtering software that should be running.  It's just a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The expert said that the evidence was she went to Crayola.com,  and then after that somebody went to a site about hairstyles,  which loaded a JavaScript that spawned the pop-ups.  So she didn't go to a porn site. This is ridiculous.  And the fact that that testimony wasn't allowed, I mean, a miscarriage justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This case is going to get thrown out. This is just beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but has it already wrecked this woman's career?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, she was convicted. I mean, she's been convicted of this.  That's appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sad is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, politicians and judges apparently aren't keeping up with technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, welcome. That's been pretty obvious for a while.  So how many of you, VISTA comes out Tuesday, how many of you are going to rush out and buy a VISTA computer?  Buy?  Okay, I know you don't buy them.  I've got VISTA installed on a couple of machines.  I do want to copy DOS, though.  How many of you want VISTA? Maybe I should ask that.  I'm going to wait.  Patrick, you already have them, sure, on most of your machines, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not really qualified to answer this question.  You've been VISTA-fied.  I have to run VISTA so I can answer all the questions about VISTA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think about it so far? What do you think? What do you guys think about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like XP only. It's shiny.  Watch DLTV on Tuesday, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it, too. I think there's a lot of good stuff.  I mean, just the fact that you could search the Start menu for one thing.  But you know what, really, and I wish this were being covered more, I think the bigger upgrade, the more important upgrade, and frankly the more impressive upgrade, is Office.  Yeah.  I think the new Office UI is...  Magnificent.  It's gutsy as hell.  I've looked at it two or three times over the last year and I haven't...  Use it for a while. It's brilliant and you know what, it's gutsy because you're taking a well-known user interface.  I mean, I was shocked. And you're throwing it out. But it's a much improved user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can still get to what is effectively the old interface, a shinier version, but the ribbon and what they've done, they spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to make the functionality more accessible, easier to judge, easier to basically preview things without having to destroy your document in the process.  It's a pretty amazing job. I mean, I wouldn't think Microsoft could pull that kind of an interface job.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm blown away. And I think in many ways it deserves more attention, frankly. I mean, it's important.  But I think that... And by the way, the guy I'd like to get on the show at some point to talk about this is Jensen Harris. He's kind of been responsible for this UI and I think deserves a lot of credit.  He really knows what he's doing.  He's a blogger. If you... You can read his Microsoft blog.  Speaking of Microsoft blogs, Microsoft finally responded to the Peter Gutman Vista content protection article.  And they've corrected a few things, but mostly they just said, well, that's just the way it is.  Their attitude is, well, you know, you just, you kind of have to put up with it if you want to watch high quality content.  Anyway, Jensen Harris's blog is JensenH, blogs.msdn.com slash JensenH.  And he talks about some of the new features in 2007 that it's worth taking a look at just to kind of see what can be done with it. It's pretty impressive.  Any other stories anybody wants to talk about? Anything in the blog, John, that caught your eye?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's something that came up just recently that was kind of interesting. Oh, yeah, there's this. Yeah, this is good. Hold on.  Juicy. Is it juicy?  Well, it's this story that, you know, that Dianne Feinstein is now pushing.  In fact, there's a bunch of people pushing a new bill S-256 to write, to make the Internet radio ruin it basically.  And this other story that we ran is don't help grandma write her will or you might be sued for practicing law without a license.  This is going to be very interesting because the apparently somebody using, you know, quicken will maker or something from Nolo Press, you know, they ended up getting their in a ringer for practicing law without a license, which makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. Why didn't Intuit get in trouble? Why did the guy get in trouble?  God, you got to use the Intuit software. It's a good point.  I mean, that that was the ones who were impersonating impersonating the lawyer, not the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the other story that came up last night I noticed was the Sony denying that this that, you know, there's a bunch of rumors or gossip or allegations that Sony wasn't going to let, you know, Blu-ray run porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they said good news.  Vivid has now introduced the first Blu-ray porn title.  What's the name of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, but I'll look at some really weird names.  Yeah, I got what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's it.  That's kind of scares me that you know that much about it already.  Now, you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know because somebody sent me an email saying you, you know, I get so much email saying I'm a fanboy on one camp or another.  You HD DVD fanboy.  You said that porn wouldn't be on Blu-ray.  Well, I defy you to correct yourself.  Sony originally said they weren't going to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, that's getting close to the comic book guy's voice.  I want you to work on that a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I defy you to correct yourself.  So I'm looking for the name so I can so we can correct.  Vivid is I know it's Vivid.  That's all I know.  I don't know what the name is.  Yeah, they have the hottest chicks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been wicked.  They do?  I really don't want to have this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's Debbie Does Dallas Again is the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that was the huge poster right across from us.  We were shooting DLTV in Vegas for six long days.  It was a 40 foot by 20 foot poster of that DVD and right at the bottom or that movie and right at the bottom.  It showed both the HD DVD logo and the Blu-ray logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it will be on both.  That's right. Blu-ray and HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's another story on the blog Dvorak.org slash blog for any of you haven't visited.  Have a drink.  Apple declares or Norway declares Apple's iTunes illegal.  I thought that was pretty funny.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Norwegian consumer counselor.  You know Americans we don't even know what consumer protection is anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consumer protection here?  Yeah.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Consumer Council the body that is filed with the consumer ombudsman and the ombudsman ombudsman  returned with a ruling that in fact Apple's iTunes store is illegal under Norwegian law because if you buy a song there you have to play it on an iPod.  And they're saying Apple if you want to keep doing business in Norway you have to allow other manufacturers either have to open your DRM or allow other manufacturers to license it.  Which means Apple is going to say I'll see you later Norway.  I mean how many songs could they possibly sell in Norway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I don't think it's a C you know right problem because it's France and Germany and Norway.  Okay.  And possibly.  So that's now a thousand songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole EU could go that way.  The EU could go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that when Apple starts to care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I think Apple cares now.  Apple's probably got fleets of lawyers going now because if we lose Europe we lose the United States.  It's the domino theory.  I mean it's World War II man.  Geopolitics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple has until October 1st to open Fairplay.  That's the DRM to other companies or face fines and the threat of iTunes being closed in Norway.  Well what is their choice?  I mean they're not going to open Fairplay are they or are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't he create a Fairplay compatible encryption scheme so you could then?  He did.  I don't know if it's legal or you're ever going to get your tune on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to see Sony putting on their mp3 player.  But yes there's a way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a way to do everything.  You know what you can't load up an iTunes with music any other way than using the iTunes software or an iPod using anything else but the iTunes software.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No that's not true.  There's actually quite a few media ape I think is one.  There are many programs that will sync your iPod.  I mean but again you have the issue of if it's copy protected nobody else.  You have to use iTunes.  But if it's just standard music you don't have to.  But that's true of Windows Media Player.  If you have protected Windows Media files you have to use Windows Media Player in a licensed player right?  Certainly.  Well the difference is of course that Microsoft licenses its DRM.  So I think we're done.  We're done.  I'm going to be heading off for New York to do Regis and Kelly.  Not at the same time.  I'll be doing it on Tuesday.  You're going to do the show you mean?  I mean the show on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Let's get that straight.  Did Leon say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said this blank memory where something John responded to you went.  Yes you missed all the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry Patrick.  But the good news is Debbie Does Dallas Again is on Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How old is this woman Debbie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we should put a guess.  Come here boys!  Since the new Debbie is the brand new.  We've gotten harangued a little bit recently for bringing up the whole subject of porn.  I'm one person.  One old bitty.  Easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a viable outlook Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're talking.  But it's...  Excuse me Robert.  Roger's making faces at me through the door.  Oh is Roger there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I invited Roger.  He never...  What is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does he not want to be on the show anymore?  He hates you Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah pretty much.  That's because I'm a top 25 web celeb.  He's just jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember the same people you meet on the way up are the people you meet on the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out which direction I'm going.  Going sideways.  No actually there's some good news.  The KFI radio show I do is going to be nationally syndicated.  I did a deal with Premier Radio Networks which is the number one syndicator in the country.  They do Dr. Laura.  They do Rush Limbaugh.  They do all the big shows.  Oh there's two of my favorites.  I don't know if they do Lycus.  Lycus is a god.  You should get a list.  Anyway I'm very pleased.  You know what they really get it.  I'm very happy and we're going to be starting that in a couple of weeks.  So call your local talk station and say,  Hello Leo.  And you guys all...  All the twit guys I'm going to appear on the show too.  I'm going to help Steve do security.  Dvorak will do a drinking game.  I don't know whatever.  Robert can review Blu-ray porn movies.  It'll be great.  It's going to be really...  It's a big party.  DL.TV will have a special show on Tuesday to celebrate Vista.  Vista?  Or at least help you survive.  The Vista Survival Guide.  I'm actually going to show Vista on Regis and Kelly on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I'm going to watch Regis and Kelly just to like watch that whole scene break down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The three minute Vista demo on Regis and Kelly.  It should be quite interesting.  Tell us everything about Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Vista? What is Windows? What are you talking about?  So why do I need this?  Do I need this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John is at his blog.  John C. Dvorak of course is the owner, the author, the editor,  and the guy with the good pictures on dvorak.org slash blog.  We didn't say it enough this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm losing my touch here.  I don't know about you John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there's a lot of sober people listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep forgetting to do it on the Cranky Geeks show.  Oh yeah, Cranky Geeks. Let's plug Cranky Geeks.  And PCMag.com and also MarketWatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm very happy to say we had a little trouble.  I never really wanted to be in the rag trade.  And I think the initial version of the Twitch store was, let's face it, a complete failure.  We're going to work on a way to refund everybody who bought any bad merchandise.  If you're unhappy with your merchandise, let me know and I'll refund your money totally.  But the good news is that Scott Jordan has stepped to the plate.  He does the great Scott Evest stuff.  And we're going to do some Scott Evest twit fleeces that are going to be gorgeous.  They're going to be sold on ThinkGeek.  I mean those are the two biggest brands in my mind in this area.  So we finally got a good vendor.  Look for those sometime in the next few weeks.  We're going to take next week off because I'm going to be on a Geek cruise,  but we'll be back in two weeks.  And if John has his way, we'll do a Best Of next week.  I don't know how that's going to happen.  Send me a Best Of.  Anybody listening, send me a Best Of and I will post it.  How about that? Let them do the job.  What should the topic be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we should do a wrap up of the last year, the Best of 2006.  That would be good. We haven't done that.  Just a hit from each show throughout the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Okay, that's your challenge.  The Best Of 2006 next week on Twitter if somebody does it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they'll also get a credit on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll get a credit on the show and I will give them a Scott Eves twit fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go. Now we're up in the ante.  And infamy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And infamy. Hey, thanks everybody.  It's good to talk to you. We will see you in a couple of weeks.  Another twit is in the cab.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Round the board.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Round the board.  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to be careful what I shoot.  Last time I was shooting around, right before the show started,  they were backstage, they just stand a little alcove.  And immediately somebody came and said,  you will be deleting that video.  You didn't keep it?  No, they were adamant. They said, you will delete that right now.  Somebody must have seen me do it.  And they said, whatever you do, it's like the Paris Hilton tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would have been a good one to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but this was pre-YouTube or I would have put it on YouTube.  Except I, well, I was going to say except I never be asked back, which is really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, who's going to know how they got it?  I mean, if you would have surreptitiously done it and been less obvious  and then done it months later, they would have figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, I will be there again.  And I could be a little more surreptitious with this camera phone.  I get a better picture too.  Mm-hmm.  Apparazzi!  Service pack one. Service pack two. Service pack two.  Screen of death. Firewall.
