Just stay here. Why go home? Yeah, so  now  We debated this because Daniel you remember last year's build keynote went for a world record three and a half hours  So long, they actually had a stretching session in the middle of it. That's right, which I refused to participate in I'm not that  Yeah, didn't they bring like a yoga person out and she showed people what to do

End time: 523.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know is awkward who's a little weird I  Don't know what what they're doing with these key notes tomorrow's gonna be a little strange too. They have three of them technically  So there's the main one which is such an Adele's vision keynote. That's what I would say is the exciting one  Stuff comes in right and we'll see you some of the more interesting announcements unless you're really really into Scott Guthrie's Azure  Server stuff which is super important. I don't want to knock it down. It's just the one I usually pass on  But yeah, it's gonna be a really interesting morning. So it's gonna be

Start time: 524.16
End time: 546.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently because such an Adele is a vision thing is sometimes a little  Up in the clouds. They brought in Paul Thuratt and Mary Jo Foley to explain it afterwards  They're gonna do a post keynote kind of explainer  We will carry that and then we'll do Windows weekly shortly after that is it three or one I've gotten conflicting reports

Start time: 546.68
End time: 551.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as far as I know right now, it's three o'clock three. So on the schedule of 3 p.m. Pacific six

Transcript:  Does this mean that the developer conferences are starting to go back to being developer conferences instead of yes

Start time: 564.42
End time: 628.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would actually say that start about two years ago. In fact, like the last big bill that was really sort of like exciting  It was probably 2015 they gave out Xbox's everybody that showed up and that was back when they were very much tying things into device  launches and  Software for those and these the conference now is much more professional aimed at just pure developer news  And that's why it's gone from where they would get on stage  I'm even announced like years ago like a Lumia phone on stage, right and obviously not doing that anymore  But it's now much more focused just on software tools for the people who are paying  What is a substantial amount of money to attend a developer conference and not get distracted by flashy more consumer news?  Which they tend to now save for separate events and with Google I'll right around the corner obviously on Tuesday  Whatever major news they make that would be consumer or pop culture ish  Would quickly wane by within 24 hours because of Google's I think they're it's actually smart to keep the conference like this  But it makes it a little bit less interesting if you you know  I've been following these for a few years now

Start time: 628.74
End time: 635.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do have to give a gift such an Adele a lot of credit though Microsoft joined the trillion dollar club this month

Start time: 636.68
End time: 653.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, did you see that that Bloomberg cover with that crazy?  No, yeah  The cover of Bloomberg this week is how he saved the you know saved Microsoft and it's this really insane like 90s  font  What did you think do you think he's really turned around the company?

Start time: 654.58
End time: 658.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's now yeah. Oh god. Look at that. That's hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys what it is is it's those like cupcakes  You know what I mean like it looks like a like us like a cupcake you'd get it like a gas station or something

Start time: 679.74
End time: 719.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because the Sun is coming up over his dome you want to go, huh?  It's very such as in the clouds  Yeah, that great font  It's yellow with a pink outline the miracle of Microsoft and then a very kind of 90s  The greatest tech company of the 90s is back  That's a that is a brilliant cover  Yeah, yeah, I mean perfect timing for for build. Yeah, I love that. It is a miracle. It's a miracle  I mean Microsoft was so dull their stock was flat for a decade. I mean you could drive on it  It was so flat. Yeah

Start time: 720.31
End time: 731.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now they're doing really well  I mean  It's it's not the same exciting stuff on the Balmer era and Balmer himself was always an entertaining person  Whether interviews when the dollar is definitely a lot more restrained

Start time: 731.22
End time: 737.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say if you hold Microsoft stock an entertaining CEO is number one on the list of things you want

Start time: 737.64
End time: 750.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, ask anyone who has Tesla stock, right?  So but I mean I think the changes he's done. I obviously I'm not super happy  You know, I wish things with like phone. Well, you work for a publication called Windows

Start time: 751.24
End time: 778.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Central yeah, and it's one thing such it definitely did and I think I you commend him for it is really  When he arrived Windows and office were everything they were the cash cow. They drove the company  He wisely I think saw the desktop operating systems were not the future that the cloud was the future and he pivoted that company  And thank God he did because if Windows were still their fortune. It wouldn't be a very good story to tell

Start time: 779.40
End time: 825.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and and unfortunately that change probably should happen years ago. I mean back in 2007 they missed mobile  I mean they were doing mobile and they were actually at a head start in mobile  But as a company they were focused on desktop and were completely ignoring where everything was going  The company now is positioned in a much more forward leaning towards, you know  Looking for the future in the next ten years where computing is going to be and trying to get there ahead of everybody else  That's why it's so much focus on AI machine learning  HoloLens and these kind of technologies which as consumers we hear and they're very esoteric words  And we're only starting now to see little bits of this stuff trickle into real-world life  But obviously they're betting that you know in 10 15 years is how tech is going to be and I think they're totally right on that  So I agree. Yeah, but it's yeah, it's a little bit less exciting at least initially, but it's important stuff

Start time: 825.42
End time: 877.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and you know what people like us?  Are not don't do enterprise for a reason right?  Isn't the most exciting thing ever consumer technology?  I like consumer technology, but get you know, get me get me stories about Azure and Hadoop and data lakes and  You know, I'm out and which is good. It's good. We have Mary Jo Foley on Windows Weekly because  Seems to care about that stuff or else she's a very good actor  Yeah, but let me ask is it really so one of the reasons tech stocks are been going up is because after the tax cut  Companies like Apple have been buying back stock like crazy  That's what they're doing with their repatriated money and some say that's artificially pushing up these tech stocks. Do you think?  Microsoft's value true value has gone up by that much or is it a shell game a little bit?

Start time: 878.00
End time: 936.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I'm obviously not a financial person per se so but from what I understand  Their valuation seems to be well within the range of being kind of conservative  I think because everybody looks at their profits and the cloud computing area, which is just known to be a growth area  There's not a ton of competition though the competition there with Amazon and Google  Significant and obviously major players, but they seem to have a firm grasp and vision where they're going  So it just seems like it's betting on a future business that seems to be doing well and the company itself is very conservative  I would say in terms of how it approaches new problems or products and makes it a little bit safer to invest in  But yeah, the stock buyback thing is always an interesting angle  These companies are sitting on the ton of money these days  And so it's we're entering a new era of this like massive hypercapitalism with some of these companies hitting over one trillion dollars  You know making 30 billion in revenue per quarter. It's it's kind of a new level. Yeah, it's kind of amazing

Start time: 936.99
End time: 937.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah

Start time: 938.16
End time: 971.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean if you thought that the margins were nice on advertising the margins are crazy on cloud computing  And I think that's a big thing is that they're just making you know  There's not a lot that they have to really do to make a lot of money on that and I think Microsoft's also done an amazing job  Staying out of the that companies like  Facebook Amazon Google have gotten themselves into except for like the github acquisition  Which was like a little bit of drama like they really you know stay pretty well outside of a lot of the issues that plague  A lot of these other companies like they want facial recognition to be regulated. You know that sort of thing. I think Brad's really great

Start time: 973.72
End time: 1009.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, so we're just joking about that before how like Microsoft doesn't have this we'll talk about it  In your show notes for YouTube  Regarding like some their changes that are coming up like YouTube now has this problem like we help contribute evidently to the outbreak of measles  Like that's a terrible headline and news story to be associated with as Google and YouTube that Microsoft  Thankfully to this point has then had a story like that. They could at any moment, right?  That's the business were in so we can't put them too high on a pedestal. But so far  Yeah, I mean absolutely right that the last few years  It's been Facebook and Google taking the brunt of all this privacy stuff and you know, it's worked in Microsoft's favor

Start time: 1010.06
End time: 1032.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's what's interesting because if you ask somebody a couple of years ago is  Microsoft a privacy focused company they would say hell no look at Windows 10 and all the telemetry it sends back that you can't turn off  But somehow without doing much it seems  Microsoft has started to look more like I guess in the comparison to Facebook and Google a privacy focused company

Start time: 1033.00
End time: 1036.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're closer to Apple right Apple. I feel like Apple they haven't you know

Start time: 1036.78
End time: 1041.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't taken the flag of privacy and planted it and said this is us or have them. Yeah

Start time: 1042.44
End time: 1065.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a little bit but they're definitely in between. I would say Apple and Google in terms of privacy  They're not quite as you know good as I would say Apple, but they're all sorts different business models, too  But obviously Google I was just in we'll talk about the numbers later at Google  But like I was blown away that they made 36 billion in revenue and 30 billion of that was advertising  Like if you ever need to know what Google's business is like that's a pretty clear sign versus what market offs

Start time: 1066.02
End time: 1087.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Businesses and so does do advertising Bing is an advertising  Company and they acquired  Overture right which they wrote off as a flop  But they they wanted this is almost just luck for Amazon for Apple and Microsoft both had ads  They were both pursuing ad tech and in both cases it failed and whole hallelujah. We don't care anymore

Start time: 1088.72
End time: 1114.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was a good thing, right? Yeah, it's a tough business. Obviously Google was sweeping up everybody, but  Yeah, their numbers this quarter. Obviously weren't great  I still also find that funny to their numbers that they only did set data 17% improvement for advertising and evidently that's  It's like because it used to be a 22% so clearly there's a problem, but I get it  There's a slowdown in advertising and when that much of your business is advertising its  You know that's a big deal

Start time: 1114.98
End time: 1153.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love this is Kieran McCarthy writing in the register  Of course, you know, they're the kings of snark, but I love his choice clipart  Microsoft promises to boil down its lengthy and confusing privacy controls in a 1,500 word announcement  And then it was 1350  So what is what is Microsoft's commitment to privacy are they genuinely  About that. I mean they do  It often seems like the stuff they send back from Windows is just telemetry giving them information about what people are doing with Windows

Start time: 1153.24
End time: 1244.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not so much trying to track you. Yeah, the difference is so there's information right and that's all we're talking about here  It's the information. What are they doing with that information? Are they then selling to third parties? Are they themselves monetizing it?  They're not a hundred percent not doing that right  So if you look at outlook outlook serves up ads if you're not a paying subscriber to office  And so and of course being in search has you know serviced ads for search results?  So there are there are some elements there, but when it comes to Windows 10 collecting telemetry  It's not tied to it not tied to your account in an identifiable way that can be used to track your behavior  It is purely meant on a technical basis for them to help improve the product versus  Profile you and then use that profile then sell off to advertisers which many would I would say argue that Google and Facebook  Do to look at you as the sort of the target?  And so Microsoft has always been doing that middle ground like said between Apple and Google and finding the space between  advertising and privacy, but as of late, you know Louise mentioned this earlier about  Facial scans and that kind of data they're pushing that to be regulated by governments this idea of biometrics  Having regulation I think is an interesting one an important one because so many things now scan our faces and data points  It's like all right. Where's that information get stored?  You know jet blue recently in Boston where I am started facial scans instead of boarding passes  That's shocked people when they did that didn't it? Yeah, cuz then it was like wait  Where are they getting the information from in terms?  Oh there we have a database and it's the government has it and they're working with the government on this

Start time: 1244.66
End time: 1248.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was just they got a little like weird one signed off on that, you know, right?

Start time: 1249.82
End time: 1253.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can opt out you can opt out and we were like, yeah, but we want to opt in

Start time: 1255.92
End time: 1269.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It came out of a tweet as I remember somebody tweeted this was weird  I just boarded a jet blue plane and I didn't have to show my D  They knew who I was from my face and it turns out it's a DHS database and that jet blue doesn't get access to it

Start time: 1270.28
End time: 1306.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Jeff Lee was like Jeff Lee was like, oh, don't worry Karen. You can opt out  But yeah, I mean I think there's a there's a big difference between say Amazon who releases these like horrible blog posts where they're like  Oh, we don't we think that like facial recognition is fine  Like here's our really weird like 1500 word statement on it versus the president of Microsoft  You know giving a speech in Paris about the importance of data and writing op-eds about how facial recognition should be regulated  I think is like a really stark contrast  So they've done a good job at least from a public perspective  Contrast so they've done a good job at least from a public relations standpoint of trying to position themselves as a leader

Start time: 1307.14
End time: 1315.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, that's where I get squirrely because do they do a good job of  Being a leader or just a good job of public relations

Start time: 1315.80
End time: 1354.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit of both  obviously  They're facing a little more scrutiny right now in Europe due to the heavier regulation there with telemetry and data collection being upfront about it  And it does force them to be, you know  And that's what sort of this letter was in response to about how they're going to respond to that  And be a little bit more clear. I find their privacy controls to be pretty good  You can just go through their website and turn everything on and off and everybody's kind of doing this now  But yeah, they've just never been as sort of creepy about their technology  It which is funny too because if you think about it years ago  They launched the Xbox one and it had the Kinect camera and everybody was freaking out there  I don't want to put a camera with microphones on my living room. Were you nuts? And and now today

So it's like I don't know everything shifting around. It's a very strange times  I think we're definitely trying to balance between  There are definitely people who really care about privacy and they you know make it a point to  Buy products that have it then there's just a lot of people just don't care, right?

Transcript:  They don't care. No, so but Louise you cover security maybe  Microsoft's  Problem is not gonna be privacy so much as security. We just heard another problem with 1903  You know which is the version that they're gonna about to push push out they are pushing out in some cases  It seems like Microsoft can't seem to write software or at least they can't update windows twice a year as they've promised to without  All sorts of issues and now it was 1803 then it was 1809 now. It's 1903 all have had big problems

Transcript:  Yeah, the amount of issues in  Microsoft is crazy  Like there's there's just constantly like way more bugs than there should be and they can't seem to get their act together on that  And it's just routine at this point. Like it's not even that interesting when these bugs come up because they are so frequent  I think if you're really concerned, you know from a privacy standpoint, you probably shouldn't be  Using word or like they're just certain programs that I don't think are are great  But yeah, I mean I think that you know all software has these kinds of issues  But it is interesting that you know Windows continues to stumble with these problems over and over again

Transcript:  yeah, I continue to hear so much beef about Windows 10 and  Personally, I can't say that I have those issues because about 90% of the time  I'm staring at an app not necessarily staring at the living in Adobe world  or either Adobe or a  Terminal or it's a terminal seed always getting in the way. Are you using Mac or using Windows?  I use Windows, but when I'm not doing creative stuff, I'm staring at some old informants databases  Jeez Louise. I'm so sorry

It is pretty competitive on the Linux side. Yeah, I'm using a  Poorly named but very good program called raw therapy with two E's  I  Mean so here. Yeah, so

I said no. No, I want to now  Anyway, but this this camera imports very nicely into the Linux that ThinkPad has an SD card slot  I use G thumb to import it. It looks just like Lightroom when it's importing does the same organizational things  I use raw therapy or dark table actually raw therapy is my new  Fave and it does all the editing I want to do. It's great and I can use the light dark table dark table is pretty good  It's fine and raw therapy looks even better. It's very interesting. Both are non-destructive  Honestly Adobe's hold on this market is gonna is gonna get a little shaky  Especially as they're moving towards more and more towards forcing you to subscribe  I was so peeved that they you know, I have to buy a terabyte of storage to upload my photos to Adobe  I don't want to upload my photos to Adobe

This is very expensive  $3,000 because you have this 30 inch touch screen, which is awesome  I mean it's for what I'm doing and for an artist we brought in a  Illustrator and let her play with it when it first came out. She was she fell in love with it  She loved it. She used the knob and all that stuff  But  The sad thing is they have this great screen and then I guess to save money  they basically put the the the power of the  Computer is terrible.

Now. This is something that if you are in a business  Where you have network operations you have customers in the cloud you have to deliver  Or you have to receive you have to you know that there's one of the biggest challenges of this is and there's a good reason  Why they draw the cloud is a puffy little cloud things go in  Maybe they come out maybe they don't maybe they take a long time and it's really hard to see what's going on in there  It could be very frustrating clouds great for business  But as you gain that agility you also increase risk and most importantly for DevOps and IT guys you lose control  When your cloud app or your service goes down you even know what wrong you just go  It's the cloud it's in the cloud somewhere  As you scramble to find the cause of the problem trying to fix it you're losing revenue  Employee productivity goes down. Maybe even you're damaging your brand. You know how what a big deal it is  When a cloud provider goes down, that's a big deal  You need instant visibility into the entire service delivery path from the cloud to your end user  And most especially including the portions you don't own or control and that's what thousand eyes does they really should call it a million eyes  There isn't this is the this this is an amazing service unlike anything you've ever seen before  And it came out of research from some years ago  Graduate students who are trying to figure out how do you how do you solve this problem?  They put sensors a massive array of vantage points all over the global internet cloud providers  Even down to the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop  thousand eyes is a cloud based  Program built to help organizations do the cloud right their unique path visualization technology extends beyond boundaries  Allowing you to see understand and improve the experience for all your apps all your services all your websites  it's it's almost as if you're sitting there trying to peer through a  you know a kind of a  streak dirty, you know window and somebody comes along with a squeegee and  And you can see  Mohit lad who is the founder and Ricardo Olivera were doing research at the UCLA Internet Research Lab  They were trying to visualize autonomous system topologies got an NSF grant  Then they said you know this is something that the internet needs and they created thousand eyes and I gotta tell you this is  an eye opener  Squeegee that view of the world clean join the top banks the enterprises the SAS companies the world's largest and fastest growing brands who rely  On thousand eyes to do the cloud and do it right  Here's what you do you want to find out more go to thousand eyes comm slash twit and  See what you've been missing. They've got an ebook there that you could provide the boss  Five cloud migration challenges you shouldn't ignore lots of things to think about before you move to the cloud  If the clouds important to you whether it's right now or in the future thousand eyes comm slash twit and  We appreciate you using that URL that lets them know you heard it here  And we really appreciate thousand eyes in the job. They're doing thousand eyes comm slash twit thousand eyes  thrive in a connected world  Okay, let's see where do we go from here let's talk about because this was so next week's developer week  Last week was quarterly results week although Facebook threw in a developer conference last week to f8  Did you know the future is private?  You know mark could say that over and over again he can even stand under a giant sign that says the future is private somehow I  Don't know if I believe him

Start time: 2333.46
End time: 2362.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think anyone does I think that's probably part of the problem  I kind of respect the idea that you're trying to turn this around, but it's I just say Facebook's one of those things  I'm not a fan. I never I've never been a hardcore Facebook user  I stopped I barely use it for about six months for a high school reunion  Then I stopped using it and opted out of it and that was about it  I just look there's a point in your life where all your friends are married and have kids and  You're not part of that crowd and it gets really weird on Facebook, but I'm just not into the whole thing

Start time: 2363.40

Start time: 2366.70
End time: 2383.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a choice it's a choice  But like I and that's unfortunate because I do understand the social nature of  Facebook and people want to stay connected and it seems like such a lost opportunity that this  What was potentially a huge idea is just getting so sour with all these controversies

Start time: 2383.58
End time: 2413.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got so excited when mark wrote that blog post that I actually I had killed my Facebook account  I reactivated it and then I got talked down people said wait a minute and actually at f8  He reiterated all these important things were going to be private  We're gonna have end-to-end encryption wait till you see it and they announced nothing  They made zero changes  Louise is is it do you am I wrong in thinking that mark is full of it? I

Start time: 2414.60
End time: 2439.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think he is kind of full of it  But I think that they're what the problem is Facebook is grapple grappling with this fundamental problem  Is that there was a time when you added everyone you you knew to Facebook right and now it's been too long  I've had Facebook for over a decade  So now it's everyone I've ever met in the last decade and there's like nothing that's reasonable to share with all of those people  At once right like we don't really know what to do anymore like when I was a heavy Facebook user

Start time: 2439.52
End time: 2441.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting problem. I hadn't even thought of that

Start time: 2443.56
End time: 2496.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like that's the issue is that like why would you want to share with all these people?  You know have kids now that you don't really talk to or that like it's just photos of their kids like and I think it's true  for younger people to like  No one wants to share everything with their second cousin and some guy who was in their English class freshman year of college  Like it doesn't really make sense and the only way to fix that I think is to go private  So I think that mark is addressing a genuine issue and I think it's not just the privacy scandals  It's that like you said it's perfect for a high school reunion or a college reunion or something because it's essentially a scrapbook  It's not really a live network anymore  I think for a lot of people in North America, especially and I think that  Yeah, people like group chats people like one-on-one chats that's not gonna go away but like this weird  You know memory book is like super eerie and strange for a lot of people now  I mean, I think it's like one in a couple decades is gonna be more dead people than  Live people on Facebook. It's gonna be really weird

Start time: 2497.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something about that the Oxford Internet Institute predicted that based on 2018 user levels  The dead will outnumber the living on Facebook by 2070  That's actually by the way, I will be one of them I'm just saying no action  That is a weird number and a weird statistic  But you raised a more interesting point which is that basically you and Daniel have both kind of outgrown Facebook that Facebook  Served a purpose for you at one time, but there was no easy way to take Facebook with you into your modern life

Start time: 2530.06
End time: 2546.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's still offensive to unfriend someone right?  You can mute them but like there's not like a path to like I haven't spoken to you in six years  I'm just gonna delete you like that's not we don't really have like, you know, we don't like that's still kind of weird  And it's like, oh, I hope they don't notice what so why wouldn't you do that?

Like we don't have the like normal social, you know contract  Like we already have the normal contract for the positive side, which is like, okay  You become friends with somebody maybe like after you hang out once or twice you add them on Facebook  But we have never decided what you do in six years when like you haven't talked to them in five years and you don't

Transcript:  Yeah, you don't just ghost them. You just ghost them, right? So this is a problem. It sounds like there's so the one of Facebook's problem  Is no one under 25 uses it at all  The next problem apparently is there's a generation that did use it but now feels like it doesn't have any meaning in their life  In fact, really the big problem with Facebook is it's mostly old people like me that are using it. Oh

Start time: 2596.14
End time: 2628.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like they just released this new thing called secret crush where it's gonna be in countries where there's Facebook dating  Yeah  so basically what you can say is like you can say  You have a crush on Louise and then if I put you on my crush list, then we're like matched together and when this came out  Yeah, so it's horrible  And if you don't put the same person on your list then you just like know that somebody had a crush on you  But you don't know who it is. It's kind of like tinder though. Isn't that a little tinder II?  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of tinder II except like it's people know Facebook. It's like they get jealous of some other

End time: 2727.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't have a trouble meeting people so much  I mean, I think older adults do because we're like wrapped up in jobs and we don't get out  So it's you don't have that social stuff  Just get to my fundamental problem sort of just venture capitalism and these companies in general  Which is Facebook unfortunately was one of those companies started off  Like I said, it was a really good idea for keeping people connected, but that was never enough, right?  So as soon as these companies start taking venture capital money, it's all about growth  They have to constantly be growing at exponential rates forever  and that means you have to constantly be  innovating and creating new things and sometimes a Facebook could be just Facebook, right?  It could just be this basic chat thing like how we all yearn for the days of aim  But they don't have that luxury they have to always keep adding more stuff Nate they went down that path of advertising  Years ago, we heard that you know media was dead. It's all gonna be Facebook publishing  So they've gone away from their roots of what it was supposed to be with this and in this point about  Not sharing certain things with like, you know college people versus a friend versus your co-workers is totally accurate  It's a really good, you know point that what we share now  It just has very different audiences and there's no way to segregate that now

Transcript:  It's a classic problem of how to get other your friends and family on to it thing with chat apps  It's such a lock-in to the system  But I mean, I think the possibility exists at Facebook  But it's gonna be one of those like it's like Microsoft from the 90s that they hurt themselves enough  People will leave and that's so far Facebook's biggest threat has been itself  It's to inflicting its own damage to itself causing people to to leave but we haven't seen another company  Leverage or take advantage of that. It's just it's a very difficult problem. I disagree. I'm a little bit more optimistic. I think that

Yeah, there's already a really strong  Facebook we need to think of new things. Yeah, and they have a much more interesting revenue model  I think that's not completely driven by advertising like the kind of like sponsored content they do on tick tock  I think is a little bit more innovative and not something that  Facebook can easily copy and there's you know, it's been downloaded over a billion times.

I don't bring them up  They don't bring me up and it just life goes on the difference is it seems like it's affecting people  By going in and clicking unfollow.

I have a lot of thought on it because like humans are where I call them  We're psychotic and social like we're just obsessed with the need to have human contact at any level  no matter how far and distant it is and  Seeing someone and being able to share and you know and really just go out there and create in part  It stems from that creative ability as humans  Some of it just is just the fact we talk and we're the only species that talks at least at the sophisticated level  And we just have this need inside to constantly share which is why every  Computational program that comes out the first thing that people come up with are like ways to talk to other people whether it's a messaging  Like if you look back in the internet days like the early days it was messaging right?

We're very sterile  Use net was you know, the newsgroups were one way and but I think you're exactly right that there was the strong pressure was  to become a communication medium and  That really the internet did not become a mass tool until it was about communication  And in fact, you could probably make the argument about computers in general that it wasn't until they became communications  Devices that they got mass acceptance the kind but this is the weird thing about social media  Is it appeals to people who have isolated themselves because of technology? Yes with pseudo  communicate pseudo relationship

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well, we're talking about two different things  I think is the issue is that like the issue with Facebook and why it's uncomfortable is that what Facebook did and Instagram is that?  They leveraged your real-life social graph, right?  Like the people you friend on Facebook are mostly people that you know from real life first and that's like Facebook's value  Is that like it actually has a social graph that mirrors the real world? Yeah, I like Twitter better  I like tick-tock better because I'm following people  For the most part from real life and it is a window into something new whereas like Facebook is a window into like my past  Because it's everyone I actually know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe this is just me but one of the reasons I left Twitter  My account's still there because I can't force myself to throw away half a million followers, but  One of the reasons I stopped using it is I realized I was using it as a distraction  I was using it as like I'm bored. I'm gonna look at a Twitter feed and it's good at that, right?  Because it's a bunch of stuff. It's all  It's you know, boom, but it's very dazzle II and I realized that that wasn't a healthy use of that. That was like  That was like crack that was like, you know jacking into something cuz I was bored and then  And I didn't think that was a healthy thing is that you can say that about any of the social media all of it  Yeah, all of it ultimately is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think we've like learned how to reckon with that and I don't think we I don't think we're gonna know it's we're  All kind of the test generation of this right?  Like none of us have been using any of the stuff for more than you know  10-15 years like maybe you use use that or something like that, but the real like supercharged  News feeds are only what even less than 10 years old for the most part  Yeah, so I think that we just don't know exactly how this is like, you know messing with our brains

I killed my Twitter account than I thought better of it  But maybe I still will I think maybe your followers  It's hard to throw away that many followers, but I'm thinking that maybe in five or ten years  Louise you'll be doing the same thing. You'll have come to that same point

Like we don't have that same kind of relationship with other forms of media  Maybe television people do try and watch less television  But I don't think it's the same like this is hurting a deep part of my brain

They're they're publicly traded  They have stock they have it's very public what they do  So they're going to turn this around because the public is turning against them  So it's a PR thing and that doesn't mean you know  Listen Microsoft had to do that too, right?  A lot of companies go through this stage where they're just not publicly  Admired anymore and they have to change and that's fine  It's market pressure is changing for hopefully the good but it does remain to be seen  But I think they will have to do this because people are gonna just demand it

Yeah, you know, there's they're not three platforms anymore  And I think that we have to look at kind of the reasons why they're doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think from your point of view  So there's two answers to that because from Mark's point of view  He's perfectly happy to have you use any of the above  But from your point of view it is a very different experience  One of the reasons people like Instagram is because it's not Facebook. It's just pictures. That's me. Yeah, I'm in that category  I I wish that every ninth picture weren't an ad for something that I really don't need but really have to buy

I reject that entirely except you're probably right  I know that it's in for my daughter's where she did this experiment with her friends  They said into they said into the phone baby duck baby duck baby duck baby duck  Then all of a sudden she started getting ads for baby ducks in her Instagram feed  Don't buy it I can't imagine that's happening. It happened so many times  Difficulty, you know this you're an expert in security help me Louise  They would have to be sending data back from everybody's phones all the time  parsing that data  Looking for keywords and then changing the ads.

Maybe yeah  Maybe March where they violated the Children's Protection  Privacy Protection Act because they were collecting data on people under 13  And two FTC commissioners actually wrote in a letter after that  Fine came down and said we think that the people running tick-tock should be personally held accountable for this and they weren't  But the FTC has already said that you know  We don't want to go down this path where we just find these companies chump change instead of actually holding the executives  Accountable and I think especially in Facebook's case where you have a super Omni powerful CEO  Like Zuckerberg who basically controls the company even though it's public. I think he's a perfect person to be held personally accountable

How's that Twitter feed  Our show today brought to you by fresh books. I love fresh books. I first discovered it back in  2004 I was I was complaining  to Amber MacArthur when I used to have to go to Canada to do the TV show up there and I was complaining her because  I have to send an invoice at the end of every month and I hadn't done it in a few months because I'm lazy  And then they didn't pay me and I thought this is terrible. She said oh, there's a brand new company just started up in Toronto  In fact, I'll tell you what this she said. It's a web 2.0 company  I'll give you some idea the time frame called fresh books and they make it really easy to do invoices  So I started it was like a it was incredible. They do the currency conversion  I could use the fresh books app take pictures of receipts  Automatically get them into my expense report and I got paid faster  In fact on average you get paid according to fresh books research twice as fast because it turns out the fresh books invoice  Allows you to accept online payments credit card payments on and if there's a button right in the invoice that says pay and  Your clients they don't like paying bills anymore letting you like sending bills  So if you make it easy for them, they actually pay faster  You'll spend less time on paperwork more time doing what you love  You didn't get into this to do invoices, right?  But you got to do the invoices fresh books makes it easy and by the way  Simply by doing the invoices by a challenge handling the expenses keeping track of your time and hours  You're actually doing your books. It's accounting software so you can get the reports you need when it's tax time  Automatically, you don't need any accounting experience. It'll just do it for you easily  So it starts with professional looking invoices it starts with automatically recording expenses tracking time  But by the time you're done  You've got it all everything you need to understand for instance something. I never knew as a freelancer. Am I making money?  I'd know that at the end of the year when tax time came with fresh books  You can always go to your fresh books dashboard to know exactly where you stand tax calculations are done automatically  Look your if you're own a small business if you're a freelancer  There's a lot to do at least this part can be easy fresh books  It's used and trusted by small business owners in over a hundred twenty countries  24 million people have used it's grown a long way since I started using it and I love it and you will love it, too  Join the 24 million people who use fresh books visit fresh books comm slash twit  You'll do us a favor by putting this week in tech in the how did you hear about a section?

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's gets down to the same issue with Apple's facing right which is Apple's, you know  Primary source of revenue is the iPhone and that's and the iPhone did very well for many years and is a cash cow  But as phone sales start to plateau Apple's facing an issue here and trying to you know  How they go you continue to grow and make money Google has this issue a bit, too  You know as I mentioned 30 billion out of that 36 billion in revenue is from advertising  That's an enormous amount of money. Whereas, you know, they get 5.7 billion  I think from their other products and services and the pixel, you know, which it gets all the headlines. It's barely a blip  It's not even a top 10 of smartphones. It's huge for tech people  It's huge for tech people who talk about this stuff all the time, but for consumers in the market  It's not and so and then they're losing a ton of money on things like Waymo and there's you know  They're bets that they're doing which is fine  You know companies should have that reserve fund they have plenty of money to explore new ideas and they should be doing that and you're increasing  their R&D but  The advertising is getting more competitive  there are a lot of companies that are forming alliances out there are trying to and take them on and it's a  You know the nature of the web itself is changing how we view ads how to monetize things  It's never a secure thing, but I mean financially they're not going away, right?  Google's not going under no  But they had to be wary of this stuff about how they're going to make money eventually without just advertising

Like that's kind of it like, you know, there's all these skills you can load on to it to do all these other things  But like beyond like hey, what's the weather and like, you know play Beyonce  Like I just don't really see these major use cases and I don't think it's gonna be a major revenue stream for most of these companies  I think Amazon is smart because it you know order dog food. I think is a better use case than you know  Do be doing Google searches on it like that.

So Amazon's intent for this wasn't like  Oh, let's have smart speakers  It was let's give users another tool so they can order Amazon services and it's like, you know  You just say it in order and that was the concept but wasn't I think was the intercept ran a story last year's showing  How only 2% of like a lot of users actually use it to order stuff on Amazon  So in that in that regard like conceptually this device is a complete failure  It's in a lot of homes and it has the mind share but it's not doing so then it comes down to all right  What do you where are they making money off of this thing from?  Is it like Spotify and selling associate like, you know, they get referrals or something like that  I don't know and and Google of course, it's gonna try to monetize all the data they can collect from you  But I agree we're still not used to one talking to computers partly because of natural language  It's just not there by the way teaser.

I will say Google's, you know, they're supposed to be teasing this new hub thing  And I we've talked about this at Windows Central  Microsoft was exploring this idea years ago years ago  And I think when you add a screen to these things like a Lexus show already a show that's pretty do become  Yeah  It does now also and change the user and action model and it becomes a lot more interesting  And so I think this concept of a 10-inch device that is a centralized hub  I think is  Something the next stage for these devices and it's a little more interesting  Especially as we get more more smart homes connect things up to each other a centralized repositories interesting  I wish Microsoft was  Going to do they were supposed to do something here  I'm not sure if they're still going to because again if I have to choose between companies, you know Apple for security  Microsoft next for privacy and then it's like I really don't want to do Google or Amazon a little sketchy of their stuff

Transcript:  I mean you know Tesla is a good example this recently although people could argue about  Elon Musk, but like the fact is it's like they shipped way more cards this year the same time this year than they did last year  And so they're having significant growth, but they're not able to meet sort of the numbers  there's some of them some of the numbers they set themselves internally, but  You know it's there is this pressure  But then again their stock hasn't suffered as much as nearly as much as the shorts would want them to suffer so  You know their stock is actually doing all right considering the bad news that they had in the last few days as far as Apple though  I do see an Apple is sitting on a ton of money, so that's good  But you know as a publicly traded company that it is about what comes next and the issue with the iPhone  I think is really interesting because I've been saying for two years now that smartphones. They're plateauing  We're leveling off, and this is this is a good thing. This isn't bad news  It's a commodification of the these devices as they reach a maturity level just like how we don't really do this podcast  We don't talk about like refrigerators the latest tech and refrigerate even though  I guarantee you Samsung has a brand new refrigerator at Best Buy right now. That's like really neat  But it's because it's just  Technology stuff we get used to and phones are going through this right now and Apple's seeing you know facing the pressure to most if  You look at China. They're having problems there. They've had to cut prices  You have companies like Huawei who I've been saying the Chinese companies for years were accused of copying  Apple and Samsung and they were lately  But they've gone now from that to like now  They're surpassing Apple and Samsung at a lower cost and I see what China is doing in  Tech especially mobile it's gonna be one of the biggest threats probably more for so Korea  I see LG exiting smartphones eventually Samsung. I think it's kind of a real challenge  They're chasing Apple and now they're getting beat from behind in the low  Low to mid-range smartphone segment, and you're going to see you know Apple have to cut and they they're pivoting with services  But their services are solely dependent on the devices  They sell themselves because if you're on if you have a Windows PC and an Android phone  You're probably not using a lot of Apple services  And so they're gonna have to find this balance between growing their services, but keeping they have to keep device sales  Going out and it can't be just enough to be chugging along

Start time: 5179.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know how they get around them and the problem with Apple is that you we don't we don't really think about this  When you live in the US, but an iPhone is a luxury product and I think that that market tops out somewhere  You know if you're in a third world country, you're not getting an iPhone  You just aren't and that and they don't have any interest in tapping into those markets  You know, they kind of tried with the se that was supposed to be for the brick countries, you know  They've done a little bit of that, but I don't think they have much interest in developing a mid-tier  iPhone that's gonna cost $400 or something. They don't want to do that  And there's only you know so much they can grow and people are holding on to their iPhones longer which Apple hates  It's really great for the environment. I've had my iPhone 7 for almost 24 months now  I have no intention of getting a new phone because why would I I think the difference between the 7 and  The latest phones that are out right now is just not that meaningful because you're right. I'm not gonna replace my fridge every year  That's insane the same

I I think this has created a little psychosis in Apple though  And this worries me a little bit and this is from a personal experience. So we  Patrick Delahannay one of our great engineers  Wrote a very simple program for the Apple TV  That allows you to watch and stream a new show of ours called hands on tech  It's a review show and it reviews everything not just Apple stuff. It reviews Android stuff and Windows laptops and other stuff  The when he submitted it to Apple Apple sent it back  Saying yeah, you can't have images of non Apple products in the images  the promo images of your  Show they rejected it and we've actually heard from other Apple  Other developers who write stuff for our network that yeah  Anytime they have an Android phone or a laptop from Windows in any of the collateral material  They have to delete it before Apple accept the  Program now, I'm I think that we deleted it and Apple accepted it was like  But but what kind of weird paranoia is is that where oh we don't want anybody to know that there's anything  besides Apple products

It was like a social commentary on how awful it was to make iPhones and Foxconn and they wouldn't let that game in the app store  And there have been a lot of cases like that, you know, Steve Jobs famously didn't want porn on the iPhone  There was no however, they promoted the sports Illustrated bikini edition app, which is more exploitive

They're going to add mouse and trackpad support to iPad  That's going to be the real threat because for me I have an iPad  I try to use it  But its limitation for me is I wish I had a trackpad or mouse support because I'd be so much more for productivity  Once they finally add that I think it's gonna be a real, you know challenge to Microsoft in this area for surface  There's still service could do way more on a PC end, but that's for a lot of regular people  That's actually going to matter.

I think for a lot of people it's equivalent took a core  I three processor but it has eight gigs of RAM on it  So that also helps it's right at that cusp where you know if you use it for productivity for like word web browsing email  Office stuff. It's totally fine. If it starts to if you want to play video games also, it's not very good  Now you have the 8cx which should be out around July August which start to see devices there  The long-term play though is for Microsoft switching to what we've been calling Windows Lite or Windows core OS  Which is sort of this next iterative version of Windows. It's a new skew. That's gonna be  Compatible to what Chrome OS is but right Windows 10 and so that's gonna be there real big push into  Next-gen like computing. It's also Holland surface up to will be running it and all this kind of stuff  But desktop will exist for  Hardcore desktop users legacy gamers  But as we move to and I think the world is moving towards like computing the iPad as sales continue to demonstrate is just this  Device we we want a device ironically the iPad is

Yeah, I think that's cool  It's very elegant way is gonna hook a so there was the royal  That they announced and showed at CES. Okay, throw that out the Samsung Galaxy fold. Well, you know what happened there  So now we're waiting this summer the third folding phone though while way, which is a trifold  Yes, do you think they'll get that out?

Start time: 5854.67
End time: 5877.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So okay  What I will say is that I think folding the other way is smarter than what the galaxy did actually, right?  So that galaxy like if this is the screen they folded this way  Whereas the wall is going that way  Yeah  And I think like just physically with the physics that you're working with  Folding over itself having the screen fold over itself is better than having it fold in. I  Just think that's a better model

Transcript:  There's definitely I think that's gonna be the fun part to see which this is just like the early days when  Microsoft was trying to get transforming devices on the market two and ones. We saw so many weird creations  We had screens that flipped around and spun around and so that was sort of fun to see which is the best design and there  Will be a couple of these on a market. Well, some will work some won't there's every trade-offs at the Huawei one. It's  Okay, and you mentioned this Louise like they're not glass screens. They're plastic screens  So they're way more prone to scratching and so when you have the screen now on the outside and you put it in your pocket  Like how's that last in six months?  These are solvable problems like we'll figure this stuff out, but this technology is definitely here to stay  It's just going to take a few years for us to  For price to come down and to see what consumers enjoy as soon as we get settled with that  So it's gonna come out with a trifold device like three screens

Transcript:  Yeah, I just think I we got to give it to these companies  it's easy to make fun of Samsung for what happened with the fold, but I will say like  yeah, I feel bad for them too, but I  Give them a lot more credit than I do  Apple when you know the batteries are dying like I think that it they're really innovating trying something  Versus like oh these batteries like died on purpose  You know what I mean?  Like that kind of thing like it's like hardware is really hard and I feel like you got to give these companies a lot  Of credit when they're trying but I'm not gonna give you credit when you're doing something that's just shady or stupid  But this is like I think actually really interesting

Transcript:  I want a folding refrigerator. Yes, it pops out now  But this stuff I think is really interesting because it does open up new thought scenarios  I mean there there is this issue in computing which is where we're kind of  We're all over the place like if you remember smartphones years ago, we had to flip phone  It was the Moto razor was how thin and small things could get right and then I keep telling people years ago  I had the HTC Titan. What a massive sounding phone. It's a Titan. It was a 4.7 inch display  Like that was what was huge back then. I now have over there. It's I have the mate 20 acts  It's a 7.2 and jealous. Yeah, nothing is just it's huge  But there's obviously trade-offs with that right it doesn't fit and you'll love this Leo  It doesn't fit in my Tesla the model 3 doesn't fit yet cell phone holder the tray. It's too tall  But we're trying to figure out this balance between we want a smartphone and we want large screens  But we don't I assure you most people do not want to put seven point two inches of screen in their pocket  So foldables are definitely a way to sort of solve this

Start time: 6078.10

Transcript:  All of the problems are around UI  Yeah, we got we've got the innards of these things pretty well worked out the problems are in and that's why you have voice assistants  That's why I have photoable screens  It's why you have all of these because it's a UI issue because humans like the Apple watch or these watches  They're too small. You really can't make a good UI on a device. That's 44 millimeters in size  Yeah, humans have certain needs we got fingers we got eyes we get and and so that's the problem is how do we  How do we get a user interface?

Want to be like wearing something on their wrists like that like the the smartphone is just the device  It's the one device and I think innovating beyond that is still really hard

Transcript:  Let's take a little break. What a great panel. It's so fun to have you Louise Misakas  You got to come back more often with you're just great  Wired we love having you we're not done. Don't go away  Putting I'm putting a little hello in the middle exactly  And Pruitt we love always love having him on and Pruitt's YouTube channel is youtube.com slash ant  ant-pru  Catch him anytime and of course Daniel Robino. He's executive editor at Windows Central gearing up for a big  Build conference starting tomorrow  Yeah, our show today brought to you by last pass if you're not using last pass  All I can say is what why not if you have passwords in your life  You need a password manager and if you need a password manager, there's none better than last pass the number one  most preferred password manager  Last pass does everything right?  It is a password vault that is encrypted and only decrypted on your device  So only you have access to it. It goes on every device you use windows Mac  Linux every browser Android iOS  The first thing I install on any new device is last pass  Because now I can log into everything else. I can install all the other apps last pass  Supports all the features you want  There's a last pass for every kind of user. We use it last pass enterprise here at twit  Because it gives us centralized control of our passwords  You know one of the problems you have in a business is you have to give employees  Passwords to kind of vital things like databases bank accounts websites  with last pass I can trust the employees with these passwords because  For instance, they don't actually see the passwords. I can share those passwords. They click a link  It opens it up logs in for them, but they never know what the password is  We know employees share passwords and not just with people at work. They put passwords on post-it notes  They make up bad passwords last pass enterprise gives us the cure for all of that and still  Makes it easy for them to get the job done. In fact, we love last pass so much  It's a benefit of working at twit every single one of our employees gets their own  Personal last pass and of course, I encourage them all to use that at home with last pass enterprise  We can there's a hundred policies we can say what the you know minimum requirements for the master password  We can require two-factor which we do by the way last pass has two-factor down  We I use a Yuba key with my last pass you can use duo security Google authenticator last pass even has its own authenticator app  Which is does the thing I really like?  Instead of giving you a six digit code it just pops up a approved deny on your phone  Makes it very easy again  I love how last pass makes security simple and easy to use because if it's too hard to use people won't do it  Last pass is a must for your business is a must for your home  There's last past teams for teams of 50 or fewer last pass premium for your personal use at home  We use last pass families that way I can easily there's a folder a shared folder whenever I set up an account with something  Lisa needs access to I just put it in that shared folder. She immediately has access to it  There's also a nice feature on last pass families I  You know, I hesitate to talk about this, but I think it's really important. It's called emergency access if I become  disabled or die  Lisa can get access to the password so she can get into my bank accounts and execute my will and do all that stuff  I know we don't want to think about it, but that's just an it's a it's the kind of little touches like that that make last  pass really  fantastic  Lastpass join the 13 and a half million people who signed up for last pass are loving it and trusting it including me  I've been using it for a decade  We've been using it for years at twit to last pass comm slash twit find the last pass. That's right for you your business  Start securing your passwords  Because you have to you don't want to be the next  news story about the big breach last pass  comm slash  Twitter one more Apple story  You know, there's a big fight going on about the right to repair our friends at I fix it org or big  You know believers in the right to repair  One of the companies fighting it is Apple  the latest an Apple lobbyist brought an iPhone to meetings with California lawmakers and said  The reason we don't want people fixing their phones.

Start time: 6564.24
End time: 6592.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that this is actually this is really insidious  And it's really funny to think of an Apple lobbyist like running around with an iPhone open with like a finger cut finger  Cut on their finger. What does that call paper cut on their fingers?  I guess it is a finger cut but that's not what I meant  But I think the more insidious argument is that a lot of these companies will say that it's a security issue  Right that yeah that like there's a cyber security risk in fixing your own item your own  Electronic and that we're all gonna get hacked if you release spare parts

Oh, I have it on I love it  I turned it off a while ago  You can like see literally like oh, okay left my house  But then I forgot my keys that day and I turned around and went back like it's really  Crazy how like granular it is if you're like in a big enough house or building  Sometimes you can even see like oh I was in that room for a while that I like moved to the other side of the house  Like I took the dog around the block like it is really crazy how granular it is  And I do think it is, you know kind of problematic to have all that forever.

Transcript:  There's this tension between what we want this technology to do and what willing to give up to get to it  Like there is no doubt about that being able to look at photos back  You know a year ago or two years ago on a specific day  It's like really interesting because the problem now we have is there's too much information and data out there and there is this  Massive benefit we mentioned talk about the ads before on Instagram like I joke about those but a lot of times those ads  They're so good like that  The technology has gotten to this point where they do know you and what you want  It's even when you're out for restaurants, right?  If it's it already knows like what you like these like you we do want these services  But then the question is we get creeped out when you see, you know  How the sausage is made so to speak right and how they're collecting all this data and going back there  I think this option should have always been there and that's probably the case for almost all this technology with data collection  Is like there always should be more tools it but this is also  You have to go out there and enable it and find it  And they'd be more interesting if you set up your Android phone if it's going to give you the option during the out-of-box  Experience to do that then I'll be a little bit more like okay now that they're doing the right thing  We even just it would be nice if your phone popped up every once in a while like hey we have data for you for the  Last 10 years do you want us to hold on to all this?  I don't think they'll go down that route quite yet  But that's what I think it'll take before to something's useful because right now  I don't know how many people are going to know about this feature right this isn't something that or that grant to know how to go  Find it and that's gonna be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's also the interesting thing about security too, because isn't the case like  If your password like you're using a pin or a physical password  You could claim you don't know the password and then this comes into the search and seizure  Fourth Amendment kind of thing about how they get that password  Otherwise, they've got to detain you for presumably a long time which for me  I'm actually fine. If anyone wasn't detained me for like a week. I'm just like that's a vacation man  This is where bio authentication comes into an issue because as we know the police have used people's fingers to unlock their phones or a facial  Recognition they just hold it up to your face and boom it's unlocked  So this is one of the tips where you know  either whenever you're dealing with the police if you're know, you're gonna be doing some, you know public protests or you're  Returning overseas and maybe not a bad idea if you're concerned about this to disable your bio  Authentication and just rely on a pin system and just deny I would also say a lot of modern computers today  We are living in a very cloud-based world.

Although they might want your cloud password, right?  It's not that simple. But yeah, definitely  You can't they can't force you to self-incriminate so they can't force you to give over your password  However, they can force you to give over your biometric data, which can be your fingerprint or your face  The courts are kind of undecided right now  But yeah, don't leave face ID on if you're crossing over the border and don't really want your phone looked at but yeah these device
