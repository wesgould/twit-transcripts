End time: 325.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was 10 a.m. it was perfect oh it's midnight here now when we're doing the  show but to order an iPhone 10 it was great except you know I was I don't  really need the phone so I wasn't crushed but I waited until I had to wait until  like 10 8 so 8 minutes for it to finally refresh for me and of course by then it

Start time: 325.76
End time: 365.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was like 5 weeks or 6 weeks of wait so I think that's and Amy you don't feel the  need to get an iPhone 10 and I don't I've long since given up on on iOS I am  my happy Samsung Galaxy 8 user yeah yeah I love the no date I just have the no  date which I really like I've ordered the pixel XL which we'll talk about  because what's interesting is with all of these newest phones there are some  challenges as these phone makers try to push the envelope most notably Samsung  last year with the exploding note 7 because they tried to put more battery  in it and it didn't work out so well but now pixels Google's having some trouble  with a pixel we'll talk about that in a little bit Michael did you do you do you

Transcript:  out yeah yeah we my one of my co-workers Megan Moroni got hers we'll be getting  hers Friday which is of course the official release date mine is two weeks  after that my wife so I got up I'm sitting in my home office I've got a  computer screen on the Apple Store a computer screen on the T-Mobile store  I've got an iPod iPad on the iOS store and an iPhone on the iOS store I'm  refreshing like a like a monkey refreshing refreshing it's midnight it's  1201 it's 1202 nothing nothing T-Mobile is still selling the upgrade of the  iPhone 8 not to the iPhone 10 refreshing refresh and when I finally got through  it wasn't on the Apple Store which is the easiest way usually to get through I  got through on the Apple website and you know so I got two to three weeks delay  my wife stayed in bed her alarm went off at midnight she sleepily got her iPhone  went right in the Apple Store and ordered it and went back to sleep I'm  so I don't know what I did wrong I tried Apple I tried hard yeah I felt the same

Start time: 446.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way I was you know looking at the great Steve in the sky and I was thinking tell  me what did I do wrong eight minutes that's that's unnatural isn't it

Start time: 455.90
End time: 480.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  frustrating I just find it's it's brilliant marketing there is some debate  and and and it goes back and forth over whether these shortages which seem to  happen every year are contrived for marketing purposes I don't I feel like  every company Nintendo with the switch will make will make as many as they  possibly can because every phone you don't sell day one is potentially a

Start time: 480.50
End time: 490.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phone you'll never sell right no I agree I think I think it's it's a common myth  unless you're in luxury like real luxury you know why there's nothing more

Start time: 490.60
End time: 492.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  luxurious than $1,149 iPhone X well that's what you know there are things

Start time: 497.04
End time: 520.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like bags that cost three fourth times that in those cases you know Louis Vuitton  bag or something like that I think in those cases scarcity is manufactured I  don't think it's the case for the tech products that we enjoy and I think that  those are completely you know there are their myths and especially happens as

Start time: 521.44
End time: 529.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with the switch or the 10 or with these new pixel twos when you've got a new  product not a not a refresh of the old product like the iPhone 8 but a totally

Start time: 530.02
End time: 536.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new product yeah and it's not easy to evaluate sorry go ahead Amy I was gonna

Start time: 536.74
End time: 608.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say I don't know that that's entirely true I because it's not just getting the  hardware out the door it's and you know the entire process and the whole funnel  has to scale right so given the problems that we've seen with some recent  products across everybody's different brands you know maybe people are taking  a little bit more of a measured approach I'm a cynic and you know part of me  thinks that holding off and manufacturing scarcity in order to  increase everybody's thirst and desire for these products which we have less  and less attention for because there's just more competition in the marketplace  seems like a viable reason to make it so difficult to purchase a phone but on the  other hand look at what happened with some of the most recent you know some of  the most recent launches Samsung's previous phone had problems and you know  if you suddenly got all of these people using a new phone with face recognition  that may or may not work exactly as promised you know and the pixel 2 having  potentially some screen issues I mean there there may be reasons to hold out  on the number of products that get released at one time I don't think if

Start time: 609.06
End time: 637.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple makes you know three million phones and some of them and they end up  not working is advertised it's not going to be a bigger issue than a smaller  issue than if they make 15 the difference is going to be they're going  to have you know X million less in the bank because they didn't sell as many I  mean for the switch I can guarantee you it's also kind of scarce but that is  because of the success of the console which is somewhat unexpected unexpected

Start time: 637.92
End time: 641.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah yeah but everybody knows how many iPhones Apple I mean Apple would make

Start time: 642.36
End time: 706.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  20 million iPhones if it could yeah I think whether it's manufactured or not  it's definitely made me more interested in these products so like you know the  SNES classic is a prime example it's a it's a device that I really don't want  there are there are better emulators out there there are better versions or  better ways to play Super Nintendo games as a collector's item I guess it's kind  of neat but for the most part it's like a product that I would never want the  scarcity has made me so intrigued by that it makes me really want to play the  lost Star Fox game that's that's featured on there and then also with the  with the iPhone 10 you know again it's it's something that I don't need at all  you know I already own an iPhone 7 it works just fine but the fact that people  are clamoring for this device that there's so much intrigue around the  thousand dollar phone and that it's already sold out and you know and that  delays might spill into next year I think that that makes me really interested  in in playing with the device or you know potentially owning well but you're

Start time: 706.80
End time: 740.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  also in the press so you measure that interest as well as and assume that  that's gonna carry over to Mashable right so you I mean I certainly consider  this if something is you know for instance I love the essential phone Andy  Rubin's little yeah phone and now it's $500 in fact if you can get somebody  with a friends and family it's $299 if you know somebody was stupid enough like  me to buy it at full price you can get it to $299 it's a great phone but they  sold $5,000 so why would we even cover it there's nobody wants it I mean they

Start time: 741.48
End time: 744.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have some issues to work out you know it's not a perfect phone there are some

Start time: 745.02
End time: 773.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  camera issues I think and no no no they're not that's a funny thing they  fixed the camera they pushed out three updates it is there is in no respect is  it an inadequate phone it's a for $500 with a snapdragon 835 of full bleed  screen in a tiny form factor titanium and ceramic it is in many respects a  flagship phone for $500 but it won't get any coverage because everybody's already

Start time: 773.20
End time: 786.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  decided yeah well it's essentially between just a couple of brands but I  think that essential also has the problem of only being available on  sprint in terms of the carriers that sell it you might be able to buy it I

Start time: 786.74
End time: 801.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bought it unlocked yeah I bought it unlocked but but you know you're right  there's other issues as well my point being editorially you're not likely to  spend any ink if you used ink covering it because well nobody cares anymore

Start time: 801.80
End time: 821.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's over and oh go ahead I was gonna say just so so why is everybody  clamoring for this phone the iPhone 10 yeah I mean what's the real why why are  all three of you excited about it that's a really interesting question about it

Start time: 824.30
End time: 829.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how else do we propel the consumer economy that's why okay that's question

Start time: 831.52
End time: 841.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  specifically who is actually excited about the iPhone 10 I'm not I'm not  super excited I'm gonna get it but it's not like you know I said obligation like

Start time: 842.16
End time: 847.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what was the reason that you purchased it then I have a success currently and I

Start time: 848.18
End time: 851.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  figured you know it's for work did you buy an eight you features and no I

Start time: 851.74
End time: 919.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  didn't I didn't so so by the way that's what looks like and it's you know nobody  Apple's not speaking but that's what it looks like anecdotally happened which is  that a lot Apple put out the eight and then a month later the ten announcing  at the same time and as you one almost would predict the eight didn't really  sell that well people waited for the ten and to answer your question I won't I  like Patrick could probably because we're tech journalists we have to do  this but so I'm not sure I would squat characterize myself as excited but the  world is excited and they're excited because it's the latest iPhone it's the  top-of-the-line iPhone and for the first time Apple's done some interesting  things like get rid of the fingerprint reader like a full bleed screen that is  OLED which Apple's never done before so there are some actually subject  objectively unusual and new features in it I wasn't excited about the iPhone 8  which is as far as I could tell a duplicate of the 7 with a few with a  faster processor in a you know few few bells and whistles I'm just wondering if

Start time: 919.94
End time: 968.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we've habituated ourselves to like in a Pavlovian way almost right right because  because because on the face of it the the features that are part of this of  the ten aren't really that groundbreaking aside for maybe the facial  recognition and I'm kind of surprised that everybody is so excited about  facial recognition without stopping to ask questions like okay well who owns  your face right like does Apple own your face from here on out you know how does  your hat where does the data go how is it being used I'm having a hard time  reconciling and unless it's just like we're it's like out of habit now we're  just excited because this is the latest announcement you know I think that's

Start time: 968.76
End time: 1032.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where that's where the intrigue comes from right it's like who you know there  are a lot of pieces of technology in the iPhone 10 that no one asked for but  they're being included and it's just it's about whether this is a fundamental  change to the way that we use our phones to the way that we pay for things on our  phones you know I think that that's where the interest in the intrigue lies  it's not necessarily will this phone sell as well as the the last one I think  it's if you look at like just even Google search terms over the past ten  years you know the iPhone continues to get more and more popular even just  based on search and and I think it's you know it's probably one of the most  easily identifiable products in the world and so yes the journalist it's  such an obvious story of intrigue because not only is it something that  makes a lot of money it's it's something that is radically different for the  first time in many years and I have a different definition of radical disagree

Start time: 1032.62
End time: 1076.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with that character I want to defend Michael it is so that's this kind of  what I was saying at the very beginning which is we've reached peak phone we  clearly reached peak phone a couple of years ago so now radically different is  things like you know OLED screen it's it's it or wireless charging which for  Apple is no home button recognition I mean those are two but when you that's  that's a measure of how how kind of mature this I think isn't it Michael a  measure how mature the technology is that these differences now become  radical differences I mean the iPhone 7 was radically different than the  BlackBerry it's it succeeded in my pocket yeah I don't you know this isn't

Start time: 1077.56
End time: 1139.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a technological it's not a qualification of like the technological breakthrough  it's just this phone will operate much differently than the phone that you  currently use so every time you open every time you look at your phone right  now you're using a thumbprint scanner most likely to unlock your phone in in  the case of the iPhone 10 that will fundamentally change because it will  open automatically and there are other elements like that that I think will  actually change the way that people are using their phones on a day-to-day basis  so like to me that's what I'm you know that's one of the most interesting  pieces of the iPhone 10 it's how like how deeply ingrained are some of these  habits and how quickly will we change them and adopt new ones and you know are  there privacy concerns about about the way that we begin to use our phones you  know we're trying to make it a little bit more seamless and and make  operations a little bit faster but in the process I think there are certainly  privacy concerns that are raised and and and here's yeah speaking of the Google

Start time: 1139.22
End time: 1183.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interest I've gone to Google trends till and I search for iPhone and this is over  a five-year trend and there are there are peaks every fall every of course  September there's a there's a peak although the last the biggest peak was  oddly two years ago I'm not or three years ago September 2014 that would have  been the iPhone the six six which was the first big iPhone and I think that's  probably the last time you could say that the iPhone was you know a  significant change the peak this year is not significantly higher than the peak  last year and there is a secondary peak which is happening right now of course  as people try to figure out whether they should buy the iPhone 10 just for some

Start time: 1183.60
End time: 1198.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  perspective go ahead Amy go ahead just just for some perspective so the facial  recognition technology that we are excited about here in the United States  has been in widespread use in China now for a while so Microsoft put it in the

Transcript:  connect which they just killed I mean this is three years ago it's the same  it's the prime says technology from Israel that Apple bought right right yes

Start time: 1207.70
End time: 1331.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so and there's you know lots of different China's so far ahead of us in a  lot of ways you know using your face to pay using your face for authentication  for all these you know all different sorts of things there are but China has  a very different attitude legally and culturally towards personal data that  data than we do in the United States so that's you know as we are sort of it may  feel as though we are embarking upon this brand new journey with with Apple  and for the first time discovering what it's like to do all of this with our  faces you know in reality we're pretty far behind Korea and China to begin  with the other thing that I would mention to Leo's excellent point about  reaching peak phone all of the modeling that I've done and I you know with data  would indicate that this is the beginning of the end of smartphones so  the what's next so devices so a combination of wearables that are on our  faces and are on our hands so glasses or sort of a like a headset that you that  you wear except it points to your eye rather than comes near your your your  mouth and a ring or wristband that goes along with it it's very likely based on  my modeling that in the year 2027 we will be at the beginning of AR so all of  the functionality that for the most part that we've got with our phones the  screens that we hold will be become the screens that we wear so it's lovely and  it's wonderful that iPhone is releasing the 10 and I hope everybody really enjoys it but I you know we are we are gonna see fewer and fewer true innovations on the phone front because the real news is that every company Google Facebook Apple they're pouring huge amounts of resources into AR and wearable AR so.

Start time: 1332.46
End time: 1370.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is I'm sure doing that as well yeah yeah yeah although you know.  It's it's one thing to say well the phone is going to go away but it's still here today so Apple I mean this is this is their big money you can also probably fairly say that while Apple's growth over the last 10 years is entirely powered by the iPhone that Apple can't expect that to continue forever so Apple's got to be thinking about.  What's next but meanwhile and this is the innovators dilemma they need to mine this gold mine as deep as they can until they run out of that seam runs out of gold while opening new seams in other areas.

Start time: 1371.26
End time: 1373.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1376.28

Transcript:  It's dopey have you played with it well you don't have an iPhone 8.  Every day it works it works on the iPhone anyway.  On the 6s as well.

Start time: 1390.10
End time: 1410.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right but that's today so yes all of this stuff is janky today but that's not the point the point is all of the investment and the capital like the capital investment and the work and the people who are being hired.  This is the end this is the beginning of the end of smartphones.  And what's the time frame do you think five years.  Where my models are 10 years.

Start time: 1410.70
End time: 1412.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So okay so you're looking in the distant future.

Start time: 1413.94
End time: 1416.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean well that's that's not my distant future but yes.

Start time: 1417.18
End time: 1421.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's funny because 10 years isn't long in humans but it's a it's a long time in technology.

Start time: 1422.78
End time: 1441.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know 10 years from now the iPhone 10 will be the flip phone of of 2027.  Right so there will be some people that still have smartphones which by today's measure are very sophisticated machines.  But that'll be a smaller group of people since we will have moved on to devices.

Start time: 1441.56
End time: 1447.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the real question for Apple is are they going to be the Blackberry.  That's a good question.  Years ago.

Start time: 1447.68
End time: 1510.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No I think that's that's why that's a slight mischaracterization it's because a lot of the technology that's used in the iPhone will be used in headsets so something like a depth sensor which is what is what enables.  Face ID something like that it's easy to imagine it in a headset like HoloLens or like any augmented reality headset but the but to me the reason why.  It's important to follow the tech technological side of this is because the same processors and accessories that are included in.  A mobile phone in this in the iPhone could be used for this next generation of stuff that you're talking about.  I I think it's probably farther away than 10 years just given the rate of innovation over the past five years that I've seen but.  So I'm a little bit more skeptical than you are that this will be adopted as quickly as you're saying but regardless the technology that's being used to sort of.  Push a lot of that forward is mobile technology it's all the stuff that's being used in the iPhone.

Start time: 1511.16
End time: 1547.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right I'm not saying one is in exchange of the other what I'm saying is.  I would expect to see fewer and fewer major innovations on mobile devices because the majority of time effort resources and everything else is being placed into what comes several years from now.  Right so it's fine you know obviously pay attention to the devices as they're being launched but.  All of the all of the data and modeling that you know I've got indicates pretty strongly that this is the beginning of the end which is fine.  Although yeah of course this is the nature of things in fact you hope technology moves along otherwise it get pretty dull around here.

Start time: 1548.42
End time: 1652.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's interesting what I think Apple and Google to to a certain degree are doing that's interesting is they are developing these next generation technologies.  Not merely in parallel with their existing technologies but kind of in for instance this as you pointed out Michael this this iPhone X.  Array of sensors in the notch here which is basically a connect is clearly.  In fact the way they're using it is the most trivial way possible they're using it for face ID it's not even being used for augmented reality if it were would be on the other side of the phone.  But you can imagine that the data that they get the information they get the skills they learn that for instance one of the problems with getting this out is these this Romeo and Juliet sensor pair.  They're having a hard time getting those out in quantity apparently credit rumors from the supply chain but that's the kinds of problems Apple's solving now so that down the road.  Same thing or Google with the Google Buds same thing they're developing and first of all they're getting the consumer market ready for the idea of wearables in your ear.  Or the Apple watch which is really until recently merely a glorified pedometer getting used to the idea of you wearing.  And then using the data that they gain in the and the skills they gain to further this right Amy so that's it's not they're not completely parallel tracks.  And so one of the reasons then to answer your original question why we might be excited about an iPhone X is this is a first look at some of these.  Which is being used in an admittedly trivial way but will be the precursor for something much more important.  So let's let's I would love to drill down on that because I'm so curious to know given what I've seen and how face recognition technology and not just face but object recognition and biometric and bioinformatic recognition is being used elsewhere in the world.

Transcript:  I'm really curious to know how the three of you plan to use face recognition and if you're concerned at all.  Now the biometrics interesting but I'll let you talk in a second I just want to say one thing about biometrics unlike other forms of authentication it's unchangeable.

Transcript:  Your iris pattern your fingerprint your face pattern are kind of permanent.  And so let me blow your mind yeah you're right your faces is hard to change unless you you do it intentionally with surgery.

Start time: 1691.74
End time: 1769.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah that's right but there's a way you know a lot of the foundation of artificial intelligence which underpins a lot of this technology.  Has been about teaching machines incorrect and correct and part of the way that we teach them correct from incorrect is introducing adversarial information so intentionally.  Incorrect and correct and part of the way that we teach them correct from incorrect is introducing adversarial information so intentionally introducing one teeny tiny thing that's wrong like a pixel.  But one thing that we've discovered is that your face may be a man immallible.  However, we get out a pixel through a line of malicious code to your face which effectively then hacks your face this is why I was asking like who owns your.  Like locks you out or with that right so and on the one hand it seems like bioinformatics and bio information is much better than two factor right or passwords or anything else because.  You can't you know it's hard to take your face off and and do something else with it unless you're in a sci fi film but what i'm trying to say is that there are plenty of ways using an algorithm.  And something simple like a pixel at a place that could lock you out of all of your devices.

Start time: 1783.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It introduces new risks, but it also eliminates a lot of other risks, so I mean I think in the spectrum of being secure versus unsecure it might not be the best choice, maybe a numeric you know an alpha numeric pin is still the safest.  But it's I think that like a lot of people are going to use it just because it's going to be really easy people don't use pins because it's too hard.

Start time: 1806.58
End time: 1821.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and that's why I thought touch ID and think it was was really that was an innovation, because it was so fast and easy and it did encourage people to secure their devices.  Most people did not secure their devices before touch ID they didn't want to do a pin it was too much of a pain in the butt.

Start time: 1822.44
End time: 1946.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think if people are comfortable with touch ID and with giving their information, you know whether or not apple or others are secure.  People are comfortable giving their fingerprint information to to those companies i'm not sure they're going to be I mean they're going to there's going to be a little bit more resistance for face faces but.  Not so much that it's going to get the technology to tank, but that being said, I do think I mean we have reached.  peak phone and all of you have said this in different ways, but the the technologies that we're seeing now are not as exciting as they were five years ago in the in the phone space.  And I think we're all sort of discounting another reason why we are quote unquote excited about the iPhone 10 and that's because it's just shinier you know it's a bit more expensive it's a bit different it's it doesn't matter really how it's different, you know I was referencing.  handbags at the beginning of the show, I think the iPhone 10 is kind of the slightly more exclusive.  handbag of phones and that aspect i'm not just saying this to be you know to put it down.  I think the fact that it is a little bit different more expensive whatever has value as well for people like us because.  Just as someone who likes handbags is not going to use that 4000 bucks handbag better than one that would cost a couple hundred bucks the fact that it's.  New and a little bit different is going to bring us joy, because we like tech right, so I think that is also a reason why we want that phone.  Regardless of whether or not it has all of that technology, I think we rationalize our desire for for those things a little bit with the face ID which, when you think of it.  Really is it going to be that different from touch ID do we like would I be unhappy with touch ID I don't think so it works fine and I don't even need to look at it to unlock my phone.

Transcript:  Right and that's my point my point is that.  It's a seamless interface and because it's a seamless easy to use interface lots of people will use it and, unfortunately, this is true of the United States it's certainly true of Scandinavia and of Europe.  Our government isn't you know governments don't keep up and keep the same pace with technology as technology would want right because it develops faster than our laws and regulations and regulators are able to think about it, and the problem is.  We don't have case law we haven't defined who owns your face right, so we have a technology that is going to rely on it, we have seen this go in into weird directions in China already i'll give you an example.  So in China, there is facial recognition technology and use in a lot of different cities and shangdong if you cross the street there are electronic billboards all over the place, and if you Jaywalk.  That image recognition is used to identify who you are and then your personal details are shown as a way to publicly name you oh my God they talk to you on a billboard they do and not just that then then.  Then right your face and your details and the fact that you Jaywalk is then sent out over Weibo.

Transcript:  So here's the deal.  I mean it's China.  Well, but it's okay, but this is my job is to is to use data to model out what are the implications not just like what.  Not to predict just like what tech is coming, but what are the second third fourth order implications.

Start time: 2045.48
End time: 2065.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's also this this, I think, even in the United States is assumption that anything that's gathered when you're in public is kind of public domain because you're you're you're walking around you're on the streets you so.  Now I admit that that society is starting to think about that is just because i'm in public, should you be able to take a picture of me, for instance.

Start time: 2066.54
End time: 2079.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and now, let me tell you how this plays out so we haven't quite figured out the who owns your face problem, but what we do know is that people are angry for various reasons all around the world and have started suing companies like Google and Apple and.

Start time: 2080.30
End time: 2091.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2092.00
End time: 2202.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or another way another term of art is splinter net so one of the things if we don't figure out you know.  Again it's we need to push the envelope forward on technology, but we also need to simultaneously think about the implications in the present.  Because we could very well end up with a sort of multiverse of internets where in Germany, you know that the that the worldwide free web suddenly.  You know, must also follow geographic boundaries and it's very possible that in the near future in like the next 10 years.  There will be a German version of the Internet and a Chinese version of the Internet and a United States version of an of the Internet and a Canadian version, you know, and so forth and so on, which yes, there are ways to get around and yes, you could theoretically still penetrate and get different versions by using.  You know, I I piece spoofers and stuff like that, but for the average person what that means is the way that information moves around is different. It means the way that you theoretically if you if you took your iPhone 10 into France that maybe the face recognition technology isn't legal there.  Yeah, I mean there are some real real important things to be thinking about.  While we marvel at the shiny new technology, that's all I'm saying and it's always better to try to think through this in advance and model out what those scenarios are rather than waiting for somebody to murder somebody and now somebody wants to backdoor into the phone so they can.  Scrape your face off, whatever it might be and suddenly we're all making decisions under significant duress and politicians are making these decisions for us and they don't know very much about technology and it's happening all over the world and you know it becomes very difficult.  How about this this article from a a futurist you may know Matt Rain and writes on medium about the who owns.

Start time: 2207.26

Transcript:  Who owns the picture of the house in some of the augmented reality apps allow you to put graffiti virtual graffiti on a wall.  Let's say you own a restaurant and somebody comes along writes this restaurant sucks.  I guess that's part of Facebook's plan. That's what one of the things that they announced at FAA.  They showed it.  Yeah, so is that I mean I guess that's not the right answer.  I mean there's there's definitely a lot of questions to be asked there and some of them are already being asked as you're saying Amy and the splintered internet is already happening.

Transcript:  I think so.  Thanks to the right to be forgotten has been heavily debated and we've all talked about it but some links are now required to be used.  To disappear from Google when you search for some things in France and some people would like it to be unavailable worldwide because of the you know the fact that if you go to Google.com for example you can still access that link so that's causing issues to a lot of people.  But what you're sort of saying Amy if we say it a different way is you would like you know the parliament to legislate on technology that hasn't even been that's kind of what you're implying.  I'm definitely not saying that.  I'm saying it differently.  No, no, no I'm not. I'm not. What I'm no because I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that.

Transcript:  Right right.  I have to think back.  Government of academics and smart cool geeky people running the universe.  Let's get that right now.  Right so so in absence of sort of one one government that rules the planet which we don't need or want we you know if each if we wind up at a legislative if we wind up legislating in every single different country we're going to wind up with all of these different laws anyways.  So I'm not proposing a legislative approach and that the United States and France and everybody figures out what their exact rules are.  What I am saying is we are using more and more technology and our data that we create using technology will itself become a natural resource in the very near future.  The people who use the technology don't fully understand the implications of its use and we aren't in any way shape or form prepared to have a conversation legally about.  Things like who owns your face and this just happened in the United States during the San Bernardino shooting there was all this back and forth about what the FBI and.  You know having a back door into the phone we you know legislation wouldn't have solved that issue so I'm not advocating for legislation or regulation however we don't have norms and standards and there's no.  Interoperability even at this point between countries on a lot of this stuff so.  Keep you know it's fine to keep working on the technology but we can't decouple what's happening in Silicon Valley from what happens in the consumer marketplace and what happens in our respective capitals all around the world.  There's gotta be there's gotta be people working together on all of this in advance.

Editor of tech for tep I don't know what you do at mash.  Deputy tech editor at Mashable.com how about that.  Nice thank you.  All right show today you'll know about this then if you're into tech at all you know the words Scott e vest I live i'm wearing Scottie vest underwear I have underwear with pockets right now I live in my Scottie vest jackets shirts pants technology clothing.  Designed for you we've been fans of Scottie vest forever in fact if you get a Scottie vest.  I think even to this day if you get a Scottie vest you'll find some pockets inside the pockets you find some cards.  With a picture of me wearing my Scottie vest we have twit fleeces which we love those fleeces are warm comfortable and as with all the Scottie vest clothing have strategically placed pockets.  Everybody who knows tech loves Scottie vests the best thing for travelers I wear my Scottie vest vest they actually do make vests with all the I think I have 26 pockets in my vest.  That means I this is a great trick to get through security and to avoid weight limits I loaded up i'll put lenses laptops ipads cameras phones everything in my Scottie vest.  And then when you get to the security you just put it on the conveyor belt that's fine they don't mind that you walk through nobody weighs your coat.  It's a great way to get all your gear with you so that you never lose it and I have to say the zippered pockets in the Scottie vest are great for protecting your wallet.  And the RFID blocking pocket is great for protecting your secret stuff whether it's keys or cards from snoops keep that passport free from high tech skimmers thieves.  Everything Scottie vest makes is great products for men and for women.  Some of the pockets are fantastic they have pockets for eyeglasses in fact my eyeglass pocket I love it has a little on a clip a little eyeglass chamois to clean my glasses I love that.  The personal area network links almost all the pockets to one another so you can keep your ipod or your iphone one pocket.  Work run the headphone wires through it have them come out at the neck you'll never get tangled again.  It is fantastic and they don't look blocky if you load them up I have to say you don't look like the Pillsbury Doughboy you just you know you're just carrying everything.  That you need whether you're a photographer a tech journalist or you just like to have a snack in your in your breast pocket at all times.  21 pockets in the fleece jacket removable sleeves heavyweight fleece that keeps you warm the quest vest has 42 pockets it's Teflon treated.  So it's water and stain resistant did I say that they have products for women too you bet some really nice looking stuff.  For women and men hoodies dresses and skirts even that have all the famous Scottie vest features it's the best way to travel I wouldn't I.  You see me on a plane I will be wearing a Scottie vest no question about it and if you've got a geek that you've got to get a gift for this is a great gift.  The geeks don't think about this sometimes but look at these these these believe it or not the Deborah dress this gets it's got.  hover I love these the the website because if you hover over the eye you can see where the hidden pockets are in all.  These in these outfits I love this Scott s c o t t e v e s t scottie vest.com and we've got a deal for you this is actually fantastic.

I know he's watching hi scott help a fella out go to scottie vest.com slash twit will save you 25% right now.  We're having some fun here I don't I don't know where to go next with this should I should we go for more controversy.  You're talking about the iPhone 10 I have to show you this.  Apple has you know in some ways become a fashion company and less of a technology company.  I know every time I say this it drives apple fans crazy and they say things like yeah well what about the a11 bionic chip or the amazing face recognition.  Okay fine but if you can't get your calculator to add one plus two plus three what good is that.  Right okay maybe they're a technology company but they are this is by the way this bug.  Which is well known in the iPhone is because of looks because of style because of the animation when you press the the the operator keys notice the fade in and fade out.  The problem with that is when you're hitting numbers if you don't pause for the fade in fade out.  They won't register properly see it did that right one plus two plus three equals six if I do it slowly but as soon as I go one plus two plus three.  21 wait a minute one plus two plus three 23.  That's I'm not doing it super fast either it's just a bug and now it's an easy bug to fix you merely interrupt the animation when the next operand is hit.  But they don't they don't seem to understand that I don't know they don't care this has been around for a while.  Apple's put out three updates to iOS 11 hasn't fixed it.

What if I say I'm going to add up five numbers on the Apple calculator and I do it carefully so I don't get in the errors.  But at one point one place I type it a little too fast and error is introduced that I will not see I will get the wrong answer.  If you're of course I understand it well don't do your taxes with the iPhone calculator then.

Transcript:  It's a problem because it's a manifestation of a of a shift at a company that had been producing world class best in class hardware for a very long time.  And I would argue that across we can we can argue all day long about this but some of the changes to the US some of the changes to.  Something stupid like keynote you know that for whatever reason design is being.  Functionality is being sacred sacrificed for design across a lot of the interfaces on Apple's products.  And I think that's that's that's a manifestation of an of a organizational problem internally within the company.  I'm stuff should look good certainly and we should all enjoy using it but if the functionality suffers.  And you know eventually you wind up talking about it with Leo in front of a world.

I mean these things happen I understand that's a bug which Intel patched and fixed I have to agree with Amy this is more this yes it's a bug.  But it's a bug that exposes an underlying flaw in how they're thinking about what they're doing.  It's not about functionality it's it's not about function anymore it's about form.  It's the Johnny I've ization of technology and I'm not sure I'm crazy about that.

Transcript:  Well this is one of the apps that's been around since the beginning.  And like you know I would also add that people who praised Apple for referencing Braun design on this calculator.  So it's something that sort of that's a good dare I say iconic I've used a lot of.  No but you're right it looks like a brown you're right I forgot about that.  Yeah so but but this is like one of the I would say most iconic apps on the iPhone because it's been around for so long.  And because it uses this this iconic I guess modern design.  And so it's just a little bit weird to see a flaw or a blemish of course anywhere on an iPhone.  But especially in something that has existed for so long that people have actually championed for a few years.  So I don't know yet it's definitely unusual to see things like that.  And I would say I notice more of them happening on iOS 11 than I have in years past.  So you know ever since I've updated my phone's been just acting really buggy.  Yeah there are lots of cosmetic errors in 11 I think.  Yeah exactly there's just a lot of inconsistencies.  And you know even on the 10 that you'll see inconsistencies you know when you mess with that phone.

Transcript:  Come on honestly you didn't do we need to go back to like mobile me and and.  No this is current Patrick this is current.  No but that's my point.  It was they did have significant issues in their design and in their software.  Way before this and they were much bigger.  I mean mobile me was a disaster.  iTunes has bloated forever.  We're talking about these now as if it was new.  They've always had significant issues.

Start time: 3222.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My position is that they've never been perfect.  All of a sudden now because you know.  But I don't I'm not seeing.  I mean maybe we would need a scientific study on this.  But I don't think I'm seeing more significant issues in the way Apple designs its software  or even hardware than there were 10 years ago or five years ago or 20 years ago.  And I you know we could lay out an entire list of gigantic blunders that either got  fixed or they they stuck to those to their guns in all of those years.  So yeah I'm skeptical about and maybe I've gotten used to being skeptical about oh now  Apple's going down the drain because this or that.  So maybe it's an automatic response for me.  But I'm still you know not sure that it's worse now than it's been before.

Start time: 3282.14
End time: 3330.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well MobileMe was a big huge gigantic blunder.  I guess what I have noticed is that the problems are more insidious.  They're more sort of less less of a massive catastrophe.  If we put MobileMe in the massive catastrophe realm.  More sort of like sprinkled throughout all their products.  And it just strikes me that design is being  preferenced over basic functionality.  And it makes me think that is anybody you know Apple used to be the user centered design  the human centered design you know capital right.  It makes me wonder if humans are still at the center of their are still the center of  gravity for them and the way that people use their devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know I would say that there have been design choices that certainly make the  application look crisper and I'll go back again to Keynote.  The new UI on the Keynote that came that shipped with High Sierra certainly looks good.  But a lot of but it's also not intuitive in any way.  And a lot of the core functionality and some of the key transitions just basic things either  got moved or removed.  And so one has to wonder you know what why sacrifice basic usability in exchange for looks.  Or it was that a conscious decision or is Apple maybe got folks over in the design shop that just  have more leverage and pull over the usability people who hopefully are testing products before  they go anywhere.  I don't know.

Start time: 3389.26
End time: 3400.20

Transcript:  So let's to make it fair Apple's not the only one having trouble with their flagship products.  This is the tweet that started it all from Alex Dobie at Andrews Android Central.  He showed a picture of his Pixel 2 XL after seven days of use and while you have to kind of look  hard there is burn in of the back home and recents buttons at the bottom you see the dock as well  burned into the screen and I've talked to many people now I talked to somebody yesterday who  got that on his brand new Pixel 2.  He took it out of the box and he saw it.  Google is taking this seriously people have contacted Google's support the guy I talked to  yesterday Google was willing to trade in the Pixel 2 for another one and yet another one after  other problems.  Here's the response from Google and Mario Cueroz who is their VP product management.  I think it was kind of I want you guys to parse this a little bit on me.  First of all there are two issues with the Pixel 2 XL.  Actually this one's the Pixel 2 as well as color accuracy.  A number of people including I think Marques Brownlee have complained that the color accuracy  the Pixel seems desaturated a little bit low quality.  Google's response to that is oh no well that's not a problem because you're just used to over bright  displays like say the Samsung and what we're doing is we're making a better looking more accurate  display and so your eyes are conditioned to you know these super bright displays.  You'll get used to it.  This is a high quality.  But then I've also seen posts from color experts who say no no I tested this phone with color  measurement hardware.  It's inaccurate.  So I'm thinking that some of the early at least Pixel 2's that came out have were not calibrated  at the factory as they're supposed to be.  That one you can fix.  That one's not the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that something you can calibrate after the fact or no?

Start time: 3544.35
End time: 3661.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah absolutely.  You can get a color profile.  It's hard to calibrate it accurately without hardware.  At the factory you have the hardware.  It's all automated.  You put a little screen sucker on.  Push some buttons.  It makes a profile.  You put it in the software.  The color will be accurate from then on.  It'll be sRGB which is what Google intends.  After the fact you're right it's a little more tricky because you don't have that hardware.  But you can.  I mean it depends on how consistent these screens are.  And if they're fairly consistent you can at least push out a more accurate color profile.  That's what by the way most companies do.  Windows doesn't have color management but companies like Apple that do.  I don't know if Apple on Mac OS has custom calibrated each display.  It gives you a generic I believe a generic color calibration that's pretty accurate for its displays.  And then you know if you want to go further you can.  That's less of an issue though than the biggest issue.  This burn-in which Google calls not burn-in but differential aging.  That's what you're seeing here on the panel.  Differential aging.  I'm aging a lot faster than you guys are.  Differential aging.  Now I understand what that means because it's an OLED screen.  And so the idea is that some of the pixels are burning in because they're wearing out faster than other pixels.  But after a week?  But after a week or no time at all?  That seems a little premature.  Mario says our current investigation of burn-in which started as soon as we received  the first user report on October 22nd confirms that the differential aging is in line with that  of other premium smartphones.  So that's defense one.  We're no worse than the other guys.  Not true.  And should not affect the normal day-to-day user experience of the Pixel 2 XL.  Well that's kind of subjective.  I think some users might say yeah I don't want that.  I paid a lot of money for this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think really where it would bother people is if you're watching videos and you start to see that.  I don't know.  I don't have mine yet.  Of course it's the first thing I'm going to look at.  The question is, is this a hardware flaw or well I guess it is a hardware flaw but can it be fixed in software?  They didn't use Samsung screens for the Pixel 2 XL.  They used LG screens.  Some of the complaints about the screen color and the graininess also apply to LG's V30 which uses the same panel.  I've been told I haven't verified this with Samsung but I've been told Samsung in its software on its OLED screens  nudges the always on screen controls a pixel left and right periodically to jitters them a little bit  to keep them from burning in.  That's perhaps something Google could do.  Google's response to this was to double their warranty to two years from one year  but if they can't fix the phone that's not much good either.  They say that they're going to I guess maybe fix this somehow with software or it says  we use software to safeguard the user experience and maximize the life of the OLED display and will make ongoing software updates to optimize further.  Unknown whether they can fix this.  That's going to be a big issue going forward with the Pixel 2 XL.

So my Samsung I love my Samsung but it is the screen is way too bright and even at the dimmest setting it's bright.  It doesn't need to be as bright as it is.

Transcript:  That sells phones by the way.  You know I mean that's the same thing with TVs.  You go in a showroom and see a TV.  In fact when I went to see the Pixel 2 at the Verizon store because they have them on display.  I noted that the both displays were turned up all the way because that sells the phone.  And of course the first thing you do when you get home is you turn it down.  Turn it down.

Transcript:  Yeah I mean I think that the Pixel 2 I want to like the Pixel phones more than I have.  So this is the second year where I've just been a little disappointed with the you know the rate of innovation on the phone and also.  Okay can you hear me?

Start time: 3874.36
End time: 3908.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh there we go okay.  That's okay.  I don't mind.  I apologize but the point being that that you know these phones have been hyped a lot but in fact their market share is tiny.  I think they own like less than less than 1% of the market share in the US and probably less globally.  And so yeah I mean I think that it's time to start considering whether the Google Pixel is a failure or just a disappointment.  But you know frankly it's just like it's not selling enough phones to compete with both Samsung and Apple.

Start time: 3909.38
End time: 3992.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're getting started though.  I mean that that press release or that article whatever it is is very strangely worded.  Honestly it seems like my interpretation would be there are only a few of those that have been highly publicized because of you know they were distributed to people in the press.  That's what I'm hoping for them and they will make it go away by replacing them and that's going to be it hopefully for them.  But regarding their success I think they're going very slowly at first because they're all in.  You know they're not selling it in France for example when they did sell the Nexus in France.  Interesting.  But they're because they're you know they're doing all of it themselves.  They're I think they're building teams, building relationships and they don't want to launch it internationally or you know more internationally.  If they don't have the proper teams because they are now a phone selling company as well.  So I think they're playing the long game here and I wouldn't judge their performance on the first couple of years because they've never really done this themselves before.  You know they they're developing chips, they're designing the phones themselves.

Start time: 4008.98
End time: 4028.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why I recommend it against other Android phones.  I mean here's the Note 8.  This has got the last patch on here is the August Google security patch on a Pixel phone.  It would be September and it will soon I mean it'd be October and it'll soon be November.  In other words this is three months behind.  For security points of view that's scary in Android land.

Start time: 4030.42
End time: 4043.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right and Samsung also comes with a bunch of bloatware that you know you don't need.  I will say this all of this sort of begs the question because Google has another phone project called Aura.  And Aura is a which was dropped by the way.

Transcript:  I think they were trying to launch something in the Philippines like a test market.  But no no after that they killed it.  That was a failure in September they killed it.  You know and it from my vantage point it was a pretty smart idea Motorola picked up on at least part of it.  So for those aren't familiar with it Aura it was a modular based phone.  So just like the old old school computers you know you would buy the sort of basic unit and then add different components to snap.  In and out so that you weren't having to recycle and renew your phone every couple of years you know.  But that you could you could add and exchange components and upgrade the phone that way.  Which again seems like a really smart idea.  So the question is if you take a sort of you know 40,000 foot view is you know can Google be a hardware company.  And I don't I don't have the answer to that.  It certainly looks as though they are trying to firmly establish themselves.  As a manufacturer of stuff.

Transcript:  Google's faced exactly the same problem Apple's faced with which is they have a singularly successful product.  In the case of Google is search and advertising based on search.  And they hope to have a follow up because they know that nothing lasts forever.  Just like Apple with the iPhone.  And that's why they've got Waymo.  That's why they've got hardware.  It's very hard to enter the hardware space.  Look at Microsoft's challenges.  Microsoft had made hardware all along but they made their first computers.  And they had all sorts of problems in the first year with the surface.  It is it's hard to do.  You think the idea now sent entry because I looked at the Aura.  And all I saw was oh that's going to be janky it's going to be rattly and loose.  I didn't and I think most end users said I don't I don't want to build my phone I just want to buy it.  I envy.  Well what's the problem is that the market has gone in the exact opposite direction.

Start time: 4177.84
End time: 4189.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know a lot of these phones are actually harder to open up and repair and replace.  That's true.  Than ever before.  Like even the Samsungs which famously had removable batteries for so many years.

Start time: 4192.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  Now they're they're completely closed systems.  So you know in the case of Google Samsung Apple and probably others that I'm forgetting.  You have a phone.  Oh the essential phone.  You know these are these are phones that are actually pretty difficult to open up and mess around.  Yeah.  And so although I loved the idea of Project Aura because you know in theory  it eliminates you waste it makes it easier to keep your same device over time.  I've been sort of you know really amazed at how willing people have been able to just like  buy a new phone every year and now it's going to be even more interesting with them costing  as much as they do with the Galaxy Note 8 reaching up into the thousand dollar price range and then  also with the iPhone 10.

Start time: 4237.26
End time: 4288.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that doesn't have to do the technology only.  I mean the reason that people are habituated to buying new phones every two years is because  you it is literally like I when I went to buy this phone I wanted to pay cash for it and just  buy it out and I it was like I couldn't I had to jump my my carriers AT&T.  I had to jump.  Would you ever want to do that Amy?  Well yeah but that's but the business models are predicated on our you know at least in the  United States throwing out perfectly good phones.  Right.  You know every couple of years.  It's horrible.  That's right so so the reason I would argue that the reason that are that a modular based system  hasn't yet taken off it has a lot to do also with the way that the contracts are structured  and the carriers.

Start time: 4288.88
End time: 4293.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh so it wasn't it wasn't end users that didn't want it it was the carriers that hated the idea.

Start time: 4293.56
End time: 4317.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never launched.  Now there is a Motorola version similar kind of version out that again people it hasn't taken  off now is the reason that it hasn't taken off because people don't understand the value of  being able to upgrade different parts of the phone and customize it as it sees fit or because  the majority of people still go into stores to purchase their equipment.

Transcript:  I so I'm going to I guess I'm going to try and disagree with every you know.  All three of us are bringing for Patrick.  Amy I think the real reason they're making really interesting finding interesting solutions  to that you know perceived jankiness of a modular phone.  They had the super strong magnets and a bunch of things that were really clever on project era.  But I think the real issue is that they're solving problems  that people don't want solutions to they don't care.  We have a really great parallel with computers nowadays.  You could make all of these same arguments for PCs and no one wants a desktop where you  can swap parts.  People want it's commoditized and everyone wants a laptop.

And also if you just look at modular gadgets across the board I mean they've never truly  caught on because consumers like things to be simple you know they value simplicity over  essentially everything else.

Transcript:  Okay let's take a little break.  We want to talk about outrage and since we did start talking about business we should  probably mention that the quarterly results were out for three of the big five and what a surprise.  They're just rolling and dough kids.  The tech industry is going great guns.  And what does that all mean?  We're not a business show but I think you know there's something to be said including  we're going to be talking to Scott Galloway about his book The Four either Friday, this Friday,  is it this Friday?  On triangulation.  And he's the professor at your school I think right?  He's at NYU.  Yeah yeah.  Who said that hey these guys better watch out because governments are going to start  to crack down on them.  They are monopolies.  And I'm not sure I agree with him but we can talk about are these companies too big, too powerful?  Farhad Manju has been talking about this.  He talks about the big five, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook.  Dominant in their respective fields.  At this point such strong incumbents they'd be hard to beat.  I think this is an interesting topic and it ties into those quarterly results which are  kind of confirming a little bit of that.  The famous Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote I thought a very interesting  piece in the nation.  America has a monopoly problem and it's huge.  We're dominated by large corporations in a way that has failed the many and enriched the few.  Food for thought but first we had a fun week on Twitter and we have made a very nice little  video.

We had this problem when you first start a business and you're giving your employees  phones or tablets or computers it's easy enough to keep track of them.  But as you grow and you buy more tech and it's harder to keep track of everyone's Mac  and iPhone and iPad devices just the other day John came up with an iPad.  We had no idea whose it was or more importantly how to unlock it.  Have we ever have we unlocked that week.  It's a nice iPad.  We don't know.  Darn it.  I wish we'd been using Jamf now.  Jamf now lets you secure a lost iPad.  It makes management tasks like deploying Wi-Fi passwords easier.  I am constantly asking Russell what's the Wi-Fi password constantly.  He could just push it out to my device secure company data  enforce pass codes.  It's very simple it's very affordable.

Jamf they've been around for a long time they're kind of the kings of managing Apple  workplaces and if you go to Jamf.com slash twit you can create your free Jamf now account  and manage your first three devices as I said free two dollars a month per additional device.  Jamf jamf.com slash twit Patrick BÃ©ja of the Phileas club is here.  So nice to see our favorite Frenchman.  Actually if I say that Cedric Engron is going to be mad at me  and I can call you our favorite.  I'll calm him down.  Our favorite it's funny I was in France last month and everywhere I went with Foursquare  Cedric had created the place.  He tends to do that.  You notice that now when I go places in Petaluma I created them.  You know they'll say you created this spot eight years ago on Foursquare  and thousands of people have logged in ever since.  Does anybody still use that Foursquare and Swarm?  Don't think so.  Yeah kind of a shame.  Did you see my Amazon look?  This is this is silly.  This is the silliest thing ever but it finally came.  First of all smaller than I thought.  It's an Amazon Echo with a camera and a flash attached to it.  And it doesn't have a much of a speaker such a small speaker.  You can't really hear what it's saying.  That's not its point.  But what you do with it you have to have a separate app called the look app.  And the idea and I'm going to do this I think is every day you get in front and you say Echo  take my picture and it goes boop boop boop and it flashes.  And then it takes your picture puts the date the weather.  And then it has this style check thing here.  So you could take this is what I'm wearing today and you could take an outfit that you  wore the other day.  This is not good for guys like me.  And I could say which outfit looks better and then it checks it.  It's unclear.  I think when Amazon first announced the look they said that the way it did it was they would.  So now they're going to notify me when the results are ready.  They would send this to a stylist because it doesn't happen right away.  And there would be a combination of computer intelligence and a stylist rating your outfits.  And then it's told me it's told me which outfits I should wear.  For instance for some reason unknown it recommends the frumpy sweater vest look  over the stylish suit jacket look.  Okay fine.  Yesterday I think this was correct it recommended the Hawaiian shirt minus the Hawaiian shirt  plus overcoat.  I don't know.  To me it looks but I'm going to do this every day from now on because at least I'll have a record  of what I wore.  If you're on TV.

Start time: 4947.50
End time: 4990.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well so let's think about why Amazon is doing this within the broader picture of these other  companies we've been talking about that are in the hardware business.  So Amazon is a platform right?  Amazon however is a platform that's gotten itself into the hardware business and is  but is in the hardware business in a very broad way.  So Amazon's also making sensors and they are helping.  I didn't know that.  Yeah or I don't know if they're physically manufacturing them but they have a program now  where they're helping mining or they're going to be helping mining companies optimize their roots  so that truck the trucks can you know get get more per gallon of you know mileage.

Start time: 4998.12
End time: 5104.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and it involves hardware and the reason I think this is so interesting is because  the next era of computing it will be powered and sort of predicated on artificial intelligence.  And what's so interesting about that within the context of what we were just talking about  those big companies you know are are there monopolies are the tech big tech companies  monopolies and if you haven't been looking at Farhad's really really good  columns about this and the times you absolutely should because he's making some really compelling  and interesting arguments.  But there are also there's also a monopoly in the AI space that we just don't sort of think about.  And there's nine big companies that control the fate and future of artificial intelligence  and they include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, IBM, and then I'm forgetting  somebody and then three companies in China Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu.  And the you know most of those companies are also getting them or Google sorry I didn't mention  Google but but by necessity almost they're also getting into the hardware space.  So you know is Amazon trying to be the style mecca of the future?  No you know probably not.  Are they trying to use our data in an interesting way so that we use the platform more you know  and ultimately we spend more money on their various services?  Yes right so a lot of the hardware that's that I think Amazon is producing  is just a different way to connect us to their platform and services where we'll spend money  which is a really interesting way of thinking about the work that they're doing and how it  connects to AI and sort of the motivation behind it.

Start time: 5105.40

Start time: 5268.26
End time: 5310.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the reason we think about them so much is that they're really big and extranational for us  and they also don't pay a lot of taxes in France so bringing it back to what you were saying  earlier Amy that personal data is going to be is a natural resource now there was a conversation  about taxing those companies not on the on the work that they do or on the money that they earn  but on the data that they use considering the data on French citizens a national resource that they  are mining and using and taxing them accordingly. It didn't go anywhere so far but it's being this

Start time: 5311.18
End time: 5347.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it was being discussed. One of Farhad's points is for instance if you're a startup forget about it.  This is one of his first articles on the frightful five how frightful five puts startups in a lose  lose situation and of course this is the power of monopoly. You don't have to have an actual  monopoly. I don't think any of these companies have an actual monopoly except maybe perhaps  Facebook and social media but then there's always Twitter and other stuff so none of them have an  actual monopoly but they have enough control and power. They're big enough that it becomes a real  problem to compete with them and maybe that's why we see so few interesting new startups these days.

Start time: 5347.68
End time: 5386.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all crap and it's even worse it's going to get worse. There was an article by John Evans on  TechCrunch a few days ago about the fact that the the future technologies like AI and self-driving  cars and AR and all of those require capital and data and that is something that is a lot less  available to smaller structures so the frightful five are going to be are basically have a strangle  hold on the future technologies as well. So that's definitely a concern. So that's so here's again

Transcript:  Private equity through direct investment and you know China historically doesn't play fair  so one of the ways you know they're not just investing because they're hoping for a 10x return  they're investing with stipulations that IP is shared because China has put part of its sovereign  wealth fund. I mean China is going all in. When a nation state invests in you they don't have the  same goals as an individual investor would have. That's right and at the moment we aren't quite sure  whether or not and how China's industrial policies now may or may not affect treaties  and economic agreements because it's very complicated.

Start time: 5489.70
End time: 5525.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cultural difference. It doesn't necessarily but what it does signal is China very much has that  culture of a community over individual. That's right. However and I lived in China for a while  too so that's actually it sounds very strange to us in the United States but it's not out of the  ordinary in China. But my point is that for people who care about America continuing to be one of  the if not the global economic superpower that could look very different as few as 15 years  from now. 10, 15, 20 years. Look the American century is over. Yeah the American century is

Transcript:  We're very good at that. All right so this week Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft all announced  spectacular earnings. They beat the street. The expectations that the analysts had that meant  their stock went up. In fact it made Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world again yet again.  He gained 10 billion dollars in his personal net worth. He's now night more almost 94 billion  dollars. Four billion dollars more than Bill Gates but that's not the story really. The story is  that these companies combined are worth two trillion dollars. They are incredibly powerful,  incredibly successful. Might as well add Intel which beat the street as well.  Actually that's kind of surprising since I don't think Intel is a big up and comer but Amazon  total revenue 43 billion dollars in three months. Amazon web service a four billion dollar business  per quarter. Alphabet revenue boosted by a surge of clicks on Google ads around the world  particularly in Asia. Microsoft beat estimates by a significant amount by about 12 cents a share.  These companies are getting bigger all the time. I have mixed feelings about Farhad's  frightful five point of view because it sounds a little bit like techno panic. We certainly get a  lot of benefits from these companies. Amazon, Facebook, Intel, not Intel, Microsoft. Why is  Intel even in there? Throw Intel out. Microsoft, Google and the Chinese companies you mentioned.  We get significant technological benefits from them. Should we be afraid? I don't know.  What do you think? You're on the ground. You're covering this stuff.

Transcript:  Well, I mean it's complicated. I think that the reason why I got into technology journalism was  because 10 to 15 years ago this stuff looked really exciting when MySpace was still around  and social media was still in its infancy. Web 2.0 was sort of a new thing.

Start time: 5722.70
End time: 5726.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5728.80
End time: 5777.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, now we're in the twilight zone. Essentially, these companies that were  really young and exciting and were introducing all of these new ideas and new ways of thinking  into our daily lives ended up growing so big that they have this inordinate amount of influence and  this inordinate amount of power. I think to Amy's point, there has to be some element of regulation  in lockstep with the growth of these companies and with the growth of this technology. The problem is  that right now in government, antitrust is just not even a concept that I don't think anyone thinks  about ever at this point. There are so many other fires to put out. I like how Sprint said,

Start time: 5781.80
End time: 5880.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think there's very little corporate oversight at this point. These companies that  were already gigantic are growing even bigger. I don't think people realize how bad things could  be in the near future. Something as simple as net neutrality. You brought up this merger.  That's a huge deal and it could actually cost consumers a lot. There are so many different  nodes to attack as a smart consumer and as an active citizen. There are so many battles that  we need to fight when it comes to the relationship between government and technology that it gets  hard to pick any one. We can talk about net neutrality. We can talk about privacy issues,  whether the government should be able to snoop through your text messages or not.  There are so many layers to what's going on right now. I think what I'm seeing is that the  technology is rapidly outpacing the government's ability to regulate any of this stuff. I guess  you just have to do what you want with that information. There seems to be no end in sight  with especially these big tech companies. They're posting record profits and record revenues  on what seems to be a regular basis. These companies have made several billionaires  and several millionaires. I just don't see an end in sight, to be totally honest.

Start time: 5880.96
End time: 5973.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're certainly a concern and I think people shouldn't take their eyes off of them. But  the reality is they're all more or less competing with one another. So while they are gigantic,  there is an element of competition. I'm very concerned about them. Don't get me wrong. I  don't want to make excuses. But I think it's less of an immediate concern than maybe something to  make sure you don't take your eye off in the next close time, like one, two, three years.  But if you want to talk about tech monopoly issues, I think the real problem you guys have in the US  is what you were referring to, ISPs. That is a horrible monopoly abuse and it's having very  real consequences because you don't have the infrastructure outside of some cities,  not even all cities. You don't have the infrastructure that you need in order to  get the whole country to benefit from the internet. If you don't have decent internet connection,  then your town, region, countryside, whatever is not going to develop today. It's just not going  to happen. And the stranglehold that your ISPs have on the infrastructure is damaging the country.  If you want to talk about monopolies and tech, that's where people should be looking at.

Start time: 5973.50
End time: 5992.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really good point. That is a mess. And in fact, we're seeing very increased ingression from the  big ISPs, the Comcast, AT&T and Verizon against municipal Wi-Fi. They're actively suing, they're  pursuing legislative agendas to keep cities from creating their own Wi-Fi in areas where they're

Start time: 5992.74
End time: 6062.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not well served. It is a very aggressive... That is outrageous. And I have in Finland here  an example of the government is actually subsidizing to an extent the development of  municipal communal associative ISP development. And so we have one village where my wife's family  has their house that got that dug fiber from like 20 kilometers away, maybe even more to the next  town over. And that got a tiny village connected against the better efforts of the incumbent ISPs.  But because the government was supporting them, they managed to do it. And now you have fiber  in the middle of nowhere. And people, if they wish to do that, they can go and work from  those tiny villages that are dying in all over the world. And if you don't have that,  it's not going to happen. Who is going to go work in any small town that doesn't have fiber today?

Start time: 6062.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and to kind of bring it back to the earlier conversation, then you see a company like Facebook  propose something like internet.org, which brings an internet to developing nations, to underserved  communities. But it's a special kind of internet. It's Facebook's internet. And it isn't the free  and open internet. Talk about the splintering of the internet. Yeah. Ben Thompson always astute  writes in stritechary about Facebook in this regard. They are, of course, acquiring now a very  popular, I never heard of it, but it's a student social network called TBH, which of course is the  acronym for, to be honest, it's a polling system that students use 5 million downloads, two and a  half million daily active users. And Ben says the FTC needs to step in and not let Facebook acquire.  He says they should have stepped in when Facebook tried to acquire WhatsApp and Instagram,  because essentially Facebook's strategy is the minute any social network threatens Facebook,  acquire it. Like they weren't able to copy it. If they can't acquire it, they tried to acquire  Snapchat and couldn't. So they made sure Instagram was a Snapchat clone. And in fact, Instagram seems  to have stolen some of Snapchat's thunder, at least with an older audience. He says this is a failure  of the federal government to block this kind of thing. But maybe because he's based in Taiwan,  but I don't know if he understands how unlikely it is, at least under the current regime,  that we're going to see any intervention at all in this kind of thing. Certainly not an acquisition

Start time: 6169.06
End time: 6199.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of a small company like TBH. It isn't just the current regime. So I think one of the  great failings of our various government agencies is that we don't have enough...  In a lot of ways, first of all, nobody is planning out far in advance. There's no  substantive data-driven long-term planning. In part, that's because we got Newt Gingrich  in the 90s defunded the agency that was responsible for doing that. It was called

Start time: 6199.92

Start time: 6203.94
End time: 6282.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people, the legislators understand technology. It was non-partisan. It became the gold standard  around the world and all kinds of countries everywhere else have had that office modeled off  of ours. So what we're left with is a group of rotating commissioners who are political appointees  and the USPTO, the Patent and Trademark Office. Unfortunately, a lot of the future of our technology  now is being decided by whoever happens to be the commissioner du jour in those offices who  don't have, I think, enough... There aren't enough restrictions on how quickly those people can go  back and work in the private sector and the lobbying that they can do after the fact or  before the fact. So then there's kind of a revolving door. I will say this, I am a capitalist.  I believe everybody should make money. I believe everybody should have the ability to make money.  But I also think that the interests of Silicon Valley butt up against, necessarily, because they  are commercial entities, that they rub up against the long-term interests of democracy in a lot of

Start time: 6282.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  It's fine. It's not a value judgment. It's just like, they are companies that are  publicly traded. So they have different interests than the FTC and the FCC.  Absolutely. They're profit focused.  That's right. And those two agencies don't have enough sort of long-term... They are looking at...  First of all, they don't quite get what a lot of these companies do. And they don't really have the  non-partisan people who are there, who can help them make informed decisions. And ultimately,  the commissioners come and go. And they come and go back to the private sector,  where there are commercial interests in play. So...

Transcript:  Here's one of the things...  Just to be a contrarian for a second.  Sure, Patrick. Go ahead.  Just to be a contrarian for just a second. And let's put it like that. I'm a socialist. I come  from a socialist country, not in the sense that you understand socialism. But France is certainly  on the left end of the political spectrum, if you want to look at the world. Well, the Western world.  But even with everything you're describing, which I agree is very concerning,  the reality is that the tech sector in America has not only outperformed every other tech sector  in the world, but basically driven the world very successfully into beneficial revolutions  in those areas. And they're all American. All... Well, yeah, mostly American and all in the  Silicon Valley. I feel like I need to say it because it seems like it can't be a random  chance, right? That system has spawned those giants that were so successful.

Start time: 6415.78
End time: 6647.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. That was the premise, really, at the beginning of the conversation, is we get great  benefits from Silicon Valley. But maybe it's time for some judicious intervention. Just,  for instance, one of the things Ben says, if the FTC wanted to, and they won't do this,  but it would be great if they made a condition on the acquisition of TBH that Facebook be open up  the social graph. So one of the things that is the case is that all social networks kind of lock in  your friend list. You can't export your friend list from Facebook to another network. Instagram  launched off the back of Twitter. Many of networks launched off the back of Twitter,  but of course, the minute Facebook acquired it, it shut that down. And all social networks  have long since made social graph portability impossible, he writes, making it much more  difficult for competitors to arise. There are things, there are tweaks, I think you'd agree,  Patrick, that government could make not to disassemble these giant companies. I don't think  that's proper either, but to make them a little more societally aware in the face of profits.  Hold that thought, Amy. I want to take a break because we're behind. This is such a good  conversation. It's such a great panel. I want to keep going. Amy Webb is here, futurist from Future  Today Institute, also the author of The Signals Are Talking, Patrick BÃ©ja from the Fillius Club,  and Le Rendezvous Tech, and from Mashable, deputy tech editor Michael Nunez. We're talking today  about backup, Carbonite backup. You've heard the name before. I've talked about Carbonite for more  than a decade. I've used Carbonite for that long for home or office. But I want you to take a look  at the new Carbonite website because it's a new Carbonite. They have really evolved into so much  more than just a backup, an online cloud backup service. They are really the data protection  experts. You'll see that in the new website. You'll see that they've expanded. They've acquired  companies like DoubleTake and Evol to give you more high availability options to create a data  platform, a data protection platform that supports all of your business. For instance,  keeping you from being locked in any particular cloud, making it easy to move your data around.  Solutions for high availability in a business where downtime is not an option. You can get back  in seconds. Endpoint backup, migration, server backup. It's all there at Carbonite. There's a  plan for you, whether it's just a single computer in your home or your big servers in your data  center. Yes, data center backup and disaster recovery. They do it all. I want to encourage  you to visit Carbonite. If you want to try the individual solutions, just make sure you use the  offer code TWIT to get two months free if you decide to buy. If you're running a big enterprise  or a medium or small enterprise and you can't afford to lose that very important data that runs  your business, if you want complete protection, all kinds of solutions including disaster recovery  as a service, I want you to rethink Carbonite. Carbonite.com. They've got the solutions  for you, including their hybrid backup solutions powered by Evault. I love them. Carbonite.com.  And if you do want to do the free trial, use the offer code TWIT just to let them know you heard  about it here. You got to back it up to get it back. Do it right with the data protection specialists.  Carbonite.com. Amy Webb, you started. I hope you didn't forget what we were talking about.

We have, as Patrick pointed out,  the innovation that came out of Silicon Valley has powered not just American innovation, but the world.  And my suggestion is that's fine. I don't want to ignore that. I don't want to throw out the  baby with the bath water. We need these companies, but we also, it's appropriate, I think, for  judicious governmental regulation to make sure it's an even, fair playing field and innovation

As with any technology,  the easier it is for us to use something, the closer that it resembles magic, the sort of less  we think about it. And that's what Arthur C. Clark would say is the point, right? Any, if the  technology is like magic because it works well and we don't even have to think about it, then  that's great. And we're going to use it. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable  from magic. Right. However, we need to, we, you know, and I'm defining we very broadly here,  but I think we all need to spend a little bit more time thinking about how that magic trick works.  How did they do the magic? Which is not to say that we all need to go learn how to make a deep  neural network or something like that. But this sort of Delta is widening between  us, us consumers and us givers of our data and the companies that ultimately mine, you know,  harvest and refine it and, and, and, you know, use it. And as a result of that,  you know, I just wonder that this analogy doesn't quite fit, but almost in the same way that we  establish national parks is a way to preserve land. I'm wondering if there's like a national  park solution for our data. Like, is there a way for me to somehow either retain all ownership and  rights of my data. So if I'm using somebody else's platform, I still own, and I know that you can  download your data afterwards, but that's not the same downloading. It is not the same thing as owning  it. Right. Because I don't get to see how Russian botnets or something looked at my data when they  were on, on Facebook. Right. So I'm just wondering, is there a way for me to have sort of portable  ownership ability or some control over my data? Or if not, you know, maybe there's some kind of  governance structure where everybody who's putting data into the system has some say  in how that data is being used. Now, you could argue that that will complete, that could completely  slow down innovation. It's too complicated. You know, there's all kinds of arguments against it,  but there is no denying that we are getting further and further away from the sort of core  of how our technology works. And that's important because the more that we press forward with AI,  and as we move from AI, artificial neuro intelligence to artificial  general intelligence, and all of the technologies and everything else that go along with it,  one of the challenges is, you know, to me, it's concerning because we have fewer and fewer people  making decisions about what the future of our technology looks like. The corpus, like the  data sets that are being used, the algorithms that are used, that use that data. And it's like,  we're sort of getting further and further removed. So the National Park illustration doesn't quite  fit, but it's in that vein. I'm just wondering if there's a way for us to truly own our data.  And if not, then let's all give up our data, but get something more meaningful in return,  aside from the ability to put a stupid avatar on our Snapchat,  whatever's for these five minutes before something else comes up.

Transcript:  Exactly. Basically, it's forcefully making every company care about privacy and data and protecting  the data. Does it give us our data back? Does it give us control of it?  Not so much. It restricts the use of data that I know of. I'm not an expert on this issue.

But the irony of this,  I'm sorry, I can't find the article, but it was really interesting. Basically, the irony is that  it further entrenches companies like Facebook and Google that already have all of the data and the  social graphs and all of those, because those are much more difficult to be shared now. So it's  really hard for another company to come up with those social graphs and clever uses of our data,  because they can't acquire them as easily. And so this basically, starting with a good intention,  might end up furthering the power of those huge companies.  Interesting.  So I don't know.

Transcript:  It requires just a couple of the bullet points, the highlights. It requires consent for data,  explicit consent for data collected and information about how it will be used,  protects children. There will be a data protection officer who will monitor this. The GDPR requires  something called pseudonymization, which is basically anonymizing data. Encryption is an  example of pseudonymization. Data breach notifications are required. That's something  we don't have in the US. We sure ought to have. The right to be forgotten is incorporated in it  as well, although it's a more limited right to erasure, which isn't quite as  sweeping. Data portability, just like we were talking about, you should be able to transfer  your personal data from one system to another without being prevented from doing so. I like  this. Data protection by design and by default. So much in the US, we get things like Equifax,  who decides to protect your data after it's already been released to the wild.  All of these things seem like good things, and yet I think there's considerable concern,  certainly in the United States among these big corporations, about GDPR and how to implement it  and whether it's going to be burdensome. Of course it'll be burdensome. But the burden is on us.

I have a Tesla and I love the fact that the Tesla can, whatever, auto park works and the pilot  function works. I don't know exactly how every single component of the car works, but I'm very  invested in learning every single thing that I can about every single update, which is different  than me just getting in the car and turning on autopilot and going somewhere.

And I understand I'm talking to mostly American audience and going against what I  was sort of implying by again being a contrarian earlier. But this is the only way these things  work if you don't have the government, which by the way is by design. This is not going to be  popular in the U.S., but it is representing the common interest of the people as opposed to private  companies. Yeah, here in the U.S. it might work the other way. I agree with you. Amazon, here's a

Start time: 7201.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good one. What do you think about this? Amazon wants to offer a service that lets the delivery  person inside your house, because here's the problem in the United States. Packages get stolen  off of porches all the time. It's a big problem. So it's only currently available in areas where  Amazon does the delivery. They're not going to let the UPS or FedEx or the postal service driver in  your house. And you have to spend $250 on a special door lock and the cloud cam, a special camera,  because they want a camera watching the guy or gal as they make the delivery. But if you're  willing to spend that $250, then you don't have to worry about packages on your doorstep anymore.

Start time: 7241.76
End time: 7253.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And collecting, I don't think surveilling every single thing that we're doing,  but Amazon is this, absolutely one of the smartest companies that we track when it comes to understand  very, very clever use of data. Very clever use of data. This whole thing with the  trucks that I mentioned and coal, I don't think that Amazon is trying to get into the logistics  business specifically to help coal miners. Isn't it more possible or probable that Amazon assumes  that, or it's trying to build itself into the company that will sort of be the cloud for all  of the various connected car companies? All of these car manufacturers have promised  self-driving fleets, but Ford doesn't have its own cloud server where it's able to process all

End time: 7354.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. So, isn't it possible... So, every time Amazon launches something new, in the back  of my mind, I treat all of these product launches as weak signals. And weak signals are what  futurists use to sort of spot patterns. So, is this really about making it so that fewer people  steal your packages? I don't think so. To me, this is a weak signal that's indicating...  Same thing with the look. Yeah. Same thing with the look. And what we don't know,

Start time: 7354.32
End time: 7387.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's not our business and we're not data scientists, is how these little bits of data,  how valuable they can be. You might say, well, Amazon knows when you got a delivery and whether  you were home and who cares? But what I think is we just don't understand the great value of  gathering this massive data has and the interesting, unique ways they can be used.  This is... I mean, Amazon doesn't want to help me choose what outfit to wear.  There's no percentage in that. It's clear they're up to something.

Start time: 7389.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a marginal benefit to the company for the Amazon key thing and for the look and for  all of those. But certainly, the data is... I mean, it's the gold and the fuel and the petrol,  the next version of that. And it keeps coming back, right? For AI, which is going to... Well,  deep learning and AI, which are going to power everything, you need data. If you don't have the  data, it just doesn't work. And so, that's something that I think we should be more aware of. You're  very right, Amy, at least in the tech industry. Tech media isn't aware enough of this,  the importance of data. Look at this. To do the Carbonite ad,

Start time: 7438.34
End time: 7608.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to the Carbonite website to show the Carbonite website. And now when I read this story  about Amazon Key on the verge, I get a Carbonite ad. This is a perfect example. That wouldn't have  been there two clicks ago, but it's a perfect example of how... And this is from Google.  How Google... And I'm using the Microsoft Edge browser, but the circle is like this, of data  coming and going and flowing. And in this case, it's just showing me an ad of something I'm already  shown and interested in. That's not a bad thing. Yet, it just shows you how free flowing this  information is. Google wasn't involved in that transaction, yet they know exactly where I went,  and they are in fact putting up an ad key to what I went. All right, let's take one more break.  We got to get one more ad in, and then I have a couple of lightweight things, because I don't  want to end on a deep, heavy, profound note. I'd like to end on a fun note. How about that?  Although this is kind of heavy, and maybe I should do this first. Roger Stone got banned from  Twitter. Twitter, which announced a calendar of new rules, is apparently taking them seriously.  Roger Stone, who is a very outspoken... In fact, you've got to see the documentary,  Get Me Roger Stone, fella, has decided over the weekend that Don Lemon at CNN was the devil  incarnate, and a series of vicious tweets, including saying he should be punished,  have gotten his account banished. Roger Stone has been suspended. Twitter is not saying if  this is permanent, but his account is suspended. Stone immediately took to tweeting from the Roger  Stone documentary movie account. So there apparently is a loophole. In fact, we've known  this all along. You can always create a new account. So Stone says he's hired one of the  best telecommunications lawyers in the country and will sue Twitter if it's not clear whether  there are legal grounds to do so. He's pretty litigious. He'll probably do it anyway.  Yeah, he sues no matter what, right? Yeah. And he says, I've been inundated on Twitter,  and this is not a bad point with bloggers threatening to kill me, my wife, my kids,  even my dogs. Twitter seems unconcerned about that. So the battle rages. The battle rages.  And one more story for Facebook, and we'll probably talk about this on Wednesday with  Jeff Jarvis because he's our journalism guru. Facebook is apparently testing,  keeping publishers' articles out of the stream unless they pay for it. This is not in the US yet.  It's in six countries. They're taking content from publishers and businesses out of the newsfeed.  Those posts will exist in the explore feed unless the publisher pays for placement in the newsfeed.

Start time: 7610.30
End time: 7622.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So remember when Facebook was a place to find...  Publish your newspaper?  ...news from your friends and family and stuff like that?

Start time: 7622.34
End time: 7644.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it became a place for Washington Post and Wall Street Journal to put articles.  This is a tweet from somebody, but he's talking about the drop in organic reach,  pages of four times less interactions in countries where the feed has been modified.  You just could see the drop.

Start time: 7645.70
End time: 7660.92

Start time: 7661.26
End time: 7675.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7689.50
End time: 7751.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's why. Because about a year ago, I admonished... It doesn't matter.  I was speaking at a conference after writing some stuff and I said,  news organizations have no longer controlled the means for distribution,  so everybody should get together and decide nobody's publishing anything on Facebook.  Then Facebook will just be a wasteland of friends and family posts and stuff that nobody wants to  read. They were reluctant to do that. Now, just anecdotally, we did a study  to try to figure out how much of Facebook's UI is dependent upon quality journalism.  It turns out there's quite a bit of it.  Oh, really? Oh, interesting.  Yeah. What I'm trying to figure out is what net benefit is there to Facebook?  Obviously, they know what their leverage is right now, but news organizations are so strapped,  if they forced news organizations to pay, which they can't really do, then what's their end game?  I can't figure out what... What do you guys think? Why would they be doing that?

Start time: 7754.40
End time: 7795.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just not going to take away the ads. That's the reason why they... The way they put it  in the article is basically they force you to pay in order for you to appear on people's feeds  as if that was a strategy to encourage people to pay more. I think the strategy is to make the  feeds more personal, but at the same time, they're not going to turn away the ad money.  That would mean there's no more revenue for Facebook. They keep the ads in there.  It's a test, but yeah.

Start time: 7795.60
End time: 7799.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know. I think there's something else going on.

Start time: 7800.12
End time: 7907.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that for the past decade or a little more than that, I guess,  Facebook has made a lot of publications basically addicted to the Facebook news feed as a source of  distribution. I can't blame them for trying to collect on that addiction, because this is  a necessity for actually a lot of the largest publishers in the US, probably even in the world.  It's really easy for Facebook to basically just flip a switch and ultimately hurt the bottom line  for these companies. Already, a lot of the biggest publishers in New York, let's say,  are spending thousands of dollars on Facebook to promote certain stories and to promote certain  social media campaigns on a monthly basis. I think it's safe to say.  I would just see this as Facebook sort of... I think that, of course, they're looking to charge  publishers for distribution, because this is one of the biggest use cases for the network right now.  People are publishing less original content, and therefore, Facebook's relying on publishers for a  lot of that content. One way that you can quickly increase revenue is by making those publishers pay  to have their content seen, because a lot of them already are doing a version of that, which is  paying a smaller amount to have certain stories promoted and boosted a little bit. It's the same  model, but just applied in a different way, in my opinion. Matthew Inman, the cartoonist at The

What happened?  Well, Facebook. Actually, follow me over there. It'll be easier for us to reach each other  where we're at now. Hey, I made some new stuff. Can you show it to my followers?  Facebook's closed the door and says, boost this post. The irony is he posted that cartoon on  Facebook. Then Facebook said, get more likes, comments, and shares. This post is performing  better than 95% of the other posts on your page. Boost this post for $2,000 to reach up to 490,000  people. I get those all the time. I get them all the time, too. It's kind of ironic. I love it.

Transcript:  Let's take a break. Final thoughts in just a moment with a great panel. Really fun today.  Michael Nunez, he's Deputy Tech Editor at Mashable, joining us from Brooklyn, New York.  Amy Webb, joining us from DC. She's the author of The Signals are Talking, a great book on  futurists and how they work. She's also a futurist herself, as you probably can tell from her astute  insights. Patrick BÃ©jar, our favorite Frenchman, at least one of them, from the Fillius Club.  And of course, Le Rendez-vous Tech. Our show today brought to you by,  appropriate for a Frenchman visiting us, Wine by Blue Apron. We know Blue Apron. We talked about  Blue Apron, the number one food delivery company in the country, packaging wonderful ingredients  with great recipes to make a delicious dinner. Now you can expand your wine palette with Blue  Apron's wine boxes. With Blue Apron, no wine leftovers because their bottles are a little  bit smaller, which is nice because I always have leftover wine in a regular size bottle.  Lisa and I open up a bottle of Blue Apron wine. It's delicious. It's wonderful. They  curate a great collection. Great way to de-stress in the evening but not wake up with a hangover  the next morning. Perfectly sized for two to share over a lovely weeknight meal, a Blue Apron meal,  I hope. Ten dollars a bottle. That's half the price of what you'd find in the store  because of course they go to the source. They deliver it directly from the winery,  eliminating the costs of a middleman. Six new wines monthly from all over. Napa, our favorites  are Bordeaux's. We've had some wonderful Bordeaux's from Blue Apron. You customize the box, of course,  with the styles and varieties you love. And Blue Apron includes custom tasting notes. So just as  Blue Apron has taught us all how to cook great new recipes and ingredients, they're now going to make  wine fun by giving you the who, the what, the where of every wine they send. I love this and we're  going to get you 25 dollars off your first wine box by going to blueapron.com slash twit wine.  We've been doing this for some time. In fact, I think I remember that we convinced them  that they should talk about the wine. For a long time we were talking about the food, of course.  We love our Blue Apron boxes. And Lisa said, you know, you really ought to tell people about this  wine thing. It's fantastic. Blueapron.com slash twit wine. Perfectly sized wines with custom  tasting notes helping you to discover fabulous new flavors. Blueapron.com slash twit wine. As always,  Blue Apron, a better way to cook and now a better way to imbibe. Convince them to launch in Europe.  I want this. Oh, you need this in Europe. You need this. Yes.

You put the  condiments on the meat, then you... No, you put the cheese on the meat, the condiments on top of the  cheese, and then the lettuce. Anyway, for some reason, bizarrely, Google's emoji features the  cheese on the bottom. Now, I know this is not the end of the world, but apparently Sundar Pichai  thinks so. The CEO of Google has tweeted after Thomas Beekdol tweeted, I think we need to have  a discussion on how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger while  Apple puts it on the top. Sundar tweets, we'll drop everything else we are doing in a dress on  Monday if folks could agree on a correct way to do this. Now, are you going to tell me it's okay

Here's Facebook's cheeseburger  emojis compared to Facebook Messenger's and Caspar Klipchin points out, hey, Dave Marcus,  you need to put more sesame seeds on the messenger bun. There's only three on the mess...  But David then responds, those are poppy seeds, but our cheese is excellent. And on and on and on.  Cheese always goes on top so it can melt. Sundar. I mean, also, by the way, while you're at it,  this is not how beer works. And that actually, I think it makes an excellent point. The foam  is on top of the mug, but there's this air gap between the top of the beer and the foam. Google,  go home, you're drunk. That's not how beer works.

Transcript:  So he's got a diagram. Apparently, Katie Couric got involved in this as well.  This is crazy. You know what? The smaller, the less important, the less relevant the topic,  the easier it is for anybody to have an opinion. And I think that's what's going on. And by the way,  somebody responded to a Google image search, which seems like that should be definitive.  Apparently, the person responsible for Google's new emojis is a vegetarian teetotaler,  according to Damien Perz. We may never solve this conundrum, but I'll be watching with interest  tomorrow to see if Google fixes this problem. Yes, it is.

Transcript:  I really hope they fix, they change their emoji based on this Twitter thread.  Twitter certainly has a lot of influence in very important things in the world. It's nice that also  sometimes some ridiculous thing happens and becomes a thing. It seems like it happened like this  all the time a few years ago. And nowadays, it's only horrible horrors that happen on Twitter.  I like that the emoji burger thing became a thing and everyone's jumping in on it.

Transcript:  Well, a couple of things. First of all, Patrick was already taken, which is completely  anecdotal in the reasoning. The real reason is that it is a brilliant marketing move.  You hear it once and you never forget it. Not Patrick. He is for the English Language Podcast,

My good friend, glad to have you back. Please come back anytime from Mashable, where he is the  Deputy Tech Editor, Mr. Michael Nunez. Michael, you held that microphone like a  champ for two and a half hours. Thanks for hanging in there with me.  I definitely appreciate the invitation. We'll send you a headset you don't have to hold on to  from now on. That'd be great.  Thank you all for joining us. We do This Week in Tech every Sunday afternoon. Really, it's fun  every week to get together with just the best people and talk about what's going on, try to  understand it in a deeper way than the daily headlines. You can join us around about 3pm  Pacific, 6pm Eastern Time. That's 2200 UTC. We'll be for one more week and then the Daylight  Saving Times ends and we'll be at 2300 UTC, but we'll talk about that next week.  If you can't watch live, and by the way, if you are here live watching Twitter.tv slash live or  live stream, please join us in the chat room at irc.twit.tv. Great bunch of people in there.  The background chatter helps you. Basically, they write all my jokes. It's very, very helpful  if you come and write jokes for me at irc.twit.tv. You can also be in house. We have some great  visitors from all over the world. If you want to visit, just email tickets at twit.tv so we  know you're coming. We love having people from all over who listen to the show come visit us,  like Toshi who visits from Japan, Srinivas who's from Mumbai, India visiting today from  Boston, Massachusetts, Bob and from Boulder, Colorado. Steve, great to have you guys here.  Just email tickets at twit.tv. We would love to have you in the studio with us.  If you can't watch live or be here live, you can always get on demand of all of our shows  easily enough at the website, twit.tv, or subscribe in your favorite podcatcher.  That way you'll get every episode. It's getting to be a lot like the end of the year. I can't  believe it. We're already starting to talk about the end of the year. We're putting together our  Best of episodes for all of our Twitch shows. We would love your help. It's easy if you remember  a moment that you really, you know, oh, that was great. Whether it was thought provoking or funny  or just weird, go to twit.tv slash best of and give us whatever information you know about it.  Even if you just say, hey, that time when they did that with the thing and the thing on the head,  that was a great time. Even that will be helpful because our editors have to work hard to comb  through 52 weeks of shows to put together the Best of. We'll have that at the end of the year.  I think it'll be our New Year's Day show, right? Is it New Year's Eve or New Year's Day on the  last Sunday of the year? twit.tv slash best of. Thanks everybody for being here. It's great to see  you. Come back again next week, will you? But for now, another Twitch is in the can. Bye bye.
