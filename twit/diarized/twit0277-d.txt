Start time: 184.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's do then. Level 3 Communications issued a statement beginning of last week,  around Monday, saying that Comcast was going to block them if they didn't pay up. And they  should be having a peering arrangement between the two. Peering, if you don't know, means  that I send you a bunch of traffic, you send me a bunch of traffic, we call it even because  we're both big players on the internet. Comcast says no, level 3, mostly because they have  a deal with Netflix, is going to send us a lot more traffic than we're sending back to  them. This is not a peering agreement. This is a... What would you call it, Chris? They're  trying to say it's a transit agreement or an interconnection agreement?

Start time: 227.16
End time: 251.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I think it's actually technically still peering. It's not settlement free peering  anymore, which is, will be the change. And there's a lot of facts that are in dispute  still. And actually probably will remain that way for a long time because there's no real  mechanism of resolving this. It's a somewhat new problem that's arisen in terms of how  things have been traditionally done and apparently how they'll be done from here on out.

Start time: 251.56
End time: 266.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the FCC says they're going to look at this. Comcast says this is just level 3 trying to  get by without paying for stuff. Level 3 says no, this is Comcast trying to put a squeeze  and make people pay twice for something. What do you think, John?

Start time: 267.46
End time: 328.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, let's get to the basics here. Comcast sees Netflix as a threat to its basic  business, which is selling movies on pay-per-view. Very similar to what Netflix does. And if  you have a Comcast account, there's all these opportunities to rent movies exactly the same  way Netflix offers them. And they are of the opinion, I can imagine how somebody could  get to this perspective, they're of the opinion that, golly, we give these people this great  bandwidth and then they're screwing us by taking advantage of it. Because something  up to 20% of all internet traffic during the TV watching hours is supposed to die. I don't  believe this totally, but they keep saying it.  I've heard that stat.  Which is 20% of all internet traffic during TV viewing hours is Netflix. And so Comcast  sees it as an infringement on their basic business model and they don't see any reason  why they, if they don't have to let them have the traffic, why should they? At least they're  not throttling it.  Yet.  Yet.  Yet.  Well, that's a good point.

Start time: 328.42
End time: 359.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gets a little more complicated, I think. And I think one of the interesting things  that we can say here is that even if Comcast is acting on its best behavior and that this  is inevitable, that they would have to charge level three, that even then it has a really  broad consequences for the future of internet video. Because Comcast customers will always  be guided then towards Comcast selection, the fancast rather than Netflix. And so Netflix  will always have a disadvantage relative to Comcast.

Start time: 360.80
End time: 397.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think there's no question that level three did come at Comcast with  a much greater than expected traffic proposition kind of all of a sudden. And I buy that they  were able to negotiate a good deal with Netflix by promising potentially a price that they  couldn't deliver knowing that they had this traffic sharing agreement or peering agreement  with Comcast. But there's no question that Comcast wouldn't probably be responding this  way if it weren't Netflix traffic we were talking about. And there's also no question  that Netflix or Comcast is in a really dangerous position in terms of putting down the hammer  and saying we're not going to carry your traffic because people don't have the competition  to go elsewhere if they do that.

Start time: 397.40
End time: 458.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think you brought up an interesting point and I think that what you  say is possible that there's something because generally speaking with these sorts of news  stories, there's something missing from the from the story we don't know about. And it's  quite likely that Comcast, you know, got wind of these guys, probably like you said, promising  more than they can deliver and in the process having to deliver more than they or I'm sorry,  deliver what they promised, they have to screw Comcast. Comcast then decides that, you know,  they got wind of it or there's back there's some back channeling going on. They say this  is ridiculous. These guys can't do that. Well, let's just charge them. I mean, I'm convinced  that there's a not to defend Comcast, which is Comcastic, by the way. But by definition,  it's I'm not completely thinking that the toll is long. There may not be a bad guy element  here. I mean, maybe trying to defend themselves against some some nefarious dealing by the  other guys. I mean, I'm not totally, you know, jump on Comcast evil doers.

Start time: 458.48
End time: 485.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is something where Comcast was is trying to move and make a and make a big change.  This is obviously the worst time for them to do it. And so for me, that's one of the  best pieces of evidence to suggest that, that probably it is a pretty gray issue. It's fairly  nuanced. There's no bad guy. But I have to say that I think the consequences are pretty  dire. And so it has to be dealt with intelligently. And I'm glad the FCC is getting involved.  We'll see how it gets resolved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to personally because I don't want to do this. Are you going to personally  listen to the C-SPAN testimony because you know it's going to be on C-SPAN?

Start time: 494.94
End time: 518.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually most of my most of my work really focuses on local and state levels.  We follow the FCC when we have to. But what I want to say is that is that right now all  these peering arrangements are done in secret. No one has any idea what's going on. And it's  only probably because Comcast is in the limelight with this merger with NBC that level three  decided to try and make it a public issue would be my guess because they thought that  it would help their their ends.

Start time: 519.86
End time: 559.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, from what I understand what Comcast reacted to was level three said we need about  26 more connections. And they said, well, we can give you six in our current peering  arrangement and level three said and we'd have to charge you to do the do the rest of  them. And that's when level three freaked out. Now, I'm wondering if we if if this was not  Comcast, if this was a different ISP that didn't have a cable television service and didn't.  I don't know if there's any of those left, frankly, but it's going to say that in some  imaginary world where it was just an ISP without a conflict of interest. Chris, do you do you  have a sense of what would be the normal reaction? Why haven't we ever seen this kind of  dispute before?

Start time: 561.08
End time: 617.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a question that I can I'll jump at and I'll do my best to answer. But I'll  tell you, my expertise is not in this. So the way I would look at it is that it seems to  me Comcast would be benefiting from having a direct connection here. The worst thing  that could happen to Comcast is if they had to pay someone to get access to Netflix content,  because me, I'm a Comcast user. I want to watch Netflix. I watch a lot of Netflix. And  there's millions others like me. And so if Comcast has to pay someone else to get access,  that that would be the worst scenario for Comcast to get it for free seems like a decent  scenario because someone's going to be delivering that content to Comcast somehow. So in my  mind, there's got to be facts here that we just aren't privy to. And it may just be a  case of both sides just trying to use this the public limelight to get an edge in their  negotiations. But again, I just think it's the worst time for Comcast to do this.

Start time: 618.69
End time: 654.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a really bad time for Comcast to be, I mean, I can only assume right that negotiations  must have gotten to a pretty ugly place for level three to take this step. Like, it's  pretty bold for level three to come out and issue a press release and say Comcast, you  know, say in essence, Comcast is violating net neutrality. And whether it's true or not,  like it seems like it was clearly an exaggeration on the part of level three, but it's such a  bold move and such a kind of bizarre public action given like you said that most of these  peering agreements are conducted in secret, that it really does make you wonder how hard  was the ball that Comcast was actually playing here?

Start time: 655.68
End time: 722.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And actually my interest is mostly in local community fiber networks, citywide  networks. And what I'd be interested in also is if level three has all this power of Netflix,  do they have the ability to just force any smaller provider to do what they want? And  so I don't know enough about these agreements to really go further in that. But I think  there's some real issues in terms of the market power of the players involved. And  I really hope we can just talk briefly about this post. I don't know if someone could put  it in the chat room, but you found a blog post from an ISP called IP House, which put  some numbers to this and I think really was was well written. IP House is a provider here  in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, and they're terrific people. And they know a lot about  peering, obviously, because that's what they do. And one of the things that they pointed  out was that you cannot route around Comcast to provide the requested content to Comcast  subscribers. And so a lot of the peering agreements typically are more sort of two networks that  are exchanging backbone traffic as opposed to one network delivering it directly to the  subscribers. So that's another area in which this is different and why I think the FCC  is getting involved rather than just saying work it out amongst yourselves.

Start time: 723.72
End time: 743.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to thank Kendrick Erickson here who sent me that link. It was a really eye opening  link from IP House. But what I want to know is if Level 3 said, no, we're not going to  pay you Comcast, would there be no way for a Comcast subscriber to receive that traffic?  It couldn't come some other way?  It should be able to go around the horn.  Yeah.

Start time: 744.34
End time: 781.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I feel but it does seem like this blog post is saying that they can't and that  that is what caused Level 3 to raise the alarm in the first place. So that even though they  may have raised an exaggerated alarm, they were in a position where Comcast was saying,  OK, well, we're not going to, you know, I would say to my three year old, then all right,  I'm not going to carry your traffic, which is like a pretty terrifying concept because  you have to admit that however this ends up in the future, Comcast is a company that's  very familiar with and comfortable with the idea of offering content packages to its subscribers.  And there's no, you know, there's no reason to think that they don't down the line really  want to offer that in terms of internet service too.

Start time: 782.74
End time: 827.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it could turn into a cable vision sort of situation like we had with the baseball  in terms of and I think it was Fox. And the question is, who's going to blink first, right?  So if Level 3 and Comcast have this fight and Comcast won't allow our subscribers,  me to get my Netflix content, the question is who blinks first? I'm not switching to  anyone else. Comcast is the only one that offers real broadband in my area of the world.  And Netflix clearly would be losing a lot if it loses access to millions of customers.  And so I think that would be terrible for everyone. The only way that I would think  that if Comcast is not going to accept peering from Level 3, if they fight about this, would  be if Level 3 was sending it across another network that is peering to Comcast, which  would be just totally inefficient and really defeat the purpose of the CDN to begin with.

Start time: 828.84
End time: 851.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Okay. So it could be possible, but it would not be ideal.  It might be herky-jerk.  Yeah. Level 3 has already agreed to pay, as I understand it too. So I'm not sure with  all of this putting out of the facts and the press releases, are they just hoping to get  legislative action or they just want to embarrass Comcast? I'm not sure what result they're looking for.

Start time: 852.18
End time: 878.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're probably trying to force some legislative action and also to shine the light  on the NBC merger because that content delivery conflict of interest is just going to keep coming  up. I feel like there's no question that that is a scary issue for anybody who's doing business  with Comcast. It's got to be scary for Netflix. And I suspect that they were just trying to kind  of keep that pending merger in the spotlight as much as they could. And hopefully get the  SEC to just go ahead and reclassify broadband too, just as a happy surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a sidelight.

Start time: 881.86
End time: 894.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a terrible precedent for the future of Level 3 if this is what they want to move into is CDN,  presumably with more than just Netflix. So I think they want to resolve it and try and get back to  an arrangement where they have a free peering arrangement.

Start time: 895.96
End time: 907.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Monroe in the chat room says they could peer with public peering locations, but it would  not work well with that load that Netflix delivers. That's kind of the key there.  All right. Well, by the way, I have a solution for the whole thing.  You do? What's the solution, John?

Start time: 908.02

Transcript:  We'll pay you money, Comcast, but we're going to soil your deal for NBC.  What is that going to close?  Well, it's never going to close now.

Transcript:  Facebook is overhauling their profile pages. There's an interview with Mark Zuckerberg  on this evening's 60 Minutes where they'll be going over this. It's Zuckerberg's first  appearance on TV since the release of the social network movie. It looks like the overhauled  profile pages will be interesting. They're going to have photos elevated up to the top,  added icons to all of your interests so it's more visual. Your vital statistics,  things like your relationship and your job and your hometown are all up at the top.  It's a more readable situation.  The most interesting thing to me about this is they're letting you opt in. Instead of doing what  they've always done in the past, which is just pile it on you and force you into it,  they're saying, you know what? You want to go into it and go to this URL?

I'm horrified when  I see all these commercials that pop up and say their Facebook address of a company rather than  the www, the internet address. I think it gives Facebook way too much power over what people are  seeing and doing on the internet. So when Facebook gets savvy and starts doing things better, I sort  of grow more fearful for the future of the internet.

And there's some formatting, like if you format a special letter. So there is some  government formatting that includes the secrecy level and maybe like who it's addressed to and  a special government salutation and all of that kind of makes it like a cable instead of an email.

Transcript:  It's illegal. And it is arguably, I mean, the rightful freak out thing has kind of shifted in  my mind because arguably this has become a little bit of a free speech issue, maybe a big one,  because WikiLeaks, you could argue that the Wall Street Journal never had the right to publish any  of the Watergate stuff that it got, but it has long been protected speech to even if you received  the Washington Post.  The Washington Post, sorry, thanks. Even if you received the material, the material itself was  obtained illegally. You still have the right to publish it in theory. And we don't know that.  And nobody's been accused of any crime.  I don't see anybody filing any papers.  Web-wide censorship.

We're giving  you 24 hour notice to move your DNS somewhere else. WikiLeaks didn't move it. And so the URL  went down. But the fact of the matter is you can mirror this thing all over the place. It's being  mirrored everywhere. So it's not like even if that was malicious, that you can really stop the signal

Wasn't there actually a network, a dark network called Freenet or  Freenode or something people were talking about 10 years ago that was specifically supposed to  solve this problem where it would be, you'd have all this information that was more or less hosted  anonymously on everyone who was participating and the government couldn't track it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this has become a really weird story and one that I feel sort of uncomfortable with because I don't  want to have to be on the WikiLeaks side because I think what they did is sort of unnecessary. It's  kind of, it falls into that just because you can doesn't mean you know, Carl Burns, but it's not  damaging and it's not illegal. And they have now become the subject of a full on witch hunt that  I think is going to prove down the road, especially if laws get passed as a result,

First of all,  Carl Bernstein, I think he was on one of the shows, talk shows, and he, I think he was one  of the few guys in the media. The media was all crazy. Carl Bernstein said, Hey, look, we're  journalists. This is like a goldmine of material. Why would we want to reject it? And, and, and,  and condemn it when it's like there's stuff here for us. And apparently they, they,

And, and, and said, look, help us figure out what names need to be redacted  here. We want to be responsible about, about this. And they, they allowed those publications  to publish things and then they simultaneously published the leaks. So this was done in

And, but what's funny is, of course, The Guardian,  which is a communist newspaper by all intents and purposes out of England, they just piled on. I  mean, they're just like, I mean, they're the ones that if you want to, anybody out there wants to  read the good gossip, it's in The Guardian. I mean, they just barreled into it. What isn't that?

Transcript:  What I want to see is, is with the, it's what they had to do with the Bank of America stuff, because  it seems like they've taken all this heat and they may disappear because of a bunch of cables that  really aren't that interesting and they don't have a smoking gun. But apparently they claim they have  a whole lot of really interesting stuff from Bank of America, perhaps other corporations and banks  that have done real damage and may actually help us understand what went wrong a little bit better  and that exactly these people knew what they were doing. And so I don't want to see, you know,  Julian Assange disappear before we actually get this new problem. Yeah, he disappeared.

Start time: 1656.18
End time: 1673.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, yeah, he did just the other day. He disappeared.  It just doesn't make sense to me that everybody and their sister hasn't shorted the Bank of America.  It just seems like an obvious thing to do. And if the WikiLeaks thing never appears and you buy in  at the low, I mean, it just doesn't make sense to me that this isn't a stock market manipulation.

And there was a bit of  an uproar, but we didn't have anyone taking them down. We didn't have PayPal withdrawing their  support. We didn't have all of this controversy about it. Now we have a leak that is mostly about  gossip, but it involves politicians instead of the military. And now WikiLeaks is on the run.  I mean, it seems pretty clear to me. That shows you who's dangerous, who's more dangerous.

Start time: 1738.32
End time: 1758.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait till the banks get a hold. I mean, if you think that, you know, it's ratcheted up. First,  the military, which says, okay, whatever, it doesn't mean anything to me. And then it went to  the politicians who got all bent out of shape and made the media condemn the guy. Now the bankers,  this guy's showing up dead left and right. Go watch the movie, The International, if you want to see  what the international banking scene is like, even though it's a movie. But those guys are

Start time: 1758.54
End time: 1787.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more dangerous than these other people. But let's also remember why WikiLeaks is on the run right  now. And it's because of the companies they've depended on to get their information out. There's  no real alternative, it seems like. And you have both PayPal and Amazon that seem to have these  acceptable use policies that were similar to what I understood as Soviet law, which was that  everything was illegal so that they could arrest you when they wanted to. And in this case, it  seems like everything's against acceptable use so they can kick you off when they want to.

Transcript:  There's laws that protect whistleblowing, which is leaking stuff. So that's not true.  The fact of the matter is we have a bunch of spineless corporate executives. That's face reality.  We're talking about a bunch of jellyfish out there that run these companies and they pull the plug on  stuff left and right as fast as they can so they don't get in trouble because they're afraid that  their easy income is going to go down the tubes because they don't know, they don't get it.

Start time: 1871.56
End time: 1897.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when this stuff was first published, I was like, really you guys? But the fact is free speech is  often uncomfortable and frankly, at its best, it should be. And the fact that these companies,  like you said, John, are running in terror at the slightest, at the tiniest little staffer phone call  from Joe Lieberman's office is scary stuff. And Joe Lieberman is actually proposing legislation.  God knows if it's going to pass, but if it does, it will have an utterly chilling.

Start time: 1898.90
End time: 1912.14

Start time: 1917.26
End time: 1962.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, in today's paranoid climate. The other thing, there is one thing I think that we can say  that a positive in terms of government wanting to discourage these sort of leaks, which is  there's a real danger, I think, in terms of the future of a person that's giving advice to the  government, whether it's from the private sector or two people in the public sector conferring,  if they are afraid that those words will be later disclosed, because sometimes candidate advice is  not popular. And if there's a culture of fear that anything you say will can show up the next week  on the internet, then you will start having bad advice given or no advice given. And so  from a policy perspective, there is a problem with just publishing all these stupid little  documents as opposed to ones that are actually important, like the Pentagon papers, which are

Start time: 1962.38
End time: 1986.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  brought up frequently in this context. Well, that's true, John, you made the  crack about Britney Spears, but a lot of these stories that are being put out are not any  level above that. It's just put a diplomat's name instead of Britney Spears. It's the same story.  Graduate students are being warned away from admitting they've read the leaked memos,  the leaked cables. What? The White House is forbidding a lot of federal departments from

Start time: 1986.98
End time: 2036.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reading them. They're blocking them. That's just terrible. I have a master's in public policy.  A lot of my friends went through difficult situations applying for jobs, the state and  federal governments. And to be honest, it horrifies me that they would put this sort of additional  burden on people that they shouldn't ever use their computer to go to a site that has something  like this. Especially because I actually think these documents, though I just argued that they  probably shouldn't be released when they're so meaningless, can actually be helpful for students  trying to understand how these decisions are made and how the government actually works.  It's incredibly difficult to understand how our government works, believe it or not.  And so the idea of being able to see this as a student when you have time to just mull through  it and see how these decisions are made, it actually can be interesting. And so if anyone  should be reading it, it seems to me like maybe students should. It's unbelievable. It's starting

Start time: 2036.68
End time: 2047.14

And then all of a sudden it became a trendy thing. So everybody started writing and designing  viruses. And then every hacker in the world came out of the woodwork. I mean, if this thing went  crazy and you had a bunch of kids that were just hacking in the government computers and doing all  kinds of nutty stuff, which is would be totally illegal and then spreading it all over the place,  like crazy, you'd really have an interesting situation on your hands.

But my understanding is, is it's been several weeks since WikiLeaks has stopped  accepting new data because in the words of the founder, their, their collecting of data was  increasing exponentially and their ability to verify and do anything with it was increasing  linearly.

They've got an event announced, but I want to, I want to thank our sponsor, Ford, makers of the  2011 Ford Edge. I got to drive around in a Ford Edge. My brother and sister, or my brother-in-law  and my sister were in town for Thanksgiving and they rented one. Smooth lines, fluid aerodynamic  shape. Instrument panel is very, very nice. Door trim, floor console, best in class,  second row leg room. I can attest to that. I've got long legs. I could sit back there.  My nephew's got even longer legs these days. He could sit back there. And ambient lighting that  you can choose. You can choose the lighting that fits your mood. That was interesting when we were  in the car and I didn't realize this, but then Ben, my nephew says, turn it to Comet Blue, which  Comets is the name of the high school team in Greenville where he lives. And so there were  actually a couple of blues you can choose from. So you can, you can change that instrument panel.  They have unbeatable V6 highway fuel efficiency, best in class 27 highway miles per gallon. Edge is  also available in a high performance edge sport, which offers even more horsepower and 280 foot  pounds of torque. The 2011 Ford Edge also features Ford's My Touch. Connects you to your vehicle in  new and intuitive ways. You've heard us talk about Ford voice activated sync. That's the voice control  part of touch. There's also three touchscreen LCDs providing information or there are three LCD  screens providing information. And there's one eight inch touchscreen in the center stack,  two five way switch pads on the steering wheel. If you haven't, if you're in the market for a car  and you haven't driven one, go, go try a test drive, drive a Ford 2011 Ford Edge. And if you'd  like a free test drive in Madrid, Spain, you can go to twitfordfocus.com and upload a video explaining  why you would want to win and why you think $10,000 should be donated to a charity of your choice.  Just make that video, keep it concise and upload it at twitfordfocus.com. You could win a trip to  Madrid for a test drive of the Ford Edge, as well as the National Institute for Aero, at the National  Institute for Aerospace Technology. They make rockets there, you know. So check it out,  twitfordfocus.com and go check out a 2011 Ford Edge. All right. Google is going to launch something  on December 7th. This is a, this is a auspicious day for many reasons. It's obviously it's Pearl  Harbor Day, but it's also the launch of World of Warcraft Cataclysm. There's another conference  going on, D-Mobile something is going on and Chrome is now going to have an announcement  December 7th at 10 30 a.m. in San Francisco. Two main bets, it's going to be either a Chrome OS  update, probably not a netbook. They said they wouldn't have one of those till after the first  of the year, but either a new version of Chrome OS or the Chrome Store where you can buy web apps.  Which do you think it's going to be? I think it'd be the Chrome Store. It seems more likely  since they're not going to have the netbook. You agree, Molly? Yeah, I think it's going to be the

And then someone else comes out with a new  browser, Chrome, and it goes really fast because there's not a lot in it. And you start saying,  how can we add more things to this? And you're right.

I don't think Netscape  people thought about this to begin with, but then Gates says, oh, they're going to take over the  world because Andreessen made some casual comment.

Everything is a bad idea. Okay. So let's take Chrome OS out of the equation just for a  second. Chrome browser launches with a web app store. Let's say that's what we get. It seems to  be the most likely scenario. Is that any better of an idea? A web app store? No, I'm not into this

You say you design  something. You have to go through the Google web app store to distribute it when you can just have  a crappy web page that you could put on with WordPress.com. It makes no sense.

Transcript:  Molly, can you think of one, Chris? Well, yes. I mean, I think right now,  web apps, I think right now apps in general are a stopgap until the actual web experience catches  up to or gets a lot better in terms of the interfaces that we're all starting to use.  Right now, there isn't a good touch interface kind of system for using the web. The web isn't  touch friendly. The web isn't Google TV friendly because you don't have, I don't know, voice  controls or it's annoying to use a keyboard with your television. And so I think apps are kind of  the halfway house between the HTML5 and the web experience catching up to these new kind of class  of always on, always connected devices. And so, okay, give me a web app store right now because  I want something that is more focused than the web at large, faster and streamlined for my device.  I just don't want that to become the dominant paradigm forever.

But that doesn't, the way I remember them unveiling this when they talked about it before was  it was a store and you had to download something and a lot of them you had to pay for.

End time: 2778.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  I don't think it was bogus, though, because everybody else is doing this. Amazon put that  money into whatever that one, the LiveLocal thing, the same thing. But no, everyone is  getting into a way to try to localize search results and localize reviews. So there's no  question that Google should want something like this. Maybe they didn't want to pay that  much in the end. I cannot see Groupon being like, $6 billion? I don't think so.

Start time: 2818.47
End time: 2835.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  What?  I heard some good reasons why Google would want to have a company with a huge local sales  staff that could help out with AdSense.  Yeah, they had something like 3,500 salespeople locally.  Yeah. And Google doesn't have very many salespeople. They kind of rely on AdSense  to just work on its own.

Start time: 2836.08
End time: 2853.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Amazon invested $175 million in LivingSocial. eBay bought some other company that does  Milo.com, which also does niche localized searching. So everybody in Google space is  starting to play in the local playground.

End time: 2862.34

Start time: 2862.48
End time: 2884.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to go along that line of thinking, there's also the possibility  because we've seen Google do this before. Try to bid something up to make some sucker,  AKA Microsoft, come in and overspend on something that Google really didn't want in the first  place. And I think this may have been like one of those deals where you have the dollar bill  hooked to a little fish line and you throw it out there, see if Microsoft tries to pick it up,  you pull it away.

Start time: 2885.76

Transcript:  Does it just $6 billion for Groupon? I think everybody agreed that that was just an outrageous  amount of money for this company, at least right now. Is this a sign that there is a bubble in  venture capital in investing?

Start time: 2898.34
End time: 2925.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's pent up demand because nobody can do an IPO because the Sarbanes Oxley.  Hey, I bring it up when I can. He's the one who set me up with a slow pitch.  So nobody can do an IPO. And so you got all these people, they got money, they want to invest,  they want to throw it at companies and they cancel. They have to buy these companies because  these companies can't go public and get some money to grow. It's ruining the economy. It's  ruining the country. It's ruining the business. We're screwed because of this.

Start time: 2927.06
End time: 2954.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's a venture bubble though, too. I think there's a way everybody's over relying  now on purchasing smaller companies to build up your portfolio. And as a result, venture capital  guys are just throwing money at these tiny companies that are wanting to get bought.  And I just yesterday, wait, Friday, had lunch with somebody who's going to work at a startup  and said, it's warm body time again in San Francisco where they're just pulling people  off the street, giving them a hot meal, cleaning them up and putting them to work.

And people go  definitively, no, this will last forever. This is not a problem.  That is a bubble. You're right.  We're starting to get people saying that.

End time: 3009.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

But I think Molly may be on to something  because I've noticed the traffic has been a little more congested than usual at this time  of year. And that's always I kind of judge the activity in the Bay Area in terms of high tech  or whatever just by the freeways. And it's a little bit annoying. It's jammed up a lot more

A Russian man who is thought  to be responsible or at least accused of being responsible for, what is it, a third of the world's  spam has said, no, I'm not. It's all a ruse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Molly? Well, I mean, it seemed like sort of a weird number anyway, right? It seemed a little  specious to say like, yep, this is the guy, 30% of spam. His botnet does it all. It feels a little  hard to count exactly what a botnet is sending out. So maybe he's just quibbling a little bit with the

Start time: 3198.44
End time: 3223.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I wish I was guilty of a third.  He's in Madison, Wisconsin. He's in jail, waiting trial. His lawyer has said he's king of nothing but  that cell they're keeping him in. He is not a spam king.

Start time: 3237.66
End time: 3254.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, sometimes though, they've been able to reduce spam significantly when they take down certain botnets.  But I don't know, you may be right, Chris, taking out an individual may not take out the botnet.  So don't get me wrong, the individuals should be taken out. But if we want to solve spam,

Start time: 3254.46
End time: 3280.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not going to be resolved in the courts. I mean, I think it really has to be a technical  solution. And this argument about 33% of the spam, I mean, I don't really care if it's 1200  messages in my Gmail spam folder or 800 or whatever. I mean, there's, and maybe we have  solved it. I mean, Dvorak has a solution, Gmail has a solution. But to a certain extent, it seems  like not an interesting trial just because it's just, if it wasn't that guy, it'd be another guy,

Start time: 3281.10
End time: 3291.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? Pretty much. Well, that's the thing, right? He's got a botnet, he's got a system,  he goes to jail. That doesn't take away the spam. Nothing. Microsoft has actually had a little bit

Start time: 3291.98
End time: 3312.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of success in shutting down the botnets themselves. I mean, I think there was one point where they had  released, they had reduced global spam messages by two or three billion messages a day by taking  out an actual botnet. And it's true, like you can put this guy in jail, but I'm sure that,  I mean, for one thing, the botnet runs itself. Yeah. And gee, the funny thing is most botnets

Comcast is taking action though,  and I hope we see other ISPs stepping up to say, you know, we have a role here and we can take action,  we can work with our subscribers proactively to tell them that their computer is infected because  of the pattern of traffic. And that to me seems like a good solution. It's just one that's  labor intensive. And so the major ISPs don't want to embrace it, would be my guess.

Transcript:  Google is going to take the side of copyright owners. They put up a blog post this week,  laying out four principles to their plan. They're going to act on reliable copyright  takedown requests within 24 hours, prevent terms that are closely associated with piracy from  appearing in auto-complete, improve their AdSense anti-piracy review so that AdSense ads aren't  showing up on sites that link to infringing materials and experiment to make authorized  preview content more readily accessible in search results. Now combine this with their earlier  cooperation with Verizon to propose net neutrality rules. Google seems to be crossing over to the

Start time: 3388.06
End time: 3395.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  corporate advocacy side rather than the individual advocacy. It could be just lip service for all we

Start time: 3395.60
End time: 3442.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know. Well, I think Google is, I think two things. One, Google is trying very hard to make nice with  rights holders right now because of the growing debacle that is Google TV. And they know that if  they can't get some deals with some actual major content providers and networks, that Google TV is  a little bit dead on arrival. So I think they're trying to kind of suck up to them now and say,  listen, we'll protect your rights online so that people aren't stealing and also hopefully provide  you with a new business model. But I also have to think that this is a little bit of chilling  effect fallout maybe from the U.S. government seizing 82 domain names with roughly no due  process because they used an argument that could, you know, these domain names were pointing to  copyrighted material that could potentially extend to Google. Let's grab Google. Now that

Start time: 3442.16
End time: 3446.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  would be something if the government shut down Google. Well, you're right. By the logic they use,

Start time: 3446.56
End time: 3478.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they did go to a federal magistrate, but no one was allowed to defend themselves.  They said, look, there's infringing material. It's pointing to it. We get to seize it. Every  search engine, Bing, Google, Ask, eBay, Northern Lights, Altavista. I mean anybody. Craigslist.  Anybody could be linking to infringing material. I mean, and of course, there's that law working  its way through Congress was approved by committee that would make it explicitly  the authority of the government to seize a domain name. Now seizing a domain name,  as we talked about in WikiLeaks, doesn't actually take the site offline. It just makes it a little

Start time: 3479.04
End time: 3530.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  harder for your average person to find. It makes it a lot harder. I think it's scary though. I think  a lot of this we're looking at right now is the demise of the original, I think it was John Perry  Barlow's suggestion that the internet was beyond the jurisdiction of governments. And in this week,  we've certainly seen that governments, when they want to, can assert some jurisdiction and at the  very least make it a tremendous hassle to get your message out, regardless of whether it's  pirated materials or allegedly pirated materials or secret cables or whatnot.  And I think the Chinese government, for instance, is probably looking very interestingly on all of  this and in others as well. So I think this has been a very sobering week for the way government  interacts with the federal government interacts with the internet. The golden age of the internet is over.

And it's time to say, look, this is a thing that  has changed the world. This is an invention whose fundamental openness and innovative nature has  created possibly the best age in human history. And it's being impinged upon by all comers pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. Go ahead, Chris.  I would say also that we say government and it's a complicated term. And there's a fascinating  article that I just read. It's called, oh, wow, I just lost it. The internet that might have been,  if you Google it, I'll bet you'll pop up. It was a law professor out of New Orleans. And it goes  through and it illustrates the way that government has allowed the internet to become the strong  force that it is by having good policies. And so I think there's two countervailing forces  at work there. And right now we're just seeing a whole lot of the force we don't want to see,

Start time: 3599.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the force that the EFS steps up to fight. You know what the irony of the whole thing is,  it's kind of interesting, is that we remember when the internet first started cropping up and  started getting some traction in the mid-90s. And then anytime someone would try to commercialize  anything, they would be jumped, oh, you can't do this. You're a horrible person for putting  advertisement on the internet. And it went on and on like that. Now it's gotten to the point  where there's nothing but advertisements on the internet. It's completely switched around. You  put any real facts or information or use it for anything other than advertisements, which is where  it's all headed, then now that's bad and the government goes after you. I find it slightly

I didn't think that was a good idea to put  graphics on the web. I changed my mind. Yeah. Yeah. Ads are terrible. Yeah, exactly.  Do we think Google is changing sides here?

So you have Microsoft, the media product  that they have. It doesn't do this. It doesn't do that. It's got all kinds of digital rights  management stuff built in. You can't do this. You can't do that because Microsoft's kowtowed  to Hollywood and Google to get any traction. I think Molly's right. The Google TV thing is  moribund. It's stuck in the mud and they need to do something. And so they're doing the same thing.  They're selling out, instead of leaving these things open for people to use them any way they  want to, they're going to sell out the user so somebody else can make even more money,

Transcript:  have a second limo. One of these four principles that I have a big problem with is the autocomplete  one. Saying we're going to respond to DMCA, take down notices. Well, that's a problem with the DMCA,  not Google. AdSense, anti-piracy review, that's their own deal. That's ads. Making authorized  preview content more accessible seems to be a positive thing. But how do you decide what terms

Transcript:  are piracy related? You tell me. I don't know. Really. I mean, are you suddenly not going to get  an instant search result for avatar? Yeah. Or maybe you're doing student research into piracy,  right? And you look into, you're Googling for avatar piracy. Avatar. You got nothing.  MPEG-4. I mean, you'll still get results. But the other thing is it's just such a bizarro  cosmetic change anyway. It's like, oh yeah, we have this awesome feature, autocomplete. You'll  still get search results if you search for avatar torrent, but you just won't see it drop down at  the same time. You'll have to think of it all by yourself. It's not only disturbing, it's actually

Start time: 3771.72
End time: 3794.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just kind of dumb. This actually seems antithetical to the point that Google has been trying to make,  which is that their search engine returns what it does because it's a good algorithm.  And it actually seems more like they're sort of getting into the tampering that they want to  avoid because they really don't want to be accused of selecting certain e-commerce sites or companies  over others when there's searches. And so I kind of wonder if they're going to see some blowback

I mean,  if I was a rights holder and this was Google's attempt to suck up to me, I'd be saying,  because I do think they are. There's no question. But if I'm a rights holder, I'm like,  why weren't you responding to DMCA take down notices faster before? How is taking it out  of autocomplete going to deter anybody from anything if you're not actually changing search  results? Why wouldn't you be as a decent search engine offering links to previews that are legal?  If you break it down, it's kind of like Google giving the impression of selling themselves out  more than they even are. And it doesn't seem like it's going to make anyone happy.

Transcript:  You know, a company that's got a better approach to fighting piracy is Netflix,  because what they do is say, you know what, we want to make as many things available for  legal streaming as possible. New York Post earlier this week reported that Netflix is making a run  for in season episodes of big TV hits. It was rumored they were willing to pay $100,000 per  episode to get the rights. Paid contents, Andrew Wallenstein said that's a bunch of hooey. This is  not what Netflix is going to be able to do. No TV network in their right mind would license Glee

Transcript:  My job is done. Anyway, what Paid Contents Andrew Wallenstein  pointed out is what they should do is try to get the serial dramas that don't go into syndication.  His argument is, why would anyone sell the rights to current episodes to Netflix when they can make  so much more money in syndication? Three of the networks have a Hulu interest they can use  for that. They wouldn't give them to Netflix, but the older serialized shows that are harder  to jump into in the beginning might be a good opportunity. He used AMC's Mad Men or CSI as  examples of ways that you could possibly have Netflix help you out with your ratings.

Start time: 3960.24
End time: 3980.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. There has to be a kind of a dichotomized approach to these things. I think  Mad Men is a perfect example of something. People like to watch. They get into it. You get into it  late in the game. A lot of these things like Mad Men and Rubicon was the same way. If you didn't  see the first few episodes or you can't keep up, you have to go back. You have to find some way of

Start time: 3980.44
End time: 4010.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  watching it from the beginning. As much as I agree with that point of view to a certain extent,  the networks still have been totally resistant to do that. Hulu is a perfect example. There are so  many shows that I would want to watch if I could get caught up and if I could just stream them at  work. But I can only see the last five episodes of Fringe or something on Hulu. I feel like  Netflix is probably pursuing everything with the same fervor because the networks are objecting to

Start time: 4012.22
End time: 4027.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any flexibility with the same fervor. Well, they don't want to give up the money. I'm sorry, Chris,  I just want to say this real quickly. They don't want to give up the money that they already know  they can get through existing licensing situations to risk the money that they might get

Start time: 4028.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if online television really takes off. I think if we look a step ahead, Netflix licenses a couple  of these series that people really want to see. We're looking at 20% if you believe the number  right now of the streaming traffic. More people are finding out about it. More people are signing  up for that $9 a month or whatever it is offered. It's $8 for streaming only in  nine with one disc. Okay, so $8. I think it'll be really interesting to see. I don't think our  cable and DSL networks can handle that many people streaming these shows. And so I kind of wonder if  Netflix could be a victim of its own success by just getting too much good content. Because right  now they're doing tremendous with movies that are a lot of times four weeks after their release date,  television shows that are a season or two out. And so I think it'll be interesting to see what  happens if they're able to do this. I don't know if they have a plan moving forward of how they're  going to really deliver it to people high quality. I think our networks, the ISPs and the backbones

Start time: 4088.46
End time: 4092.10

Transcript:  BitTorrent technology. Just saying. Right. Maybe. Yeah, that's a good point. No,  VIEWS uses BitTorrent to stream video. VIEWS? I don't know VIEWS. They used to be called something  else before that. But again, because of what Molly just said, because of the demonization of the  word, everybody's hesitant to get in bed with them. It's a great point. I mean, BitTorrent would have

Start time: 4119.28
End time: 4167.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  solved some of these issues with the streaming, although CDNs to a certain extent, the content  delivery networks took that over. But fundamentally, there's just not the capacity for everyone to,  right now we're seeing traffic broadband increase by 30% on the year, I think. If it goes up to 50%  or 60%, I don't think anyone's really prepared for that. 20% is Netflix, don't forget.  But maybe the increase is, I believe, on the order of 30 or 40%. And I guess the question I have is,  is just, I don't think as an infrastructure, we're ready to handle this. There's certain  cities that our VIEWS can handle it. A number of the community networks can handle it. But  Netflix is sort of full speed ahead without regard to the fact that I don't think a lot of people  will be able to use this when everyone's getting on it. No, absolutely. It's a disaster waiting to

Transcript:  happen. The FIOS can handle the downloads, but can Netflix deliver enough? That's the problem.  And that was the great, the beauty of Torrents is that everybody took part in this kind of passing  around aspect of it. So you had, it wasn't like dependent on one single source, but then there's

Start time: 4186.88
End time: 4196.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all kinds of legal issues with it. Well, and if everybody was using Torrents, then Comcast would  be sending as much traffic back to level three as level three was sending to it. Right. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Bitthorne's make it really great if I have a piece of content that I want to get out to millions  of people. But there's still the fact that I need to get a certain number of bits down to my computer  at a certain rate in order to have a good quality experience watching it. There's also just the  fundamental stupidity of streaming when you have an internet like we have, where a progressive  download or something like that would be far superior. But the content creators want to use  streaming because I think it'll prohibit the piracy. Bring back Juiced. Juiced was using

This rumor goes in line with the rumor that Facebook  would be integrating Skype. What they say, Jason Kincaid says on TechCrunch is that Skype is  hoping to launch a web-based service in the first quarter that would integrate into multiple  partner sites the ability maybe in LinkedIn or Facebook to use Skype to call people. You would  have a special plan in Skype that would allow you to do that. It may be free to start with and then  they try to sell you premium features. Like what? Like text messaging.

Robert Crippen was being brought to trial for selling mod chips for the  Xbox. First, he was told he could not use fair use as a defense. Then when the trial started and the  jury was seated, the judge went on a tirade against the prosecution and then suggested maybe he could  use fair use as a defense. They took a recess, came back, looked like the prosecution was willing  to carry on under the new rules that Judge Philip Gutierrez had put in place. And then the next day

Start time: 4447.96

They were worried that this would end  upsetting a precedent saying, you know what? Anytime you're doing it for a reasonable purpose,  like making a backup of your own game, you should be allowed to do. That would break the DMCA wide

And it's really hard to see, actually. And so I kind of wonder if this is related to that,  or if I'm just imagining that the designers have a scheme afoot.  I don't think that's what I was imagining. But it does seem like cars are harder to see out backwards

Transcript:  now. Yeah, well, you know, I always get out of the car. When I have to back up, I stop the car,  open the door, get out, look behind it, make sure somebody's not laying there. It's the only way to

Transcript:  I think I know, my guess about what's going on here is some insurance actuary noted the amount of  savings they could have, probably more for the injuries, because there's 18,000 injuries,  if there were a backup camera on every car and said, you know what, let's try to push for this  to be mandated, because then there's fewer payouts that we have to make for injuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take another look at this. People are not looking behind their car when they back up,  apparently. And what makes you think they're going to be looking at the screen? They're probably just  oblivious to the entire world. They're not going to look at the necessary look at the screen to see  what's behind them. It might be out of range, who knows? And they're going to back up over  somebody laying back there for all you know, this whole thing is a waste of time and money.

Transcript:  Bill is being proposed in Congress that would require Wi-Fi base stations in all federal  buildings. It's a bipartisan bill. Senator Olympia Snow, Republican of Maine, and Mark  Warner, Democrat of Virginia, introduced the legislation on Friday.

Start time: 4978.22
End time: 5033.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Mark Warner is really good on broadband generally. And I just want to read the purpose  of this, which comes from the bill itself. And that's to install Wi-Fi hotspots and wireless  neutral host systems in all federal buildings in order to improve in-building wireless  communications coverage and commercial network capacity by offloading wireless  traffic onto wireline broadband networks. It strikes me as kind of an odd situation. I mean,  I was just thinking about where city halls and public buildings are around Minneapolis,  and I just don't see this being all that helpful. And why the federal government is mandating that  the local governments have to help private companies to manage their traffic is even more  sort of confusing to me. I don't really understand the point of this, although quite honestly,  having more open Wi-Fi for people to use is certainly a good thing.  So you're against it?  It really strikes me as being unnecessary.

Start time: 5034.52
End time: 5049.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like you don't think we'd get the benefit from it because there's just not enough  federal buildings that would warrant this. Because it's only the federal buildings that  would require to be retrofitted by 2014. I think that's exactly why.  The bill sponsored by Cisco.

Start time: 5125.26
End time: 5162.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's like I'm horrified. I'm horrified. No, it's because I used to have Sprint Broadband  Direct, which was about 10 years ago or more. And they canceled it saying,  oh, we're going to grant... They grandfathered a few people in and the next thing you know,  they said, don't worry, we got a million technologies we're going to replace it with.  Ten years goes by and they have nothing. And so now they're bringing this thing out.  And I'm wondering, it's about time, A, and I want to check it out because it seems to me that once  you standardize on one technology with WiMAX, which is problematic because all the technologies,  none of them work together. But ClearWire is doing all of them. So it might actually work.

Start time: 5173.86
End time: 5194.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I'm comparing the Sprint Overdrive to the Verizon MiFi. The Verizon MiFi only does 3G.  The Sprint Overdrive did WiMAX in Atlanta. And it was excellent. It worked really well,  unless I was deep inside a building. And then the WiMAX's problem penetrating building started to  show up and it would switch to 3G a lot of the time. But most of the time that wasn't an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually have a different experience. A friend of mine who's in Portland was disappointed  to find out that they can't get it because they're on the wrong side of a hill.  Well, that's a bad experience. I would agree.  But I did some research on this recently and they have the two plans, one of which I believe is like  a gigabit down and half a gigabit up. I'm sorry. That would be incredible. A megabit down and a  half a gigabit up. That would actually be 4G or even 5G.

Start time: 5231.46
End time: 5256.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when I looked at it, then they have an unlimited plan. And from what I could tell,  sort of averaging responses on message boards and whatnot, it looks like the best people do  is about five megabits a second sustained. And that can be terrific for a handheld device,  but I don't see that replacing a wired connection. And fundamentally, we have 4G,  Verizon LTE coming out today, I believe. And I think there's just all this hyper wireless.

Start time: 5256.36
End time: 5261.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not technically 4G. And I resent the fact that-  It's more, I think it's 4G-ish.  It's 4G.

Start time: 5261.84
End time: 5271.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but to be fair, the technical specification for 4G actually came out after the marketing  term had been in widespread use. So they can still get to call it that.  They can call it whatever they want.

Start time: 5271.86
End time: 5274.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5280.74
End time: 5317.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But LTE is like, you know, I'm on the other side of this debate, which is that by the way,  WiMAX in Japan has up to 300 megabits per second called WiMAX 2.  That's 4G.  It's for how many people on the tower?  But the point is that I'm not convinced that these cell phone technologies that run LTE  and all the rest of them that came before it, they always run out of bandwidth. They crap out.  They have all these issues. It's not really equipped. The cell phone network,  the mobile network's never been equipped for data. It doesn't like it.  I don't know. I'm not taking that side of the equation anytime soon.

Start time: 5317.34
End time: 5340.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly right. Wireless and wired networks aren't substitutes. They're complements.  Wireless is terrific for a lot of things, but it's not a substitute.  The idea that we're going to solve our rural broadband problems with 4G just to go off on a  tangent because I can is absurd for the reasons that you just mentioned. Wireless is just not  going to... Our future is wired and wireless.

Transcript:  All right. Couple stories to finish us off here. A Texas man, Aaron Embry, told a local Fox News  affiliate he had heard a popping noise while using his Droid 2 and then looked down to find  blood dripping from his ear. The glass... That happens to me a lot.  The glass had broken. The battery, I guess, maybe exploded and cut him. Now, he says,  I felt something dripping. I realized that it was probably blood. I went into the house and as I got  into the bathroom and once I got to the mirror, I saw it. I was only then I kind of looked at my  phone and noticed the screen had appeared to burst outward. So he took some pictures of it  in case he had a legal case and then went to the hospital.

Well, okay, if you didn't ever grow up in like a cold  state, you haven't seen this, but if you go, they had drive-through banks and the pneumatic tubes.  Yeah, they still have them. They still have them.  They get sucked up. That is a genius idea for transporting, I don't know, wheat bundles.  Yeah. Okay, it's crazy.

End time: 5567.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it. I think it is crazy. Molly's right. But at the same time,  then you read further in the article and it's something that I occasionally think about, which  is the energy you put into a vehicle, the energy that vehicle uses to move you, like 98% of that  energy is wasted, right? Because you weigh a hundred pounds, the vehicle weighs, I'm sorry,  you weigh 200 pounds if you're me. The vehicle weighs 2000 pounds, a lot more probably. There's  just so much energy that's wasted. And so the idea of installing these tubes once and then not having  to run trucks everywhere. Actually, you can imagine if it's a long-term investment, it could

I'm thinking, because I'm looking at that thing and the first  plasma is that... Panasonic, too.  They're the only ones still doing them, as far as I can tell. But anyway, I remember seeing the  first plasma at a Comdeck show, or CES, one of the two. And it was 42 inches. That was the original.  10 grand. So the price has come down a bit.  A little bit.

We're a profit. I work on  community broadband. So, anything that's co-ops, non-profit, municipal ownership. The point is,  is that the network should be focused on community needs rather than profits.  And so, there's also other focuses of the Institute, which you can find at ILSR.org for  the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. But all their telecom work really happens at muninetworks.org,  where I write about networks like the one gigabit per second Chattanooga network and other  community networks that are doing fascinating things to push forward in ways that the private  carriers are a little bit slow to do sometimes.
