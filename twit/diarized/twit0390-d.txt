Transcript:  You know in some ways you might be right because apple's stock price is about where it was exactly a year ago  So this whole thing this run up to 700 bucks  Was this year and it might be an anomaly might be overblown  And now it's back to where it should be foreign. It's not you know, they're market cheap. They're priced earnings to 10 bucks  10. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the peg? It was interesting. They came out with a good earnings price earnings growth  Any other company would be would be thrilled to have that earnings report  Yeah, and their stock went down by 10 percent before before the night ended it was down by 10. Yeah  Absolutely, so you're punishing what was actually by most standards  I wouldn't mind if my revenue had just gone up a little bit in 2012 over 2011  A lot of people's revenue went down a lot of companies revenue went down  But wall street doesn't doesn't think that way they were  You know, they're looking for continuous growth and I agree. I don't know what how apple is going to continue to grow  What do they have in the pipeline? You know bigger phones smaller phones ipad maxis. I mean what what just?  Reinventing something that they've already created isn't enough to make this a company that's just going to grow through the roof  And I'd love for apple tv to be a great product  But i'm having trouble imagining what it's going to be that's going to blow me away  I mean who knows if it's just a great big ipad on the wall. Forget it

Start time: 1271.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two factors that I think are really interesting people talk about the tv as if it's a question of hardware  Uh, and of course it is if they do do a tv  They'll also have a box like they do now  But hopefully a better one than the one that they have now because you can't just they they can't do their big living room play  By relying on everybody buying this gigantic tv set from apple  That's not going to happen  They're going to have to have a tv set plus a thing that does what the tv set does for your sony tv  But the real play is with content  I think apple is in a better position than any other company to essentially coerce and force hollywood to bend to its will  Which is really what we need in order to break away from this cable thing with nightmare that we're in where you have to subscribe  To to to all these channels just to watch one show  And you know people want to watch what they want to watch and want to be able to watch anything anytime  And whoever gives them that is going to win lots and lots and lots of money and apple's in the best position  To coerce hollywood into that type of uh of an arrangement. So that's one thing the other thing that people  Uh don't appreciate enough. I think is china  Right now  People say well china's succeeding in apple apple's the main one saying that but they're not really they're the number six  Smartphone company in china people don't realize this they're way down on the list first  It's samsung then lenovo way zte and the coolpad and then apple  So they're not even on the biggest carrier that the the world's biggest carriers. What is it china mobile?  They're not even on china mobile yet like they they you know, they could double  Their handset sales once they really get into china except that and this is

End time: 1418.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if it matters what wall street thinks but this is one of the things that's puzzling about the stock price  It looks like they're about to make a deal with china mobile which will open 700 million more customers to them  That they are in fact making a less expensive iphone for that market  Which you need to do because it's a very expensive phone. They call it the iphone math. We don't know if that's a bad  Chinese translation or if that's the name of it, but this less expensive iphone  Will be selling this year into china in all likelihood  So they will in fact be doing well in china one. I think one of the things that wall street didn't like is that the margins are lower  They're still very good  They're like 38 percent but they're lower and the math will certainly because it's a less expensive phone have lower margins  But they're going to be big in china. They're selling the ipad like crazy

Start time: 1419.12
End time: 1444.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, this is funny because I was thinking about this because the chinese love the apple iphone  It's a prestige item, but the chinese also steal  Intellectual property is such an extreme that I think they're just walking into a buzzsaw. Yeah, you'll have an iphone  But it's not an apple iphone, you know, well, it probably will be close to it, but it won't be you're right  But it'll say apple on the back and that's all that counts.

End time: 1514.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they do and I suspect that to a certain extent the um, the wall street is being influenced by people like us  Because people like us are always saying we need more innovation. We want a holographic display  We want uh, you know a flexible foldable thing  We want something totally radically new and if apple doesn't deliver that then they're going to fail  But I don't really think that's what makes apple successful  Uh, you know, they did do some innovation a few years ago on on the on the iphone  But lately they've just been focusing on quality. They were the first with bluetooth 4.0  The screen quality is amazing. The camera quality is amazing. I'm not aware of a  Of a of a phone other than the iphone 5 that has that quality of a camera ready the samsung galaxy s4

It looks good  It's a good phone, but it's not blowing anybody away  And the question is can apple succeed as a company that just does  Also good products or does it need to have these revolutionary products in order for it to succeed long term?  And it hasn't had a revolutionary product since it came out with the ipad  Since then we have better ipads smaller ipads, but nothing revolutionary. I'll tell you though

Bill gates was talking about admitting that apple actually had a superior product  And acknowledging the fact that apple could control the operating system and the hardware  And that that enabled them to come out with a better product in many ways  And I think that for microsoft to be able to have that that full experience and and really control it in a sense controlling their own  Destiny would make sense  The only problem is it's gonna it's gonna really upset their partners  And I don't know what that means for youlet packard and lenovo and asus and all the other companies out there that are supporting windows

Yeah  Uh speaking of bad ideas now we're finding out that cbs  Has told cnet not only can you no longer review dish because we're in litigation  You can't review ario either because we're in litigation with them. I I don't find this to be a big deal. I do  CNET says cbs says cnet has 100 editorial independence  We talked about this last week. Apparently not apparently not  How is this 100 editorial independence and how is this? Okay john?

Anyway, uh  Here's the deal i'm an editor at let's say at cnet and somebody come  I think they dropped the ball. I think cnet shouldn't have run my karrington said everybody had seen it should quit if they don't  They're not journalists. Well, he's the like he's a journalist. Yeah, I know I like that  So anyway, so no you have a you have your staff and you somebody throws this thing through  Nobody caught this thing and they ran it and so then cbs freaked out and then they they handle it poorly  But they're generally speaking the editor would go up to a writer and say look, here's the deal  We're in our company the ones who pay your salary are in litigation  and  You can run this piece but you're gonna like be deposed and you're gonna have to testify against the company you work for  And and this could go on drag on for years and it could really tie you up. Do you really want to do that?  And then I mean if he stops writing no the writer can say well, no, it's probably not a great idea  I'll go write about something else. I mean there's ways of stopping this without it looking like is this kind of thing routinely?

Start time: 6509.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they didn't I think I I looked for to try to figure out who to blame looking at the the masthead  I don't think there was I think their editorial structure stinks. They don't have like an editor  They get all these little sub editors and this kind of editor and that kind of there's no editor in chief that I know of  And I just don't I just think that the structure of the of cnet is  Is is flawed and that's how this happened in the first place. I know I think it's just something wrong with it

Start time: 6539.54
End time: 6543.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 6543.48
End time: 6563.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the reason by the way, you are working at twit exactly why because I don't want to ever be put in that position  Right, and that's one of the reasons we do the no agenda show.com  Because we have no advertisers we don't have anybody to you know, tell us to do anything and we do what we want to it's  It's a big difference  But if i'm working for cbs, I am working for cbs, but it never came it never came up

End time: 6579.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I guess you're right. There's this kind of understanding. I mean, I never an understanding  I never got in a situation where at tech tv or at cd where I felt like i'd love to talk about that  But it wouldn't be prudent  Or politic. I think you did really? Yeah, let me think what would be yeah

Start time: 6579.32
End time: 6586.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Of course  We're gonna do it  They did of course contact lawyers and they asked them are we gonna get in trouble for doing this?  But we did I think that all it ever came down to was that we had to do a disclaimer  But there was never nobody I was really impressed with the editorial folks at uh tech tv that they never said don't do that  They didn't and it was a risky thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That would just be impolitic  Anyway, but that is why I like being an independent media because I don't feel like and i'm sure it's why you like no agenda  I don't feel like and I you know if we wanted to lamb based our advertisers, we would we might lose an advertiser  But it's not the end of the world

Transcript:  You know used to be the other way around during the early days in the 20s and 30s  It was the it was the publications that harassed the advertisers until they coughed up money and started advertising  Seriously, I have to try that that's a good idea. So I don't know what's wrong with this company  Story about your company, you know if you want to hear nothing but bad news about your company don't advertise  That's what the hearst papers used to do
