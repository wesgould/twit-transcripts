I just throw them on a desk.  Yeah. Where did you get that?  And how much it's on Etsy?  It was 50 bucks.  It's a 3D printed Zuckerberg head.  And since he loves all things Roman emperors and stuff,  I figure that the nose kind of works.  It does. You should just chop it right off.

Transcript:  I think you need to get this.  Why is Arnold four dollars more?  Yeah, I was wondering about the price differences for some reason.  And it's a gubernatorial fees.  Maybe because he's so big, it uses more PLA fiber.  It's very expensive to print the muscles.  That's it. I can't decide.  That's really what's.

Transcript:  It is. It's good to know that three thousand six hundred fifty six people in the world  have Arnold Schwarzenegger's head on a shelf.  All right.

Start time: 482.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 485.24
End time: 561.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll be watching over us the whole.  I'm a little mad at Mark.  And I don't know, maybe maybe this is it's not reasonable to be mad at Mark for this.  It's just something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  A teenager and her mom in Nebraska, a 17 year old girl and her mom  chatting on Facebook Messenger.  They thought privately about her medicine induced abortion.  The abortion was at 28 weeks, which is illegal in Nebraska.  Nebraska somehow must have found out about it.  The police sent a subpoena, a warrant to I don't know what the difference is.  One of those two, I think a warrant to Facebook.  And they provided the.  Not so private chats, which were then were then used  to gather more evidence and arrest the 17 year old who's being tried as an adult.  Her mother is also being tried, as is a man who was charged with attempting  to conceal the death of another person.  The fetus.  This this to me is exactly in a nutshell, why privacy is so important.  You can't.  Denise, can you fault Facebook?  Don't they have to give the police that information given a valid?

Start time: 561.84
End time: 585.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do. Here's what they don't have to do.  They don't have to have the data.  They could delete it.  They don't have to keep chat.  Lots of good points.  Yeah. So if you want to get mad at Mark for something, get mad about him for that.  Because and they have to respond to search warrants with information  they actually have.  If they don't have it, they don't have anything to give over.

Start time: 585.26
End time: 645.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why encryption and encryption is so important, because then the company  can't hand it over.  And in fact, weirdly, that right about the same time,  Metta expanded messenger's end to end encryption.  They say it is unrelated to the Nebraska abortion case.  You can have private end  to end encrypted conversations, as I remember, on messenger.  But you have to you have to turn it on.  So and you remember that famous post from Mark Zuckerberg three years ago saying,  you know, we're going to everything's going to be end to end encrypted eventually.  They have faced, according to Wired,  technical and political challenges that have delayed that.  But they're driving, according to Wired again, they're driving toward,  quote, a global rollout of default end to end encryption for personal messages  and calls next year.  Government doesn't like this.  Government calls it going dark.  They think the bad guys are going to use this.  Government likes search warrants.

Start time: 645.76
End time: 648.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, we know that.

Start time: 651.32
End time: 674.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know,  this this this is painful on a number of levels.  I feel for the 17 year old who didn't want to have a baby.  She and her mom had conversations she thought was private.  Mark thought otherwise.  But in every case,  in every step of the way, this is all legal.

Start time: 675.96
End time: 707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  And and and a good cautionary tale in the wake of recent  Supreme Court developments to know that this is how things are going to go.  This this case would have been prosecuted before Dobbs because it was late.  It was late. Yeah. Yeah.  But, you know, this is this is how this is going to go.  People are going to be asked for search histories.  People are going to be asked for communications.

Start time: 708.70
End time: 754.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we know that the data smog that you leave behind you  can be used in all sorts of ways.  I remember a story from years ago.  Was it Target?  Some store knew that a shopper was pregnant before family did  based on her purchases of the store.  So they started sending her solicitations for, you know, diapers and things.  And she was like upset because she hadn't told anybody she was pregnant.  And this is the case.  Your data can say things.  And if suddenly you're not pregnant after being pregnant,  this data can get you in a lot of trouble in about 23 states in the United States.  So what should we do?  We talked about period tracking apps.  Turn those off. Yes.

Start time: 756.52
End time: 767.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But definitely.  And, you know, I think it's just a good idea.  I know it's a lot to think about people using signal in their daily lives, but.  You know, if you're

Start time: 768.80
End time: 785.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because then you're acting as if, you know, I'm a secret agent  and I have to do everything encrypted.  Plus, you have to get everybody to do it.  And I even think that that could be a red flag for law enforcement.  Well, that's interesting.  Leo seems to be using encrypted messaging exclusively.  I wonder what he's up to.

Start time: 787.82
End time: 791.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you use HTTPS to in your browsers, you know, I mean,

Start time: 792.48
End time: 805.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's why that's why Facebook and everybody else should just turn it on.  Then nobody looks guilty because they're using it.  It's just the default. Everybody's using it.  You don't have to choose signal. Right. Yeah.  Well, let's move along.

Start time: 806.68
End time: 831.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other reason that they want to do that is because exactly what we're talking about, then  the next time something like this happens, they're kind of off the hook  because there's nothing they can do.  The problem would be right to play devil's advocate is the next time  there's a terrorist attack or something that everyone can see was planned on  telegram or something like that.  And there's no way to to track people down.  Then the government gets even more mad.

Start time: 831.60
End time: 868.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the only thing I would I would say to that is  there have always been and probably always will be a way for people to communicate  privately, even if it involves going out in a field and whispering in each other's ear.  People are going to be able to communicate privately.  You cannot eliminate all means of communicating privately.  And the law protects to some degree  your privacy and things like, well, is there any?  Actually, it's a good one for our attorney.  Is there any I mean, you can get a lot of people get a wiretap, right?  Is there they can open mail, right?  There are laws against opening mail.  But if they have a warrant, they can open mail.

Start time: 869.80
End time: 894.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there particularly under the Patriot Act and all the legislation  that came out after 9-11?  Yeah, you can. If there is probable cause for a crime that's being investigated  and they think that data may exist in a place, they can compel  it to be turned over under a court order.  So it's so we get back to do you have the data? Right.

Start time: 895.42
End time: 940.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll make the argument that Phil Zimmerman made when I interviewed him.  He was the creator of PGP.  And he said law enforcement is not going dark.  Law enforcement has unprecedented access to data  more than they've ever had before.  People are using digital devices to communicate  and law enforcement can see into most of those.  So it isn't the fact that, oh, my God, we we can't do our job anymore.  It's he he said, and I think he's accurate.  It's more of a case.  They've got a amazing view into everything that's going on.  And there are a few little spots where they can't see.  And that bugs them that there's some dead pixels.  They're not going dark.  They have more than they've ever had before.  Does that seem accurate?

Start time: 941.24
End time: 1008.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  100 percent. That's exactly what I think.  That it is the the full they want full control  and they also want full autonomy.  And it's funny how it works until it gets flipped back on them  because of something that they did wrong.  Oh, yes. And that interesting. Yeah.  Then it's like, oh, the camera was off.  Or this is secret.  And if we tell you how we did it, then, you know, so that's the catch 22.  And you're right, they definitely have more access.  They have the best tools in the world.  Now, if you look on LinkedIn  and you are a forensic data specialist,  you will find jobs in law enforcement agencies all around the country  looking to hire people that are even better at it.  So, yeah, they're they're kind of full of  they want the best of both worlds.  They also just like in an interrogation,  they know all they need to know, but they want you to tell them  because then that iron clads the case, which is the reason why they end up  screwing it up because they keep pushing for a confession  and then they do something dumb and get the person off  because they just want to get their work done for them.

Start time: 1009.02
End time: 1015.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a little off topic.  By the way, we have a lot of law enforcement people listen to our shows.  I met them. I talked to them and I have huge respect for them.

Start time: 1016.30
End time: 1034.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know my brother-in-law is a cop.  I mean, it's definitely not an anti-law enforcement thing.  I think it's more of like you said,  if I can get everybody to do all the work for me, that just makes my job easier.  I don't I don't blame anybody for wanting that.  But you just got to understand what you're asking.

Start time: 1034.42
End time: 1122.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And and and look, the Constitution has two amendments,  the fourth and the fifth, the side designed really to protect our privacy  and to protect us against unlawful search and seizure and overreaching law enforcement.  So this is something that's been recognized for 200 plus years  in this country, and and we are in theory protected.  I I don't want to go down this.  There's a wonderful book Jeff Jarvis recommended.  Eli Mastal, who is a commentator on MSNBC.  He's a Harvard law graduate, a brilliant guy, wrote a book.  Allow me to retort the black man's guide to the Constitution.  And in it, he makes it, I think, a strong case that look, we got the fifth menu.  You're right to, you know, not incriminate yourself.  You know, people plead the fifth.  And yet we allow, you know, it coerced.  Confessions all the time.  And and really, he says, you should not allow  confessions in the trial.  That just shouldn't be allowed.  The fifth specifically says you have a right not to incriminate yourself.  And I mean, I want this a longer conversation.  And I'm sure Denise, you've you've probably thought about this a little bit.  I think Eli makes a very or Ali makes a very good case for it.  He's against confessions.  He says, forget the, you know, Miranda writes.  Police should not be allowed to ask to ask for confessions.  You just you shouldn't.

Start time: 1123.56
End time: 1132.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, if you're sitting there being interviewed  and your lawyer's there and you have a good lawyer and you decide to confess,  I'm OK with that confession being used.

Start time: 1132.66
End time: 1238.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just it's just so often misused.  Yeah, you're right.  Under perfect circumstances, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.  You should be allowed to plead guilty. Right.  I did it. Your honor, I did it.  Anything anything more than that, though, gets you in a lot of trouble  because there's a lot of coerced confessions going on.  They lie to you. They'll you know, there's all sorts of things.  So as any lawyer and any police officer will tell you, don't talk to the police ever.  Just don't talk. It's just it's not in your interest.  They're not they're not looking to help you.  They're looking to convict you.  Speaking of privacy, Lena Kahn, we've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.  She is the new chairman of the FTC, Federal Trade Commission,  and they have now kicked off their massive push to regulate the data economy.  They've asked for a request for comments.  They launched a notice on on Thursday this week, a potential rulemaking,  and they're looking for comments on a long list of questions  having to do with privacy and data protection.  Chairman Kahn said in this in a statement,  the growing digitization of our economy,  that's what we've just been talking about, right, coupled with business models  that can incentivize endless hoovering up of sensitive user data  and a vast expansion of how that data is used,  means that potentially unlawful practices may be prevalent.  They're trying to decide whether they should regulate.  In these areas, there it's a 44 page notice with literally dozens  of questions about digital ads, security of consumer information, biometrics,  psychological harms, corporate structure, the protection of kids and teens,  algorithmic discrimination.

Start time: 1241.70
End time: 1248.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't looked at all 44 questions, but I hope they have something in there  about the perceived privacy of digital communications tools.

Start time: 1249.32
End time: 1255.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, well, that's right.  What we're talking about, isn't it? Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 1256.12
End time: 1264.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's the FTC, then it wouldn't this be more about like  the commercial surveillance stuff than government surveillance stuff? Yeah.

Start time: 1265.18
End time: 1336.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Also, we were right before the show was starting.  We were talking about Amazon Prime Day and whether Leo was going to get a rice  cooker at the appropriate price.  And the thing I was thinking about at that time is  there are these tools out there.  I'll use the word tools to be generous and kind about what they are.  They are apps that run that help you price compare things.  So if you want a particular rice cooker, you can plug it in.  Camel, camel, camel.  They will scour the web.  And they will and they will tell you when it's hit that price threshold  that you've said or when it's gone on sale or however, they all work differently.  But, you know, I haven't delved too deeply into the data  that these things are gathering and how they're using it.  But everyone is voluntarily forking over a lot of data here.  Not so much critical data about, you know,  am I going to have an illegal abortion or do something else illegal?  But still, I don't think the people using these apps are thinking about  the privacy ramifications of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I have this conversation with Lisa because she uses honey.  And every time I say, oh, don't use honey, she shows me the check  and she gets in the mail from honey from Rakuten.  She says, no, no, Rakuten.  Yeah. But they get.  But this is the difference.

The recommendation engines, even if you use Rakuten and honey  and you give them all the information, they still get it.  I just bought a rice cooker.  They want to sell me more.  Like, how many rice cookers does one family need?  And just so you know, the guide to competitive programming, Brian.  There is such a thing as competitive programming.

Transcript:  Yay. And there are still, of course, many episodes of this week in law,  almost 500 of them on our website at Twitter TV slash T.W.I.L.  Our show today is brought to you by I.T. Pro TV.  Actually, this is a related thing because I.T.  Pro TV was started by two guys, Tim Broom and Don Pezet,  who were I.T. trainers, but in a more traditional classroom setting.  And this was some years ago at NAB.  I was on a panel with Adam Corolla and some others talking about video  and podcasting way back when in NAB.  And Tim and Don were at the panel.  We talked afterwards.  They said, you know, maybe we could do this with I.T. training.  And it was there that the idea for I.T. Pro TV was born.  Now, fast forward about eight or nine years.  And I.T. Pro TV is huge.  They've done so well.  They launched in 2013.  They now have seven studios open every day,  eight a.m. to six p.m., creating great new content.  You can watch I.T. Pro TV on your TV.  You can watch it on your computer.  They have apps for, you know, all the major platforms like Apple TV.  You can actually learn I.T.  the easiest possible way.  And let me tell you, if you've got a business,  it's not just for people getting into I.T.  You have an I.T. team.  You need them to keep up on this, right?  Because I.T. is constantly changing to recertify, to learn new skills,  to polish up old skills.  Now, you might set up a training system for them,  but you've got to make sure you do one that they're going to love,  that they're going to use, and that's I.T. Pro TV.  80% of users who start a video on I.T. Pro TV go all the way through  because it's engaging.  It's fun.  They really know what they do.  They have instructors.  They call them edutainers.  They're experts in the field,  but they also communicate so well their passion for I.T.  They communicate that knowledge,  and that's what keeps you engaged in the shows.  5,800 hours of training.  You can get all the training and search for your team done in one place.  Every vendor, every skill you need, Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple,  security, cloud, everything you want your team to know.  And their dashboard is great for the business plan.  You can track team results, manage seats, assign and unassign team members,  access monthly usage reports to make sure that your investment is paying off.  You'll see all the metrics you need.

I'm curious what you all think of this.  Google is going all in.  They're buying ads.  They've created a site to get Apple onto the RCS bandwagon.  It's time for Apple to fix texting.  It's not about the color of the bubbles, says the website.  It's the blurry videos, the broken group chats,  the missing read receipts and typing indicators,  no texting over Wi-Fi, and more.  Is this going to work?  What do you think, Brian?  Is this a good strategy for Google?

Transcript:  I don't think so because, first of all, the rest of the world  is on WhatsApp, right?  I met with somebody from Singapore this past week.  And I'm like, well, here's my phone number.  He's like, what are you talking about?  We're connected on WhatsApp.  I'm like, oh, yeah, that's right.  So the rest of the world is already locked down.  Here in North America, at least with the younger folks,  you've got iMessage sort of.  And so essentially, all they're trying to do, what they want  it to be, they want to get rid of the green bubble.  They want to get rid of the green bubble.  But they're making the argument of, well,  messaging should be a standard, which generally I'm  in favor of, except for the fact that they're shoving  a standard that most of the world kind of doesn't need  or want.  And so this would require people rewriting stuff  from the ground up and people adopting new things.  And so yeah, I don't think that there's anywhere for them to go.  This is just, to my mind, a naked play at the regulators  to try to put it on the scene.

Transcript:  And I think RCS is more problematic.  If anything, it would probably be better on our end  to open up the iMessage side and let them in.  But that would be hard too, because the thing that  makes iMessage works is you know what devices are talking.  So it can be easier to secure.  The disadvantage of the Android platform is it's everywhere.  So you can find all kind of random things.  I just got this really cool live streaming box  called YoloBox Pro.  And I just realized recently it's basically an Android box.  So yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think we can never get to this RCS thing  no matter what they're trying to do.

Transcript:  I was going to tell you what an intriguing idea you  had about this being aimed at regulators.  But I'm just trying to think through that and understand,  OK, what would catch the regulator's attention?  Regulators are already upset with Apple  about things like the App Store.  Is the blue box a sufficient cornering of the market?  There are so many other texting alternatives that aren't Apple.  I don't think it's really an antitrust concern.

Start time: 2945.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see, that's the tell that I think  that they're targeting regulators with this.  Because if they wanted to be really expansive and be like,  you know what, messaging should be an open standard,  like email, like any number of other things,  then they would be including meta in this.  They would say, hey, by the way, Telegram, everybody,  let's integrate this one standard.  So this is the baseline standard in the same way  that you have baseline SMTP and all this good stuff.  They're not.  They're going after specifically Apple.  And these ads are in the United States.  So that says to me there's one specific target.

They're all using database messengers.  In fact, here is a map of the world's most popular messaging  apps worldwide.  Apple's messages is not even on the list.  Facebook Messenger is big in North America.  WhatsApp is 31% of the market.  They're the largest.  Telegram, 4%.  And then, of course, in Asia, you've got WeChat and Line.

Transcript:  Classic innovators dilemma because the innovation  was this is 100% free.  Although WhatsApp charged a dollar a year or something.  But there's no way that AT&T and Verizon 15 years ago  were going to be like, you know what?  Turn it all off.  The billions of dollars we're making on text messages.  Turn it off tomorrow and we're going to give this away for free.  They would never do that until they were forced to.

Start time: 3171.80
End time: 3185.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, their answer to this was  stop charging for SMS.  Just build it into your bill effectively  because nobody pays per message anymore.  But in the early days of SMS, not even that long ago,  everybody paid per message.  It was hugely profitable for them.

If they started it back in the day where every couple of messages,  you would get a message from Pepsi or Coke or Expedia or whatever,  and we would have gotten used to it and not cared.  And they would own the ad rev space right now.  Imagine if WhatsApp figured out a way to turn ad revenue into their chatting  platform.  You know, they would just be bigger.  So it's funny because they could have found a way to pay for what they  thought they were losing money on, but they just didn't think about it.  They're being greedy.

Transcript:  They were thinking about it.  In fact, I remember the founders of WhatsApp left Facebook in a huff  because Facebook was going to introduce ads into WhatsApp,  and they were furious about it.  Yeah, I meant the telecoms.  Oh, the telecoms.  You would think the telecoms would have said, well, I mean,  that's what RCS, I guess, is a late answer to this conundrum of,  oh, shoot, we're losing everybody to Apple's messages and WhatsApp  and all of this.  But I remember Google was pushing RCS for a long time,  and the telecoms didn't even want it.  It took them a long time to come along.  I don't know if they're technical issues as well.  We actually had something I thought really good called the XMPP  that was a really good messaging protocol.  It was cross-platform.  It could work with SMS.  If everybody at Google initially supported XMPP,  if everybody had supported that, we might have had a solution,  but it was a fact Google even abandoned it for a long time.  It was the universal messaging standard until about five or six years ago.

And someone much smarter than me made the point that this is true for everyone.  You have nostalgia for social media for when you first discovered the platform and it was  perfect because it was just your friends and you were expressing yourself for the first  time.  And every generation sort of has that sort of experience, going back to GeoCities and  what have you.  So it's inevitable that it's sort of like no one goes there anymore.  It's too popular.  Everybody has that platonic ideal of what it was like when they first found a platform.  And then five, six years on, ten years on when your boss is on there, your grandmother's  on there, you kind of hate it.

And I remember because when I got the post that IG was coming out, Leo and a bunch of  people and they were doing a talk on the stage, which was at the back of the hall in Moscone.  We were in the 2A booth just freaking out of his new IG thing.  And I remember that later that day, the only thing to argue about an IG was, is it OK to  post a picture later?  And they used to be like, no, this is not later, Graham.  You got to post it when you get it.  And then it switched within a matter of days.  This was to that's taken with DSLR.

Transcript:  Isn't Be Real already over?  The last numbers I saw, they were still growing.  In fact, now, according to TechCrunch, the CEO of Be Real had to send out a message to  people at the company to stop you being careful about Be Real.  So the idea of Be Real was it would pop up a message on your phone.  OK, now take a picture, whatever you're doing, because it's in real life.  And it would take a picture with both the front facing and the back facing camera.  So it would get you as a selfie and whatever you were doing.  But people were doing it and not realizing they were revealing corporate secrets.

Dave is an analyst at Goldman now and said his summer intern tipped him off on secret  data from Morgan Stanley.  How did she find out her friend posted it on Be Real?  She took a selfie at her desk, but on the other side of the camera, right on a laptop,  were trade secrets out in the open, ready for anyone to steal.  So be careful while you be real.

But you do only get one.  One window a day.  So that the idea is, is that immediacy of it's not the asynchronicity of something you're  doing right now.  Used to.  It's what I'm doing right now.  It's what you're doing right now.  It's what everyone's doing right now.

Start time: 3665.54
End time: 3720.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think it was like a day in the life where was everybody at the same time.  I think it was kind of somewhat randomized.  The other thing was if you missed that window, which the implication was that you are constantly  on.  Because you only have a few minutes when that alert goes, I would miss it every time.  But then you could like a tardy student post a late be real and it would be and it would  be marked Leo posted this three hours late.  And unless you posted it, you couldn't see your friends be real from that day.  The whole thing was just scolding and stupid.  And it's I think it's I think it's had its day already.  20 seconds later, it's over.  It's actually it's actually been around since 2020.  It just as is often the case, you know, somebody discovers it, then an influencer uses it and  all of a sudden everybody's using it.

Transcript:  But you know, look, again, to put this in the context of how social networks succeed,  that's a gimmick, right?  Yeah, it may or may not pay off for them.  But so was Snapchat at the beginning.  The key for having a social network that lives on is you have to have a gimmick that makes  it different.  And then you have to be around long enough to again, hook a generation into what?  Talking to each other.  So it's like you you you hook them with the gimmick.  And then if you can keep them around long enough that a cohort of 16 to 21 year olds,  that's where they go to talk with their friends, then it doesn't matter what the gimmick is.  You can then go on and do stories.  You can go on and do all these other things.  But but in the end, what makes a social network stick is we all get hooked on whatever network  again based on a certain age or something.  And then that's how we communicate with our friends.

Transcript:  So it was like what's happening right now?  Yeah.  But and then the thing with Twitter is it evolved and they listen to users and evolved judiciously.  There was a good article, though, in The New Yorker.  We've been kind of talking about this all week.  This was at the end of July.  Tick tock in the fall of social media giants.  And the premise is social media is over.  So what what was the promise of Facebook and Twitter and social media in the early days?  It was you follow your friends, your family, your high school girlfriend,  your high school boyfriend, you know, you follow the people you care about and you'll get updates about their lives.  It was social. It was a group.  But what quickly happened, and I think you blame YouTube for this, is the rise of the creator.  And now all the social platforms have become creator platforms.  That's what's happening in Instagram.  It's it's stopped being about the pictures your friends post and it's turning into tick tock because YouTube and tick tock succeed  because creators are creating compelling content that you spend more time looking at than your friends and family ever did.  And Facebook realized this. They went to the algorithm.  So the premise of this article by Cal Newport, and I think it's accurate, is that what you're really seeing is the rise of creator media and the fall of the social network.  Discuss.  Well, that's why Be Real was there, right?  You disagree, Doc Rock?

I'll just use them because they work.  People understand them to use the content creator economy to either expand your businesses, launch new businesses, like get out there.  This is literally what I teach people because if you if you really spend some time on on YouTube and look at the good content that's out there, which there are a lot,  but it's so much fun to make fun of the trash.  Right. If you're on Instagram, Reels or TikTok, even looking at some of the great contents out there, there's a lot, but it's so much fun to make fun of the trash.  And this is what people do.  And anybody who back in the day was a, you know, a film buff, you know, like Christina Warren and I used to talk about movies all the time when we were at talk.  And she's a legitimate film buff.  Right. We knew what a good movies were.  And people would be like, oh, there's nothing good at the cinema place.  No, maybe not. But there's some dope movies out there.  You just got to go find them. You know what I'm saying?  And and you're right. I think that content creator generated media in the next five or six years are going to blow past everything that's out there.  And even the Amazons and the Apple and the Netflix are starting to pick up on smaller production houses as opposed to the big stuff.

There's no algorithm that doesn't surface content you're going to that's sticky.  It's just what people are talking about.  The New Yorker article also points out a hazard because Facebook, when it was your friends, you couldn't leave Facebook.  That's where your friends are.  As soon as it just becomes content, another TV channel, it's no longer sticky.  That's why Tick Tock can beat them because Tick Tock is doing a better job of surfacing creative content.  And really, if you think about it, Tick Tock is just a TV channel.  Right. That's all it is.

Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  It's a TV channel that is algorithmically and very sensitively and cleverly algorithmically tuned to just what you want.  And you want food.  It does the channel for people.  Yes. So instead of the food, you don't watch the you might watch the Food Network, Denise, right?  But that doesn't know.  I only watch Tick Tock.  Has become your Food Network.  And for me, it's the Bikini Network.  And for you know, it's different.  No, it's not. I'm just kidding.  Because my son is a food creator and he's done very well on Tick Tock.  So I do get a lot of food as well.  But but it becomes imagine what if when you turn on your TV, your TV was so smart that it knew exactly what you wanted to watch at this very moment and put on shows.  And because we're all short attention span, you flick up, you flick up, you get the next show.  It's always constantly entertaining.  That's why you have to spend up spending, you know, waking up at four in the morning, having spent four hours of vital sleep time on Tick Tock.  It's brilliant.  And the secret thing is go ahead.  Go ahead, Denise. Then, Doc.

Transcript:  What I've been talking to my people about a lot is for all my friends or students that come to me and they're saying, well, I don't like the way the algorithm works and this and that.  I'm like, you know, you can control the algorithm.  And they're like, what do you mean?  I was like, when you see something that you like, don't just hit the heart button, leave an actual comment, leave a relevant comment or something of that nature.  If you see something that you don't like, do not comment on it.  Do not go to tell that person they're dumb.  Do not go to tell the person you hate them or whatever.  Just let it go, Elsa.  And if you do that, it's all good.  Yeah.

So like you actually control the algorithm.

I'm sorry, the Gen Z is loving this song.  And the millennials pushed him out of way.  And then they listen to the version that's the millennial version.  And then we come in is like, no, it's actually older than you think.  We slide them off the way.  And then so the most recent one is off the Tom Tom Club track, which is like was then, you know, Mariah Carey fantasy for the millennials.  But then now it's some other song with the big, big energy.  And it's like Tom Tom Club is 1977 player.  I don't know where you at.

Transcript:  You guys, you're making me feel really old because I for years have been saying Bang A Gong was originally T-Rex.  Forget this twisted sister.  So it comes around. It goes around and it comes around.  I'll never forget years ago.  Listening to the high school marching band, we used to live in a house on the hill that we'd hear the high school marching band.  And then and then they would have lunch and they'd play rock music.  And it was always music from the 60s and 70s.  I thought this is something going on.  This is very strange.  So maybe there is this maybe this is what happens is there's nostalgia for the stuff before you were born.  I do want to give credit actually to Scott Rosenberg, who was I think the founder of Salon, I want to say, used to write for the exam or anything,  because he wrote an axios, The Sunset of the Social Network.  And it was he, I think, who first pointed out that these the social network is being replaced now by the Discovery Engine, by the television channel, by TikTok and YouTube and so forth.  And it makes it hard for these companies to succeed because they just like the phone company that missed the boat on SMS.  It's as you said, it's the innovators dilemma, Brian.  It's hard to take that business that making a lot of money and say, yeah, it's over.  Anyway, very interesting article from Scott Rosenberg on Axios.  Let's take a little break.  We will come back with more with our esteemed panel, Brian McCullough from the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.  Do you ever do your Internet history stuff anymore?  I ask you that every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's so funny for two reasons.  One, because we needed a creator liaison at YouTube in general.  There was no one doing that.  Nobody was really doing it.  And then it's funny because I'm like, you know, Renee and I have been friends for years.  So I feel like I got a man on the inside.  So it's kind of funny.  And it's not that, you know, I'm like, I'm never going to bother him and call him up me like, you know, I always call him R2.  But yeah, I just really appreciate that they decided and I wish more companies would think about that.  You need liaisons for the actual users of the platform or in their case, the creators of the platform.  So it was a very awesome move for Renee.  He well deserved it.  And yes, nice to have a homie on the inside.  Yes.

Transcript:  And Denise Howell, the one and only from DeniseHowell.info.  Dee Howell on the Twitter.  Our show today brought to you by a company I'm fond of.  I love these guys, Mint Mobile.  You've seen the incredible Ryan Reynolds ads.  I just love their attitude, their style.  And what Mint Mobile is doing, I think, is really important for consumers.  After years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big, big wireless, big cellular.  If we've learned anything that we learned is always a catch.  So perhaps when I tell you you're not you're just not going to believe it.  When I tell you Mint Mobile offers premium wireless service at 15 bucks a month, you're going to say, no, Leo, because I'm going to end up paying three times that I know.  No, it's not true.  I know because I use Mint Mobile.  There isn't a catch.  Mint Mobile's secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online only.  No stores saves them a lot of overhead and also really cheesy ads.  And they pass those sweet savings directly on to you.  Mint Mobile is really remarkable.  Premium wireless.  All plans come with unlimited talk and text, unlimited plus high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network.  It's T-Mobile, I'll tell you.  And you're paying only for what you need.  So for most people, 15 bucks a month with just four gigabytes of data a month is more than enough.  Check your bill. See how much data you use every month.  They have unlimited plans.  Thirty bucks a month.  I mean, you know, and I bought the year long plan.  It's a great deal.  You know, you can bring your own phone if you want.  They'll send you the SIM. No charge.  Everybody else charges for the SIM, not Mint Mobile.  So you can use your own phone. Keep your phone number if you want.  You can move it over.  You keep all your contacts and stuff or you can buy phones for them.  In fact, I got an iPhone SE for a great price from Mint Mobile.  Mint Mobile is just really about giving you the service you want from people who really love the biz.  Mint Mobile. Get premium wireless service starting at 15 bucks a month.  There's no catch.  Ten gigs, 20 bucks a month, 15 gigs.  That's the one I got. 15 gigs a month for 25 bucks a month.  Or the unlimited plan.  You pick what you need.  I think for most people, four gigs a month is plenty.  That's $15. What are you paying now for wireless service?  A lot more than that.  To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door for free,  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  They got a family plan too. You bet.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile, for doing what you do and for supporting our show.  We appreciate it.  And you support our show by using that address.  Please do, because then they know you saw it here.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Here's a big sea change.  I don't know what this means.  Maybe our esteemed panel can explain it.  For the first time ever in Q2, cable lost broadband market share.  A negative growth quarter.  People are moving away from cable internet service.  How do we explain that?  The top seven U.S. cable companies lost over 60,000 subscribers April, May, and June.  Comcast, the number one internet service provider in the country, was flat.  Gained no new users.  Number two, Charter lost 21,000 customers.  Number three, Altice lost 39,000 customers.  Is this just a blip or is this signaling a sea change?

Transcript:  Isn't this the promise of 5G?  5G was going to be so fast that it was going to be...  So you add that to the fact that not everybody needs a computer.  If you just do all of your computing on your phone and you can't really tell the  difference in speed between...  Because remember, even if you have the best ISP in the world, you're still limited to  your Wi-Fi speeds.  So maybe people are just like, hey, this is good enough.  No worries.  I think you nailed it.

Start time: 4683.91
End time: 4687.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  I have a PS to that.  Yeah, go ahead.

Start time: 4688.32
End time: 4702.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The PS to that is for power users, cable can't get fiber to a lot of places.  So I know that we dumped our cable to go with AT&T because they could get us fiber.

Start time: 4702.90
End time: 4743.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, AT&T has been aggressive in rolling out fiber.  In fact, it's interesting because Google had stopped doing fiber, Google fiber.  They just announced, I think, five new cities and they're going to be rolling out more fiber.  So maybe this is fiber's time.  It's 5G's time.  I agree.  Both T-Mobile and Verizon are selling home internet service now wirelessly.  For my daughter, who lives near a highway, so she's near a Verizon Towers, I bought it's  $25 a month.  She's getting 150 megabytes down, I think 20 up for nothing.  And it's just a wireless box you put in there, you turn it on and it works.  Doc Rock, you were going to say something.

Start time: 4743.84
End time: 4804.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say a couple of things that are going on as well.  When everybody started looking at places to sort of pinch pockets a little bit, if you  have, for instance, Verizon, they were doing your Netflix streaming doesn't count against  your bill.  So each one of the companies has a thing that they offer for free without using your data  plan or whatever.  So for instance, in AT&T, it was HBO, which I think might change now that it got sold.  But anyway, people are using that to watch what they need to watch or just ignoring the  watching all together and just watching the social stuff because T-Mobile has streaming.  You can stream stuff on YouTube or whatever without taxing your bill.  So then you don't need that at the house and you get your broadband outside at work or  whatever to do the heavy lifting stuff.  But most of your just consumption stuff you can do on iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Android  TV boxes and the like.

Transcript:  It's kind of like the end of the landline phone, right?  People just doing everything on their cell.  It is the case that fixed wireless, that's what they call the T-Mobile and Verizon home  internet.  It's fixed wireless.  Huge growth, 816,000 new subscribers in Q4.  Wait, what was that?  Wow.  Yeah.  So there you go.  T-Mobile and Verizon are seeing steady gains for their FWA fixed wireless services, which  together picked up 816,000 subs in Q2, April, May and June of this year.

Transcript:  Well, again, this is what they told us was going to happen.  I just got so jaded about the fact that 5G showed up and we're not having the telemedicine  surgeries yet or whatever.  So I thought it was overblown hype, but maybe it's just now happening.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Right?  And also I just switched to a different carrier, which I won't name for various sponsor reasons

Start time: 4923.16
End time: 4932.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and things like that.  But we should mention Mint Mobile is a sponsor.  Mint Mobile is great.  But no, you don't have to say that at all.  You can even mention your other carrier.

Start time: 4933.42
End time: 4959.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sponsor my show as well.  So I do love Mint Mobile.  Oh, okay.  So you don't want to say the other carrier.  So but the other thing that has just happened since I did that switch, I never used to get  a millimeter wave.  And I live in New York City.  So that was also why I got jaded.  I was like, okay, it's a year, two years in.  It's just tight.  I'm switching this on.  It's just tight.  But now I've been getting it.  Really?  It actually is noticeable that it's faster.

Start time: 4960.28
End time: 4975.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, still millimeter wave, which is the fastest gigabit plus telco cellular data is  very, very limited, both in locations and range.  It only goes 800 feet.  So you must be living near a tower.

Transcript:  And weird places because it's on my walk.  I do walks and runs around Prospect Park and then Windsor Terrace on Prospect Park, Southwest.  Boom, it shows up.  Exactly.  But then, you know, Grand Army Plaza where there's tons of people, it never shows up.  Yeah, when it does show up, it is noticeable.  You will notice a difference.

Start time: 4993.88
End time: 5054.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the big change though was the mid band, the rollout of the mid band.  So there are three bands.  There's millimeter wave, which is a very, very high frequency.  There's the 700 megahertz low frequency, which is really no faster than LTE.  So you could be on it.  Technically, it's 5G, but you'd never know.  But and I'm seeing it here.  I'm seeing it everywhere.  This is what my daughter is getting.  There's this mid band, which is very fast, is noticeably faster than LTE.  That is being very widely rolled out by all the big three carriers.  And I think that is really what's happening.  And that's the yeah, I like you, Duck.  I mocked 5G.  I remember that Apple announcement, not last year, but the year before, where they said  5G every three seconds.  Maybe it was they were too early on it.  Maybe they were jumping on this marketing thing.  But I think it is now starting to happen.  And I think maybe that you're exactly right.  That's what's happening to Comcast, Charter, Cox, Altice, MediaCom, Cable One and BreezeLine.

Transcript:  Now, I noticed that Spectrum is not on the list, but it's funny because that's our  building contract for the condo.  They just came in and stuck in all of the internal fiber lines.  So we're switching over to Spectrum Fiber middle September while I'm on my road trip.

Start time: 5074.22
End time: 5089.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're not on this list probably because they didn't announce their quarterly  results this past week.  But between the big broadband companies, they still have 75 million households of the 109  million households that are getting broadband.  So they're still dominant.

Start time: 5089.88
End time: 5097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5097.94
End time: 5167.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they only have 2.2 million.  These are brand new services.  And if they're growing at the rate of nearly a million a quarter, it ain't going to be  long before.  And that's got to be growing at the cost of the cable companies.  I think that's very interesting.  Cable companies are suffering anyway.  People are watching streaming now.  It's a fascinating time to watch the turmoil in streaming services and in cable companies  and the battle.  And then now you're seeing, for instance, companies like Google and Apple come after  sports contracts.  We've talked before about the Sunday ticket, which is a two and a half billion contract  with NFL that DirecTV paid one and a half billion for it, what is it, four or five years  ago has been losing half a billion dollars a year on it.  It's not been a very good deal for them.  And they're not bidding on it when it comes up next year.  But the companies that can afford to bid two and a half billion dollars for Sunday ticket  are Google, Apple, Amazon.  These are companies that are not in the traditional broadcast business or the cable business.

If they would use these as a test ground for doing a better job than the networks do.  That's the real threat to the networks.  What if we did it 4K?

I think Apple's really interested, maybe you European types know it as football, but I  think Apple's really interested in taking something that is not yet a huge sport in  America but has the promise of becoming a huge sport and getting behind it and making  it.

Transcript:  I love it.  I love it.  All right.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Elon Musk sells more Tesla shares.  We haven't done a good Elon story in a while, have we?  It's time.  It's time.  But first, Worldwide Technology and HPE.  We love these guys.  Worldwide Tech is at the forefront of innovation, working with clients all over the world to  transform their businesses.  These days, if you're an enterprise, you need to know about technology.  You need to be engaged.  You need to see how it can change your business.  But to do that, you need a partner.  And you need a partner who understands business.  I think this is really important.  They're not just technologists.  WWT understands business, understands your strategy, and is always working to make your  come alive using technology.  So that's the kind of partner you want.  And it all starts for WWT at their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center.  It's a research and testing lab.  Used to be the magazines would do this.  Now WWT is completely taken over.  It started about 10 years ago with a rack of equipment in one building.  It's now in multiple buildings, over half a billion dollars in equipment in the lab.  All the latest technologies.  And WWT's engineers use this to spin up proofs of concept, to do pilots so customers can  select the best solutions, to test integrations with existing technology.  So they're really the experts in cutting edge technology.  So it helps cut WWT's evaluation time down from months to weeks.  Now their partners are using it.  And this is the biggest change.  Now WWT offers the ATC for you, for everybody.  Anybody who's a member of the ATC platform, it's free to join.  Can get access to hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs like HPE's Primera Storage  Lab along with labs representing the newest advances in everything you'd want to find  out about for your business.  Multi-cloud architecture, security of course.  I'll never forget going to see the ATC and there was this whole rack, about three or  four racks in a separate room, in a separate cage, completely separate.  I said, what are those?  And they said, well, that's where we do our virus testing and our security testing, our  exploit testing.  And we keep that air gap from the other ones off in a corner.  But you know what?  That's how committed they are.  They really put the money into making this happen.  You could study networking, of course, primary and secondary, storage, all the storage solutions.  They all light up differently.  It's really quite beautiful.  Data analytics, AI, DevOps.  They're on top of all the latest technology, both hardware, software, operations, management,  compliance.  They're the experts.  And thanks to the ATC, you can test out products and solutions before you go to market.  Not just hands-on labs, you get access to technical articles, to expert insights, to  demonstration videos and white papers, all the tools you need to stay up to date with  the latest technology.  a CIO, if you work in technology at a big company and you're not using the ATC, you're  missing out on one of the most important tools you could have.  It's a physical lab space.  Sure, in St. Louis, we visited it a couple of years ago, but it's completely virtual  now, which means if you're a member of the ATC platform, you can access it anywhere in  the world any day of the year.  And while you're there, check out WWT's events and communities.  We did a great event for them.  It was so much fun.  They are doing lots of panels.  They have great communities.  So it's a chance to learn about technology trends and hear the latest research and insights  from all the experts.  I am so impressed by WWT because they understand it's not just selling technology.  It's about empowering their partners.  It's about partnership.  It's about community.  And they do it so well.  Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions  for you.  They bring strategy and execution together to make this exciting new world happen.

Thank you, WWT, for supporting This Week in Tech.  What is Elon up to?  He just sold another big tranche of stock, almost $7 billion worth.  So that means he has now sold how much Tesla stock?  $32 billion worth of Tesla stock over the last year.  Is it because he thinks he might be forced to buy Twitter?  He offered $44 billion.

Transcript:  That's one of the theories.  What's the other?  The other theory would be that, you know, because a lot of people conspiracy theory  being that he just wants the price to come down.  But what if, remember, half of it is his money and half of it is all of the...  He's talking about the Twitter price.

Start time: 5868.14
End time: 5878.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't want the Tesla price to go down.  He wants the Twitter price to go down.  Twitter price to come down.  That's his fear because the Tesla price has been going down because he committed Tesla  stock to this.

Transcript:  What if all the banks and everyone else in the consortium that's doing the other half  of this deal with him is getting cold feet?  And because they're like, we don't want to be on the hook for this necessarily anymore  because it's overpaying.  So he's sort of giving himself a cushion that if he can get the price to come down,  he could do the whole deal himself with all his money or at least most of his money.

Start time: 5938.69
End time: 5956.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, there's a real reason.  Oh, there is good.  Why?  Oh, yeah, because Delaware has very strategically over the years made itself the place where  everyone wants to incorporate.  It's very business advantageous in its laws.  So you pay...

Start time: 5956.48
End time: 5962.28

Start time: 5977.58
End time: 5979.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just a panel of judges or is there a jury?

Start time: 5980.82
End time: 6033.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe it's...  You know, that's a good question.  I don't see a jury box in this picture.  I don't see a jury box in the picture either.  But I don't know.  I mean, I don't think that, you know, incorporating as a Delaware corporation means that you  waive jury trial if you have disputes.  Yeah.  So I'm not quite sure.  You know, again, this is...  There must be a jury in most cases.  This is a contract case and there may be questions of fact as to...  In fact, there probably are questions of fact as to what the evidence shows about  what the parties did and didn't do and whether the contract was breached.  So I don't know if we're going to see a jury in this or not.  I would be surprised if the parties waive a jury to be in front of this court and get  more speed.  That's something that could be the case.

Transcript:  Elon himself kind of implied that he's worried that this could go against him.  He tweeted when he sold the stock in the hopefully unlikely event that Twitter forces this deal  to close and some equity partners don't come through.  Remember, and I don't even know if the Chancery Court can force the equity partners to put  up the money.  You know, that $44 billion is not all Elon's money.  Some of it is from Saudi Arabia, Larry Ellison, a variety of equity partners.  I don't think they can be compelled to...  They can easily say, yeah, well, guess what, Elon, we're not giving you the money now.  So he says in the unlikely event, hopefully unlikely event, that Twitter forces this deal  to close and some equity partners don't come through, it's important to avoid an emergency  sale of Tesla stock.  So in other words, he's trying to cash out.  He also says, and if I win in court, I'll buy the stock back.

Start time: 6099.42
End time: 6135.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure that's in the contract, don't you think?  This was a case of Elon saying, I'm going to buy it and Twitter saying, okay.  First they said, oh, we're going to, no, poison pill.  And then they gave in like three seconds later.  But I think Twitter basically wrote the most advantageous contract they could.  Basically said, as is sight unseen.  I don't care.  No, no diligence.  And so of course Twitter said, yeah, and you're going to be trying to chance record.  And not only is there a billion dollar breakup fee, but I think they want the whole amount,

Start time: 6136.90
End time: 6153.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right?  The funny thing is I actually did a segment on the show where I just read the opening  paragraphs of the Twitter lawyers response.  Oh, they were so dismissive of Elon, weren't they?  They're having so much fun.  They're having so much fun.

Start time: 6153.88
End time: 6172.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  So I think he's maybe getting some cold feet.  He also maybe said, he's tweeted, all Twitter has to do is give me their method of sampling  a hundred counts and how they're confirmed to be real and the deal can proceed on original  terms.

Start time: 6174.89
End time: 6234.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like that's not part of that's not in the deal.  They don't have to give him anything.  And so then the other thing is, is when he started to ask for more stuff to find out  about these bots, they gave him the whole fire hose.  It's not like they withheld anything.  They're like, OK, we're going to give you every single thing that we have.  And knowing possibly that that's impossible for anyone to actually parse in time.  But also, number two, like they if his argument is that there are bots and there's more bots  than you've told me.  And so there aren't as many real users as you told me.  The other problem is, is that he's on record publicly saying that the reason he wanted  to buy Twitter was to solve the bot problem.  So when you get in the court and you say, I want to get out of this because there's  all these fake users.  He's on stage at TED telling people that the reason he wants Twitter is he wants to fix  this and make it better.

Transcript:  I hope there's a Perry Mason moment where Twitter's lawyers say, Mr. Busk, you know  that your lawyers set us your entire phone log for the last 12 years.  And I don't think that'll happen.  But I'm sure Elon has very, very good lawyers.  Your guy you had on This Week in Law a few times, Andrew Torres, does a great podcast  opening arguments.  I'm sure you're familiar with it.  And I listened to all of their shows about this whole thing.  I think they're of the opinion that what this will end up happening is the court will not  force him to buy Twitter, but will ask for a substantial, much more than a billion dollars  Penalty in effect for basically throwing Twitter's business into turmoil.  Is that possible?

Start time: 6288.76
End time: 6303.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's likely.  I'm also I've always sort of been of the opinion that I'd be surprised if this stayed in court  for too long.  Oh, they may settle.  They're going to get together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we'll never know the terms.

And I know that it depends on if we're talking about, you know, small potatoes things, but  huge, huge things.  How often does a court actually say, I don't care.  You have a million dollars.  You signed a contract for a million dollars.  You're going to pay the million dollars.

Start time: 6330.77
End time: 6340.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  If this actually goes to trial and they have to be they have to perform under the terms  of the contract and it's proven that they breached the contract, that's what will happen.

Transcript:  There is a very famous case in Delaware Chancery Court, I.B.P. versus Tyson.  Tyson had, which is the largest chicken processor in America, had agreed to.  We're talking boxy.  To acquire I.B.P., which is something pork.  It's the pork meatpacking firm.  Very much like Elon agreed to by Twitter.  And then Tyson broke it off.  I.B.P. filed a breach of contract suit, much like Twitter has.  And the court ordered Tyson to go through with the purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  It was similar in the sense that Tyson said, well, we hadn't seen the financials and now  that we've seen them.  Oh, this is terrible.  And then, in fact, the judge said, well, no, you should have known.  And some of the reason it's terrible is because of you.  So it's not an exact analog.  Andrew Torres does a much better job of explaining it than I do, but it's a fairly famous case.  And it is the one example where you could say, yeah, the courts can force you to go  ahead with the purchase.  They did.  They made Tyson buy I.B.P.

Transcript:  Denise, what if you don't have the money?  What if something intervenes in between?  And we know that Elon has the money because he has all the money.  But can a contract be voided at that point?  Because in the intervening time, I don't know, you lost half your whatever?

Start time: 6443.30
End time: 6460.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all.  You'd still get a judgment that the party who the judgment favors can try and enforce  however they can.  It doesn't matter if there's no money there.  They can they can go to garnish Elon's wages.  They can go on a hunt for other assets.

You know, it's funny, back in the day, Steve was probably one of the most brilliant.  I'm sure he wasn't alone, but it's the one that we all know about of like setting  himself up with the dollar salary.  It's so hard to like get in trouble when you're like, hey, I just get paid a buck,  you know, and then they'll work around it, of course, and try, like you say, to go  after assets. But I don't know.  Elon is just a weird character and it's just what makes it worse.  Like if he was more normal acting, I think more people would maybe side with him.  But he just does strange things.

Start time: 6509.46
End time: 6547.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I have such mixed feelings about him because SpaceX is remarkable.  You and I both.  I had a Tesla. I was really impressed with what Elon had done.  He didn't kind of remember part of the plan with Tesla was to get rich people to  buy the expensive ones to finance the development of a low cost EV.  And he had planned to sell a Model 3, I think, for 35,000.  You can't get it for less than 46, 47 right now.  So he never kind of lived up to that promise.  But I think still we wouldn't have the electric vehicle market we have today  without Elon and Tesla.

There's a thing where people who are well-intentioned innovators  start moving up the chain.  And it's like they get at a very particular point where the billionaire  switch comes in and they go be as crazy.  Kanye fits in that description.  Elon, you know, and that's why there's a whole entire song.  I really like the old Kanye because he was always eccentric.  But he got super weird once he got like dumb rich.  And Elon did the same similar thing like he was this great guy for a minute.  And then all of a sudden he just hit a level where let me start trying to like  buy stuff in. Yeah.  A toxic wealth is probably the best explanation.

And, you know, at the end, you know, one of the things that she said,  which is funny because they're really trying to add in a little McKinsey  and a little Melinda into this character.  And she says billionaires shouldn't exist.  Like, I can see. Yeah.  It was a well-stated point.  And then right after she went back to doing something billionaire oriented,  which was, you know, they all say that and they all act like they're being  altruistic. But most of their altruism is feeding egos.  And do you need a side?  Confuses me. The only thing I really my faith.  I mean, I know stuff about legal stuff, but my favorite term is frolic and detour.  And I don't get to use that one frolic in detour.  Yeah, that's my favorite legal term. What does that mean?  Do you know that when you're working for a company and you stop acting like an  employee to do your own thing? I'm frolicing. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ever learned. We need the incentive of possibly becoming a billionaire to get  people to create, to innovate, to make, build companies.  Is that a necessary incentive?  Because that would be the argument for allowing, I mean, for having billionaires.

Start time: 6697.20
End time: 6748.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I get that's why that works.  But what happens is, imagine, OK, so  granted there's boards and there's other things in place, but someone like a  single person, especially a person who has shown that there might be  something, you know, and it's not at the full picnic to get over to a  platform that controls that many people's communication.  That's a scary thought. And I think anybody with that much power does get a  little punch drunk.  And so they're probably no longer good to single handedly control a body of  people. It almost it almost stands to reason like how is it that four or five  hundred people are in charge of three hundred and ninety million of us?  It's a it's a really weird situation.  I think it's time to rethink this.

And the phrase originated in Joel versus Morris in an English case from  the eighteen hundreds, which clarified, get ready for this, that a master is  liable for actions a servant takes stemming from a master servant relationship  where a servant takes a detour while acting in the scope of employment, but is  not liable where a servant goes on a frolic of his own that exceeds the scope  of employment. By the way, there's a great novel called a frolic of his own.  But that's now I know where that term comes from.  I had no idea at the time.  Frolic and the briars.  I'm frolicing on my own here.

If you ever go to a graduation at one of the old schools and you see the crazy gowns  that the professors wear with the floppy hats and the velvet and all this, you realize  it's completely a medieval institution.  It's straight out of the 15th century.

They launched those and then their information coming off of the rocket and then they deploy  to their locations.  But when you first see them before their deployment to their various locations, it's  just a line of satellites that have just come off the rocket.  And it looks like a Santa Claus.  Yeah.

And then you find out, oh, yeah, but first you have to spend six hundred dollars on a  satellite dish and then it's going to be one hundred ten dollars a month.

So they test their rovers.  He's up there with him and he calls, call the radio show today via iridium satellite  phone. It's a perfect example.  You might say, oh, wow, iridium.  They're going to that it's 60 satellites.  It's going to give phone access to every corner of the globe.  Yeah. If you've got, you know, what was it?  I think he said it was like like a hundred bucks a megabyte or something.  I mean, if you have a huge amount of money, this is great.  Starlink is not designed.

They have a beach house somewhere in Mass, I think, Salisbury-ish, and they use the  Starlink to do the live stream to the Ecamm community once a month to tell them what  they're working on.  And it works amazingly.  I was originally worried that it would crap out in the middle of the show, but it seems  to work.

Transcript:  I don't know. Let me read it.  We're going to see a lot of these stories.  We have a ton of them today from Black Hat Def Con.  This is the time of year where all of a sudden you find out everything you know has been  hacked. Belgian security researcher Leonard Wooters, who is very well known, has gotten  his own code running on the Dishy McDishface satellite terminals.  And you can too.  The hack is Dishy McDishface.  That's what they call them.  It's a mod chip with an RP 2040 and a MOSFET that crowbars the power rails.  So, you know, anybody could do this.  Browning out the main CPU exactly when it's verifying the firmware's validity, bypassing  that protection.  Oh, that's clever entirely.  Leonard had previously figured out how to dump the Starlink firmware direct from the  EMMSC and then upload it back.  So now the circle of ponorship is closed.  There was a talk at Def Con, of course, about $25 in parts.  Leonard has submitted his attack to Starlink and he says they took some precautions to  make the glitching harder.  But it's not like they can't really disable it.  It's almost impossible to shield a device against an attacker who has it on the bench.  So, yeah, you can't just go around and drive around town and hack people's Starlink.  You know, you got to get access to it.  Elon's in a little bit more trouble with the California Department of Motor Vehicles.  They are accusing Tesla of deceptive practices in marketing autopilot and full self-driving.  The penalties could be as bad as losing the ability to sell Tesla's in the U.N.  California.  Tesla has not yet, as far as I know, responded to these allegations.  They I think they were supposed to by Friday, but I haven't seen the story that they have.  So, you know, I don't know what the upshot of this is.  Maybe they're going to ask Tesla to put an asterisk next to autopilot and full self-driving.  Maybe they'll ask him to change the name.  And I think I agree with them that saying it's full self-driving or calling it autopilot is risky.  It gives some people the feeling that they can get in the back seat and take a nap, which they cannot.

So I had like an hour and a half everyday train ride.  And the one dope part about high speed rail is I spent all that time doing work.  Like I would actually do my homework instead because I would be partying.  Isn't that awesome?  And it's awesome.  So you're on a train.

You know, people who produce shows often want to know how many people watch?  There's one person, a hundred thousand.  People don't get it from Netflix either.  No streamer does.  Except I don't buy that.  Well, Apple knows, right?  Netflix knows.  They've got to be saying, look, you can't admit that you know this, but oh, I'm just  going to write it right here.  Right?

If you look at what the content creators are telling you, we're telling you.  Oh, interesting.  You don't have to get the exact numbers from it.  Just watch us.  We tell you.

People throwing money at you saying, please produce something for our streaming channel.  And then so among it's not just money.  I'm sure it's also, oh, we can give you prestige or we'll push you for nominations for Oscars  or Emmys or, you know, but I think a missing point of it that the networks, the television  networks can offer is we'll tell you how many people saw this episode.

Start time: 7729.02
End time: 7798.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's a problem that I fight with.  And I think you will understand this because you do this as a business.  My thing is trying to teach my creators do not get sucked into staring at the analytics  and start making knee jerk reactions based off the analytics.  Your only true algorithm is your actual audience.  So pay attention to your audience.  Listen to what they're telling you.  When YouTube starts to show you these weird blips in your ad revenue because, you know,  companies stop spending during July because they know everybody's on vacation.  Don't freak out and think that means that your content isn't being hit.  And so the problem with algorithms is you make false adjustments and in turn do stupid  things that alienate your audience.  But if you listen to your audience, they will always guide you in the direction that they  want you to go.  So I try to tell people, stop staring at the algorithms.  And so, yeah, somebody mentioned that awards don't equal viewers, but paying attention  to what the viewers are actually telling you.  Listen to the podcast, setting up Q&A's that can be live streamed on Twitch or YouTube  or whatever with your audience doing a show like this where you have your whole audience  in the chat telling you what to do.  That's way more valuable than numbers.

Transcript:  But that's how YouTube and broadcast are different than broadcast television.  Correct.  Right.  Broadcasters have no eye.  They don't have a two-way.  Some years ago before he passed, it was actually he had just announced he was retiring.  I taught Regis Philbin how to tweet on how to Twitter.  There's actually a YouTube video of it.  And so he tweeted, I just announced my retirement today on the show.  And he started getting all these responses back.  And he was so excited because here's a guy who had been 50 years in broadcasting.  He never got that kind of feedback.  He called his wife.  He said, Joy, Joy, go look on Twitter.  They're talking to me.  By the way, he quit Twitter within a week because he couldn't handle it.  These guys are not used to that feedback.  But I got to tell you, if you're a television producer, you want to know, well, how many  people watch show one?  How many people watch show 10?  Did it go up?  Did it go down?  That's valuable information.  And Apple, I cannot believe that Apple is not telling Ben Stiller how Severance is doing.  He says they give us charts with no zero.  It's up.  It's down.  They don't give us the numbers.  That's very Apple-y.  I think in the long run, that's not going to work for Apple.  The producers want to know how many people saw this show.  I really do.  And I might be wrong.  Maybe not.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  I've kept you so long.  I've got a couple more things to do.  I do want to talk about some of the silliest things that happened this week.  But first, a word from a great sponsor.  Click up.  Imagine if you could get a show that's going to be a hit.  If you could get an extra day every week, instead of five-day work week, four days,  what would that be worth to you?  What would you do?  Would you binge Severance?  No, that's what Doc would do.  Cook healthy meals, work out more, write a novel.  You could take advantage of that extra day a week.  Well, that's what ClickUp gives you.  The productivity platform that is so effective, it will save you one day of work,  one day of work a week, one day of work a week.  And that's guaranteed.  I know you don't believe me, but it's guaranteed.  ClickUp was started because they realized productivity was broken.  There were too many tools to keep track of, too many things.  All the ecosystems were siloed, separate, didn't talk to one another.  They knew there had to be a better way to get through the daily hustle.  So they created ClickUp.  The one tool, I love it.  When a startup scratches their own itch, they solved their own problem.  And that's why it works so well.  It's the one tool that houses all your tasks, your projects, your docs,  your goals, your spreadsheets, your more.  Built for teams from a single person, ClickUp will help you, to a thousand plus people.  It's packed with features and customization options  that no other productivity tool has.  So you can tailor it to work exactly how you do.  Whether you're in project management or engineering or sales or marketing or HR,  ClickUp has easy use solutions that create a more efficient work environment.  I think that's a nice kind of balancing act.  Yes, it's highly customizable.  But from day one, you'll get started with a setup that is tuned  for the kind of work you do and then you can refine it if you want.  This explains a lot.  800,000 highly productive teams are using ClickUp.  That's huge success.  I'm going to get you 15% off ClickUp's massive unlimited plan.

They sold Sierra online.  But they brought you King's Quest and Space Quest, Quest for Glory.  They were the original graphic adventures.  Remember?  But in the old days, before graphic adventures, there were text adventures.  You might remember if you're old, Zork and Planet Fall and those Infocom adventures.  But even before that, I used to play it on a dial-up modem.  Dialing into CompuServe, there was a game by Will Crowther and Don Woods called  Colossal Cave Adventure.  And this was the first text adventure, an amazing adventure game.  I loved it.  So Ken and Roberta have got together and they've made a graphic version of Colossal Cave.  Get your Plug and your XYZZY ready.  This is very exciting.  This was a great game.  It's more than 50 years old.  You can still play if you search for Colossal Cave online.

Transcript:  Ken and Roberta coming back.  Colossal Cave was released in 1976.  Ken and Roberta assembled a team of almost 30 artists and programmers  to do a graphical version of this classic text adventure.  Roberta on the podcast said none of them really knew what Colossal Cave was.  Yeah, 1976.  They weren't even born.  We've had to educate them.  All I have to say, she said, is that as we've worked with them on this game  in various ways, programmers, animators, artists,  they've come to have such respect for this game.

Transcript:  We had a good week.  I hope you will come back and watch more shows this week.  And a reminder to Club Twip members, you have exclusive access to that Hands on Windows show,  brand new from Paul Thurotte.  You also have exclusive access to Club Twip members,  have exclusive access to the Hands on Macintosh show that Micah Sargent's doing,  our Ultimate Linux show.  What we've been doing is we launch shows in the Club because Club members are paying for it  before we can get advertisers.  This way, you help us launch new shows.  And then shows like This Week in Space, which launched in the Club,  then gets launched, quite literally, into the public space once we build up the audience.  This is one of the most important things that Club Twip does.  At seven bucks a month, you get ad-free versions of all the shows,  access to the fabulous Discord where there's always great content going on and conversations.  That's really a social network.  And then the Twip Plus feed.  But that seven bucks a month really helps us also generate new content.  We have lots of plans for the future thanks to our Club members.  If you're not a member yet, twit.tv slash clubtwit.  And I should mention that what we are doing with Hands on Mac and Hands on Windows is shows that  are of broader general interest.  We're putting those out on YouTube, on our Twit channel on YouTube.  So you can at least get a taste of what the show is like.  And so I think there is a Hands on Windows coming out that has Windows shortcuts.  Micah did one looking at the brand new Mac OS.  So those are available on our YouTube feed as well, just to give you a taste.  And thanks to all our Club members.  Did you see this Netflix?  Speaking of games, Netflix launched games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this, when I framed this story on my show, I said, can someone tell me is this good or  terrible, terrible, terrible?  It sounds terrible if it's less than 1%.  But if the whole point is that they want to do new things to keep you inside the app,  to give value so you don't feel bad about paying the subscription.  If 1.7 million people are playing games on Netflix.  Good point.  Every day.  Terrible.  No, that's a good point.  You've given 1.7 million people another reason to keep paying the subscription.

Start time: 8880.74
End time: 8894.46

Transcript:  So these are all time for it to mature, right?  Like people need to figure out because people still think that Discord is just for gamers.  And as you and I and other people are starting to really thriving amazing communities,  I'm still getting but isn't Discord just for gamers?  I don't want to do that.  Right.  Like, no, man.  So labeling.  Yeah.  Denise, what were you going to say?

Start time: 8918.18
End time: 8927.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8928.34
End time: 8981.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all of the above.  And one of the weird things is that they're limiting it, at least right now,  to tie ins to their existing shows.  So it's like strange, stranger things.  The game.  Yeah.  Which maybe is good because then it grows affinity or whatever.  But like, so they're not trying to build their own Fortnite yet.  Right.  Right.  But again, like if the issue is, is they lost subscribers for the first time ever last quarter  and they just have to, they're trying to throw anything against the wall to see what sticks in  terms of adding more value to keep people subscribing because of all the new competition.  I don't know.  Like even if it was just Snake or Solitaire, but 1.7 million people a day were in the  Netflix app to play Snake or Solitaire, that doesn't hurt them.  It's a good point.

Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of it has to do with education.  Okay. So when I first went to Japan, we were just getting into like the handheld console games  like the was PSP and the Game Boy, the second version of the Game Boy, the DS, when you open it.  And they were very small market here in the U.S. at that particular time.  When I went to Japan and I'm in a train riding culture and then going to Korea  right after in another train riding culture, everybody's in there with some small micro  thing in your hand doing that.  So even the idea of watching TV shows and movies or whatever in your hand seems weird.  When I was in Japan, Manga in your phone has comic books like just going down.  Everybody like 8 to 80 blind, crippled, crazy.  Everyone's reading this stuff on their phone.  We see so many things from our own lens and we're not anywhere near the biggest market  as we saw in the WhatsApp thing a minute ago.  In places like China and in certain areas in Korea and Japan, the computer is basically  the one that fits in your pocket.  They don't have the time, the space or the wherewithal to even own a full computer.  So we have to start to do that a little bit more, like understand there is a global lens  to these things so I can see Netflix gaming growing.  But if we're looking at it from the lens of where we sit today, no, you just don't  understand it.  You're thinking about it from your perspective.

Transcript:  Doc, I want you to go after me, but let me step on this real quick because the long-term  play for everything, the solution for Netflix's problem is their own IP library, right?  They got to have a winning show.  If they owned Star Wars, it wouldn't be a problem because they'd have a great Star Wars  game to go along with the Star Wars shows that are coming out or whatever.  So this, the long-term thing is they are, someone's again, smarter than me, said this  this week, they're becoming a media company, which they always were, but they got a certain  halo by pretending to be a tech company all this time.  And Doc, I'm sorry to step on you, but that-  But no, the economics of media is what's happening.

Start time: 9201.49
End time: 9245.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.  So they're trying to do that as well.  And what's going to happen is I think they'll eventually get there, but they are in the same  position as TV and radio was when we first got to sort of the end of the Tower Records  era.  Give the people what they want.  And if you're paying attention, stop dumping all your money on these big shows that tank  when they could have went and bought literally 300 really good top level YouTube shows with  million followings and they would have been bigger for them than to do that.  Right.  Like I'm not going to say that Leo wants to sell, but if Netflix came in and said, hey,  let's put the Twit universe on Netflix.  No, they wouldn't buy me.

Does anybody else get irritated when you're watching a movie or a TV show or something  like, you know, stranger things and you see a shark jumping moment that says, oh, they're  going to make a video game out of this part.  No, have you seen that?  Is that the case?  Oh, yes.  All the time, especially in sci-fi movies or things where they think that might  generate.

He asked Comcast.  They said that'll be $50,000 to trench out to your house.  So instead, he went out and got wholesale fiber, created an ISP for 30 homes.  That's by itself a success story.  Washten off fiber properties.

Transcript:  He's got the way I lived in Washtenaw County for five years.  That's where Ann Arbor is.  So now granted, there are rural areas even outside of Ann Arbor.  But it's not like this is like, you know, the Upper Peninsula or something.

Start time: 9531.20
End time: 9567.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it's not woods.  But yeah, he has 70 customers.  But now here's the best story.  The American rescue plans, coronavirus state and local fiscal recovery funds.  A $71 million fund to Washtenaw County.  Some of that's going to be dedicated to Mock.  He's going to actually get a couple of mil to add more properties.  The government says you need to add 417 addresses in Freedom, Lima, Lodi.  And how do you pronounce that?  Scio?  Sio.

Start time: 9568.18
End time: 9578.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So of course, Sio.  Hey, listen, there's a there's a there's a there's a Mylan, Michigan  that is spelled Milan.  Oh, I know.  Michigan Michiganers love to they like to make Maconaw.

Start time: 9578.78
End time: 9608.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is is Lima pronounced Lima or Lima?  Lima.  Lima.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Lodi in California, we say Lodi.  Do they say Lodi?  Lodi.  Lodi.  Okay.  So the contract from the feds says you have to add 714 locations.  He said this is so much money.  I can add another 600 fiber customers to my my my plan.  I think this is so such a great story of local local internet.

Start time: 9608.58
End time: 9626.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did that one too.  And I love it because again, it's just sort of like it's sort of like a DIY project that  took off that he didn't exist because he says in the story something like, well,  they did a request for proposal and I sent in one that took the whole thing.  And that was probably stupid.

Start time: 9630.60

Transcript:  2.6 million dollars in the federal funds to build out his ISP.  So that's a happy story.  I like to end.  That is a great story.

Start time: 9638.17
End time: 9668.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny too.  The original sort of thing I saw in this is probably like two or three years old and  he was first starting out and all of the comments were very hate commenting about,  well, he had to be rich because he needed to have the money to dig the trenches and  all of that.  I like people.  You guys are missing the point.  I mean, first of all, the guys, you know, lives up there and he has a boat and,  you know, he obviously wasn't like coming from the complete pauper situation.  But still, can I give the comment?  Can I give the context doc?

Start time: 9668.44
End time: 9688.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it was is Comcast said we will string the wire to your house.  It'll cost you 10,000 or no.  He said that if they had said 10,000 dollars, I would have paid it.  But they quoted him 50,000 dollars.  And that's why he started his ISP.  So right.  Not everyone has 10,000 dollars to string cable to their house.

Start time: 9689.06
End time: 9717.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, it was just funny.  Just watch the hate comments.  But I'm like, what he did was brilliant.  Like, let it go.  People like you live in a different place and you don't come against it.  I got it.  But it was just funny.  And this is common for, you know, my side of the world, which is YouTube.  There's a lot of yap talking in there that people don't know what they're talking about.  But it is kind of funny that that was what they went for.  Not that he actually went up against the multi-trillion dollar industry.  That was the better thought.  So it was a great story.

Yeah, I do want to take a time to give a shout out to Ken and Glenn, our founders,  not just because they're my bosses, but they're really my friends.  They're really great guys.  And believe it or not, many Mac users use stuff that they invented that they might not know,  like printopia or Skype call recorder or some of the other stuff they made long before they  made E cam live.

And to all of you, we do tweet every Sunday, around about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern,  2100 UTC.  Actually, you know, theoretically we could start at 2.  It's usually more like 2.30.  But I'll tell you what, you don't want to miss the pre-show.  So tune in, audio or video, live.twit.tv.  If you can't be here at 2100 UTC, you can always get it on demand at our website,  twit.tv.  You can get it on YouTube.  There's a twit channel, This Week in Tech, for just the This Week in Tech show channel.  In fact, all our shows have their own channel.  Or subscribe and your favorite podcast player.  That would be probably the best way to get it.  Thank you for being here.  I think we have to say by now, we must be the longest running tech podcast in existence.  Now in our 18th year.  It's got to be, right?  Thank you for being here all those years and we'll see you next time.  Meanwhile, another twit.
