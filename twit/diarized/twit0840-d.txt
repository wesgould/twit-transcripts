Then I realized that for some reason the Alienware had gone into some sort of weird cycle mode and it looked like a hot tub from the 70s.  It was just going. And then Michael's got a Republic of Gaming desktop that also has extensive LED coverage. It's crazy.

Transcript:  You know, I was born in New York City, so I don't know why, but I feel like that's home in many ways, even though I didn't live there very long.  And I flew back on October 20, 2001 to do a TV show back there. Nobody would go.  So I was the only guy that they could get for live with Regis and Kelly. They said, can you fly?  I said, sure. But I wanted to go out there because I wanted to visit Ground Zero and see and this I'll never forget, you know, the fire department there and all of the flyers on the fences.  And it just was really dramatic. And since my wife and I have gone back to visit the memorial, which is beautiful.  And then when the museum opened, which is right next to the memorial at Ground Zero, we went and I sobbing.  It is so moving that that museum, if you're in New York City, you got it.  It's kind of you have to go to Ground Zero and visit it because it's a beautiful memorial.

Start time: 428.18
End time: 466.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the museum really, really brings it home. So yeah, being able to see the frames of the old buildings underneath there is exactly that alone is pretty amazing.  Yeah, the basement is there.  I was there that day and I remember it all very well.  Oh, you were still working there. Oh.  Yeah. Yeah. I moved out of New York City about six months after that.  And I remember watching marching across the Queensborough Bridge with millions of just dumbfounded people and the cell phone networks weren't working.  So you didn't know if your friends were alive and you're staring down at Southern Manhattan watching the giant plume raise and.  Terrifying. Yeah.  I get a little frustrated with the never forget rhetoric because it's just not.  Don't worry. Yeah, don't worry.

Start time: 506.06
End time: 531.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that most moved me at that museum was the fire truck.  For some reason, that always really gets me.  Of course, the people who died in the incident, but there's the first responders who, while everybody's running away, are running towards.  And there's a fire truck in the museum that's basically melted.  You know, it's just the remnants because it was sitting right there.  And I just I that's what I lose it every time.  It's just very pleasant.

Transcript:  I don't know if you guys have ever been to the museum in Washington, D.C.  I don't know if it's still around, but they also have a 9-11 exhibit that was really,  really moving and very frankly difficult to get through where they show what media coverage was like on the day and just the videos of reporters barely being able to hold it together on air and everything was just so powerful.  And like I said, really hard to get through.

Start time: 629.72
End time: 816.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I think they lost a lot of money or something.  You know, the one text story that's tied to this is a lot of the sites that were created at the time were done in flash and can can no longer be run.  So there there's a huge swath of content that's gone because it was in flash Adobe Flash.  I hope somebody's doing their best to preserve it.  Maybe the Internet archives on tech TV.  I remember going in and of course we were doing we suspended our shows.  The screensavers took a couple of weeks off and I remember vividly the night we came back and we had lit candles.  But I also remember vividly the day of and I'm I'm anchoring with Erica Williams, right?  What's her?  And she was, of course, a New Yorker and she was such a pro.  But she would burst into tears every commercial break.  She was like, I have to take a I have to leave.  I have to take a moment because it was very, very visceral.  Erica Hill.  I'm sorry, Erica.  I should remember your name.  I apologize.  And she's still on CNN, I think.  All right.  Now we've we've mentioned it.  We can move on.  You know, I wasn't going to.  But I it's kind of hard not to.  And since we have people from New York on the show, I thought I should probably bring it up.  The big story of the week is Apple versus Epic.  And I'm really I've been kind of very interested in getting to this show and finding out what you all think of this, because Apple basically said we lost.  I mean, we won.  Epic said we lost.  But I think it's more complicated than that.  And I think it's fascinating.  So and by the way, Epic has now appealed.  So that's kind of goes along with we lost where they lost was Apple.  The judge was unwilling to call Apple a monopoly.  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Friday Epic should pay damages to Apple for violating rules, but was and was and was unwilling to call Apple a monopoly.  Both companies will bear the costs of their own cases.  But I don't think it's exactly a loss because the judge also said to Apple, you need to make some changes in your app store.  And maybe maybe it's fair to say this is the least Apple could have expected or this has been what's coming all along.  But it could have cost Apple billions of dollars.  The judge says you have to let iOS apps use, quote, buttons, external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing methods other than Apple's payment system.  And it strikes me that Apple may have won this battle, but they've lost the war.  You agree?  Brianna.

Start time: 817.10
End time: 867.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if I would go as far as say lost the war.  I think Big Tech lost overall here.  So I think if you are, you know, you're skeptical about the amount of power unchecked power, large technology companies have, you kind of won with this.  You know, I thought it was very interesting that the judge noted that being very, very successful does not make you a monopoly, which the Apple Store certainly is.  But I think the part of it I'm most worried about is it seems like this is opening up apps to all kinds of payment systems.  I mean, if I want to put out a video game that has in-app purchases with Dogecoin, can I do that now?  Because from my reading of this, I think I could.  I really kind of worry about the scams that could come up with payment systems now.

Start time: 868.28
End time: 921.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple also wasn't sure what it means.  They said it's too early to determine how or when exactly the changes will be implemented.  They have three months.  They said we want to have conversations with the judge to find out what she means.  It's not even clear that it says allow third party payment systems.  But you just, you know, the least aggressive interpretation would be say in the Kindle app, which you've been prohibited from linking to Amazon's website to buy a book.  They could now link to Amazon's website to buy a book that would bypass Apple's 30 percent.  Apple has prohibited that in the past.  Lisa, you cover mobile.  Yes.  Apple said this is a victory.  The court has affirmed what we've known all along.  The app store is not in violation of any trust law and success is not illegal.  It's a resounding victory, is it?

Start time: 923.47
End time: 1010.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's that simple.  I think it's a little bit of both.  I think the outcome definitely could have been a lot worse for Apple.  I think if they were ordered to maybe change the fee that they charge and lower it, like maybe that would have been a worse outcome.  But I do think we are going to see some ramifications from this because don't forget, Apple makes a lot of money from the app store.  I think I might have to check this, but I think it's their second largest business after the iPhone.  So it's a big deal.  And I don't know exactly how much money Apple makes from the app store.  They don't break out that specific information.  But I can probably only assume it's a lot.  It's billions. We know it's billions.  Yeah, I mean, it's that and iCloud subscriptions, I would imagine, especially considering a lot of their other services are still new.  So this is a big deal for them.  But I'm also curious about...  You mentioned we don't know how Apple is going to implement this yet.  And I think that's a big deal because if it's something that's kind of cumbersome for developers to put into their apps,  or if there are specific rules about where the call to action can be placed or how big it is, consumers might not use it anyway.  And then they're still using in-app purchasing because a lot of this depends on how the consumer decides to purchase something through the app.  So I think there's a lot of questions that are still up in the air about this for sure.

Start time: 1011.60
End time: 1014.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carl, did Apple breathe a sigh of relief? I guess they did.

Start time: 1015.42
End time: 1049.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think like you guys said, it's kind of a mixed bag.  They could have had it much worse.  The court basically said that they could be a monopoly, but that Epic really didn't prove that in the case.  So the door is open here.  And you still have all these other lawsuits against Google, for example.  And some of that, I don't know if you saw the unredacted Epic complaint against Google, but that includes some very interesting more pointed...  Sorry about that.  That's OK.  The unredacted Google complaint contains some information showing how they were actually paying wireless carriers.

Start time: 1052.02
End time: 1053.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And game developers.

Start time: 1054.30
End time: 1086.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're paying wireless carriers, something like 25% of the commission.  And that was right around 2010 when Google was starting to kind of drift away from its original founding vision, like it used to support net neutrality.  And around 2010, you saw them kind of shift away from that.  And the unredacted complaint Epic filed showed that Google is basically throwing money in their direction, billions of dollars to not try.  So I think as you see more of these cases coming out and more of the antitrust inquiries with Linnecon at the FTC, it's going to get complicated.

Start time: 1086.94
End time: 1101.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, for instance, at one point thought about buying Epic.  They were so worried.  Exactly.  They paid top game developers, including Activision Blizzard, not to leave the Google platform.

Start time: 1102.38
End time: 1106.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they were paying phone makers not to include competing app stores on the phone.

Start time: 1107.74
End time: 1133.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the interesting point in this is that unlike the iPhone, there is a setting on Android devices that say use third party app stores.  So you don't have to use Google.  Right.  And I think Google probably doesn't worry about it so much because people just do what's easy.  And I'm sure that's why Apple's not too worried about this.  In fact, it makes you wonder why Apple fought so hard because people are just going to use Apple Pay.  It's just easier.

Start time: 1134.47
End time: 1136.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it works well.  I don't know about that, though.

Start time: 1137.86
End time: 1140.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, go ahead.  Sorry.  Finish, Carl.

Start time: 1140.72
End time: 1158.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The system works well and it's already set up to give them a bunch of advantages.  So I think a lot of people are going to still continue to use them.  I don't know.  Plus, we're entering this phase now where they're going to debate about the definition of a button for six months and then we have to see if people actually enforce anything.  You know, so it's they've got a lot of runway here to tinker with.

Start time: 1159.24
End time: 1181.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Analysts don't know and they won't say how much this could cost billions.  But how much, you know, how much is how much is billions?  According to Sensor Tower, Apple from from games alone and mostly from in-app purchases made three point eight billion dollars in 2020.  But but Brianna, you don't think you think that that's at risk or not?

Start time: 1182.50
End time: 1192.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a really good question to ask yourself with almost anything in technology is, hey, how would Fortran use this?  So I would really encourage you to ask.

Start time: 1192.72
End time: 1195.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that from bitter experience that you should ask that question.

Start time: 1196.16
End time: 1236.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so we're all assuming here, rational actors, like we're thinking about our use case, right?  Like, of course, I get the modal dialogue that comes up when I do my one get an iPhone.  I put in my credit card.  Apple Pay is easy. That's what I go to.  How would someone really deranged operate to exploit this rule?  And I would I would encourage you guys to take a closer look at children's games on iOS because I know it all started with that ninety nine dollars Smurfberry.  It did not stop there.  Someone's calling me now on Skype.  Oh, my God. When you say deranged, you don't mean Tim Sweeney.

Start time: 1237.38
End time: 1281.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean other other more even more deranged people than the head of Epic.  Yeah, I think that it's going to be interesting if you go.  So let's say you're in the Kindle app or the Netflix app and and you say, I want to subscribe.  I imagine what you'll see now is pay with Apple Pay pay on the Netflix site, maybe equal sized buttons.  It depends how Apple what Apple allows them.  But I think this is the spirit of the ruling.  If it's 30 percent less or maybe even only 15 percent less to pay on the Netflix website, maybe people will do that.  But I think it's just so easy to go. You pay with Apple does the face recognition.  It's done. I'm sure Apple's assuming the vast majority of people.  This won't be a change.

Start time: 1282.00
End time: 1294.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's right. And Epic called it a loss.  But it's not when you consider this is probably the biggest change to be implemented in the Apple Store.  And I don't know its history, perhaps.  I think that's something, you know, it's not exactly like that's nothing.  And it may be worse coming.

Start time: 1295.00
End time: 1307.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, South Korea is making Apple put other app stores on the phone in South Korea.  The same thing may happen in other countries.  It's on the it's on the table in many countries.  So you layer on you layer on these other antitrust inquiries.

Start time: 1307.76
End time: 1315.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think there's you know, there's a real sea change happening here.  I don't know if it'll result in anything, but it's it's it's moving that direction.  Well, I think that's sorry.

Start time: 1318.44
End time: 1352.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to say, Carl, I think that's what makes this so interesting, too, is because this is really one of the first times that we are seeing, you know, the type of action that that would be taken, you know, in an antitrust case like this.  Like you were saying, you know, there's a lot of concerns right now and a lot of different, you know, lawsuits and cases that are being and issues that are being raised.  And I feel like this is kind of like our first peek into like what you know, how the country is like thinking about, you know, the modern, you know, antitrust situation and in big tech today.  And I think that's really interesting.

Start time: 1353.30
End time: 1384.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, you consider that first decade from 2000 to 2010, it was all about innovation and how miraculous and amazing all the technologies were.  And then like right around the 2010 point, people started to think a little more deeply about some of this stuff, like how do I moderate content at scale?  You know, what is the gatekeeper power on the phone device actually mean?  You know, people started to actually notice.  And I think we've finally just in the last maybe year or two started to see some actual action, you know, in terms of even the GOP and both parties being interested in kind of rating and some some big tech stuff.

Start time: 1385.12
End time: 1399.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But remember, I think you've covered this, how much money big tech telecoms pay Congress to keep them in check.  Yeah, I mean, that's suspicious about anything significant happening from Congress.

Start time: 1400.02
End time: 1428.70

Transcript:  I mean, that's the problem with antitrust reform is it's so broad and impacts so many companies that you get just this massive coalition of companies across industries all funneling all their money towards one thing, which is not any expansion of existing antitrust law.  And it's hard to beat that.  If you're you know, the opponents in that case are going to be consumer groups and activists and academics and you know, they're outgunned, they're outfunded.  So it's going to be hard.  You know, I think there is a sea change here.  But whether it actually ends in any meaningful antitrust reform is really quite.

Transcript:  I unfortunately have to agree or just how curious they are about these issues.  It seems to be very, very low.  I would encourage you to go to OpenSecrets and look at how much say AT&T donates to people in the science, space and technology committee in Congress.  It is a ridiculously low amount for the legislation they get passed.

A hundred percent.  Although I have to say both Texas and Florida have passed bills that prevent social media companies from blocking politicians because of what they say.  I don't know how constitutional those would be.  The Florida bill, I think a judge already issued an injunction, a temporary restraining order on, and the Texas bill just got passed.  So we'll see what happens there.

And the last like two years has been heavily focused on big tech.  But I mean, it's everywhere when you look at it, when you really step back.

Transcript:  Yeah. And as Apple said, the judge affirmed success is not illegal.  And by the way, nobody's asserting that the the the any of these companies are somehow flawed.  Well, mostly nobody's asserting somehow these companies are flawed by being successful.  They're flawed by being monopolistic, by using their success in the marketplace to dominate other companies and to put them out of business and to prevent other companies from coming in and taking business away from them.

Transcript:  Well, that consumer welfare standard that all the antitrust focus is always focused on is basically saying if the prices are low and consumers are happy, then there's no real problem here.  You know, that's kind of overarching logic that's gone through antitrust reform.  But like, you know, Linnikon at the FTC was came to fame by just saying, you know, there's more going on here than just whether consumers are happy.  Are you impacting other businesses or creating gatekeeper gardens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the long run, consumers won't be happy if there's only one place you can buy something online, only one place you can buy a smartphone.  That's that is not in the long run going to make consumers happy or keep prices low.  They're only low until there's no competition.

Transcript:  Yeah. And specifically with this, you know, app store debate that we've been seeing play out recently in the Epic trial.  You know, I'm really curious to see if some developers do lower the prices of their apps or their subscriptions if they don't have to go through Apple.  Because remember, I think Spotify was the one that kind of stepped out and said this maybe last year in 2019.  I forget, you know, the CEO said, hey, you know, we have to inflate our prices because, you know, we have to pay this 30% concession to Apple and then we don't have a choice.  And, you know, Apple does not have to do that with Apple Music.  So it's a different situation.  So now I'm curious to see if there really is an impact on prices the way, you know, we've kind of been led to believe.

Transcript:  If I could just say, I feel like we're focusing on Apple here.  And Apple is obviously the most the more interesting of the two companies.  But I think looking at Epic, I think this has gone really under examined.  I mean, Epic in some ways took a really big risk, did some very expensive litigation in an effort.  I'm so torn here, though, because Unreal Engine is amazing.  That's why I built my career on.  You know, Epic had this really big scandal just a few weeks ago.  Leo, I don't know if you heard about this, but there's a really big indie game called Among Us.  And basically you have a bunch of players who are trying to figure out who the imposter is.  And the imposter is going around secretly murdering people, trying to evade gang-caught as long as possible.

Transcript:  So Epic took Fortnite and copied literally every single bit of this indie game that broke out.  They called it Imposter.  You know, they use the same lexicon.  And you obviously can't patent gameplay, nor would we want that.  But this was a very big ripoff when they could have just partnered with the studio.  So as much as like through this, I'm like, I want to give Epic kudos for picking a really big legal fight  with, you know, a giant when there really wasn't that much win in it for them.  On the other hand, I'm like, it's kind of undercuts their credibility when they've gone through a Fortnite  and stolen the game design basically of PUBG and Among Us and others to basically get a piece of the pie.  So it really undermines their credibility as standing up for the little guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of us have said on various shows that it's a good lawsuit,  but it's a terrible company to be making in the lawsuit, that it's great to call Apple the carpet,  but maybe Epic isn't the champion that you really want.  By the way, Call of Duty also has a double agent mode that is a copy of Among Us.  But that doesn't happen all the time if the game is successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I could give you a hundred examples here.  I mean, really, Among Us is werewolf.  Right. You can go back that way.  But there's a different thing than taking a hit indie game and using the exact same terminology.  I guess. It's just to me, that's like imposter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like agent or something.

End time: 1823.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Secret agent. Yeah. Yeah. I'm completely with you.  And by the way, Fortnite does not get back on the iOS platform just because of this ruling.  They're still not. They asked Apple, give us back our developer credentials.  And Apple said no. So it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to pay a fine. So I guess, yeah.  And in balance, Apple knew it was going to have to give up a little bit.  That's what they gave up. The big one that they didn't want to give up, they get to keep.  And I think they probably aren't going to lose a lot of money.  I think most users are going to go with whatever the easiest thing is.  And you know Apple is going to do everything they can to make it easier to pay through Apple than anything else,  no matter how many other links there are.

We don't ever want to allow this on iOS.  And it's like, what? That's your defense is to throw Mac OS under the bus.  OK. The judge, by the way, did not buy that argument at all.  All right. Let's take a little break. Take a breath. Relax.  It's great to have you. Brianna Wu is here from Rebellion Pack.  So nice to see you and your red beret.  Have you joined?

What do these businesses have in common? Mom and pop stores and restaurants.  They're all you can't go to a restaurant these days without a help wanted sign in the window.  They're all on an epic hiring spree.  Don't put a help wanted sign in the window.  Hire smart with Zip Recruiter.  All these businesses reopening means millions of jobs need to be filled.

You invite the top choices to apply for your job.  That means you're going to apply faster.  According to Zip Recruiter internal data, jobs where employers invite candidates to apply  will get two and a half times more candidates.

I'm sorry we're going to be talking a lot about Apple.  There is a lot of Apple news.  And it will be that way next week too because the invitations have gone out.  Apple is having an event on Tuesday.  California streaming,  which is a nice little play on the Mamas and the Papas song.  And there was a picture of a lake and a floating apple.  Lisa, do you go through the annual parsing of the invitation at CNET?  Is there a lot of time spent on what does this mean?

I mean, every year it seems like Apple has like some kind of like augmented reality  Easter egg in these invites now.  And it doesn't really amount to much.

End time: 2229.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was good. Well, yeah, you're going to be streaming the event.  Anything else to say about that?  We pretty much know this is an iPhone event.  I mean, this is the time. Yes.  You wrote an interesting piece where you said if they make a mini, this might be the last mini.

Start time: 2230.46
End time: 2253.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, of course, we won't really know for sure until, you know, Apple unveils whatever it's going to unveil.  But yeah, there have been some reports that in 2022 Apple could pivot towards actually, you know, getting rid of the mini and instead releasing another version of the Pro Max, since that seems to be one of the more popular models.  So I kind of just. Yeah.

Start time: 2253.72

Transcript:  The mini didn't sell that well this year, right?

Start time: 2256.12
End time: 2304.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it doesn't seem that way. I mean, I've seen like, you know, of course, Apple doesn't specify by model which one's sold well and which ones didn't.  But and they would never say something didn't sell well anyway.  But there's been like quite a few reports that I believe are based on like, you know, channel checks at carriers and whatnot from, you know, research market research companies that have, you know, indicated that the 12 mini didn't sell well.  And I think that was a little surprising at first because whenever there's, you know, a new iPhone size, people are usually really excited about it.  And for years, there's been this shift to bigger and bigger screens.  So I think there was some expectation that some people might be kind of sick of that and looking for something smaller, especially after the iPhone SE did pretty well.  But yeah, it turned out that wasn't really the case.

Start time: 2305.26
End time: 2323.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of an Apple MagSafe filing with the FCC, we do, I think, know that they mentioned eight different models, four legacy models and four new models, models numbers we hadn't seen before.  So I think we do know that Tuesday Apple will announce four new iPhones.  Is that right? Is that fair to say?

Start time: 2324.52
End time: 2349.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's what all of the reports that we've seen leading up to this event are indicating.  So, you know, and again, this is usually the time of year when Apple announces its new iPhones.  Last year, I think, was a little bit of an exception to the rule.  So, but yeah, I mean, I think it's been every September since 2012 or something like that.  Apple's been announcing new iPhones.  So, yeah, it's I feel like almost certain at this point, for sure.

Start time: 2350.71
End time: 2359.44

Start time: 2361.08
End time: 2373.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny because so many of the people on our shows said, oh, I can't wait.  The mini is going to be great.  The mini is going to be great.  But I think you're right.  You go for the extra cameras.  You go for the bigger screen, the better screen, the better processor.

Start time: 2374.96
End time: 2392.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, don't forget.  Oh, go ahead.  No, sorry.  No, I was going to say the mini also isn't that much cheaper than the regular iPhone 12.  So I think that's part of it, too.  It wasn't as cheap as it could have been.  And also, six point one inches is not like that in these days.  Yeah.  So, but I think they weren't positioning it.

Start time: 2393.49
End time: 2411.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were still positioning it as a premium.  It was just a smaller phone.  It wasn't an SE.  You know, it was.  And I wonder if the fourth phone might be an SE this year because it's been two years.  I think that sold very well.  In fact, I recommend the SE to a lot of people because it's a less expensive but late model iPhone.

Start time: 2412.47

Start time: 2418.20
End time: 2463.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say I wish they put out a mini with a better camera on it.  Like the reason I always go for the Pro and the Max, it's the camera.  Like once you have that zoom function and that quality, it just comes in handy all the time.  So, you know, put that form factor in the mini and I buy it is that they, I think they assume that the person that wants the mini is also going to want a bargain.  And I don't agree with that.  Like we're both old enough to remember when smaller tech was actually more expensive.  That's right.  Because you had to miniaturize all the parts inside of it.  If you can do that, I will take a battery hit.  I just I want a really well done small phone and they won't produce that.

Start time: 2464.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be spending plenty of time all next week talking about whatever Apple does announce the live stream.  Mike Sargent will join me at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.  We take our life in our hands and restream Apple's stream with our commentary behind it.  So you can watch that or you can watch the original Apple content and then Mac break weekly immediately after.  So iOS Day will start a little bit early on Tuesday so that we can do that.  Probably there'll be no AirPods.  Probably there will be a new Apple Watch.  Some or all of this stuff will be in short supply because of chip shortages.  Apple's less hit by chip shortages in a lot of companies, but they still use legacy, what they call legacy nodes.  And some of those are still hard to get.  In particular, the rumor is that the Apple Series 7 watch will be hard to get, but not because of shortages,  but because it's hard to make that new big screen that they're going to put on it.  One millimeter bigger, one silly little millimeter bigger.  Anyway, all the coverage really begins Tuesday and will continue until you're sick of it.  I thought the most interesting thing, and I really hope this happens,  Google released a teaser for its Pixel 6 that got people talking because it looked like they might be showing some dates in there.  Let me show you and see what you think of the new Pixel 6 trailer.  I'll pause it when we get to some.  OK, so what if there it is.  What was that?  What was that?  What was that?  It said 930.  Yeah.  OK, well, maybe it's going to be September 30th or is it 930 in the morning?  I don't know.  Keep playing.  Keep playing.  Smartphones were just wait a minute.  Monday.  Wait a minute.  What was that?  Monday 02.  Are they messing with us, Lisa?  Is this just messing with us now?

Transcript:  There's at least four dates in this.  OK, there's the 21st.  There was a rumor for a long time that it was going to be tomorrow.  It was going to be on the 13th.  But everybody says, oh, you wouldn't announce a phone the day before Apple.  And, oh, gosh, I hope not.  But the whole thing Google needs to do is to get people talking.  And this teaser certainly got people talking.  Yeah.

Start time: 2617.74
End time: 2654.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you know, it's interesting that they're doing this like for this specific pixel model, because, you know, as you can see, just based on the new design and the way they're kind of positioning this, you know, they're kind of trying to rebrand pixel as being, you know, a really premium phone again after a couple of years of the A series being more popular than the regular phone.  So it's interesting.  And I think, you know, it was a while ago, so I might not be remembering correctly, but I think they pulled off like a similar stunt when the original pixel was announced back in 2016.  Like they did something around the same time as like the new iPhone launch, I think.

Start time: 2655.08

And if you were carefully observing, we left out the numbers five and seven or something like that.  I wouldn't put it past them at all.  So I don't know.  It's, you know, they're clearly throwing those numbers in just to get us.  It will be an interesting phone.  It's going to have Google Silicon.  There's going to be more and more.  I hear more and more rumors about this phone being kind of massively powerful, especially machine learning.  It's about time Google kind of took last year off.  I don't know.

Because for me, it's like I look at what this has done for the car industry and used cars.  It's killed the car industry.  It's killed the new car industry, but it's also like older cars.  I know.  People are ringing more life out of their cars and they're maintaining them.

Transcript:  My cars have all gone up in value.  But at the same time, it's like none of us need a new phone every single year.  We all participate because we're in the tech industry to various degrees.  Do you think that maybe this is the moment we take a collective breath and say,  do we really need to get on this upgrade cycle every year?  Because I think it could be good.

I bought...  I mean, I like gadgets too, but we could slow it down by at least 10% hype and maybe...

Transcript:  Plus, this is purely personal, but September is so damn expensive.  Yeah.  I got to buy so much crap.  And it's not just for me, but Jason Howell needs some stuff.  Micah needs some stuff.  I bought the Framework laptop, Carl, because I wanted to see if you could make a repairable laptop.  And I love it unreasonably.  It's actually the best laptop I've got now.  I'm really a fan.  You can open it up.  Everything's QR-coded.  Many of the parts are stock, so you could easily add memory, replace memory and storage.  You can replace the battery easily.  You're kind of dependent on Framework to make motherboards and batteries, you know, some of the custom components.  But I like the idea.  And it makes me think you could do the same thing with a phone.  I hope somebody will make a repairable phone.

Transcript:  There was a push there.  I don't know.  Most of them didn't go anywhere, but there was a push there for all the modular devices where you could repair,  pull out a part and replace a part and make it so you could be more sustainable.  But every time I see one of those announced, it seems to just disappear completely.  What was it, the Google era?  Yeah, that's true.  Motorola tried to do that, I think.  And Google Aura.  Yeah, there was a couple and they never seemed to really go anywhere.  And I wish they would.  And I actually, you know, I have a Google phone and I was perfectly, I used to join the thousand dollar upgrade cycle  last year because of the chip shortage.  I bought this, you know, one of the first pixels that they had with 5G.  And I've been like perfectly satisfied with every aspect of it.

I think once phones became like once the price for like the new iPhone or whatever jumped up to a thousand dollars,  I think that's when people were like, I'm not going to do that.  Not every year.

And I got a call from the radio show who said, my husband and I have pixels, iPhone sixes.  And we just found out that iOS is on iOS 14 and we, you know, we're on 12.  So we're going to get a new one.  Is the 10R any good?  I said, yeah, it's great.  It's three years old now, but it's very nice in 2019.  I highly recommend it.

Start time: 2966.61
End time: 2986.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because like the iPhone 11 is still so popular.  And I think that's part of why the 12 mini also didn't do well, because theoretically, if people are shopping for like whatever the less expensive iPhones are,  you could get a really good phone in the iPhone 11 that does almost everything the 12 can do.  But, you know, certainly enough for the everyday average person.

Like, you know, reception wise, like I feel like a lot of their reviewers were like, hey, this is a good phone, but it's just too expensive and doesn't have everything.  It should have for a flagship phone or it has too much like with the Pixel four, I think is the one that had the gesture recognition that I don't I don't think people really used.  And yeah, the solely sensor. Exactly.  And then they kind of got rid of that with the next model.

And I think it's it's going to affect the tech industry, the wider tech industry for a while.  And I I I don't know.  I just think like us taking a breath and thinking how many years we can get out of a Mac or if we can like start designing things that are more upgradeable.  I just think at a certain point we're going to have to have an adult conversation about that.

Thank you, AT&T, for supporting this week in tech.  There was something you brought up.  I wanted to follow up on.  Follow up on. I have the mind of a sieve.  Golly, we could talk about ProtonMail.  That's an interesting story because I was always a little hesitant with ProtonMail.  Carl, you have a story on Motherboard.  Because ProtonMail shared the IP address location information with French authorities of a climate activist.  Even though they advertised for a long time, we don't log your IP address.  How did that happen?  Were they actually logging IP addresses?

Start time: 3212.57
End time: 3251.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, from what I remember, they weren't at the time.  But they still, while being in Switzerland, allows them some protection from certain requests.  They still have to adhere to Swiss law.  Of course.  I think what happened is the French authorities just went through Europol,  who then communicated with the Swiss court and said, you pretty much have to do this.  They had no choice. They really didn't have much leeway.  The problem, as you noted, is that the marketing for these services always frames these services  as if they're some kind of super heroic privacy miracle cure.  We're in Switzerland, which means people really would never get to see your email.  It's just not true.  Except it's not true.  And I've always said email was never designed to be private or secure.

Start time: 3252.72
End time: 3264.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not. That's not.  And it's almost impossible to make it so unless you encrypt the data  and you arrange ahead of time to get the other guy's public key and all of that.

Start time: 3264.76
End time: 3287.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like ProtonMail provides good secure service.  The problem is that email just is inherently not the most secure thing in the world.  If you're sending from ProtonMail to another email service, it's not always going to be secure.  So if you're an activist who really is very concerned about hiding your identity,  really don't talk to people on email.  Use an encrypted messaging service. That's basically the lesson.  You signal. Yeah.

Start time: 3287.98
End time: 3308.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it really underscores how valuable metadata is  because there's no evidence in this that they handed over the contents of messages.  In fact, they asserted, no, no, your message is still private.  Still, they got the guy, right?  They arrested him based on IP address information and device details,  both of which they had because they logged that stuff.

Start time: 3308.92
End time: 3345.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And their transparency reports had previously been saying, you know,  that that happens sometimes, but only in the most extreme cases.  And we're in Switzerland again, remember, so everything's pretty safe.  But then to see this happen and then how quickly they had to change all of their website information  to kind of water down their promises.  You see that a lot, too, in, you know, VPN services.  VPN services are often treated like just they're inherently some kind of magic security bullet.  And I think people who don't know any better get one thinking that they're impervious  to any kind of outside surveillance.  And that's just not the case. You don't know who you don't know what they're collecting.  You don't know if the company's reputable.

Transcript:  You know, if you're if you're a target, it would be who you not to listen to  marketing promises from anybody, including Apple, by the way,  because we now know with the NSO Group's Pegasus that Apple people aren't somehow magically protected.  Brianna, do you have any OPSEC advice? Do you do you pursue any OPSEC protocols?

Start time: 3368.06
End time: 3425.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I well, I do. I want to say when I was running for Congress, we looked at the email protocol quite a bit.  I would encourage people to go look at the Wikipedia page for for how email is sent.  I mean, it really is a system from the 80s built on top of another system, built on top of another system.  Pray to God our server side encryption holds and send it out there.  I mean, it's it's a product. If you were designing it today, it would look very different.  I do think overall, though, I feel like we're kind of giving proton mail a pass.  And I'm not I I feel at the bare minimum, their messaging on this to the public has been a disaster.  And a more cynical view is that they're not really going to have their users backs.  So I can tell you this this this really obviated any instinct I might have to use their service.

Start time: 3425.76
End time: 3492.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We Steve Gibson always mocked proton mail because on their web page they've changed it a little bit.  But they would they would show the the Matterhorn and say our data is secured securely stored inside a Swiss mountain.  So, you know, you're safe. And and I think we we all realize that that is kind of a meaningless, meaningless claim.  Yeah. Yeah. Email is just not inherently secure. Period.  I agree. And anybody who says it is is probably selling you something.  And the problem is PGP, which is one way to kind of sort of send secure email, is a pain in the ass.  I use it, but it's a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to use it. Nobody knows how to use it.  I've had a PGP. I published my PGP key and I've been doing so for 20 years.  I have yet to receive anything except people saying testing my PGP key. Can you read this?  The only thing I ever get. And by the way, you're welcome to send me those.  But I guess if we ever had to, we could. But then the metadata is still problematic.

Start time: 3493.78
End time: 3515.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think like the big takeaway. I mean, this isn't really a takeaway because it's been very obvious for a long time.  But it's just another reminder that there really is no such thing as true privacy, at least not, you know, certainly not with email.  But I feel like you could say that about almost, you know, anything that you're doing online or through your phone or whatever.  It's just impossible.

Transcript:  I mean, I use, you know, when people ask for private communications, I'll give them my signal.  Yeah, give that out. And I'm sure, you know, I think that open was open whisper foundation.  They're good. And I know Moxie Marlin Spike does everything he can to make it secure.  But if you put it on the Internet, Steve Gibson, our security guy, always says, really, you're only safe if you go out half naked in the middle of a field, cover yourself with a blanket and talk one on one.  That's the only time.

Start time: 3549.76
End time: 3551.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But just because something is imperfect doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.  And I do think there's a conversation to be had.  Look, let's just level with people. Email, generally speaking, is where the adults are having conversations, right?  Like that is the workhorse. It's always been the workhorse.  And I don't think it's crazy for us to want a better standard.  The other thing I find really disturbing is iCloud and Gmail are two very, very popular email systems, but they're they're built on these proprietary backends.  They may have an IMAP service or PLP service, but, you know, ultimately they're doing things their way on their own end.  I think it's long past time for our industry to come together and rethink email from the very beginning and come up with something at the very least that is, even if you're hiding the PGP key from people, like have parkey encryption on it, right?  Like, let's come up with something truly secure that even if the metadata gets leaked, like the message itself can't be leaked.  I just I think this is a really strong priority for our industry.  She can have the ideal like, oh, you signal. I'm sorry.  Sometimes I have to send my lawyer something and I would like a more secure way to do that.

Start time: 3634.56
End time: 3663.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I mean, if you're going to talk that way, I've been reading more and more articles about people saying, you know, the entire industry's computing infrastructure is based on C and C++.  Written years ago by people who are no longer around, no longer maintaining it.  No one really understands how it works. As long as we're reinventing email, we probably should reinvent the whole damn thing.  Rewrite it all. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was stunned. And I learned this lesson many years ago when Wozniak, Steve Wozniak told me one of his hobbies was to listen in on satellite phone conversations.  He said, oh, no, no, it's not. It's not secure.  So, you know, I mean, he just would like an evening and turn on the radio and just listen to what people are talking about.

Start time: 3703.80
End time: 3775.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, I think part of the problem too goes back to what you were saying, Leo, about services that are more secure, not being as convenient.  And, you know, not to say that there shouldn't be options for people who need extra privacy like Brianna is absolutely right.  I mean, I think as users of these services, we deserve to have that and we should be expecting more.  But, you know, what concerns me is that I wonder, you know, I feel like consumers, at least the mass market, you know, the general public, tends to go for the easiest and most convenient option most of the time.  And usually that option is also the one that's the least secure and where you're giving up a lot more of your personal privacy and information.  I mean, you know, it's probably the same reason why a lot of people would use, you know, something like Google Chrome over DuckDuckGo.  It's just convenient. Everything's there if you are like a Google user.  So, you know, I'm wondering, I hope that companies are still incentivized to build products that have that extra, you know, in-depth layer of security, like what we would hope to get out of something like ProtonMail, you know, even if it's unsure how big the market for something like that might eventually be.  Yeah.

End time: 3821.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which is why you need to bake this stuff inherently into the systems that we're building just from the ground up.  For sure.  Because we've entered this phase where privacy is sometimes framed as a luxury option.  You know, I know telecoms kind of do that.  You know, if you pay $5 more a month, you get a little bit more security and privacy.  And I don't like that whole shift.  You know, just build it in from the base up and work from there.  Because, yeah, consumers just, I mean, especially during a pandemic, who has time?

Transcript:  Isn't there something in like Apple's new iCloud tier or whatever?  I'm like hazy on the details, but it was something that they announced, I think, at WWDC where you can pay to have some kind of extra security.  I'm doing a horrible job at explaining this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will back you up.  If you buy Apple One, which is their all in one package, I think 30 bucks, some bucks where you get everything.  One of the things you get is essentially a relay service on iCloud.  It's like a it's basically a VPN and sort of like a VPN.  It's I think it's called iCloud Relay.  And I don't know if this is going to come out this week with iOS 15, but iCloud private relay.  But you have to have an iCloud Plus account.  Yes, that's what I was thinking.  I think a lot of people who pay for iCloud, I get it with Apple One, but I think a lot of people pay for iCloud.  I think everybody will get it automatically.  Yeah, not exactly a VPN.  It's a relay.  It's kind of more like a tour kind of because you're it hides your IP address because it's routed through.  It's really the case unless Apple or Google does it.  You know, no, no, very few individuals, except people who are highly motivated, like, you know, if you're running for Congress, Brianna, most people you you are using the Google Titan keys and all of that.  I still do.

We just mandate it.  I think it's so unfortunate that this kind of government desire, inherent desire of all governments, not just ours, to kind of keep tabs on the people and prosecute crimes is very much at odds with keeping us safe from hackers and scams and things like that.  It's just it's so frustrating because we don't have any apparatus doing the bare minimum.

Transcript:  You know, at this at this point, I don't know.  Congress gets obsessed with one privacy issue for about six months and then forgets about it three months later.  You know, so I don't know what the answer is to that.  And mandating, you know, what's happening now is the federal apathy on privacy and security has created state by state laws like California coming in and pass its own Internet privacy law.  But that comes with its own issues, you know, and it doesn't help somebody in Tennessee or it doesn't help somebody in any number of states that aren't going to follow California's lead.  So we need more federal leadership.  We need somebody, you know, we need we need, you know, hungrier, more tech savvy lawmakers.  And that comes down really to the that comes down to the voter to vote them in and stop voting and people who have absolutely no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think they go they get too ambitious with some of these laws.  They're so convoluted and there's so many loopholes and strange caveats that I think they they're not helpful.  I think it would be great if federal lawmakers could just pass a basic, clean, simple privacy law.  You know, start there.  Start simple, like you suggest.  You know, a law that basically says you have to be transparent about what you're collecting and selling and give to the consumer the ability to opt out.  Yeah. Tell them, be honest with people, give them the ability to opt out.  You know, and maybe incrementalism is a good idea.

You have all these ad tech middlemen brokers and telecoms and app makers and everybody's just hoovering up every shred of data they can and failing to secure it.  Like T-Mobile is a reputable company.  You can't secure their stuff.  I had to.  Five times in the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to go to and it turns out I didn't know there are now five credit reporting agencies.  I had to go to all. I'm a T-Mobile customer.  I had to go to all five of them to freeze my credit account.

Start time: 4227.46
End time: 4245.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what I love about those is every time that one of those hacks happens is you get free credit reporting as if you hadn't gotten free credit reporting when Equifax was hacked.  Oh, wasn't that nice of you?  Yeah. Yeah.  Like I've got 17 instances of free credit reporting and it's not really helping me.  I mean, the onus has to be on the company to do a better job securing their stuff.

And I think Chex.  What is it? What is the?  I think it's Chex.  C-H-E-X.  Something like that.  There are now at least five credit reporting agencies and these other ones go under the radar.  But you have to. Absolutely.  Of course, that's where the bad guys are going to go.

Transcript:  By the way, because these companies hate credit freezes because they make money selling your information to credit card vendors.  So as soon as I signed up with all five of them for a credit freeze, I started getting immense amounts of email from them.  Because in order to sign up, what do you have to do?  Give me your email address.  So now I'm getting all sorts of solicitations from them because they're desperately trying to make up for the lost revenue.  They basically see this as an opportunity to mind me.  Chex systems is the other one. And there's probably more than those five.  I figure, though, maybe, Carl, it's safe to say everybody knows everything about everybody.  Like, what am I doing protecting my social security number?  I'm sure it's out there, right?

You know, a lot of their a lot of companies will say, oh, it's anonymized.  So nothing bad can happen.  You know, you have so many you have so many sections, so many leaks and so many hacks and so many just cross reference.  You just cross references.  I can't I've lost track of the amount of studies that have shown that like it takes two seconds to compare data from this group from data to the other.  Right.

Thank you, Sir Tim. And I hope the check clears.  OK, I'm no I don't I'm trying not to be a security nihilist, a privacy nihilist.  That's a term I think Bruce Schneier coined for people just given they just throw up your hands.  It's like I give up. I give up. What are you going to do?  It's pretty easy to do.  Carl Bodie has his Bodie, right?  Yes.  Not Tom Bodette. Carl Bodie wrote an article saying this is great news.  More communities are building their own broadband.  Why? Because of COVID? How does that happening?

Transcript:  Well, you know, everybody most people don't like their regional telecom giant, whether it's, you know, Comcast or whoever it is, you know, and most people only have the choice.  It's a monopoly. A duopoly best.  Yeah. Eighty three million Americans live under a broadband monopoly.  You know, here in Seattle, which is, you know, Silicon Valley North, I have the choice of one provider.  Isn't that terrible? It's awful.  And this has been going on for 25 years. Literally, we've thrown billions and billions and billions of dollars at this problem.  And it just so I think a lot of these local towns and cities have just gotten incredibly frustrated.  So there's about a thousand different communities that have in the last decade or two built their own broadband access that routinely winds up being cheaper, faster, more reliable.  The money that the locals spend on this service goes back into the community.  The people who work for these providers tend to live in the communities they serve.  So unlike a lot of these regional monopolies, the money is staying there and they're more accountable to the locals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's 17 states that currently have passed laws restricting towns and cities from getting into the broadband business or building their own broadband networks or expanding those networks.  But I think COVID really showcased when you saw toddlers like sitting on the sidewalk outside of Taco Bell.  Try and get online for class.  You know, this has always been a problem, but COVID really accelerated the awareness.  It really is driven action.

Start time: 4537.76
End time: 4592.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends. Each state has a different variation.  Sometimes it'll be an outright ban on building your own local network and sometimes it'll be worded in a very convoluted way to make it as difficult as possible to raise funds or to expand or you can't market in this zone or you can only if it's like a lot of these networks are built on the back of the local power utility.  And so what does that do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the fastest and cheapest fiber providers in the nation.  They have gigabit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what a lot of people say you can't expand.  You can't expand this network outside of the local utility footprint.  You know, some of the laws will say something like that.  And there's no real reason for it outside of the fact that the regional telecom monopolies who literally go straight.  Most of these laws just told the state representatives that they didn't want that to happen.  And there's no stuff is super popular.  It's bipartisan.  There's no excuse for the failure that I've seen.

Start time: 4601.41
End time: 4621.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the counter argument is that, you know, a lot of these companies have had 20 years to wire these areas and they don't want to because the return on their investment is low.  But at the same time, they don't want anybody else building their own broadband networks because they might want to go back there someday.  Yeah, we may someday.  Yeah.  It's a very it's a very cake and eat it too kind of thing for these companies.  Oh, what a surprise.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And just thinking about when I ran for Congress, I got to know so much about local budgeting, like more than I ever would have thought.  And I'd like here in Denham where, you know, a friend of the show, Paul Thoreau used to live here, too.  We canceled our trail this year, like a just walking trail because COVID has destroyed our municipal budget.  If you go over to poorer areas of Massachusetts, like Brockton, I can promise you the Brockton tax base is not going to let go for a bunch of broadband development right now.  So I kind of I'm for you.  I'm with you in principle.  But I'm also thinking about the people that need it most and thinking about towns like Whitman where they're like, hey, we're just going to have our library open for three days a week because we have no money.  You know, we're going to have a four day a week police department.  And, you know, I'm thinking about like, is that really a feasible thing all through the United States?  Like COVID affects our local revenues for years.

Start time: 4683.84
End time: 4709.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like a silver bullet where you could just do this in every nation.  And there's also like multiple varieties of different types of ISPs that are built out of this model.  You know, some will be on the back of the local power utility that won't use taxpayer money at all.  Some will be a private private public partnership that, you know, just works with a local provider like Google Fiber or somebody to deploy to the area.  So it's not it's not all it's not all just tax based driven models.  I mean, there's a wide variety of models they can.

Transcript:  Here in this little town of Petaluma, about 60,000 people, there was a big initiative about five years ago to put in community Wi-Fi.  Initially, Comcast was going to help, but then they bowed out.  Then another provider was going to help.  They bowed out.  They put some stuff up, but it didn't work.  It's gone.  I think it's just a hard thing to do.  And there isn't a lot of support from the incumbents, of course.  So you really have to have a leader, a civic leader who's going to really push it through.

Start time: 4740.76
End time: 4763.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like any, you know, I mean, one of the things the telecom companies will do is they'll just say that these are automatic taxpayer boondoggles and you should never try it.  But I mean, they're just like any other business plan and they require a good leader and a sound plan.  And, you know, look at Chattanooga that built its own fiber network when Comcast refused to.  They've been ranked consistently one of the most affordable, fastest Internet providers in the country.

Start time: 4763.90
End time: 4787.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other good reason to do it is this evidence shows everywhere that incumbents were challenged by fiber, whether it was Google Fiber or others, that prices went down, that, you know, speeds went up.  And even in some communities where there's fiber up to this road, you could see the prices go up as soon as the fiber from the other companies not available.  It's like no competition. Great.  We're going to raise the prices.

Transcript:  And the thing that is frustrating is like, you know, the approach to ban these entirely.  We've spent literally about 25 years where the U.S.  We broke up Marbelle.  The U.S. telecom policy has basically been to do whatever the dominant regional monopolies want.  I mean, with some exceptions, occasionally, you know, like net neutrality was an effort to say, OK, maybe we should apply some very basic rules to these companies.  And any time anybody tries to do that, the companies get Congress to freak out.  You know, trying something different will destroy the Internet.  You know, that's basically their line.

Transcript:  When I spend a lot of time covering these companies, I would look at the way, the success they had writing bills.  And there's literally some of these companies effectively control state legislatures.  They can get the bills passed. Any telecom laws that are passed are written by them, ghostwritten by them.  And that's, you know, I've started learning that.  And then, yeah, like you said, you start looking around at health care and other industries and it's pretty much the same.

And frankly, it helps these incumbents because they're going to do a better job because they're getting competition finally.  You know, they can't just rest in their laurels or whatever.

They need service tiers at around $40 a month. So it's not really helping those people. I mean, if they can afford it, maybe.

I do want to give some credit to Elon because SpaceX is doing something this week that's pretty cool.  The first all civilian mission to orbit. It's scheduled to launch, Inspiration4, this Wednesday.  And what's cool about this, this is the Crew Dragon that Elon's used already to send astronauts to the space station.  But what's cool about this one is kind of, it's for charity. The person who bought this for millions of dollars, Jared Isaacman,  Jared Isaacman is a founder of a payment system, has made lots of money so he can afford to buy this trip.  He's also an avid pilot. In fact, at one point I was told that he owns something like 40 fighter jets.  And has kind of like a fighter jet air show that he finances. He's kind of an amazing guy.  He's an amazing guy. 6000 hours in the air. He's an accomplished jet pilot.  Ready to fly military or aircraft. But he's also a private citizen.  So he'll be, Jared Isaacman will be going up. He bought the mission and then they invited others to go on with them.  Including this medical assistant. She won a contest, Haley Arseneau.  When she was 10 years old, she found out she suffered from a rare form of cancer, osteosarcoma.  And she was treated at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. She had a prosthetic femur put in and chemotherapy.  She's fine. She's great. She has her physician assistant's degree and she works at St. Jude, which is cool.  She will be going up when they call her. There's a documentary on Netflix which I have to watch because they show all of the passengers being called and told they get to go on.  They won. And she said, are we going to the moon? No. Just to orbit for three days. But still real orbit.  Bruce Sombroski, who is a space advocate served in the Air Force, maintained the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles before leaving for active duty in Iraq.  He also has a BS in aeronautics. And so he'll be going up.  When you look at the crew, I feel like he's the red shirt guy. Like, don't go on a...  He would be the guy who would say, no, I'm not going to go down on the planetary landing mission. They won't be doing that, I don't believe.  And then Dr. Sean Proctor, Sean is a geoscientist, wanted to be an astronaut, has followed this for a long time.  So she's going to go up. She's also black, which is great. And she's in her 50s, which is also great.  So this is a really interesting crew. Now, that's inspiring, right?  Now, it's not like Elon's paying for it. They're raising money for St. Jude. I'll be watching on Wednesday. This is exciting.

But I always love going to NASA. It's just every bit of that.  I feel like today you look at our government and our systems, you're like everything is so dysfunctional.  And you're reading and you're there and you're living a moment where we came together and worked towards a really big goal.  And like landing on the moon, it is just so, it gives you something to aim for.  Right. So I think spaceflight has a huge psychological value that we often discount.

Transcript:  Yeah, Brianna, I'm glad you brought that up because as you were saying that, I was literally just thinking about the moments in the past year when,  obviously this has been a really difficult year and a half for many, many people around the world.  And yeah, watching spaceflight on TV, watching the SpaceX mission recently was one of the few times where I feel like I was excited watching the news.  And there was just a general like feeling of enthusiasm and optimism around the news cycle that day.  And that's something that I feel like you rarely get today, especially in the past year and a half though. So I'm totally with you on that.

They they tell the FCC that well, let me just read the quote from this this FCC filing because they don't want Starlink to launch all these satellites.  Quote, whether it's launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower or reopening a factory in violation of a shelter in place order,  the conduct of SpaceX and other musk lid companies makes their view plane.  Rules are for other people and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks.

Seems like if you can't compete, go to court.  Yeah. Yeah. All right.  Amazon, by the way, won the NSA contract. So maybe I think it's Microsoft suing them.  So it's goes what goes around comes around. It's both both sides of the matter.  Why are top streamers leaving Twitch? Is the Washington Post right about this?  They lost. Oh, my God.

I thought Twitch did a better job of quality and so forth. But I may be wrong.  I don't know. I don't. I'm a I'm a Tyro at all this.  It was fun, though. I liked it. I'll probably be going back on my Twitch stream, Twitch.TV slash ClubTWIT with my Valheim primetime stream  because we're getting an update to Valheim on the 16th.  But it's you know what? It's going to be it's going to be so depressing because it's mostly new cooking items.  I'm going to do a Valheim cooking show. It's not it's not OK.  It's not aliens. I'm just saying it's Vikings and kind of stuff.  Let's see. Amazon is getting in the TV business.  Not clear who's making these TVs for them, but these are very inexpensive, really kind of.  I mean, let's be honest, low end TVs.  The Amazon Fire TV Omni series.  That's the expensive one in the value priced for series.

Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say also, I feel like in general, like not from a privacy standpoint, but just in terms of usability, I feel like it's much easier to use a Roku or an add on any kind of device that you add on to a TV rather than the built in software.  Anyway, it's just usually not a good experience and it's slow and it's not as easily upgradeable.  So, yeah, I don't know. I was very anti smart TVs for a long time.  I am a hundred percent with you. It's impossible to fight against it.

Start time: 6483.72

Transcript:  There's some TVs if you disable the Internet functionality, you actually lose some other functionality.  Like if you tell it you don't want to be tracked, I forget which TV it was, but there was a story a couple of years ago that if you tried to turn off the Internet connection, then like other important parts of the television just wouldn't work anymore.

Start time: 6525.48
End time: 6544.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a larger story. I think that a lot of apps, a lot of products are subsidized by spying on you.  And so we're demanding lower cost TVs. For instance, these are very inexpensive TVs.  But the price you pay is that they're making up the difference by spying on you.

Start time: 6545.40
End time: 6572.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's like very Black Mirror-ish. Like that whole example, I forgot what company it was, but I feel like I remember what you're talking about, Carl, with the TV that had some of its functionality turned off.  If you turn off the tracking aspect. And yeah, doesn't it kind of sound like Black Mirror?  Like wasn't there literally an episode where like they like forced you to watch ads or something like that?  Or else your screen wouldn't work. I don't remember. But it sounds if it doesn't exist, it sounds like it probably would.

Transcript:  Also, when consumer reports reviews these TVs often, they're not very secure either.  Like there was that scandal about Samsung collecting like microphone audio data and then not encrypting it at all and storing it just openly somewhere.  Oh, that's nice.  These companies collect that data, which is how people make money, but at least secure your stuff, which they don't really do that either.  So there has to be some kind of improvement.

Transcript:  I feel like this is a hard story because on one hand, I really want the TV industry disrupted.  It is such I don't know if y'all have bought a TV recently, but it is a nightmare of trying to figure it out.  I mean, all the different sizes, just even if you know you want a Samsung and you know the number one feature you want is low latency for gaming.  Like you're going through SKUs and trying to figure out is it this year's model or last year's model?  Like the whole thing is just it feels like a broken industry.  So I like Amazon getting into it, but they're the worst people to like do something like this.

Start time: 6635.34
End time: 6660.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not to mention all the jargon too, like the TV industry, I feel like is infamous more so than other aspects of the tech industry for throwing in buzzwords that are literally just marketing terms that don't mean anything.  And that makes it even harder to buy something.  I think every company has their own like marketing term for like the type of display panel that it is.  And like if you're trying to buy something, it's super confusing.  It's awful.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Good luck.  I mean, I'm sure convinced Samsung chose QLED for its LCD TVs because it sounds like OLED.  Right.  And people will maybe they'll mistake it.  I should mention that the ValuTV shootout, Valu Electronics does this every year where they bring in the top TVs, usually just a handful of them, and then bring in experts to review them.  That's this week.  In fact, it's going on today.  It's today and tomorrow.  So at some point now, the problem is this doesn't cover the whole waterfront.  On the 4K TVs, there are only four because they don't they just kind of rule out anybody who's not going to be like the Amazon TV.  It's not going to be in the running this year.  They'll look at a Hisense.  They have a new technology called dual cell LCDs, the LG OLED, Samsung OLED and a Sony OLED.  And then they're also going to look at 8K TVs.  It's the first time they've done that.  And they'll be LG, Samsung and Sony.  And then so they get all these experts in a room looking at the same TV with the same content.  They're pre calibrated and then voting on what they call the king of TVs.  This is something every year I pay attention to.

Transcript:  I don't know.  I thought there were the same thing.  So the PS5 will either do 4K or 120 frames per second.  Although that's, I think, a limitation of the games.  That may change in time.  I get confused by this.  The reason I know this, I feel guilty because we did get a PS5 for Michael, our 18 year old.  And I said, oh no, you need a 4K TV.  But I got him a 60 hertz.  And I feel guilty.  So I have to explain to him, oh Michael, don't worry because you can't do both.  But really, what I should have done is get 120 hertz.  I was just stupid.

Transcript:  I've been going the other way and trying to find a really good CRT for speed racing.  What?  I've been obsessed with finding it.  So the thing with the CRT is there's zero lag.  You can have the best HDMI component to HDMI converters in the entire world.  The Framemeister RetroTink makes a great one.  But you're still introducing one to two frames of lag in there.  For you to do the Princess Peach vine jump, it's a three frame window.  So that lag really, really matters.  So serious speed runners for vintage games like me, we are constantly looking for old CRTs to bring in.  And I want a PVM from a radio station.  That's the holy grail is finding that professional video monitor.  I actually have hardware that will hook up the analog.  It's a modern Super Nintendo slash Nintendo slash Sega.  They have all these different models of it.  But it's re-engineered for HDMI.  And they released a product that will reverse engineer their modern SNES and make it run on a CRT.  So now that I finally got one of those, I desperately need to find this.

In case something happens, we should put you in this Foul Bard Speed Vault.  No, it's a seed vault, but we could call it the speed runner vault.  Put you all in there.  It's for seeds, but you know.  You know, it's funny, I don't cover Facebook stories very much anymore because I'm not on it.  But I guess we should do a couple of Facebook stories.  We're going to take a break. We will do that in a moment.  In a moment, speed runner, Princess Peach, three frame, vine jump expert, Brianna Wu is with us.  She's also the executive director of Rebellion Pack at RebellionPack.com.  So nice to see you. I hope things go well in the Guardian Angels.  Also, it's Carl Bode from all over, Motherboard and Tech Dirt and Great Tech Reporters.  It's wonderful to have you on here. First time on Twitter.

Yeah, it's great to be here.  Finally got you back on.  Our show today brought to you by, I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm very well rested today, my Casper.  I slept like a champ last night.  Casper, there it is, my Casper mattress.  We have so many of these. The kids have them. Relatives have them.  We just keep buying Casper mattresses.  Actually, it's an affordable and nice gift because you'll love your tomorrow with Casper, the new Casper cooling collection.  Oh, man, has everything you need to sleep cool all night long.  Winter or summer, you really want to sleep cool, but especially during these hot summer nights,  having the Casper cooling collection is just a boon.  The new mattresses with the snow technology, they call it the Wave Hybrid Snow Mattress,  keeps you cool for 12 plus hours, actually literally pulls heat away from your body for sustained temperature regulation.  You don't feel cold, you feel comfortable.  And there's that nice, fresh, cool, little touch feeling.  And of course, your tomorrows are much improved.  Better bedding, also important.  That's why Casper's Hyper Light Sheets are designed with an innovative grid weave.  You can see how cool I am right now.  That lets the air flow through for maximum breathability.  The lightweight duvet gives you optimal temperature control without sacrificing plush comfort.  And of course, Casper's breathable mattress protector improves the coolness of the bed even further by allowing air to flow between your body and your mattress.  There's nothing like it.  It's that feeling, that feeling when you first put your feet down in the sheets and they feel so cool and fresh.  Or maybe when you flip your pillow over and it's nice and cool.  Oh, that's the feeling.  You just go, ah, oh, it's so good.  And as always, Casper offers free shipping and free returns.  We love our Caspers.  When it comes to a better night's sleep, Casper's new cooling collection has you covered.  Focus on tomorrow.  Let Casper handle the rest.

Transcript:  There's a lot of stuff, but everybody should do their part as best we can.  Oh, well.  Facebook.  Let's talk about Facebook.  So much more cheerful.  Send flawed data to misinformation readers, which on the face of it seems like if you're going to send misinformation to misinformation researchers, it should be misinformation, but that's not how it works.  More than three years ago, Facebook trumpeted a plan to share data with researchers about how people interact with posts and links on the social network after a lot of criticism so that academics could study misinformation and help Facebook handle it.  They've been using that data for two years for many studies.  Turns out, according to internal emails and interviews with the researchers, the data included interactions with only half of Facebook's US users, the ones who engage with political pages enough to make their political leanings clear.  Not all of them, even though the company said it was all of them.  And so researchers are saying things like this undermines the trust we have in Facebook.  And you had trust in Facebook.

Start time: 7632.94
End time: 7641.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I still don't understand how communities work.  I saw you talking about that on one of your other shows.  And whether they're trying to like shovel the Reddit model into an app that really.

Transcript:  But like I'm all for anything that kind of narrows the audience down because you always have those collisions between Aunt Bertha and your punk rock friend from college.  You know, in places like Facebook and anything that allows me to narrow down the people I'm talking to and allow for better conversation is good.  But I just don't know if Twitter is maybe the right.

End time: 7681.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 7699.08
End time: 7728.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually like it should be able we should be able to write a regular expression that filters them out.  Yeah, seems simple.  So, well, communities, they are trying a little bit to give you more control over who you hear from.  You can have you get there is a there's something they're trying.  They call it a soft block feature.  You can remove a follower without unfollowing them.

Start time: 7731.66
End time: 7738.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like muting them or is that similar to muting someone if you're removing them?  Yeah, following them, I guess.

Start time: 7739.20
End time: 7776.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, people who are following you, let's say you've got somebody with eight digits after his name, actually in their example, Twitter only has three digits after his name.  But anyway, so apparently they're aware of this issue.  You can and I think you can do this right now.  It's certainly on my timeline.  You can you have to use the official Twitter app or not app but web page.  You can click the three buttons on the right and say remove this person from your followers.  That person will not be notified and they can re-follow you later.  But for a little while until they notice it, you won't show up in their timeline.  It's called a soft block.

Start time: 7778.32

But still maintaining connections to people I work with and the beat that I cover so I'm not losing track of the information stream.  And it's a hard balance.  And there's no real guidelines.

That stat does not surprise me because I don't go on TikTok very often.  But when I do, I feel like I could just scroll forever.  Basically, you're like that most interesting man in the world.

I feel like it's not always a video.  I'll kind of go to Twitter for that.  Otherwise, I do try like to what Carl was saying.  I do try to distance myself and be more conscious about it because if I don't try to kind of cut down on the screen time or not compulsively reach for my phone to check something, it's just out of control.

Transcript:  Also, I think you all are being a little too hard.  I mean, I cannot tell you how many times I've just yesterday.  Like someone's like, hey, look at this Atlantic article that never would have clicked on in a million years.  You read it, it's deeply substantive.  I mean, sometimes you just got to follow the right people.  I'm on car Twitter, which is completely different than political Twitter because it's just like, look at this cool thing that this person's doing.  Look at the great ride.  Look at this car that's coming out.  I mean, you just got to change your people, you know?  Yeah, that's true.

Transcript:  That's what everybody always tells me is, oh, you're just not following the right people.  But the only reason I still have a Twitter account is because my wife says you have to retweet this.  I said, OK, fine.  So every time I do, invariably somebody say, oh, are you back on Twitter?  No, I am not.  To show you how successful TikTok is, Amazon has announced that not only in their TVs, but Amazon Fire TV sticks and other devices will now have a TikTok channel.  So you get your TikTok on your big screen.  I don't feel like this is a good trend.  I feel like this is this is encouraging short attention spans.

Transcript:  What do Florida, Texas and Brazil have in common?  All three have passed laws banning social networks from removing posts from politicians.  Texas governor just signed the bill, Governor Abbott, prohibiting social media giants from blocking users based on viewpoint.  I mentioned earlier, I think that the Florida law has been paused by the courts.  Maybe the same thing will happen in Texas.  I'm thinking Bolsonaro probably doesn't have to worry about that so much.  This is they don't have a they don't have a First Amendment, though.  See, that's the difference in the US.  It's illegal for government to restrain or or or do anything about speech.  Not that they don't, but it's illegal.  It's anti-constitutional.  I don't think Brazil has the same kind of protections.  He's also up for election next year, which might have something to do with it.  Let's see what else here.  Kind of down to the bottom of the barrel.  Always some of the most exciting stuff down here.

End time: 8260.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting that you bring that up because I feel like something like this, no one's going to wear it if it doesn't look like a normal pair of glasses.  But at the same time, you do have to make it look distinct enough so that people know what it is and people know that this is a device that might possibly be recording.  Yeah.  So it's just, I think, a weird kind of middle ground to balance.  And I don't know what the answer is for that.  Where's the light?

There's no display.  It's basically, it's kind of like the echo frames and like the Bose.  It's a cross between Snapchat Spectacles and like the Amazon Echo frames.  Except, you know, it's not, you know, obviously Amazon's is very much built around Alexa and stuff like that.  But this is really just built to, I think, basically play music and kind of act like wireless earbuds.  They have speakers.  Yes.

But also there's a lot of downsides to it.  There's a lot of things that you need to be careful about.  And I feel like in more recent years, especially with social media, we've seen that sometimes we realize what those downsides are way too late.  And we spend years trying to course correct.  And instead of like thinking about some of these, you know, possible like, you know, bad situations from the ground up, which is difficult.  But but yeah, I mean, I think there's pros and cons, you know, for sure.  Yeah. Oh, my goodness.

I don't even understand how this how this works.  I don't even understand how a country could use Bitcoin instead of dollars, which El Salvador used to use.  It's their legal tender.

Yes.  Everybody was like, wait a minute.  That was not an uncommon game.  There could be a lot of those are still new in box.  What's going on here?  And there was a YouTuber that did an expose.

I don't know what to think about this.  This came the news came out this week that the Los Angeles Police Department on routine stops, even if you're not being arrested, will interview you.  That's what the police call it when when they're asking you questions and try to fill out this.  This is the interview card they're provided with name.  Sure.  Date of birth, sex, gang, moniker.  OK, fine.  Plus full your email, social media accounts, E.G.  Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, et cetera.  They're collecting information about your social media accounts.  You have been arrested.  But the worst thing to me is this.  They're pretending it says if a social security number is requested, the following disclaimer must be read.  Federal law requires that you be informed when asked for your social security number that it must be provided for use and identification.  That's exactly not what federal law requires.  That's the exact opposite.  Why are they collecting social security numbers?  Twitter handles.  It's a common.

She's an immigrants rights expert, previously served on the L.A. police commission.  She says she was not aware of any law requiring individuals to disclose social security numbers to local police.  She also says she was shocked to learn about the Social Security Section, noting that that is antithetical to the department's own policies.  Ah, and it violates the spirit of sanctuary laws.  So that's what they're trying to figure out.  Are you a citizen?  And can we can we deport you?  Anyway, I don't know what to make of that.  I'm just glad I'm not in L.A.

And, you know, it's inevitable that your Social Security number is going to be, you know, exactly what I was saying earlier.  Exactly.  Just give us little as possible.  At least try to make it a bit harder for them to get my information.

They're just asking some questions.  Just ask us some questions.  All right.  I think we should wrap this up because I'm sure there's a football game to go to or something like that.
