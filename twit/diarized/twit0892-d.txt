He was a regular on the This Week in Computer Hardware show and pcper.com to go to Intel.  And has now, and we couldn't ever really get him when he was at Intel, just once.  You got me once.  Once, we got you once.  And now he's left Intel, actually gone to a spinoff of Intel.  Their NAND department got spun off into something called Solidaim.  He is an SSD technologist.  Always my hero when it comes to solid state drives.  Hello Alan.

Start time: 366.08
End time: 427.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's on YouTube, we got the wire.  That's amazing.  Actually the Pope came to mind this week, of course, of the passing of Queen Elizabeth.  I was wondering why not everybody feels sad about this, but I did.  And I was wondering why.  And it reminded me a little bit about the Pope.  It's nice to have world leaders who can be leaders without being politicians.  And I think that Queen Elizabeth II gave such solace and succor to her people  because she could stand above the fray and just be a kind, caring person.  And I think there's a lot to be said for that.  And the Pope is a little more political.  He gets a little bit more involved in the day-to-day operations  because he's more than just a titular head of state.  He really is head of state.  But he also, I think, for Catholics all over the world, is a moral figure  and somebody who gives them solace.  And I think that's important.  I really do.  So anyway.

Start time: 428.76
End time: 463.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's something unique.  I mean, I get it.  I understand the people who have either issues with the monarchy  or with the Queen herself or the family, the politics and the dynamics there.  I get all that.  I don't want to minimize that.  But there is something about a person, be it the Queen or Pope Francis,  about a person who is just very dedicated to duty.  We actually don't get that a lot.  We always feel this compromise in our leaders.  So when you have a leader that genuinely is trying to do their best,  even when they mess up, it comes off as something special.  So I get why people miss.  Yeah.

Start time: 464.22
End time: 531.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Duty is very...  And of course, this is also September 11th, the 20th.  Hard to believe.  21st anniversary of the horrific attacks on New York City and the Pentagon.  I feel the same way.  That's actually...  I can tie it in.  I remember going a few years ago to Ground Zero.  The memorial there is very beautiful.  But then going into the museum and I burst into tears because  at the entrance to the museum, there's a fire truck that's half melted.  That's the FDNY.  And I realized what I admire about these first responders is duty.  Their sense of duty.  That they run into a place where people are running away from.  They run into danger.  They ran into the fire.  And it's that same sense of duty that transcends even their survival instinct.  That is so moving.  And so, yeah, it is.  It all ties together.  I would observe a minute of silence, but you just skip through it, so I won't.  But it's too easy.  I've been to that museum.

Transcript:  They have a tissue button, like really nice pedestal style tissue box about every 20 feet.  And for good reason.  I bawled my eyes out.

Start time: 540.42
End time: 550.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't consider myself a crier.  But it is very...  It's a difficult museum.  But I think an important one.  Yeah.  But you know what's strange, Leo?

Start time: 550.22
End time: 573.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you think about it, there are adults who are in the museum.  Adults now.  Not kids, not children.  Adults who were born after that.  They never knew the United States before 9-11 and how much it changed because of what happened that day.  I mean, we are a dramatically different nation, both in culture and in tenor, than we were pre-9-11.  Some good and some bad.

Start time: 573.70
End time: 651.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing is I'm watching.  For the first time ever, the accession ceremony was broadcast yesterday of the new king.  And you know, the privy council gathers.  And they say, is it okay if we use the old seals until you destroy them?  And he's going to hit them with a hammer when they get the new seals.  And for me, the sense of history was also interesting.  And talk about people who weren't alive.  95% of the world wasn't alive when Queen Elizabeth became queen.  I've never known another queen.  We've never known another queen.  So, you know, to hear God save the king for the first time.  To see those E2R insignia on their money, on their post office boxes everywhere,  removed and replaced with whatever sigil he decides to use.  All of this, to me, is history.  I mean, I think like Henry VIII, it's history and we're getting to watch it.  I think for a whole generation of kids, 9-11's history, for those of us who remember it,  it's searing history.  I'm probably none of you remember JFK getting shot, but I do.  And again, same thing.  You know exactly where you were.  You remember every detail.

Start time: 652.08
End time: 680.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that why we have the rituals though?  We have the traditions, both religious and just in terms of society,  when you have the succession or the accession and they go through all those things.  The change is very hard for us, but seeing those traditions,  being able to think of them.  Like even if you've never seen them before, you know they've been passed down through history  and it provides like this whole wave of stability so that the change feels less scary.  It just gives you a grounding and we are part of a much longer, much older, much stabler process.

Start time: 681.02
End time: 694.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And I like that because the stock and trade for all of us as technologists is move, move, move,  change, change, change every second.  And so it's nice to have some roots, some grounding.

Start time: 695.82
End time: 732.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really interesting though, because like one of the things that concerned is too much of a word,  but we've been doing a lot of nostalgia and technology lately.  Like for the last three to four years, five years, we've been going back to these retro designs  and we've been rebuilding a lot of things.  And that usually means that we're concerned about the future and we're trying,  like marketing people are trying to give us that same solid foundation saying,  no, it's not scary.  These are the same, whether it's the same phone or tablet or computer designs you're used to.  When we're optimistic, it's all like rockets and fins and chrome and like going off into the future.  But right now we're in this whole era of very much clinging to the past again.

Transcript:  You're in Canada, so a Commonwealth country, you're going to have to change your money too,  aren't you?

Start time: 739.36
End time: 754.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found out that the Queen was actually like 24 or 25 separate legal entities.  Like the Queen of Canada is a separate legal entity than the Queen of all the other places.  And that we include some Canadian cousins in the Royal Family that they don't.  And they have some British cousins in the Royal Family that we don't include.  It was so deep.

Start time: 755.54
End time: 827.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  It's hysterical.  So one thing that did change, normally the British people, and I imagine the Canadians too,  but the British people would learn about the Queen's passing on BBC, right?  In fact, there's a whole protocol that the BBC goes dark and then they play God Save the Queen.  They interrupt all programming.  They put the logo up on channel one, two, and four.  And then they all have the same message.  Didn't happen this time.  It broke on Twitter.  It broke on Twitter.  In fact, the first tweet came from the Royal Family Twitter account  two minutes before the BBC had its tweet.  And I think that's unfortunately this page is not showing the tweet,  but I think that's kind of remarkable.  This intermediation.  Yeah. But what I want to point out is that the Royal Family embraced it.  And they said, instead of waiting for the beep, we're going to tweet this.  It shows you Twitter is still important.  Well, yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  It shows you the Twitter is still important, doesn't it?

Start time: 829.02
End time: 904.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That story is amazing, but the not so amazing addition to that is the fact that  Twitter did its regular thing.  And in the hours before her death, there were so many fake announcements of her death.  We expect that from Twitter, but it's sort of like when it happens  to a major figure like the Queen, you almost kind of want to say, what's wrong with you?  Just stop.  We know she's on her deathbed.  Could you just let us let this unfold as it's supposed to rather than trying to  garner the attention of the death of a cornerstone of an entire nation?  But, Leo, we had a similar thing that happens here where there's an official channel of  how we announce who gets picked for the next father general or who gets picked for the next pope.  And we've been having problems with this with people inside of the  assemblies tweeting out before the official call goes out.  So it's hitting all parts of society and all sorts of ancient nations, ancient cultures,  where you now have to deal with the fact that the data is going to leak before you're ready  to leak it.  And it's kind of interesting to see the royal family was forward looking.

Start time: 904.88
End time: 952.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they jumped on it.  You just schooled me because I saw a tweet this morning that I believed  that was supposedly Donald Trump's message on Truth Social saying she had secretly knighted him.  And you know what?  I felt like this.  I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  And there's still people on Twitter falling for it.  So it just shows you, yeah, this is a medium that is lightning quick that the royal family  could beat the BBC by two minutes.  But it's also lightning quick with equally lightning quick with this information.  In fact, what is the old Ben Franklin saying that the lie speeds around the world while  the truth is putting on its pants or something?  I don't know.  I can't remember.  That's got to be wrong.  But you get the idea.  No, that's right.

Start time: 954.42
End time: 958.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The lie travels around the world while the truth is still putting on its pants.  Oh, OK.  I thought it sounded made up.

Start time: 958.96
End time: 990.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I believe Donald Trump got knighted instead.  Maybe it is.  So it shows you what I know.  Yeah, well, as Abraham Lincoln once famously said, you can't believe everything you see  on the internet.  So I think we kind of have this really interesting dichotomy of, yes, that's the fastest,  best way to learn something.  It's also very prone to disinformation.  And it's easy to not.  Citation needed.  I mean, I consider myself sophisticated.  And I fell for it completely.  So there you go.

Start time: 992.28
End time: 995.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard not to.  Especially if it's a good fake.

Start time: 995.64
End time: 996.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because I wanted to believe it.

Start time: 997.16
End time: 1014.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A good fake will take something that could be true and stretch it a little bit.  And that's what that tweet did.  And in fact, the only reason why people started to doubt it was because, and you picked up  on this, it was so short and so concise.  People were saying, that can't be Trump.  He never wrote anything that's short.  It's too coherent.

Start time: 1015.78
End time: 1046.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and also, as many people pointed out on Twitter, if that's true, then he's ineligible  to run for president in 2024.  And so that would be a very self-defeating tweet.  Twitter, Twitter, taking the headline away from the BBC.  On the one hand, I'm not surprised.  On the other hand, it's like, well, there's a tradition dashed.  Do you think it's bad to broadcast things like the accession?  Did any of you watch the accession ceremony?  It was actually quite fascinating.  No, I did.

Start time: 1047.70
End time: 1050.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're on the privy council and you'll never see one again, probably.  Well, maybe you will.  I don't know.  It depends how long Charles makes it.  So one of the things that, as I mentioned, they asked to say, yeah, you can keep using  the old seals until we get some new ones.  Then, by the way, the announcer told us, and by the way, he will have to destroy the old ones  personally with a hammer so that they aren't misused because they're used for official  documents and so forth.  And then they ask a bunch of questions.  He has to say, for instance, promise that he is not going to be mean to the Church of Scotland,  among other things, and signs.  They were, by the way, all fountain pens I was noticing, but I was trying to figure out  whose fountain pens.  Prince King, now King Charles, had his own fountain pen that he pulled out of a pocket  and unscrewed, but the other ones looked like those disposable pilot pen fountain pens.  And I hope that's not what they were using, but they were all fountain pens.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe he doesn't use a Swiss.  Although, Sam had told me that they are replacing the very famous royal limousines  that were Land Rovers, and you see them all the time now.  They're replacing them with Audi A8s.  And I thought, you couldn't do that in the US.  That's a little power.  You couldn't do that in the US.  Replace the beast with something made in Germany?

Transcript:  By the way, we have the same ceremony here.  When a pope passes, they destroy his ring with a hammer.  Do they really?  Because they do.

Start time: 1184.70
End time: 1220.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I imagine that there's a certain amount of overlap between the papacy and monarchy.  I mean, it is a kind of monarchy.  In fact, you have even, your accession ceremonies are even more elaborate and more ceremonial.  The cardinals have to come in, there's a conclave and they have to vote.  And I watched a movie, maybe it was The Shoes of the Fisherman,  I don't remember where they showed the vote.  They stitched the votes together with thread.  Yes.  And then that's when they burn them.  Naturally.  And if they don't have an agreement,  is it white smoke or black smoke if they don't have agreement?

Start time: 1221.50
End time: 1239.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's black smoke if they don't and it's white smoke if they do.  And actually, so right there, you can actually see,  is it smokestack?  Towards the middle, towards the back, that's the smokestack.  Wow.  So between the Apostolic Palace and St. Peter's, there's actually a little green stack that you  can see and that's where the smoke comes out of.  I see it.

Start time: 1239.65
End time: 1292.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  There's a little stove and they throw that in.  It is an absolute medieval ceremony, but so is this accession.  The other thing I liked, and I'm going to start adopting this,  when they ask for the king, they say, all right, with your permission,  we'll keep using those old seals.  Write king and he says approved.  And that's all he has to say, approved.  And they move on.  The only negative, and I have to say this, is Charles had a script.  Memorize your lines, Charles.  If you're going to be king, you can't be reading the script.  You just memorize the lines.  It's not hard.  Approve.  Probably still emotional, Leo.  Maybe that's it.  I'll have to, you're right.  His mom has passed.  My mom is close to the same age and not in great shape.  That was, for me, part of this emotion I was feeling was a kinship,  because I know this is coming soon for me too.

Start time: 1292.96
End time: 1298.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

So at all things, the afternoon of the Apple event,  Kara Swisher gets on stage,  Wadakoo, Tim Cook,  Johnny Ive,  and Steve Jobs' widow,  Loreen,  to talk about Steve  and with it to announce,  and I think this is American royalty,  the Steve Jobs archive.

Some voiceovers, some oral history interviews and stuff.  And it seems to be growing, which is cool.  And then it looks like they're also putting together some fellowships.  They say,  we are building programs, fellowships, and collections  and partnerships that reflect Steve's values  and carry his sense of possibility forward.  So this is our royalty, isn't it?

Start time: 1514.68
End time: 1562.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's something about a fast growing startup  or a reinvigorated company that brings back its founder,  that it cannot become the company it needs to be until the founder is gone.  Because as long as the founder is still around and kicking,  there's always going to be this,  well, was this what the company was supposed to be?  Was this the original direction?  Is this where they're supposed to be going?  Once the founder is gone, an organization has the freedom to sort of say,  okay, we know what we were.  What do we want to be?  And I think when they brought in Cook, that's what they actually did.  They sat down and they said, Steve Jobs did a lot of good things.  These are the things he didn't do great.  These are the things that we should be doing.  And these are the things that we want to continue doing from his tenure.  But the Apple that we have now is very different from the Apple we had when Jobs was still around.

Because when I do these Apple events, as we did, Andy and  Ako and I did the, you know, we have the stream going on.  We know the stream is an infomercial.

They are exceptionally good at convincing people that they know  what you need, which is a skill that they've had for the last 20  years, but I don't think they're the best at it anymore.  I mean, if you're going to make the argument that Apple has sort  of become the new religion, the counter religion is Tesla and  Elon Musk has now the most rabid fans.  It used to be Apple, but I don't know.  It feels like it's shifting over.  He's now the person that people worship.

Start time: 1879.72

You're a hater.  You're a hater.  Oh, yeah.  Like suddenly I'm a hater.  Like I own two of them.  Are you kidding me?  Clearly, I'm not a hater.

As usual, I would say with Apple, these are incremental  improvements over the previous year's phones, right?  Is there anything just go, wow, this is so much better.  You have to get it.  Renee.

Start time: 2121.34
End time: 2167.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, so I think it's been true for years.  And I think Apple has known this for years that very few  people upgrade year over year.  Like if you run an annual upgrade program and it just  continues your subscription, that's a big exception.  And there are always going to be people who are just they  have like a ton of money and they really like phones and  they're going to buy the new phone every year.  But for the vast majority of people, they're on between two,  three, four, even five year cycles.  And they know that.  So the goal is just to over three to four years to provide  enough value that if you're going from like this year,  probably an iPhone eight or an iPhone 10, maybe even an iPhone  10 S that it's a significant upgrade for you.  I think like Twitter and YouTube are obsessed with only  ever talking about how it compares to the last year.  And that has always only been like maybe five to 10% of the  buying populace.  You agree, Alan?

And it was like you had to go up and like ask to use it.  If there was a family emergency on the surface to do it,

Start time: 2224.30
End time: 2236.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask a question?  So on satellite, I mean, on submarines, there's got to be  some sort of policy about signal intelligence of of crew and  having cell phones that can ping.  Right.  I mean, you can't have that.  Yes.

Start time: 2236.94
End time: 2255.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that is true.  But the thing is, you wouldn't be to use the iPhone thing.  Like if somebody has an iPhone 14 on a submarine, like you  literally have to be like fully surface and then the person  would have to get out of the submarine.  Right on deck.  Right.  Because you're in a big Faraday cage, really.  Yeah, basically.  That's not going to work inside.  Yeah.

You know, technology did advance, like even while I was on  the submarine, which was over almost two decades ago now.  Man, that's totally talk about dating ourselves from earlier.  But, you know, they advanced to the point where there was like  a satellite, like a like a gyro stabilized little mini dish  built into the top of one of the masts that they could pop up  and sort of do bidirectional communication.  But that's only because it was a directional thing.  And so that you wouldn't be able to sort of triangulate  where that communication was coming from.  And they would only do it very rarely, you know, and they  wouldn't do it while the submarine, what was called  alert, which is there's some window of time out of when the  submarine's out, which is where they're the one that can be  called to launch the missiles if they have to.  And so in that window, there's literally nothing happens.  They're just they're a ghost basically for several weeks.  Right.  I don't see submarine crews doing what you're seeing from

And honestly, even if the technology was possible, even if  you make, you know, the iPhone 21 can now do it from inside  the hull of a submarine or whatever, the crew has enough  discipline to where they're not doing that because they know  it's, you know, everybody's life is on the line when you start.

Transcript:  So the thinking is according to the center for strategic and  international studies that they don't want to because a we can,  it's a great way to spy on people because if we can eavesdrop  on the phone calls, the emails, get the geolocation data from  the cell towers, that's useful.  Plus, they're using it because it's, you know, they're in  Ukraine.  So the Russian forces need to use it.  And if they ever win in Ukraine, of course, they don't want to  destroy infrastructure, too much infrastructure, although  that seems to be out the window.  Yeah, it's I mean, yeah, when you see people Instagramming  from the war zone, it's just crazy.

Transcript:  Communication is really interesting because when it was a  huge lack in the Russian army, I mean, way more than any Intel  group ever thought that they didn't come, they went into a  hostile country without their own complete communications  infrastructure.  Right.  That's unheard of.  That's just something you would never expect a major world  power to do.  And yet they did it.

Transcript:  Right.  It's really interesting, too, because a few decades ago, cable  news was changed forever by the OJ Simpson trial and by the  Gulf War.  And now social media is being changed forever by the Amber  Her trial and by the Ukraine war.  And it just seems like there's always these locusts of  coverage where it shifts to a completely new medium and then  everything gets rapidly repackaged around those mediums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's why I thought it was really even the  transition from Queen Elizabeth to King Charles was  interesting because even an ancient tradition like this is  highly influenced.  They put it on Twitter before they put it up on the palace  gates.  Right.  To me, it is.  It's fascinating how the world has changed.  And like the frog in the pot, it's happening without us  knowing.  It's just kind of gradually.  Do you imagine the Vatican would change?  Probably not.  Right.  This is somewhere where tradition is so much a part of  it.  They're going to still stitch together the votes and put them  in a stove and burn them.

Transcript:  No, they'll keep doing that.  But you do see change.  If your producer could call it up, there's a great side by  side showing the night that Benedict became pope and the  night that Francis became pope.  And on the night that Benedict became pope, you had a lot of  people in front of St. Peter's holding candles.  The night that Francis became pope, everyone was holding a  phone.  You saw nothing but a sea of screens.  And it's like, yeah, you know, even if the traditions stay  the same, the way that people are consuming it or remembering  it is changing.  And that was the clearest sign for me.  Like, yeah, you have to do this.  If you're not thinking about optics over social media, it  means you're not thinking about optics period.

The whole world is changing.  I've told this story before, but I love it.  The Soviet Union was monitoring.  This is how long ago was monitoring the coming and going  of people at the Pentagon.  And they noticed that every day around noon, a lot of high  ranking officers would disappear into this building.  You know where I'm going with this, right?  Oh, yeah.  It was a hot dog stand in the center of the Pentagon.  And it almost got nuked because they thought, well,  it was said the Soviet Union had at least two nuclear  missiles pointed at it at all times.

So it's not the quantity that you're making,  but the quality that you're making and that those videos  attract enough audience, enough views that you don't have  to continually run on a hamster wheel.

Transcript:  I know, I'm an old man shouting at the clouds.  Our show today brought to you by Melissa.  Did you know if you're in business that poor quality data can cost you big time?  I'm talking your address list, your customer supplier list, your contact information.  On average, big organizations and small lose $15 million because of poor quality data.  And of course, the longer it stays in your system, the worse it gets, the more it'll cost you.  To ensure your business is successful, your customer information has to be accurate.  And that's why you go to Melissa.  They are the address experts, the leading provider of global data quality and address  management solutions.  It's not just sending a bill or a catalog to the wrong address.  It's calling somebody by the wrong name.  You've got a customer service line and somebody calls in and you call them by the wrong name or  say, oh, you live in Idaho?  No, I live in Florida.  You're just making a customer that's already upset more upset, more frustrated.  And there's another reason why you want good quality data, authentication, verification.  You may have compliance requirements around those very important things.  And you certainly want to for security.  Melissa recently partnered with IDPAL to launch something brand new, Melissa ID.  This is seamless contact verification.  They do it in real time.  Melissa ID is a unique, fully customizable, out of the box SaaS solution.  It uses a multi-layered approach, biometrics, facial matching, liveness testing, address  verification, document checks, automated identity verification.  Something you may have to do, for instance, if you've got to be compliant with any money  laundering laws or politically exposed person laws or bank secrecy act.  Melissa's really amazing.  35 plus years in address standardization, correction, and verification.  And they keep clearly keep up with the times.  I'm sure in the early days, it was probably zip plus four.  They now this new app, Melissa ID, has coverage of over 6,000 identification documents across  200 countries and jurisdictions.  Ideal for any type of business charged with reducing costs associated with the customer  acquisition, operations, fulfillment, fraud, and of course, compliance.  Protect your data from decay.  2.1 billion clean validated records in their database they can match your data with.  That means there's almost certainly they've got a record that's correct.  They can replace your bad data with.  You could score and target customers with detailed demographic and firmographic data  appends.  You can complete customer records.  You can add missing names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses.  And of course, they treat your data like the gold that it is.  Melissa undergoes independent security audits to be SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant.  They can also get rid of duplicate information.  If you're sending four catalogs to the same address, you're wasting money.  Melissa's data matching will eliminate clutter and duplicates, increasing the accuracy of  the database, reducing postage and mailing costs.  So you got batch address cleansing.  You've got identity verification.  They have geo coding that can convert addresses into latitude and longitude.  Automatically, they can verify email addresses, remove up to 95% of bad email addresses from  your database.  They even have an app on iOS and Android.  It's called Lookups.  Let's you do onesie twosie search addresses, names, and more at your fingertips.  So make sure your customer contact data is up to date.  Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal.

And we thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.  You do the same, dear listener, dear viewer, when you use that address.  So make sure you do.  Melissa.com slash tweet.  Okay.  So the satellite thing's interesting.  I don't know how we're going to test it, but I think it's a great thing to have.  T-Mobile announced something similar with Starlink the week before knowing Apple was  probably was about to announce this.  We now know that Apple will be partnering with GlobalStar.  Partnering's even more really because they say they'll pay for 95% of the costs associated  with additional launches that GlobalStar is going to have to make to put satellites up  to do this service.  So Apple's getting in the satellite business in effect.

End time: 3369.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about this with Rod Pyle today on the radio show.  Everybody's launching satellites.  In fact, so much so that in the next Elon Musk Starlink launch,  there's another satellite company piggybacking on that.  And the thing is, it's all overlapping, right?  It's like we got four different companies doing the same thing.  And of course, each of them has to have their own satellite.  This is so much of a problem.  The FCC announced this week that they were trying to establish a rule requiring people  to get their old satellites out of the sky.  They say, we want to make it so you have five years to either de-orbit it  or launch it into space or something because they're going to just jam the place up.

Start time: 3371.80
End time: 3392.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is a good idea, but it's a non-starter because they place the onus on the country.  Yeah.  Responsible for the launch.  Not the company.  So unless every country starts putting down a huge bond for every satellite a company launches  into space, they're going to get to a point where a company has gone out of business and  now they're stuck with a $10 billion bill to de-orbit a bunch of satellites.

It could be me, to be honest with you.  Okay.  Me and my new watch.  I mean, I think I would want that and I think the crash detection is interesting.

So this is clearly Apple doubling down on what Tim Cook has always said, which is that  our next big business is going to be health.  It's going to be protecting you.  Health and safety.  This is health and safety is a very nice place for them to be in.  They're already kind of owning the privacy space, whether it's marketing only or for real.  They clearly own it.  Now they're going to own this health and safety space.  I think that's...  They're going to get the point where people are going to feel like Apple's taking care of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know your exact temperature, but they know how it's going up or down.  It's a relative...  The trends, yeah.  Relative temperature.  We knew that.  In fact, I have an aura ring that does the same thing.  But I think it's very smart of them to focus on women's health for this thing.  Because neither Fitbit nor Samsung nor the Aura talk at all about cycle tracking.  Apple, that was the number one bullet point.  They spent a lot of time talking about that.  And then this thing about retroactive ovulation,  I think they're trying to say,  we can't tell you ahead of time, but we can tell you afterwards.  Or I don't know.

Start time: 3665.04
End time: 3683.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was big.  This was big at CES about three years ago.  There was a company I think called Comper that was selling devices that would do this.  They would actually do specifically ovulation tracking.  And actually, I think Apple bought them, didn't they?  Well, there you go.  That might have been where they got the tech.

Start time: 3686.32
End time: 3744.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, good on you, Apple, I guess is all I can say.  So it's more than just period tracking.  I mean, it gives you a period predictions, a retroactive notification about your ovulation  date, which, you know, people want to know about their ovulation date,  either when they want to get pregnant or don't want to get pregnant.  That's of course, when you're most fertile.  Unfortunately, knowing about it after the fact seems less useful, but I guess  that's the best they can do.  Oh yeah, I was pregnant.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Hmm, whoops.  First steps.  And again, probably one of the reasons Fitbit, which is owned by Google, Samsung,  and Aura are having trouble doing this is privacy.  We already know that many period tracking apps are, you know,  discloses information to third party data brokers.  Very leaky.  Very leaky.  It's not a good word to use when you're talking about this.

Transcript:  So plus this takes a lot of this takes a lot of the pressure off SheHulk and Star Trek  and Lord of the Rings, because people can.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  Finish that sentence.  The feature that-  Wait a minute.  No, I knew you were going to tell me-  I was just going to say, because people are so busy complaining about that,  Apple actually focusing on features for women is going to give them a whole new sphere to lose  their fragile little minds over.  Oh, good.  Thank goodness.

Start time: 3766.60
End time: 3788.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't sure where you were going with that one.  All right.  So these are all good features.  And I think that there is a lot to be said for Apple generating this goodwill with its users.  Right?  We're here to protect you.  We're here to protect your privacy.  We're here to help you with be more healthy.  This is a good story.  Both Mark-  Go ahead.

Transcript:  On a whole, I mean, of all the majors, even though I'm not an Apple fan,  I would trust Apple with my personal data more than I would trust Samsung,  Microsoft, or any of the big ones.  Yeah.

Start time: 3801.22
End time: 3835.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both Ben Thompson and Jason Snell did point out that the modern day Apple is much more interested  in ARPU.  We've talked about this before, the average revenue per user in selling services.  And in fact, interestingly, in the US, the iPhone prices did not go up.  And I think they're charging less for the watch Ultra than the comparable Garmin by a couple  of hundred bucks.  So Apple is either very sensitive to pricing or understands that it's more important that  they get these devices in people's hands.  So that's been true.  Make money on services.

Start time: 3836.24
End time: 3885.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been true since China mobile.  China mobile, like they got Verizon and then they got China mobile a few years after that.  And that was the last big market for them to expand into, absent there being one day  Apple stores on Mars.  And I think that's the moment.  And I think we talked about that on Mac break for years, that they went from building up  the iPhone to using the iPhone as a platform to build up not just services, but ancillary  products like Airpods and Apple watch.  All of those things are built AirPlay.  All those things are built on top of iPhone.  And now they have expanded services from iCloud all the way through the stack.  All of it again, built on iPhone.  So it's an amazing platform play where once you get to a point where you can't have that  many more customers, almost everybody who has an iPhone can afford an iPhone or wants  an iPhone, has that iPhone, you got to start getting more money from those same customers.  And that's a whole shift in business model.

Start time: 3886.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the number of people, Apple didn't say this is courage, but I think this is courage.  A number of people pointed this out.  One thing to take away a headphone jack, but to take away the SIM tray means you're taking  away any possibility of using a SIM, right?  There's no more SIMs.  Yeah.

Start time: 3911.82
End time: 3931.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the context of why I bring it up is that me, like I would imagine many of the  other folks that might have a set of phones within the family and then they're like the  main technology person.  So the main phone account is probably in their name, right?  And they probably do the whole phone hand me down thing whenever they do the next upgrade.  We do that.

Start time: 3932.38
End time: 3957.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I remember vividly,  I'm at the head of the table.  Then there's Lisa, then there's your son, Michael, then there's your ex-husband, Mike.  And I bring out the SIM tray poker.  I remove the SIM from my phone, give it to Lisa, put it in the new phone.  My musical SIM chairs.  It goes all the way down.  Poke, poke, poke.  So now what happens?  I think you have to call the company, which is annoying.

Start time: 3958.06
End time: 3967.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's you can Bluetooth SIM transfer.  Like for iPhones at least.  Yeah.  They Bluetooth pair and transfer the SIM data.  That's super cool.  But wait, but okay.

Start time: 3967.20
End time: 3972.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as you're paired with another iPhone.  Like how does that, does it trade them?  Does it swap them?

Start time: 3973.45
End time: 3978.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happens?  I think it can transfer from one to the other.  One to the other.  Yeah.  But what happens if you go in reverse order now?

Start time: 3978.68
End time: 3992.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in the past, you would get a SIM, you would have a SIM and just put it in the new phone.  That would automatically make it your phone.  Now, so I'm going to get my new phone on Friday.  What do I do, Renee?  I'll have my old phone.  It's part of the setup buddy.

Start time: 3992.44
End time: 4024.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So like setup buddy, which already has like 3000 steps on it.  There'll be a step to set up the SIM.  So this is US only first.  Like there's still SIM cards everywhere, but the US.  The US is the only one going eSIM only.  So during the setup process, it'll pop up that screen for you.  And it can also, you don't need wifi anymore to set it up  because that would be problematic if you didn't have a SIM card.  So it can also just join the, like the, I forget what the term is for it,  but it can go online and connect to your, yeah.  I don't think it's point to point Bluetooth.  I think it's, I have to look it up.

Start time: 4024.72
End time: 4035.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to have more security than that because I mean,  we already have a problem with people stealing SIMs.  Imagine if it were Bluetooth, SIM hijacking that could conceivably occur.

Start time: 4035.62
End time: 4046.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's a non-starter for me because I actually buy SIM cards.  Any country I go to, I buy a SIM card there and I put it into my phone.  So there is no e-transfer for me.

Start time: 4048.38
End time: 4058.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have eight eSIMs and only two is active at any given time,  which is probably more than enough.  Now the Verge did say the loss of the headphone jack was user hostile,

Start time: 4058.72
End time: 4084.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was stupid and user hostile.  They didn't go quite so far with this.  The one thing that's interesting though is that like the headphone jack,  HTC got rid of headphone jacks years before Apple did,  but nobody really cared.  And Motorola had an eSIM only phone two or three years ago.  Nobody cared.  It's that when Apple does it, every other carrier now,  every other phone company now has cover to do the same thing.  And that's what we tend to see the entire,  Samsung will make an ad making fun of them and then a year later,  they'll do the same thing.  Meanwhile, everyone else will just quietly move over.

Start time: 4087.38
End time: 4110.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is Apple's list of wireless carriers that support eSIM carrier activation.  And they're actually in quite a few countries, not Italy, I'm sorry, Robert.  And then there are quite a few companies within the US that support it.  And then this is the eSIM quick transfer that you were talking about,  Renee, and that's a subset of those.  In fact, it's not a far fewer carriers in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, AT&T, C-SPYRE, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon only in the US will support that.  Yeah.  I mean, I saw it's going to be really annoying for nerds several times a week.

Start time: 4124.12

Start time: 4126.90
End time: 4135.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the good news is you can't, Robert, get that iPhone in Italy.  You can only get it in the US.  Not even in Canada can you get the eSIM.  Yeah, no, ours have SIM cards.

Start time: 4136.32
End time: 4138.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4138.91
End time: 4151.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a tray.  That's what you need is the tray.  So I understand when you take the tray out, it occupies a lot of real estate.  And it's another hole in the case, which makes it harder to seal the case up.  I think it makes sense.

Start time: 4151.16
End time: 4192.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also like, it's not that main, so this is like one of those things where we talked  about different user groups, different constituencies, all with different priorities,  and where you start weighing those things.  So there's going to be a lot of nerds like myself included who are super salty about  this because we have 18 phones and we move that SIM card around all the time.  But most people don't.  Most people have a phone for four to five years.  And also people with accessibility issues having to get a SIM tool and swap the thing.  Even people who are just like poor iron coordination, those nano SIMs, they fall out,  they drop, they try to put it in the right way.  If you ever watch someone in your family try to do without grabbing it from them and  doing it yourself, you have more patience than Padre, I think, at that point.  But it does solve problems, but it does create all sorts of other problems.

Start time: 4192.66
End time: 4203.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the contention that it makes it easy, it makes it more friction-free to change carriers?  I'm on T-Mobile, but I want to go to Verizon.  Is it easy to do that?

Start time: 4205.08
End time: 4221.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's differently annoying.  In both cases, you have to get...  So I was telling a story, you have to go and get a SIM card and sometimes they won't give  it to you and sometimes they charge you for it.  Sometimes they mail it to you and you don't get it.  Sometimes you get it and it doesn't work for SMS for some reason.  Oh, your SIM card is faulty and you've got to go have your SIM card changed.

Start time: 4222.26
End time: 4234.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also problems when we went to 5G, I got a notice from both my carriers, T-Mobile and Verizon,  oh, you need to get a new 5G SIM.  So my existing SIM didn't support whatever it was.

Start time: 4234.58
End time: 4261.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's borderline intolerable that it's been going on this long because for everything else that we  have, all we do is log in.  You don't need a separate chip for your email or your messaging service or your website.  We're not pushing a bunch of little cards around, but we've had this archaic process  for so long with these and it really should be something like, I log out of AT&T, I log into  T-Mobile.  We're not there yet.  eStems got us a step closer and they hate it, but the more that we can dumb pipe-ify them,  the faster, the better.

Transcript:  I'm all for pushing forward the future.  Take away the headphone jack, push forward the wrong future.  But when you do something like this to push forward the future, and think of all the  paper clips that have died.  I have 18 ports on my phone that shows up to me.  Yeah, you would.

Start time: 4279.00
End time: 4298.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have double USB-C.  I would have double USB-C to my account.  I don't want my login.  Oh, you want a burner.  You want a burner phone.  Yeah, I am very paranoid about that.  I want that disconnect.  I want to be able to swap SIMs.  I want the carrier not to know which services I'm using.  That's the whole thing.  That's how I build up my mobile presence.

Start time: 4298.36

Transcript:  But they're tying, you have to pay for it, so they tie it to you through your payments.  Well, except...  Or do you go out and buy, here's some cash, here's some lira, give me a SIM.  No, exactly.

Start time: 4312.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that is a good op-sec, but honestly, I've walked around Padre's digs over there  in Italy on vacation.  I can attest to, yes, you could probably just go onto any given street corner and find some  person that will just sell SIMs for cash.  It's different.  But they work for the company.  We know all those people work for the company.  Yeah, that's just how it works over there.  And it's cheap.  It's super cheap over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is analogous to getting rid of cash.  It's the same argument in some ways.  I mean, cash is physical.  Or dongles, like USB dongles for software.  Get rid of USB dongles for software.  That's terrible.  Get rid of floppy disks.  Get rid of cassettes.  Get rid of all physical media.  I don't think that's a problem.

Transcript:  What's interesting to me is how Samsung was really early to 5G,  arguably before anybody could really use 5G.  Google's really early to RCS.  Apple is really early now to getting rid of the SIM card.  Is that annoying or does that force adoption to come even earlier?  And there's probably arguments to be made both ways.  But it is always going to hurt nerds.  Like nerds are, we are incredibly vocal,  but we are not a very large percentage.  And we are always going to be hurt first, hardest, and most by these changes.

Start time: 4446.88
End time: 4485.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So over the long arc of history, I think it should go away.  I think a lot of these things can be way friendlier for mainstream people.  I'm happy that Apple offers both internationally.  I don't know that you needed to get rid of both in the US.  But when a company like Apple does it,  it does in arguably push those technologies through faster.  Like when they got rid of the floppy drive, it did push USBC.  Adoption.  And when they got rid of hard drives, it did push,  passing the baton nicely to my co-host, it did push SSD adoption.  It's painful, but it's painful to those of us who grew up with the technology that we're losing.  Life is pain.  We built our lives around them.  Life is pain.

Transcript:  I actually, I have to be honest.  The whole punch of the notch, I hate the notch on my Macbook because I use a program that  doesn't know about the notch.  Apple's programs do, but my Emacs doesn't.  So there's this gap at the top of the page when I go full screen.  It just drives me nuts.  But you're going to have a camera.  You want a thin screen.  You want no bezels.  You're going to have a something.  The new iPhone Pros have a, instead of a notch, a cutout.  Two actually.  There's one that's kind of lozenge shaped and one that's a little dot.  But you will never see those two because of Dynamic Island.  And I want to give, I think this is actually pretty impressive.  I want to give Apple credit for taking lemons and making lemonade out of it.  They said they leaned into what is unfortunately something you have to  do, a cutout on the screen, and I think they've made it better.  I'm pretty impressed with Dynamic Island.

I've seen like Justine and Marques's videos.  Yeah, videos.  And a lot of the Apple stuff.  Yeah, it looks good.  But like if you go frame by frame to do some of those, it is, this is classic Apple.  This is like what we haven't seen from them in a while because some of the stuff has been  a little janky over the last couple of years.  Yeah.  This is really nice.

Transcript:  Can I be honest with you, Leo, now that I'm out and I can be based about this kind of stuff?  Yeah.  Most of the leaks are wrong.  Like they don't really know what's happening.  They get like little bits of fragmentary information weeks and months after it was  at all relevant anymore.  And it's just like, if you go back and look, like there was this huge scandal.  I barely, I saw it, but I tried to stay away from it where they were yelling at each other  and accusing each other of deleting their tweets to hide bad calls and stuff.  It's like, ah, no, like I'm glad that we live in an era now where Apple is like, here it is.  Like it's fun.  Go play with it.  And like you can follow the rumors if you want, but they're not going to be exact.

Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you.  I agree.  For a long time, I actually banned rumors, but the problem with Mac Break Weekly was  as we got closer and closer to an Apple event, there was less to talk about, less and less.  So we finally had a cave and start doing rumors.  So the idea is this pill, and by the way, there's a API so that developers of apps can use it as  well, will respond to the conditions.  So it'll show you what's going on.  It's basically a permanent widget, but it changes in size and shape depending on what  you're doing.  I think that's brilliant.  Robert, are you excited?

I mean, I've seen Twitter threads where people were saying this is destroying the iPhone  aesthetic.  I'm thinking why?  You've seen this before.  You've seen the notch.

Start time: 5068.22
End time: 5094.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it makes the iPhone a little friendly plastic pal you want to be with because it's  changing in response to what you're doing and giving you just the information you want.  I think potentially this is super cool.  We've never seen a widget like this and it sure does solve the problem of, well, what  are we going to do with this big fat hole on our screen?  By the way, it's iPhone Pro only.  They didn't put it in the notches still on the old iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they need like, because that camera focuses now, correct?  Yes.  Like that's the camera that focuses.  So is it that they had to lower it from the top edge because of that?  Like is that mechanism that goes?  It didn't want to bath so much?  Well, it's just like they only gained like not that many lines worth of pixels above  it.  So it's like, why did you really need to shift it down?  So I would imagine there maybe there's got to be some guts in there on the inside that  sort of forced the need to go lower.

But it looks like it's part of this larger black area.  But the screen is blackened really.  So they're hiding the fact that there's two holes.  I don't know.

Isn't it using the old model screen?  Oh, is it?  Maybe that's it.  Maybe they couldn't cut a hole in it.  I don't know.  There certainly is differentiation.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Apple's ordering process at 5 a.m.  Pacific time on Friday was the worst.  It's been in a few years.  I got up at five.  Mostly, you know, normally I wouldn't care.  I go to the store and get it in October and November.  But because I want to be able to talk about it early on on the radio show and on podcasts,  I usually like to get it as soon as I can.  So I had pre-saved the order one for Lisa, one for me.  5 a.m.  Store still closed.  Took about six minutes.  I'm really sleepy.  I did not want to get up.  I'm lying in bed looking at my phone on the side.  Finally comes alive.  Five or six.  I think, you know, Apple's intent was you just it says you've got  a pre-order.  So I hit that.  All you have to do is confirm it and go.  And it did weird stuff.  It didn't seem like it went through.  I looked at my orders.  I didn't show it.  Then I tried my phone and that really didn't go through.  The whole thing collapsed.  I just gave up.

You'll be three hours late and then not get a phone until October.  Is that what you you're not going to get until October?  Yeah.  Because I was used to being eight o'clock and I forgot that I was on  West Coast time.  So I looked away at a clock and I've been up for three hours like October 15th.  Oh, so isn't this just the pent up pandemic demand?

Can't you get like cloud flair somebody to back up your cart?  I don't know.  I just see.  Anyway, I went back to sleep, got up in the round around eight in the morning,  checked to see if that first order went through.  It had.  They finally started to show up.  So good.  All right.  I got Lisa's phone.  She got 512 black.  I'm looking around.  I don't want to get in October.  I want to get sooner.  So I found out I finally mess in with the configurator.  If I get 256 gigs in gold, which apparently wow,

I have to drive to Marin and pick it up at the Apple Store Marin at 330 on Friday.  But at least I'll have it.  So it was not a good.  It was honestly not a good experience.  And I wonder how much that hurts Apple.  I guess anybody who gets up at 5 a.m.  It's midnight GMT, I realized.  Oh, that's why they're doing it.  It's midnight GMT.  Anybody who gets up midnight UTC or whatever is serious enough that even if it's a problem,  they're not going to stop.  Yeah.  Right.  They're not going to go buy a Pixel because of it.  Right.

But the thing that always makes me smile is when somebody retires from like an Apple or  a Google or a Facebook, they go so hard the other directions.  They're like, I am never going on like, never mind an alpha.  I'm never going on a beta again.  I'm never going on a first release.  I am going to only buy Rev2 hardware from now on.  And then they're like, they don't know how to buy or set up anything because it's always  been provisioned by the company and they have no idea how like AT&T or T-Mobile works.  And then they buy like the cheapest thing they can to keep it for four years.  It's amazing.

Not necessarily a rat that changes color or go that crazy.  But then inevitably I get the car.  It gets a few of the early, you know, dinged up,  whatever happens to the front of it just from, you know, highway or rock chip or something.  And then I'm like, oh, great. Now it's not perfect.  Well, now why bother with, you know, doing the paint protection?

Start time: 5664.96

Monday, tomorrow, iOS 16 comes out, you know, notable mostly in my opinion,  because it will be the first implementation of pass keys.  So this is the new passwordless future.  Now, it's pointless to have pass keys until a website supports it.  But I guess it's one of those chicken and egg things.  Now that the iPhone has pass keys, maybe we'll see some websites.  Do you think this year we'll see some pass keyed enabled websites?

So those are the big three.  Apple's a little ahead of the bunch though.  Well, I hope it'll be like the first time I used an Apple watch to buy something,  the first time I get to use pass keys.  That will be coming to your iOS 16.  Apple was fast to implement it actually.

And his authentication was his Google voice number,  but his Google voice number was tied to his Google account.  So he couldn't authenticate his Google.  You know, if you're tying together your pass key and your eSIM  and all of your other information, at some point I'm thinking  you're going to lock yourself out of a verification step.  So just be careful.

Transcript:  I gave my mom the new Kindle Oasis.  And there's a little check box, which I never saw before,  but I was curious that says, do not attach my account.  You check that box and you can send it as a gift.  And it's not, it's got no account.  But then I had to thought, oh, this is going to be fun.  I'm going to have to call my 90-year-old mom and explain how to log into Amazon on her Kindle.  But beautiful.  It opens up and it says, now open the Kindle app on your old Kindle or your iPhone.  And it did.  And it's great.  I'll transfer it over.  It was the easiest thing.  It was awesome.  So yeah, Amazon does a good job with that.  That was impressive.  Yeah.  All right.

Honestly, I like it because every Pixel so far has been almost at a repudiation of the  previous generation Pixel.  It's very different.  And to me, that makes it harder because you're almost starting from scratch every year.  And this year, it looks like they're going to use the Pixel 6 as a foundation and just  accelerate forward on the 7.  That's the strategy Apple's been using and Samsung's been using for years.  I think it's really smart because it's an efficient use of everybody's time and it ends  up giving you a really stable, solid product.  I think that's going to be great.

He says he's 47.  He's constant as a Northern Star.  I am surprised.  I thought he was younger than that, to be honest with you.  So you look great, Jason.  Happy birthday.

Transcript:  For years they talked about it.  They only put it in the phone a couple of years after they announced it.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by Kohlide.  I like this sponsor because I like the idea of treating users like partners, not enemies.  If you're trying to achieve security in your company,  you want to keep the bad guys out and the good guys in,  whether for a third party audit or your own compliance standards.  In the past, the conventional wisdom is to basically treat each device like Fort Knox.  You glue up the USB ports.  You make sure people don't bring their own phones, their own laptops into the enterprise.  You use old school device management tools, MDMs, to force basically employees to give up  their freedom, to give up their performance, to give up their privacy.  The problem is what happens then?  Employees aren't stupid.  Employees aren't stupid.  They start using their own laptops or their own phones.  Now you've got a world of hurt.  Kohlide is a different idea.  It's an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful,  untapped resource in IT, your end users.  They're not the enemy.  They're your allies.  How does it work?  Well, you got to use Slack.  If you're a company that uses Slack like ours does, many do.  Instead of forcing changes on users, locking them down, Kohlide sends them DMs on Slack,  security recommendations.  The Kohlide agent is always looking for things.  Your passwords are in the clear in a download folder, for instance.  You left your private key unlocked and available.  Kohlide finds that and it will automatically then notify your team about the insecurity,  explain why it's a problem, and even better, give them step-by-step instructions on how to  solve the problem.  They are now enlisted as allies.  They know how to solve it.  They know why they're solving it.  And suddenly, it's not an adversarial relationship.  By reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM, educating them about company policies,  Kohlide can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security  because everyone understands how and why to do it.  You can also justify it very nicely for IT admins.  Kohlide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet,  whether they're running on Mac, Windows, or Linux.  Yeah, it works in all three.  You can see at a glance which employees, for instance, have their disks encrypted or their  updates on their operating system or their browser.  Which password manager is installed?  Is any password manager installed?  It makes it easy to prove compliance to your auditors, to your customers, and leadership.  So that's Kohlide, K-O-L-I-D-E, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams  that Slack.  You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.  It's true.  It works.  K-O-L-I-D-E, Kohlide.com slash twit to find out how.  Follow the link to hook you up with a goodie bag, including a t-shirt,  just for activating a free trial.  Actually, the t-shirts are really nice.  I have a bunch of Kohlide stuff.  I put the stickers on my laptop.  K-O-L-I-D-E, Kohlide.com slash twit.  We thank Kohlide so much for supporting this week in tech.  So Twitter is still in the news.  Let's just give you a quick rundown.  Of course, remember Peter Zatko, the former Mudge, the former security director.  Did you know Mudge?  Had you run into him at DEF CON or Black Hat, Father Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well known.  He worked for the DOD.  He worked for Google.  When Twitter hired him, I was impressed.  They hired him in the aftermath of that horror.  You know, remember that Barack Obama and Elon Musk and everybody were tweeting,  hey, I really appreciate what you've done for me.  So just send me some Bitcoin.  I'll send it back doubled.  OK?  Remember that?  I mean, it was horrific.  It was obviously somebody had access to a privileged account within Twitter  that let you tweet on anybody's behalf because the same tweet went out on dozens  of high profile accounts.  So that immediately showed that Twitter had a problem.  They hired Mudge to come in and fix it.  And then they fired Mudge after Elon's offer in January.  I think they got rid of Mudge.  They didn't say why they'd fired him.  Although later, Parag Agrawal, the current CEO of Twitter said,  we fired him because he was no good.  He was a lazy slob.  He said all sorts of mad things about him.  Now they're saying in the...  So of course, Elon Musk has subpoenaed Mudge.  He says this is evidence that Twitter cares not about the bots.  And here this whistleblower is telling us that.  Meanwhile, Twitter is saying, look, Mudge never flagged spam.  We hired him to fix the things that he's complaining about.  How could he complain about it?  This is what he was brought in to fix.  It ain't our fault.  And finally, the latest is the payout.  Apparently, Twitter paid Mudge $7 million.  Now Elon says, oh, you did, did you?  Oh, well then that means I'm out of the deal because that's what we call an MAE,  a material adverse event.  And that lets me off the hook.  He keeps trying to find a way to get out of this.  Clearly does not want to spend $44 billion.  And I think he's honestly, I think at this point, he's just grasping at any straw he can.

Transcript:  He sent a letter to his banker before the Putin speech back, way back in, what was that, May?  He said, maybe we should slow down this acquisition  in case we're heading to World War III.  Oh yeah, sure.  That's what's, yeah, you wouldn't want to buy Twitter if we're headed to World War III.

Transcript:  He had immediate, immediate buyer's remorse.  Instant.  And this predates all of his complaints about bots or spam or mudge.  So it's, I mean, anyone who's observing this objectively knows,  oh, this was a man who regretted what he did,  who regretted that he had already signed the contracts for the deal.  He's squirming.  He's just looking for a way to get out.  He's squirming.  Which is, that's his right.  He can do that.  But by the same token, this is the conversation we had earlier about the Musk super fans.  They make it so difficult to have an intelligent civil conversation about his responsibilities.  I mean, you signed a contract without actually going and doing your due diligence.  You should not be rewarded for that.  People should not think that you are a smart businessman for doing that.  And yeah, you should have to pay the penalty for that.

And then someone actually said, hey, you know, you like way overpaid for that thing, right?  Yeah.  And then he started actually doing the numbers and realizing I will never, ever make this back.  There's not a chance that Twitter will ever make this in revenue.

Transcript:  All right.  This all seems to be of a piece.  Elizabeth Holmes, also squirming, as you may remember, she found guilty  of defrauding investors with the Theranos scam.  Now, the first day I asked the judge, oh, just throw it out.  The judge said no.  I don't think so.  We're getting close.  The sentencing is coming up.  Now she says there's newly discovered evidence that the former  lab director at Theranos regrets his testimony.  He testified against her at the court.  Adam Rosendorff regrets his testimony.  He testified for several days in the trial.  You may remember if you've been following this.  Emphasized the pressure Theranos employees were under to demonstrate the faulty technology  actually worked, even though it didn't.  On the witness stand, he said, I felt that it was a question on my integrity as a physician  not to remain there and to continue to bolster results I essentially didn't have faith in,  et cetera, et cetera.  Now her attorneys are claiming that Rosendorff called Elizabeth Holmes on August 8th,  left a voicemail in a desperate bid, say the lawyers, to communicate he felt he had done  something wrong, apparently in connection with Ms. Holmes' trial.  So they're saying, you see, you see, Judge, he regretted it.  Now you should too.  They want a retrial under Rule 33.  We'll see.  I think this is just more squirming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the statements that this employee made don't touch on the fraud.  He basically said he felt that they weren't interested in solving the problems.  That's not the fraud.  The fraud is that they were selling a product they knew that did not work.  So his statements don't affect that at all.  They might affect the degree to which someone would say that they were continuing and  perpetuating the fraud, but that's not what she was convicted on.

It was delayed till October 17th because they want to see how it goes with Elon and Twitter,  I guess.  I don't know.  October 17th.  That's the same day as the Elon trial begins.

I think a lot of cryptocurrency experts would very much like it if the SEC would finally  decide, is this a security?  Are there going to be regulations?  The latest is the Treasury is about to recommend issuing a digital dollar, but only if it's  in the national interest.  Well, that's good.  You wouldn't want to do it if it's not.

Physical money anymore, although we kind of already don't.  I feel like, yeah, I'm not sure what a digital dollar means.  I think they mean blockchain secured ledger wise as opposed to just-  Right.  Some sort of stable coin type.  Today, the fact that your money is in the bank is just a number in their database versus  an actual-

Start time: 7498.72
End time: 7501.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So really they're saying decentralized ledger more than digital.

Start time: 7502.74
End time: 7507.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7508.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That's interesting.

Start time: 7512.90
End time: 7537.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That doesn't really replace the cryptocurrency function as a speculative financial tool.  That's the power of crypto.  That's why people get so enamored because since it's not really tied to traditional banking,  it can go as high or as low as people are willing to make it.  It is a digital junk bond.  So issuing a digital dollar doesn't really fix that problem or that advantage if that's how  you're looking at it.

Start time: 7538.74
End time: 7543.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. That's just a different form of a dollar in that context.  But what are they trying to fix?

Start time: 7545.50
End time: 7552.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  This comes out of President Biden's executive order last March  that said, give me some crypto recommendations.  This went to multiple departments.  The Treasury's document is not out yet, but they expected to say,  yeah, a digital dollar would work if it's in the national interest.  That's a non-recommendation.

Start time: 7580.34
End time: 7631.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This fixes one specific thing that people wanted to use crypto for, and that was the ability to  transfer around finances, resources very quickly and without regulation.  The digital dollar gives them the ability to do that without having to use a super speculative  tool where I might buy X amount of Bitcoin and by the time I've transferred it, it has risen  or dropped 20% in value.  A digital dollar, because it is backed by the Fed, is more like a stable coin.  So it's going to maintain its value.  It's pegged to the dollar.  It's just a non-physical dollar, which means you can count on all the traditional banking systems  being able to calculate exactly how much it's going to cost to move from point A to point B.  But again, that does not fulfill any of the financial speculative tool features of cryptocurrency.

Start time: 7632.68
End time: 7635.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be regulated at that point as well?  Absolutely.

Start time: 7636.28

Transcript:  There have been attempts to do a dollar-tied crypto for that same first part of what Padre  was just saying there.  Somebody wants a thing that's not going to drastically rise or fall within the next five  minutes before you go and actually use that currency for something you wanted to do  that would have been akin to using a US dollar for it.  There is literally a thing called Tether, USDT is the  code for it.  The intent there was for it to be a dollar-tied thing, but then there's this constant,  you're just barraged with, well, it's not actually tied to the dollar and there's all this sort of...  This seems like shenanigans were going on.

Transcript:  It becomes speculative even when it wasn't supposed to be speculative.  Supposed to be stable.  Right.  So it might actually be handy if you had the government behind the dollar said,  okay, fine, let's dispel with all of that speculation piece of if somebody wants a  cryptocurrency that is actually tied to the dollar, the US government would be the people  to do that.

Start time: 7706.40
End time: 7714.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7714.90
End time: 7727.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would get rid of the stable coins.  So the stable coins which the other cryptos use to peg themselves to the dollar  would become redundant if the US was actually creating a digital currency.  Correct.  It would be the dollar.

Start time: 7727.82
End time: 7737.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And government banks all over the world have been looking at the idea of issuing  digital coins, stable coins.  They always would be tied to some sort of stable currency.

Transcript:  But I don't think about I spend zero time thinking about stable coin.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm more like when I'm walking down Petaluma Boulevard down Main Street,  would I be jingling some digital coin in my pocket?  No, because it's digital.  Your digital wallet.  I pay for everything with my watch and phone.  It's just a dollar.  It's just a dollar.  That's already your digital dollar.  It's already digital, isn't it?  That's what's confusing to me.  It's just there would be a distributed ledger.  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, if you search on Google for Ethereum merge,  Google has now put a countdown up.  Three days, two hours, 37 minutes.  Yep.  We're counting down to the Ethereum merge.  This is Ethereum attempting to move from proof of work to proof of stake,  a much lower use of energy to do its calculations.

Start time: 7821.66
End time: 7828.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by much lower, I'm not sure if 99%  Yeah, it's like a ridiculous fraction.

Start time: 7830.02
End time: 7849.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As far as I could tell, I'm no expert on this.  The way a proof of work operates now is that all the miners get a chance to try to solve this  problem.  The first one who does gets the fee for the transaction.  Gets the reward.  So that's why miners, that's what's going on.  That's why miners mine.

Start time: 7850.66
End time: 7852.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All those other calculations are wasted energy.

Start time: 7852.93
End time: 7896.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem.  I think sometimes we think miners are mining for coin.  They're not mining to create new coin.  Some might be.  Mostly miners, I guess maybe they're doing that too, but mostly what they're trying to do is  put transactions into the ledger, into the blockchain.  A winning miner gets to do that and make some money.  So that's what the whole mining thing is.  Yeah, but all the other calculations wasted.  So proof of stake roughly works the same way, except instead of saying,  here's the problem, anybody work on it, they choose one person to work on it.  And they have some sort of lottery system, I guess, to choose it.  That person solves the problem, makes the money.  It considerably reduces the amount of energy.

Start time: 7896.20
End time: 7902.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7902.58
End time: 7908.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it solve any of the other problems of cryptocurrency?  It actually adds a problem.

Start time: 7909.24
End time: 7961.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because proof of stake is actually easier to fake than proof of work.  So there was already an attack on a very, I can't remember what was the name of the crypto.  That blockchain's already gone.  Someone borrowed enough of the cryptocurrency to have 50.1%.  Oh, the 51% attack, yeah.  Right.  And then they basically rewrote the ledger to say, well, it's all coming to me.  It's all mine now, baby.  Yeah.  Right.  So that only happened because that particular cryptocurrency was super young and there wasn't  that much stake.  And you're not going to see that in high volume cryptocurrencies.  But that is a possibility that if you're not looking for people who are trying to abuse  the system, it is significantly easier to get that 50% plus one.

Start time: 7962.88
End time: 7970.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it slow down the transactions?  You only have one miner working on it at a time, no?

Start time: 7970.70
End time: 7974.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because the difficulty goes to basically zero.

Start time: 7976.68
End time: 7980.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's one thing it would help because the speed of transactions has really gone up.

Start time: 7981.20
End time: 7985.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you could literally compute the next block in the chain for ether on a smartphone.

Start time: 7985.97
End time: 8000.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh good.  So proof of stake speeds up transactions.  Does it reduce gas fees?  Because that's the other problem.  The cost of putting these transactions in the ledger can be so high as to make it pointless.

Start time: 8001.58
End time: 8048.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The gas fees are based on throttling because there can only be so much in a block.  Right.  And so you're trying to add too much data to the chain per unit time.  Because each block is basically roughly a per unit time.  Right.  The ether blockchain tries to run at a constant, a fixed rate.  And it tries to regulate itself.  Right now it regulates itself by adjusting the difficulty.  In the future it doesn't need to do that.  It just does it by other means.  But for now it's just, well, just make it harder or easier to figure out the next block.  The next answer, the next solution to the next block.  Right.  But the gas fees would still have to exist for the sake of regulating  just the data rate on the chain.  Right.  So it doesn't affect the data.

Start time: 8048.82
End time: 8051.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't change the problem.  Right.

Start time: 8051.98
End time: 8069.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And gas fees get burned and there's going to be fewer block rewards now since there's not  going to be mining.  Right.  Which actually means that the amount of ether that exists is going to decrease over time.  Eventually.

Start time: 8071.33

Start time: 8079.28
End time: 8089.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know to what degree.  It depends on how much gas fees get piled up and everything else.  Right.  That works as a thing to make ether go away.  Right.  Go into the ether.

Start time: 8089.54
End time: 8105.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is mostly like a good idea.  But there are things that could go wrong and there are plenty of people who make money  as Bitcoin miners who think this is a terrible idea.  And they...  I mean, you're going to have...  Yeah, you're going to have those people that have...

Transcript:  It's good for those of us who are trying to buy GPUs.  But so their ether will almost certainly fork.  Just like NASA tests before they launch a rocket, they've been doing tests of the merge.  The 13th and final shadow fork executed today, I don't know what I'm saying,  with no apparent issues.  Actually, that was September 9th.  So the forks have worked.  So there is...  I mean, it could be a disaster, but it looks like all signs point to a positive change.  The merge.

End time: 8277.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so I was all excited.  When did they announce this?  Five or six years ago.  And they branded it Optane.  And the promise of it was what?  Faster, cheaper.  What was the hope for 3D CrossPoint?

Start time: 8279.80
End time: 8290.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So cheaper than RAM.  Right?  That was the idea.  Cheaper than...  Basically, it sat in between RAM and solid-state, traditional solid-state storage.

Start time: 8290.62
End time: 8295.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's how Intel has been selling Optane.  Which is, is it RAM?  Is it solid-state?  Yes.

Start time: 8296.42
End time: 8357.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been selling...  Well, they were selling both types of devices.  Yes, it's both.  There was a DIMM form factor that was sort of sit alongside the RAM in a server.  And you can make a very large memory pool where the DRAM is actually like a caching layer.  On top of the Optane DIMMs, which were sort of the memory pool, if you would.  Right?  But slower than what DRAM was, obviously, because there's always a catch.  Right?  You can't get something for nothing.  So that was one solution.  And then the other solution was you take the same chips, or basically the same chips,  and you stick them behind an SSD controller and connect it to PCIe.  Now you have a drive.  Now you have a regular drive.  Right?  So they were covering both types of forms there.  Right?  But there was just...  Someday there's going to be like a Harvard Business School study or some kind of like...  Somebody is at some point going to have to put something together that just sort of covers...  Here's all of the things that were against it.

Start time: 8358.18
End time: 8364.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my question.  Is it a market problem or a technology problem that killed Optane?

Start time: 8364.46
End time: 8380.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was kind of a little bit of everything.  Oh.  In my opinion, at least.  Right?  You had just sort of the fundamentals.  Right?  You had this thing that was so much faster than what was there traditionally as far as the...  Twice as fast as regular SSDs.

Start time: 8381.56
End time: 8382.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like doubling the speed.

Start time: 8383.66
End time: 8510.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, way faster than double.  Even more.  Oh yeah.  The latency...  When the Optane devices came out, the latency was roughly like...  The read latency was like one-tenth of a regular SSD.  Wow.  Right?  But speaking as far as like...  Well, how does that impact the whole system?  Right?  If you make a thing that just goes 10 times as fast,  suddenly the bottleneck shifts anywhere else...  It's now an I.O. bottleneck.  Yeah.  Well, it's everything other than the I.O.  Like it's...  You know, if you can make the I.O. one-tenth of the speed or one-tenth of time to complete,  then all of the sudden, if there was any other bottleneck or any other inefficiency,  with the kernel, the software, the application trying to access the thing,  it sort of shifted the burden everywhere else all of the sudden.  And it was a matter of, well, how fast can you possibly make an SSD,  like a PCIe SSD that plugs into the system?  And there is sort of a glass ceiling there where it's like,  well, the controller can only go so fast.  Just to negotiate to communicate on the PCI bus.  Takes a few microseconds.  So if you have a thing that can operate in 10 or fewer microseconds,  and the PCI...  Just speaking PCI Express consumes, say, I don't know, a third or half of that.  What was previously a very small fraction of a regular traditional SSD response time  was now very significant.  Right. And so when you combine all that stuff together,  that's just only speaking to the point of how much faster was the user experience  for it in the SSD form factor.  So it took literal years for everything else to sort of progress and for other pieces of the  puzzle there to become faster around those devices in order for the system to shine  more and more because of those devices.  So it was just ahead of its time.

Transcript:  And granted, there were still people...  Right near the end, there was the last SSD that Intel made that had Optane in it,  traditional SSD wise, was a P5800X.  This is just a fire-breathing SSD.  The thing was just super fast.  For the first time, they had shifted to a...  Previously, the controllers were even a bottleneck  because in order to take most advantage of the low latencies,  they sort of had to kneecap themselves on what was the highest  throughput you could get from the device.  So the earlier Optane devices couldn't even saturate Gen 3 PCI Express.  You have a bus that should go nearly 4 Gbps, but the devices were only going 2.  Actually, Leo, I think you had like a 900p at one point.  That drive would only do 2.2 or 2.4 Gbps.  Basically, it was bottlenecked by its own controller, throughput wise.  The latencies were amazing, but pure throughput, there was sort of this ceiling there.  That P5800X, when it came out, was amazing because they finally did a controller where  it could just go full speed of the bus.  It just didn't care.  There was no longer an Achilles heel as far as, oh, it's fast here, but it's not fast here.  Like that thing just annihilated everything.  However, it was expensive.

End time: 8707.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how long it will take for somebody else to do a cross-point style media.  Will we see another media come out that was as fast as Optane media?  I don't know.  Might take a few years.  If it does, who knows there.  There are some aspects of the storage community and industry that the mere presence of Optane  as a technology helped drive.  One of the big ones is CXL, Compute Express Link, which was the industry trying to solve  the issue of, hey, if you have really fast media that sits at a different tier from DRAM,  how do you connect it to the system?  How do you integrate it with the operating system?  How do you take advantage of it in a more appropriate way?  The funny thing about this is if CXL just appeared out of nowhere, say seven years ago,  Intel would probably have not announced stopping cross-point.  Interesting.  Probably would have been profitable because there was just this easy,  here's this better way to connect it to the system and take full advantage of it.  But that wasn't there.  There is this big chicken and the egg dilemma.

Start time: 8723.72
End time: 8733.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but you still have to worry about the performance capabilities of the different  tiers.  In other words, how are you attaching, even if you have a different architecture.

Transcript:  I guess the question everybody or certainly I had was,  is this a failure on Intel to capitalize on what was a good technology?  Or was this not such a great technology?  Or it sounds like it was a good technology.  It was maybe too good.

Start time: 8759.40
End time: 8819.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The technology was great.  It died too young.  Too good.  It was expensive to make, I would imagine.  I don't even know the actual numbers.  That's part of the problem.  It could not have been cheap to make it.  Before I even started working for Intel, I wrote the article at PC perspective of how  I did all the deep dive on ISSCC filings and things from years prior where basically I  figured out that, hey, this stuff is actually just phase change memory.  Even though Intel, when it first launched, would swear up and down that it wasn't,  they didn't want to say it was.  I still don't know what the reason was.  The technology itself was amazing.  I would even say phase change memory for decades was like the flying car of PC storage.  Remember that?  Like it was always, I'm sure Leo, you mentioned the term phase change memory on several of the  first round of screensavers as a thing.

Start time: 8831.80
End time: 8868.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually came to be, it probably wasn't cheap to make because again, you're trying to,  you're literally making a thing that can make a little tiny microscopic pole of metal alloy  molten and re-solidify.  That's wild, isn't it?  That's just wild.  Even to think about it now, that's ridiculous that it's happening inside of a chip to store a bit.  It's crazy enough to think that you're quantum tunneling electrons into a nan cell  to store bits, but actually melting like 600 degrees Celsius metal.  It's kind of magic what's going on in there anyway, isn't it?

Start time: 8868.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope so.  As an enthusiast, I want things to go faster.  However, so the Optane PCI SSD latencies were roughly in the 10-ish microsecond per  transaction timeframe.  And when it came out, SSDs were running at about 100, 90 to 100 microseconds.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  But now, modern-day SSDs are actually getting down to the 50s and the 40s microseconds.  For a much lower cost.  Yeah.  For a much lower cost.  You're getting to the point where Optane was well into the diminishing returns.  It's like if you got to 40 or 50, if you go all the way down to 10,  you're really splitting hairs on actually seeing much more of a benefit in that system.  So it's kind of like the NAND things are getting to the point where it's close enough.

Start time: 8939.00
End time: 8947.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8957.58
End time: 8963.42

Transcript:  Right.  Intel still has another, like the next server CPU to launch,  which is supposed to have support for the next generation of their DemForm factor Optane.  I don't know if they're, are they going to like yank the feature out from under the next Xeon  to come out?  I would guess probably not since like, I think all the work would have been done.  Yeah.  Again, I didn't work in that group.  Maybe get it while you can.  Sounds like.  Well, no, I mean, it's like, it's going to be a collector's issue.  Yeah.  Well, maybe, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That too.  Yeah.  As like a caching tier.  Yeah.  It was great for that too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great for all sorts of things.  It's just that there wasn't enough volume at that bleeding edge.  Right.  Even the caching argument is a hard one to make because most people are fine just with  one regular SSD in their system and they just don't.  They're like, well, why do I need to have this other extra complication?  Isn't that funny?  Right.

Guess who this show is brought to you by?  Worldwide Technology and Intel.  How about that?  I did not plan this.  WWT is at the frontier of innovation.  I'm really impressed with WWT.  We went out right before COVID to St. Louis to visit,  to see the Advanced Technology Center.  That is an amazing thing.  The ATC is a research and testing lab,  probably the last great research and testing lab in the world  that brings together technologies from all the leading OEMs.  More than half a billion dollars worth of equipment invests in the lab.  Yes, there's Optane there.  In fact, the ATC offers hundreds of on-demand and schedule labs  featuring solutions that include technologies like Intel Xeon scalable processors,  Intel Optane persistent memory, Optane SSDs,  and others representing the latest in multi-cloud architecture  and security and networking, primary and secondary storage,  data analytics and AI, DevOps, and so much more.  In fact, I vividly remember the Optane units sitting in the rack.  They looked so cool.  So, so cool.  WWT's engineers, I talked to them, the engineers that work in the labs,  they use the Advanced Technology Center to spin up proofs of concepts,  to learn about technologies, to integrate technologies  so that when they deliver to you as a customer,  they are giving you the best solutions.  They really help you get exactly what you need.  They also use the labs to cut evaluation time down from months to weeks.  But here's the great thing.  You can use the ATC too.  You can test out products and solutions before you go to market.  You can access technical articles, expert insights,  demonstration videos, white papers, hands-on labs,  and other tools that help you stay up to date with the latest technology.  The ATC is not just a physical lab space at WWT.  It's virtualized.  You can access it anytime, anywhere in the world.  All you have to be is a member of the ATC platform, and it's free to join.  While exploring the ATC platform, make sure to check out the great events WWT puts on.  We actually did an event out there.  It was so much fun.  Communities too that are all working towards the same goal  of learning about the latest technology trends and how to integrate them into business.  Because the thing that WWT really stands for,  and I really appreciate is they understand that technology is there to serve your business strategy.  So it's strategy first, but they're the ones that can integrate.  You'll learn everything you need at the Advanced Technology Center at WWT.  Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions.  WWT brings strategy and execution together to make a new world happen.

That should be very interesting.  October 6th, 7 a.m. Pacific time.  Happy birthday, Atari 2600.  September 11th, 1977.  As old as Jason Howell.  I was about to ask.  Is that the same exact day?  I don't know.  Jason, it is, I think.  The Atari video.  This, to me, the reason I'm excited is this was what got me into computing, really.  I spent a lot of quarters at Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theater playing Battle Zone on the big old Atari arcade machine.  I thought if I just put some of those quarters towards buying one of these, I could play it at home.

I had two and I gave one to one of our contributors.  A guy who did a show for us was talking about it.  I said, well, would you like my, would you like a copy?  Play it on your 2600.  Wow.  Ocean shipping rates have plunged 60% this year.  So if you've been thinking about bringing over a container, maybe on your way home,  put some of those Vatican Library books in there.

That was nothing.  Went all the way up to $20,000.  That was the peak in late last year, October, September last year, about a year ago.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a source of inflation right there.  So it's come down, but it's still not at the level pre-pandemic levels.  Pre-pandemic was $1,400.  Wow.  Wow.  Walmart charted its own ships because it got so expensive.  It was cheaper to get a ship than it was to get a container.  And I said, forget that.  We're going to do it ourselves.  So I don't know if this will help inflation or help keep costs down,  but I thought that was an interesting story.  Instagram fined $400 million because they gave up kids' data.  This is the Ireland privacy regulator data, privacy regulator,  $402 million against Instagram due to their handling of children's data.  Do you think it'll get any better?  No.

Transcript:  Reddit.  This is a new search engine, Luria, L-O-O-R-I-A.com,  that actually scrapes Reddit to find the favorite products in many of the Reddit groups.  So I just thought I'd pass that along to you.  Most discussed products on cycling or e-bikes or earbuds or headphones.  Sometimes it's a little, it depends on the subreddit.  Some subreddits are infested with spammers and companies, frankly, trying to improve.  Or just toxicity.  Yeah, or toxicity.  So, but hey, I think an interesting idea for search engine.  L-O-O-R-I-A.

Start time: 9934.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there was a thing just the other day that was one of those really hard to search for  kind of things and it wasn't until I added Reddit in.  Even then I had to go a little deep on it.  Oh yeah, you had to work.  Well, I had this one Dell laptop that like it was an IT build laptop because it was a work laptop.  So it didn't come with some of the regular software that would come preloaded on the Dell thing.  Mainly control panels for like sound.  And there was this real tech based something something that was adding this horrible echo  into like USB connected audio devices.  So like my headset was just doing this weird reverb whenever I was like using the headset.  I'm like, what the heck is going on here?  And I could not crack that problem.  And I mean, I'm reasonably savvy on computer stuff and still could not figure out what the  heck was going on there.  And it wasn't until it was at the bottom of some obscure Reddit thread where somebody was like,  oh yeah, you got to install this control panel from the Microsoft store for this,  we know sound max something something control panel.  Isn't that awesome?  That's why I love Reddit.

Transcript:  I use Reddit.  Yeah.  It's not just for memes anymore.  It's not just for memes.  Yeah.  Do you remember when Cirrus?  So you may think, hey, if a plane breaks in the sky, why doesn't it have a parachute?  You have the passengers have parachute.  Why does the plane have parachute?  You ever think that maybe after one too many spleefs and a couple of bomb hits?  That's a thing for Cessnas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Small planes can have parachutes.  Cirrus airframe parachute system or CAPS has been used for the first time.  This is the Cirrus Vision Jet, a single engine private jet.  They had problems.  They deployed the parachute.  The pilot, a boy and a woman walked away safe and sound because the parachute  brought them in for safe landing.  The first deployment of the airframe chute in operation.  Wow.

Start time: 10054.66

Start time: 10061.32
End time: 10068.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've seen deployments on Cessnas, unlike the old turboprop Cessnas.  This might be the first small jet.

Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  So I guess you got a big lever there.  You can pull it and you just float to the ground.  That's hysterical.  This is a simulator.  This is not real.

Start time: 10083.82
End time: 10088.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one thing though is once you pull that chute, you don't have any control over where  you're going to land.

Start time: 10088.54
End time: 10109.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're just going to land where you land.  You're in Newton's hands.  No miracle on the Hudson for you, buddy.  You're going to...  I like that.  You're in Newton's hands now.  That's hysterical.  Let's see.  Some new Linux malware out there.  Sounds like a nation state.  This is a big one.  I don't usually mention malware.

Start time: 10109.70
End time: 10111.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was reading about that.  It's real nasty.

Start time: 10112.87
End time: 10145.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shikitega.  Shikitega.  Shikitega.  Very stealthy.  According to the AT&T Alien Labs, the researchers who discovered it, the malware delivered through  a multi-stage infection chain using polymorphic encoding.  It uses legitimate cloud services to host command and control servers.  So it's very difficult to detect.  It can infect not only Linux machines but IoT devices based on Linux.

Start time: 10146.36
End time: 10166.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cloud provider thing aspect was the big thing that popped out at me as a possible defense.  You have to figure out where is it reaching out to?  Which cloud service provider?  Which addresses?  Sometimes even that's obfuscated and not readily obvious even if you have some code to disassemble.

Start time: 10167.32
End time: 10187.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dropper is only 370 bytes.  370 bytes.  Not megabytes or kilobytes.  370 bytes.  It's smaller than one second.  The polymorphic encoder is crazy because basically every time it runs it rewrites its code.  The underlying algorithm stays the same but if you're looking for the code to detect the threat,  it'll change every single time it runs.

Start time: 10187.92
End time: 10191.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Makes it hard to do signature based virus detection.  Is that the idea?

Start time: 10192.00
End time: 10205.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it stays in memory is another important aspect of it.  If no piece of it ever touches the disk then a lot of the antivirus type scanning tools  on regular endpoint systems just aren't going to see it.

Start time: 10207.24
End time: 10221.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's very, very flexible.  They included a metasploit module called METAL which allows me to take over any connected devices.  So USB cameras, USB microphones, I can remote execute code.  Oh, Lord.  It's pretty nightmare.

Start time: 10222.14
End time: 10227.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not good.  It also could put a crypto miner on there just in case you want to make some money.  Exactly.  Why not?

Start time: 10227.84
End time: 10235.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the good news here is that I think it's a tag vector.  It wasn't like one or two different CVEs or something.

Start time: 10235.30
End time: 10236.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, there are two of them.

Start time: 10237.10
End time: 10250.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's two of them but it's issues that like there are patches out.  So it's a matter of like obviously and I think we talked about this last time I was on Leo.  Make sure all of your things are updated.  Patch your things.  Patch all the things.

Start time: 10250.44
End time: 10254.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is of course IOT devices which often are not patchable and they well have...

Start time: 10254.60
End time: 10268.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem are Raspberry Pis that haven't been updated for 15 years or whatever it's been.  I've got a couple of years that I mean I have to force myself to remember you got to update  your Linux.  Just go ahead and run the update.  Why not?  It takes a couple of minutes.  Yeah, right.

Start time: 10269.68
End time: 10329.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the CVEs has been in the Linux kernel for 12 years.  PwnKit was discovered last year and has been patched in most in a modern Linux you're patched  but IOT maybe not so much.  The other came to light in April of last year.  Both have been patched but this is yeah it sounds like a nation state but of course that crypto,  the Monero miner is a little weird.  Nation state won't do that unless it's misdirection.  That sounds like a script kitty thing.  Yeah, it's pretty cleverly written.  Okay, I think we have literally done all the stories.  I got nothing left.  So I can let Jason go have some birthday cake I think and let you all go have some dinner.  Renee, I miss you.  I think you're doing God's work over there at YouTube as creator liaison.  They are so lucky to have Renee Richie there to kind of go like the Tim Gunn.  You go in there you do a Renee talk and say let me tell you something as a YouTuber.

Start time: 10330.50
End time: 10340.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an amazing team.  I am continually oppressed by just how much they care about creators and viewers and almost  all the discussions are about like how we can best serve as many of them as possible.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  YouTube.com Renee Richie once a week and at Renee Richie on Twitter and I just hope we see you again soon.  Absolutely.  Miss you terribly but it's great to hear from you.  Likewise.  I thought man if we can get Renee on for this show that would be pretty cool.  So now that I know I can get you that's great.  Same for you Alan Malventano no longer at Intel.  Now at Soledime still studying SSDs and as you probably could tell kind of an expert  and our favorite Submariner.  Thank you for being here Alan.  You keep bringing up the submarines.  I love the submarines.  You're the only guy I know who's ever been on a submarine for real.  So that's cool.

Transcript:  A single customer but you know he's a big wig.  He's an influencer I would say.  DigitalJesuit.com Padre SJ.  So great to see you.  I miss you.  I miss you all.  This is fun.  Get the OGs in here for a twit.  I really appreciate it.  We do twit every Sunday around 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.  Please join us.  You can watch us do it live so you can see all the mistakes all the fumbles all that stuff at twit.tv  slash live.  If you're watching live chat live the IRC is open all day and all night but usually gets a little  more exciting during shows IRC.twit.tv that's open to all.  Of course we also have a club.  The club twit is really a great place to get together in our discord.  I've become a huge fan of discord.  Club twit is the place to be if you ask me.  We talk about not only the shows but all sorts of other things going on including  coding and ham radio and books and comics.  We've got Stacy's book club coming up.  We've got other events planned in there.  We also use the club to subsidize new shows.  You saw hands on windows with Paul Thurotte.  We do hands on Mac with Micah Sargent.  We do the Untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett and Rob Campbell.  We also do the Stacy's book club.  We do the giz fizz.  All of those are subsidized by club members because they're either too new or too small  to have advertising.  So the club members subsidize that with their money.  You also get ad free versions of all the shows because you're contributing so we don't need  to show you ads.  You don't even get this ad.  You'll also get access to the twit plus feed which has the hands on Mac, hands on windows  and lots of other stuff that doesn't make it to the public podcast.  All of that, that's a lot for seven bucks a month.  That is a good deal.  There's yearly plans.  There's enterprise plans.  Find out more and you can buy some shows individually ad free for $2.99 a month if you  just want to subscribe to those.  All of that at twit.tv slash club twit.  This show appears along with all the other ad supported shows on our website.  As soon as it's done, twit.tv.  There's also a YouTube channel for it and all of our other shows.  Each of them has their own channel plus the main twit channel, youtube.com slash twit.  And there's also of course and probably the best way to get a podcast feed.  Subscribe and your favorite podcast player.  You'll get it the minute it's available just in time for your Monday morning commute.  I think easily the longest running tech podcast in the world in our 18th year.  Thanks for joining me.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit.
