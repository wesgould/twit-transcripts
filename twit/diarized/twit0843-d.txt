Transcript:  Fits with fits. So the idea is that's short for outfits with benefits. Oh outfits. I get it. Yes  Fits with fits so it fit they fit with your other fits. It's all sustainable  It's all a secondhand and actually I am giving away a set right now  So if anyone is interested in this and thinks it's a cool thing  There's a local business person here in Orange County where I live who has a real-world brick-and-mortar boutique  Bohemia Newport Beach and she has struggled through the pandemic that has managed to keep her business open  And she had the dubious honor of being the first business in Orange County  To require customers to be vaccinated to enter her store. Oh god  I think she's doing great  But she is located in this very touristy part of town right down by the beach right down by a lot of bars  And so there's a sign out front that says you have to be vaccinated to come in and she's gotten a bit of grief  so I am giving away a set of  Fits with fits to help her out. So if you go to Bohemia Newport Beach on Instagram  There's information there how to enter and win it and I will just say too that you don't have to wear them yourself  They are giftable. They arrive very nicely packaged and might be a nice gift for someone. It's really cool

I love the idea and I and I think it's great that you're supporting a store that requires masks  For all the grief they get I don't know about you, but I'd much prefer to patronize a restaurant or a business where they say  Vaccinations masks, please. I feel much safer  You know, I don't let if you don't want a mask if you don't want to get a vaccine  That's fine go to those businesses and I'll just stay away. Thank you very much  I think I think this is this is I don't know what's happening. It's crazy. Anyway, great to have she got attacked  You know, I mean, it's ridiculous. So ridiculous also with us sitting just to your left Nicholas de Leon. He is a senior reporter  Consumer Reports specializes in tech there. Hey Nicholas. How are you?  Hello Leo. I'm doing well.

Transcript:  Battery capacity on these is amazing. What I wish is that the cities were more bike friendly  I mean the real reason I don't ride it all the time. I would ride it all the time, but I'm afraid of getting  clobbered  There's a you know, these this ghost bike movement where they paint where somebody's died riding a bike and they paint the bikes white  They're all over Sonoma County, but there's one on the bridge that I would go over every day  As soon as I saw the ghost bike somebody was killed there.

Start time: 691.12
End time: 870.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's a very I always felt nervous going over it. I would be even before I was scared of this bridge  There's no bike lane. It's very narrow. It's terrifying  You've got a I always would look over my shoulder and wait till it there was no traffic and then speed over the bridge  But it's just it's not bike friendly and boy would be nice if cities were more bike friendly  It'd be just a wonderful way to to get around  I'd love to see that  And maybe then I would get a stoma  Like the looks of that that's great  but we have we have all the rad powers the city and the and the  Big fat tire one and very happy with us. All right enough  Enough let's talk tech tonight  You know, I guess you know what in about 20 minutes on the East Coast  60 minutes is gonna do a big expose on  Facebook Facebook already nervous after seeing the tease Nick Clegg who runs their I don't know effort to  calm everybody down  Division has already put posted on Friday a Facebook post saying  Don't worry, it's not bad. It's not like it's like they say  1,500 word went memo. He's Facebook Facebook's vice president former deputy prime minister in Great Britain  with  interesting reviews  He wrote a 1,500 word essay  He's their vice president of policy and global affairs to preempt the whistleblower interview tonight on 60 minutes  He said the the allegations are misleading  This is I think Facebook's  Point of view on this and I'm not sure I disagree with it social  This is a quote from Clegg's memo social media has had a big impact on society in the recent years  Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out  But what evidence there is simply does not support the idea that Facebook or social media more generally is the primary cause of  polarization I  Don't disagree Facebook's been in the  Spotlight ever since the Wall Street Journal began its Facebook files  reports last week  Primarily based on this whistleblower who is I guess finally coming forward on 60 minutes  Later this week. Well, he or she will be testifying in front of the Senate  So we'll probably learn their identity at that point  The documents that were leaked out include internal slide decks one of which said  Instagram is bad for young women who feel bad about themselves already feel worse after Instagram  After seeing Instagram Facebook said you've mischaracterized the findings  But the real accusation is that Facebook kind of like big tobacco  Knows about the problems Facebook causes but buries it doesn't release that information to the public let alone doing anything about it  Denise  Is there anything Facebook could do should Facebook be worried about tonight's 60 minutes?

Start time: 872.32
End time: 956.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they've gotten out in front of it and I don't know if you've seen he not only issued a memo  But also was on Brian Stettler's show  on CNN  So if you've seen Nick Clegg speak about this as well  He's very commanding and capable and I think persuasive and makes some good points about the fact that  There's not a whole lot Facebook can do to shut down things as they're happening in real time. For example  You know, I think there's a  fine line between needing to  Hopefully detect and stop  Terrorist acts and  Also needing to let people do what Facebook is for, you know organize congregate talk with each other  And and certainly you're not gonna  Hopefully nobody wants to keep Facebook from doing the latter. That's that's what it's there for  We can't just have an internet where everybody I mean, I suppose we could that's the alternative right to have an internet where everyone has their  Own websites and no platforms  Before that's basically what you're what you're headed toward if you're saying that social networks can't let people  Organize a march in Washington, you know, I mean, I of course we're concerned about more than just a watch a march

Start time: 956.96
End time: 998.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but one of the things a whistleblower said is that  Facebook and this is some internally I think some Facebook employees have also  Raised this issue that they had protections in place for the election  But as soon as the election was over they took them down and it's now being said that was premature  Because it was then that Facebook was used to organize the January 6th insurrection  So that perhaps Facebook acted too quickly to take down their protections  I  You can't say that all the problems in the world come from Facebook by any means Nick  Legg says it's ludicrous to blame the Capitol riot on social media. I guess the question is does Facebook have any responsibility in

Transcript:  Mean they seem to they they take down, you know false kovat and vaccine posts  They try to do something about it. Do they have any responsibility a and B do they have the capability? They're big. They're huge  It'd be almost impossible to monitor Facebook in real time  What what look you're you're a publisher Seth what?  What is the responsibility of a platform in this in this complicated world?

Start time: 1027.60
End time: 1100.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so I will say that I don't think Facebook is a net positive currently on the on humanity  So, you know, what could they do to get better?  Obviously, you know you mentioned they they had a bunch of stuff up for the elections, but then they took it down  Well, why would why would they take it down? Well, the election was over I guess  Yeah, but like all the protections that they could put up  Why not keep those protections up and keep those people employed and keep you know, they make quite a bit of money  It's not like they can't spend a little bit more money on on people looking out for  big issues, I just don't think Facebook is  Run terribly. Well, I mean obviously it's run really well as a money-making machine  But in terms of like net positive to society  They just do what you know the bare minimum and they they know they're gonna get fined by the government every few months or years  And they take it and they do all the PR spin that they you know  Always do and we kind of just live with it like it just keeps happening and they say oh, we're sorry  You know, we'll do this and that and everybody's like, okay  And then next month something else happens and this has been going on for like, I don't know five years whatever

Transcript:  I don't know. I'll channel my friend Jeff Jarvis because he's always the defender on our this week in Google show  It was Facebook was where?  That 17 year old who took the video of George Floyd being murdered  went she she probably was too young and and you know not  Respectable enough to get the attention of a newspaper to be a whistleblower there  so Darnell Frazier went to Facebook and posted that George Floyd video and began a  Massive movement in the United States to protect black people  That's a net that's a positive  That's one way social media amplifies look social media. I'm not by the way  I'm not in disagreement with anybody with you Seth because I can I'm not on Facebook  I don't like Facebook  But I I think it's important to point out that Facebook  Amplifies all voices and some of those voices are good important

Start time: 1161.05
End time: 1169.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's probably other ways to disseminate that video  Disseminate that video or you know if she was recording it in Facebook if their Facebook didn't exist

Start time: 1169.86
End time: 1190.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She would be recording it in a different. Yeah, I think she recorded on her phone and then posted it on Facebook  So right I mean there might have been other places, but certainly it was Facebook look  This is the both the positive and negative Facebook. It's very good at  Galvanizing people to action and sometimes it's positive sometimes. It's negative  Hey

Start time: 1192.94
End time: 1282.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we're seeing with this this Wall Street Journal coverage  The Facebook files and and and the fact that there's just a big focus on the platform right now  Is market forces at work? I mean there are people both inside and outside the company that are  Looking at what it's doing and scrutinizing what it's doing and it's got you know, Facebook's all about the bottom line and if it wants to  Survive and stay competitive and not keep chasing off people like Leo  And it's gonna have to govern itself in a way that people do feel like it's a net positive  or at least  not always negative, which I think we're seeing a lot of  now I actually in all this coverage of  Teens on Instagram and the other leech documents the slide decks that and reports that talked about  Facebook's knowledge of its impact is particularly Instagram's impact on on teens and how it can have  How it's lots of users link it to their suicidal thoughts and they have negative body image and various other  You know very negative things for teens or anyone  I was actually kind of heartened that they're doing that research that internally they're having these discussions  Internally they're having these discussions because maybe that's a good point  Maybe the market forces are you know, if they had not been leaked and outed  Maybe decisions would have been made that hey, it helps our bottom line to make sure people stay safe

Transcript:  It feels like it would be fair Nicholas to say to Facebook  Great. You did the research. Here's what we want release the research  Let us all see every bit of it to let independent researchers like NYU do their work  Instead of banning them from the platform and protecting yourself  Let let information come out and let us be the judge. Wouldn't that be a fair thing to do? Nicholas?

Start time: 1307.16
End time: 1335.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That seems fair and to me seems like so such an easy decision for Facebook to make and it would sort of like deflate  A lot of this like media angst and antagonism towards the company if they were just slightly more  open and transparent with this information  It the attitude come from the company just seems  Maybe not belligerent, but they're entrenched in it or something. They don't want to they don't they seems like they like a fight  This is how tech this is how big tech acts

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't understand the communications, you know the comm strategies some of these companies just to be just automatically like reflexively  Just like attack be defensive it rather  It doesn't appear to be like, you know diffusing the media  Interest so I don't I don't know that it's a great strategy. It's funny. They've got Nick Clegg there  Maybe I don't know what he's arguing but this this attitude this combative attitude  It doesn't appear to be working and if they are doing this research and they do have you know, they I  Don't know it just feels like they're already doing the work. Why not just release it, you know

Start time: 1374.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if Facebook did two possibilities one is I think Facebook probably rightly so thinks normal people are users  They don't care. This is this is all a big  They're the Wall Street Journal in 60 minutes  Maybe 60 minutes scares them a little bit because real people watch 60 minutes  But I think most people say, you know, I don't care  I use Facebook to stay in touch with my grandkids with my high school sweetheart with you know with my my my neighborhood group  It's good for that. Well, I don't care. I don't see all that stuff. It's not a problem for me  Yeah, and they just kind of say they brush it off and I think Facebook's probably  Strategy is well, we're not gonna worry about it because our users don't care. There's also though. Maybe Facebook's a little worried about  government intervention and  I'm gonna play a clip that's kind of embarrassing  Senator Blumenthal talking to Facebook's safety chief this week, you know what the term  Finsta is I hadn't heard of it before but I looked it up sure which Dick Blumenthal probably should have done  It's short for fake fake Instagram  It's something kids do they can't create a fake account so that they can be private so they can share photos not publicly  But privately on Instagram, it's a way to use Instagram for privacy for some I don't know why for some reason Dick Blumenthal  Thought it was something something terrible. Will you commit to ending Finsta?  This is an act a question for Facebook's

Start time: 1459.60
End time: 1484.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, let me explain. We don't actually we don't actually do do Finsta  What Finsta refers to is young people setting up accounts where they want may want to have more privacy  You refer to this privacy from their parents what in my interaction with teens?  But I found that they sometimes like to have a an account where they can interact just with their with a smaller group of  friends

Transcript:  That's good you ought to start a meme I could just see him peddling this car  Congress has shown it kind of singular look they've shown a appropriate interest in what's going on  And maybe there's something to do about this, but they've also shown a singular inability to understand it  Dick get an Instagram account. You know, it's not that hard. I think there are a lot of people your age who are doing that  I'm your age  It's bizarre this is

Start time: 1550.50
End time: 1581.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A series of tubes. This is ridiculous. People are trying to defend him saying no  He actually knew what it was  He actually did earlier in the hearing read a definition of what a Finsta was. He read it out loud  So he either wasn't paying attention when he was reading  It didn't sink in or or people are actually like trying to get in his head and say no  He must have meant he doesn't want  Instagram and Facebook to enable kids to have  Accounts that they multiple accounts and somewhere they're not using their real name and I mean that's a stretch

Transcript:  Air if the Senate saying oh, yeah, we got to make sure and by the way  There is a there are people who think that the problem with the internet is anonymity and we should just make everybody have one Facebook  Account, that's their real name and they should provide ID and one Instagram account  That's their real name and they should provide ID if that's what they're going for. That's terrifying  That's not the answer

When was it Friday?  And and they can do that over and over again and get out in front of their voters and say look and  Except when they're completely doing a series of tubes botch  They're saying we're paying attention to these issues that matter to you and and you should reelect us  I mean basically that's the whole  Context of what's going on there?

Transcript:  And honestly, yeah, if there's if Facebook's doing anything wrong, they're just not paying enough money to the right people because  gun manufacturers and and the military industrial complex and  The Koch brothers everybody else knows how to handle Congress  It's  It's Silicon Valley's just hasn't figured out you just give a few senators some money and it all goes away  You don't have to worry anymore  All right.

Issued a statement advisory did a whole press conference. I'm not sure exactly what what  The document he published is called. It's not it's non-binding. It's more of a guidance, but  He he was very  Concerned about misinformation and he pointed a great big old finger at big tech  And said the tech companies actually have a much better sense of how much misinformation is being transacted on their platforms  And without understanding the full extent of it. It's hard to formulate the most  Effective strategies and he's got a point and what he's getting without anybody enacting  A law or having grandstanding hearings is I think you can draw a line from  Those actions by this one person in government back in July to what we're seeing now on the platforms

On these platforms I would go so far as to say the the current iteration of the iphone they just started selling  It's new what's it called cinema mode?  Yeah, where they've taken yeah where they've taken you blur out the background in photos in portrait mode  You can you can do that in your videos now, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, we live in that world. So I mean we live in a world where you know  Okay, do do kids really need to be protected from some of this stuff?  I'd say yes, but a lot of that should fall to  How kids are educated about how to use the tools?  The what harms the tools can do to them how to you know  Take it in stride and take it with a grain of salt and know that I mean  I have a teenager and I can tell you he and all his friends know that the stuff that they see on instagram  Isn't real they know that it's good. It's uh formulated for their consumption  That doesn't mean they don't hold themselves to those standards, but they're skeptical about it. They're aware of it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I I actually am kind of sad about that really  I mean not  Somebody's got to give kids a platform they can use to I don't even know if club penguin exists anymore  But they they're gonna go somewhere  Shouldn't it be you know, shouldn't it be by a company who understands?  What their regulatory obligations are under coppa?  and you know that's actually gonna have the  Huge deep pockets you need to be able to comply with those regulations that are already on the books  And uh now we've got our ftc chair lena con is her name. Yeah, um, she uh,  She issued a memo this week that is really interesting and deserves a deep dive  About how what the ftc under on her watch what she wants the ftc to do about  privacy and ad tech and children's tech and  Um on and on it's pretty interesting and and she's very savvy and very anti big tech, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and she may you know, there's been some uh pushback that some of what she's proposing might be beyond the ambit of what the ftc is  actually allowed to do under its  Designated authority but but it's interesting that there might be some um  Attention paid from that front because the ftc is also who's responsible for enforcing coppa  One of the things she says is if you expect us the ftc to you know  Be the enforcement arm of all these concerns. You're gonna have to give us the resources we need  She says they're vastly underfunded to  Be able to do the job here and and she's probably right. I mean, you know, does she have

Transcript:  I don't know the ftc has teeth and it can enforce things and she has legal theories as to how she has the authority to do  Some of this stuff, but those theories will be challenged and you remember net neutrality  How that wound up going back and forth back and forth in court. We might see that kind of

Start time: 2474.82
End time: 2552.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scenario playing out here as well. I think that's all for the good  I think this is a conversation that we should have the ftc is a very natural place to have those conversations the courts  Are the right place to adjudicate those maybe better than congress  Uh, and if if laws need to be made if any trust laws need to be modified for the modern era, that's fine  Congress can do that. This is this seems to be all to the good  You know  It's it's a very it's an intractable problem, but I don't think you could put it on  Mark zuckerberg's shoulders to fix facebook  Uh, I think he he is like any business going to act in his own self-interest  As as much as he can  I think it's going to be up to uh us the people in the form of our government  To figure out how we want to solve this and I think just more transparency more openness probably is the right way to go  Uh, it's kind of  It's a I I hate to get into the conversation because it's it's it's really such an endless  Conversation we we have it all the time and I don't know what the answer is  But tonight is going to be an important turning point. I think in this  Because 60 minutes has such reach so many people will see this and i'd be very curious to see  What your uh, what your mom thinks seth after?

Transcript:  Yes, they do, but we don't know. Okay, but yeah, that's the that's  The impression I get is the whistleblower that went to the washington post  Has now gone to cbs and will be testifying on tuesday in front of congress  You mean the wall street journal? I did I say I met the wall street journal and then cbs because of 60 minutes. Yeah  Yeah  Apparently carah swisher was on uh on meet the press today and said that facebook is amplifying and weaponizing hate  So, uh, there's a there's a strong voice in the tech community  Coming in on on this I said it's a very interesting conversation  And it's I think I agree with you seth. It's clear. There's a problem. I just don't know what the answer is  I just don't know what the answer is  We'll take a break come back with more good to have you all  Uh, in fact, it's great. It's better than good. It's great to have you back seth weintraub publisher a editorial director at nine to five  An electric he's the founder there and  Uh, he's got some new magazines great to see you denise howell  Our my internet lawyer  From denise howell.info and fits with fits  And nicolas de león who's a tech reporter senior reporter at senior electronics reporter  Let me get that right at consumer reports. Thank you. Great to have all three of you  I have a great little tool that we've been using here at twit for some years now to protect your security  We talk so much about ransomware  Uh, the real problem these days with ransomware is it doesn't just happen all at once  Uh a bad guy uses exploits  Probably fishing to get into your internal company network and then instead of triggering it right away  They wander the network they look at resources  They exfiltrate information that they can use either to blackmail you or just to sell on the black market  Uh, and then once they really understand your network sometimes  Months or years later  Then they might trigger the ransomware  So the trick to protecting yourself is to know when there's an intruder and so many people protect the perimeter  The periphery and then forget that you also got to check what's going on on the inside  That's where the things to canary is so  cool  We talk a lot about advanced persistent threats this idea that that that bad guys  Are in your network?  But rather than the villain lying in in wait inside your network. You've got a hero  Waiting for them  It's unfortunate companies find out too late. They've been compromised. I think it's on average  It takes 191 days for a company to realize there's been a data breach  That's six months and and you can think of some cases where it's been years  Years before they even know somebody is in the network  Even after they've already spent millions in it security canary is something you have to have that goes hand in hand  With your perimeter security to detect prowlers inside  Your network, what do they do? They browse active directory for file servers. They explore file shares looking for documents  They'll see network devices. They'll try default passwords to log in to your routers and your nas  Servers they'll scan for open services across the network just gives you the creepy crawlies even to think about it  Things canaries are a little appliance. They're like an iot device, but they're very clever  They can pose as anything when you go into the canary configuration  You can tell it to be a router or a switch or a nas server mine's actually set up to be a synology  nas  A windows box or a linux box you can turn on as many services as you want do a complete christmas tree light them all up  Or be more judicious  The beauty of this is thinks canaries don't look vulnerable in your network. They look valuable  They look like something a bad guy wants to get into with my nas. It has a synology mac address  It has the synology login page identical when they try to log in I get a notification somebody is trying to log into your canary  There's somebody inside your network  You can even use things canaries to put fake files around your network scatter them around the they call them canary tokens  They can look like a pdf a word document a spreadsheet. I have spreadsheets on our network that say things like  employee payroll information  You know and as soon as somebody tries to open it boom, I know I love it because you don't get  You know a slurry of of false positives  Do you only get alerts when there's really something to be paired paying attention to and you can get them in any way?  You like email you can get a text message. There's a console that comes with the canary. You can have slack  They support web hooks. They have an api so you can make it work with anything  syslog if you like to use that  You're gonna love having this on your system and not just one you probably want more than one there's some banks big big  Enterprises that might have hundreds of canaries smaller companies might just have one or two  They're deployed all over the world all seven continents  The guys who designed this have been in the security game for more than 20 years  They've trained companies militaries and governments about breaking into networks. They know from the other side  What hackers are doing and what they're looking at and that's why they designed the best honeypot ever  The easiest to configure and it's it's a great deal too. Let me give you an example  Let's say you want five canaries go to canary dot tools slash twit  7500 a year  You get your own hosted console you get upgrades automatically support maintenance if you sit on one and break it  They'll send you another one. It's all part of your deal  By the way, if you use the code twit in the how did you hear about this box?  You could take 10 off that price forever for as long as you use your canaries  And if you're not happy there's a great two month money back guarantee  So there's really no cost to trying this out and seeing how it works  The best thing is you put this on your network. If you don't hear from it, you're happy  It's it's great. It's quiet. It just sits there quietly. We've only had our canary go off once and when it did it was good  We knew  There was a it was a device on our network scanning all the nases on the network actually not just the nases all in network devices  It was a nasa itself. I don't know it was from western digital  I don't know why it was doing that but we  We tracked it down. We got rid of it right away canary. Tools  Slash twit offer code twit 10 off for the life of your device  Canary dot tools slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of this week  in tech  Oh, let's see going on with  But more moral panic, let's see what else do we have more moral panic have you seen it?  Okay, this was actually interesting amazon had an event we didn't stream it because they don't do a public stream  But a lot of people went to went to it. I don't know if you sent reporters to it, Seth  I imagine you did showing all these new echo devices  uh  I thought one was interesting.

Well quote  This is from vice astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented with the opportunity  The person detection is unreliable at best making the in-home security proposition laughable  The device feels fragile for something with an absurd cost the mast has broken on several devices  Locking itself in the extended or retracted position, which means there's no way to ship it back to amazon when it happens  They're also pushing it as an accessibility device  But with the mast breaking and the possibility that any given moment it'll commit suicide on the flight of stairs its best  Absurdist nonsense and marketing and at worst potentially dangerous for anyone who would rely on it for accessibility purposes  Maybe just a disgruntled former astro designer.

They're actually recording it for biometric purposes

I mean I guess any customer service rep kind of does this anyway intuitively  But now they're using software to do this  That's news to me. I hadn't I hadn't heard that that's you Seth you want

I don't know if you remember the curry  Say it was they actually  We advertise it they took pre-order  Deposits Bosch was underwriting it they eventually  Put it  To sleep and they said yeah, we're never gonna get this working because cuz stairs I guess but  Unfortunately, I'm happy to say that they ended up giving everybody refunds for their deposits and nobody was out money  But the curry robot looked let me see if I can I can this from Mayfield robotics  This was an advertiser on Twitter looked very much like Astro  Same idea and it did even less  It had the little eyes and it would follow you around  Read you stories make sounds  This is four years ago

What does it do nothing?  What's the point of it well  Your kids are gonna grow up in a world where there are robots in the home  So you might you should get them used to it now I  Guess you could make the same argument for Astro the on key at least was a toy  Would do stuff, right?

End time: 3616.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely. Yep. I don't want to I honestly don't want to knock  Amazon for trying this because I agree with you Denise  It's kind of neat that they throw stuff up against the wall just to see what sticks and they're willing  They're kind of brave. They're willing to do that  Complete opposite of Apple which does years of testing and often doesn't release it because you know  We we didn't think anybody wanted it. I like the testing in public instead of in private

Transcript:  I think it's a good to me the biggest issue here that a thousand dollars to beta test  You know that feels a little a little expensive. I mean my initial reaction was really oh, that's kind of neat  I don't I'm not like ideologically opposed to having a little robot crawling around the house  I mean, that's I don't know. I think it's kind of fun  I texted you know story to my dad when it was announced and he was he's pushing 70 and he's super into all the smart  Homes you name it. He has it. He loves this. That's who's gonna buy this  Amazon feels and I don't mean this is disrespectfully very boomer like like a lot of this stuff feels aimed at like guys  Really very Jetsons a group on the jet and all this stuff. We want to live in the future. Yeah  Yeah, he was like he I think I think he said it was super cool  Is he gonna spend a thousand dollars for it probably not but like again is and as long as you know  As long as their privacy kind of safeguards are there but also to be he's not super concerned about that either actually  It's all just kind of neat Jetson stuff to him  And yeah, I don't know so I sort of agree  I think it's kind of fun that they're they're launching this much stuff see what sticks, you know  Maybe maybe it launches maybe it dies and no one remembers it, you know two years now. Okay, great  But uh, yeah to me that thousand dollars this seem and you know what I get I won't guarantee  But I would be very surprised if that thing doesn't sell out even at a thousand dollars because there are enough  Let's say nerds speaking as a nerd out there who would also find that neat just to have it kind of run  It doesn't even have to do anything. It's just cool that it's there and then it works. I get a lot of people

It's called the always home cam. It's  $250 it's a an autonomous indoor camera that flies around the home  Yeah  Kind of same idea as the robot  That you might not be home but you hear a sound and so you trigger the  Release the crack and you trigger the the drone  And here I'll show you a video of this one. So bad guy breaking in right all of a sudden the ring security drone  Says hey, there's somebody in your house and it tracks him and he goes  What the hell is that and it plays an alarm and he goes I'm out of here man.

Transcript:  Here's the thing I could see that it terrifies me about both the drone and the little astro robot  They both have these  Surveillance modes where they're supposed to be helping you control people out of your house patrol  Yeah  The guy running away that that response is gonna last about five minutes and then  he's just gonna knock these things down with a sledgehammer and then this is like the  Sci-fi nightmare they're gonna have to more effectively do surveillance, right? So what does that look like?

Start time: 3794.50
End time: 3807.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. It's just the beginning  That's actually a good insight because that's really what happens is it's a slippery slope  You start with a video doorbell and pretty soon you've got drones patrolling your perimeter

Start time: 3807.86
End time: 3830.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree with that  and to me that is the the kind of the real the real issue here is is you know, theoretically perhaps the  Corrosive effect in society like if we're all disarming ourselves with surveillance drones and devices where our neighbors are, you know  It's not it's not exactly love thy neighbor anymore. Everyone's a threat. Everyone needs to be. Yeah makes you pay  That is that is very  That is interesting. I don't know what

And so you press the alarm button and there goes the raccoon.

Show about being a crazy lawyer the reason this came up in my mind is because  They're the most recent season for the last episode last season. They're going after big drug companies an opioid  Company manufacturer kind of loosely based. It's called Zaks loosely based on the Sackler family and  an Oxycontin and  At one point they're in court and  They just said they go $600 million and he goes oh, okay, and they walk off and  The whole premise of this I think I don't think it's a spoiler to say that is that these pharma companies actually  Make so much money  That that they set this all they tee this up the courts don't want the trial  The lawyers just want to settle and so they tee this all up in such a way that they pay  They're off the hook and they go home and everybody's happy they continue to make billions. Does that make sense?

We'll talk more about electric vehicles the Rivian the first I  think consumer electric truck it's a  Yep, Seth liked it a little bit. We'll talk about that in a lot more  Our show today brought to you by mint mobile. I love my mint mobile. Oh, man  You really makes you wonder why these other companies are charging so much  for mobile phone service  The big wireless companies  I think I don't want to use the word ripoff but it feels like it feels like they're taking you for a little bit of  a ride with the with the cost and of course after years of fine print contracts and  Getting ripped off by big wireless providers. If you've learned anything you learned there's always a catch right? There's always hidden fees  They always get you, you know, they start low and it ends up by the time you get the billy  Wow, that's a lot of money when I heard mint mobile is offering premium wireless service for get this  $15 a month, of course, I didn't believe it. Of course. I thought now come on. Yeah, that's the starting price. What's the final price?  No, that's it  It's how much they that's how much they charge mint mobiles secret sauce is they're the first company sell wireless service online only  They don't have stores. So there's no crazy overhead cost to get passed on to you and mystery fees  They just pass along the sweet savings directly to you  It's easy to you mint mobile will send you the sim, but they don't even charge for it  Everybody else well, that'll be ten bucks for the sim. No, they'll send you the sim you put it in your existing phone  They have a little thing on the site to make sure your phone works  But basically any any phone that works with GSM services should work just fine  You put the sim in if you want you could port your number over  Everything comes with you and you're good. You suddenly you're going from 80 90 100 bucks a month to 15 bucks a month  All plans come with unlimited talk and text plus high-speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network  T-mobile their T-mobile MVNO  So if you know if you're already on T-mobile, you're really overpaying use your phone with any mint mobile plan  You keep the same phone number along with your existing contacts. They also sell phones. I got an iPhone SE from them  It was 15 bucks a month. It was a great deal a great phone  Great service and I'm paying a third of what I'm paying just for service along with one of the big carriers  And if you're not a hundred percent satisfied, don't worry mint mobile has you covered seven-day money back guarantee  Switch to mint mobile. They have unlimited plans. They have more expensive plans  I paid by the year which really helped save I just think mint mobiles  I wish more people knew about it and of course Ryan Reynolds owns it  So, you know, it's cool get your new wireless plan for 15 bucks a month and get it shipped to your door free at  mint mobile comm slash twit mint mobile  comm slash  twit I  Think you're gonna be amazed  Minimum I it makes me wonder, you know why I was ever paying more mint mobile comm slash  Twit 15 bucks a month, that's it all in  mint mobile comm slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The verge says that the defense's strategy to put this trial off as long as possible  Of course it was delayed because of kovat and very and I think she was sick and there was various issues  Has paid off because it's now seven years ago and a lot of the witnesses can quite credibly say I don't know  I don't remember that was a long time ago  Unfortunately in discovery unfortunately for the defense there are still a lot of emails and documents and some of them are are smoking guns  one lab director said that  That  They tried very hard to keep inspectors from going into certain rooms  There were emails saying make sure that door is closed so they don't go in there  It did look as if  Executives knew that they had problems with some of the machines and were attempting to not be discovered which I think would be evidence of fraud  I guess  There's also the defense that because they were the defense was able to separate the trials  Elizabeth Holmes is getting tried right now Sonny Balwani her partner will be tried late next year that because those have been separated  Each party is capable of saying the other did it and since they're separate trials. It doesn't hurt either party  They could both get acquitted by blaming the other person  I  Don't know it's a it's a fascinating story. I  Guess the real reason it's it's important is  If if a company and Silicon Valley, I think does do this  Sacrificed safety  Or even human lives to pursue a goal  That's bad, and we want to stop them, and I don't think Theranos is the only company that ever did that and  So we kind of need to we need to keep keep an eye on this kind of thing

Start time: 5796.62

He just holds it up  Completely punishes you so he went from 18 million 18 million to half a million  26 million three point seven million to three quarters of a million  They punish you if you have product placement in there and I think that that's something so this is this was his first ad  and it's good, I mean, it's delicious, I'm maybe it's cuz he's putting french fries in a I  Don't know what PETA I don't know but  He's making his hand making his own shawarma.

This is an ad supported tick-tock  He get I don't want to say the amount of money, but it's you know  It's some decent money and a percentage of sales  And it's enough to live on let's put it that way, but if tick-tock suddenly hits your views  You know by 90% because you've got product placement. Ooh  That's not so good and they're not rewarding you any other way because the ads they show are not in your video  They're not like YouTube they're in between as you know as you slide through tick-tocks  So I think they're what they're really doing  They don't they don't really want you to make money on your own and they'll give you they have a hundred million dollar creator fund  They'll give you a pittance  From the ad money that they make that's all theirs  so  But you know what?

Hey, I want to talk about a you know, you notice it's interesting  We have a lot of security products. We advertise he stays on our network. I wonder why that is  You know ransomware attack after ransomware attack businesses held hostage  You've seen the headlines  It's every you know every security now is what we're talking about and I think if you're in business you might think it's only a matter  of time before they come for you and  You're gonna have to make that the most difficult business decision ever the Sophie's choice of business  Do you pay millions of dollars to ransomware jerks or do you lose everything?  That's a terrible choice to have to make there is a third option, but you have to act now  Defeat your adversaries before the fight even starts. We have this this company has done something. I think is brilliant  It's crowd. It's the wisdom of the crowd crowd source security with crowd strike with crowd strike  You're not alone in the battle against ransomware  Because really if you want to be secure a secure future demands a shared defense  So crowd strike they call it their Falcon platform. It uses their threat graph power  By using advanced AI to analyze behavior not just on your devices and servers and cloud workloads  But on everybody else who uses crowd strike they have a trillion with a T data points a day  Seven trillion data points a week. This is the early warning system for malware  Because so many people use crowd strike and you're all we're all in it together  They know ahead of time long before the bad guys get to you. They know what's going on and they can defend you  Their security platform delivers the industry's most powerful set of tools to fight today's most sophisticated cyber attacks  And you know, it's nice even though they've got a trillion data points. It's a lightweight intelligent agent delivered to you through the cloud  It's easy on you easy on your network, but it works Falcon complete according to Forrester  Delivers a 403% return on investment. That's pretty good plus a hundred percent confidence  I had a great conversation with their CTO who's done an amazing job putting this together Michael Santona says his name  He explained this how this threat graph system is a collaborative platform.
