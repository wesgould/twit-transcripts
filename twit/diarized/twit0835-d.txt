Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech. Great panel for you. It's kind of old home week.  Sammable Samad joins us, my car guy. Doc Rock joins us from Hawaii.  And Stacy Higginbotham from this week in Google.  We are going to talk, I think a lot about Apple's new proposed child pornography protections.  Some say it's a privacy invasion. Others say, think of the children.  This is not an easy one, but we'll go deep on this.  We'll talk about Google's reveal of the Pixel 6.  It's kind of an interesting choice when they've got a new 5A coming along next week.  And Firefox lost 50 million users last year, almost 20% of its total.  Is that a bad thing? I think it is. We'll talk about that and a whole lot more coming up next.  It's going to be a fun tweet. Stay tuned.

Transcript:  Oh, good. And we've seen pictures of your wedding now in Hawaii.  So I think we're family. I think we can.  So the big story of the week, and it's actually a developing story,  Apple announced on Thursday that they are going to start  implementing an iOS 15 new child safety measures.  In fact, if you go to Apple dot com slash child dot safety,  you can read about this.  And, you know, on the face of it, when I first read it, I thought, well,  this seems like a smart way to do it.  I'll just I'll explain quickly what they're doing  so that we can then have a good conversation about why it's the worst thing ever,  because apparently privacy advocates, including the EFF,  the Center for Democracy and Technology, a lot of cryptographers  and others are very upset about this.  So there's an organization  called the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children.  It's a non-governmental nonprofit, but it is funded by the US government.  Nick, Nick, I'll call it that has a database of child pornography  or CSAM child sexual abuse material.  You'll hear those acronyms a lot in this conversation.  NECMEC and CSAM.  So the NECMEC database is a fingerprint database.  It's a hash, a cryptographic hash of a lot of awful child pornography images,  actual specific images, each of which have been fingerprinted.  And the fingerprinting they do is done in such a way that even if the image is  cropped or later turned into a black and white image or modified in some way,  the fingerprint does not change.  So that hash is specific to that image.  You should also know that it's not specific to whatever the image is of.  It is that picture.  So you could take a picture of a car, hash it.  Another picture of the same car would not have the same fingerprint.  So those fingerprints are tied directly to a specific  pornographic image, child porn image.  So this database has been around for a while.  In fact, it's my understanding companies have been using this for a while.  Facebook, Google and others have been using this as a while for a while.  Apple plans, starting with iOS 15, to put a copy of this database on your device.  And then to compare to create a fingerprint of images that you send through messages,  whether it's SMS or data only images, you upload to iCloud images, you download from iCloud.  To run that hash, you can do it locally on the iPhone and then compare the fingerprint.  Important, according to Apple's white paper,  Apple does not learn about anything about images that don't match the database.  Apple cannot access metadata or visual derivatives for matched images  until a threshold of matches is exceeded.  They do not say what that threshold is.  Is it one picture? Is it five? Is it 10? Is it 100?  They don't say, but there is some threshold.  It's not just apparently not just one picture matching.  You have to have more than one.  The risk, they say, of the system incorrectly flagging an account is extremely low.  And if there's a report going to be made, so two things can happen.  If there's a match and you match the threshold, so if there's some number of matches,  if it's on a child's phone under 13, the parents will be notified.  If it's on an adult's or somebody 13 or older's phone  after that threshold is passed,  a low-quality image will be sent to Apple, which will be reviewed by a human.  If it does, in fact, match that known CSAM image, then they will notify NECMEC.  It says users can't access or view the database of known images.  Users can't identify which images were flagged.  So Apple's trying to create a system  that respects privacy, but still does something about child pornography.  This is something every company is worried about  because apparently there's a lot of child pornography.  The internet's widely used to distribute it and store it.  So Apple doesn't want to be doing that.  In fact, they have up to now been among the big tech companies,  the slowest to report CSAM images on their servers.  This is an image that Apple distributed of how the hashes work.  Here's one thing that does concern people.  It will also match against your iCloud photos.

Start time: 611.14
End time: 628.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's important to confirm that it doesn't match pictures.  Like if I took a picture of my toddler in the bathtub,  it's not looking for that.  It's only looking for pictures that have already been identified as child porn.

Start time: 630.92
End time: 642.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's fairly important.  There have been a number of mainstream media outlets  that have actually gotten that wrong  and said that they're looking for a certain amount of nudity or things like that.  It doesn't work that way.  It is merely a cryptographic hash against known child porn images.

Start time: 646.26
End time: 672.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You mentioned that this can detect if you've cropped the image  or resized it or done various other things to it,  that it can still recognize the image.  Machine vision systems are not that reliable in general.  Do we have any information about how accurate this actually is?  They're false positive.

Start time: 672.56
End time: 674.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Start time: 676.66
End time: 682.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're not able to...  They're not looking for...  This is a child.  What they're looking for, they've got a set of pixels.

Start time: 683.38
End time: 684.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not face recognition at all.

Start time: 685.08
End time: 700.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When they're creating these hashes,  what they're doing is they're taking a set of...  Computers are actually really good at this  because they're not turning this into meaning.  They don't know what they're looking at.  They're looking at a set of pixels,  which is why if you crop it,  they can still recognize X number of those pixels  and match it back to the original.

Start time: 702.96
End time: 728.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a hash.  Is it doing the hash based initially on some subset,  some part of maybe the middle of the image  so that if you do crop it,  you're still capturing that part of it?  Because a hash,  if you take a binary file and you hash it,  if you change one bit in that file,  it changes the hash.  That's right.  This is called...  That's what I'm trying to understand.

Start time: 728.54
End time: 751.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here we go.  I'll read from Apple's white paper.  They call it a neural hash.  It is...  You're right in this.  A perceptual hashing function  that maps images to numbers.  Perceptual hashing bases this number,  this hash, this fingerprint,  on features of the image  instead of precise pixel values.  You're exactly right, Sam.  It's not...  It's doing a machine vision system

Start time: 751.46
End time: 752.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and then hashing that.

Start time: 752.84
End time: 791.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It says the system computes these hashes  by using an embedding network  to produce image descriptors  and then converting those descriptors to integers  using what they call a hyperplane  local sensitivity hashing process  so that different images produce different hashes.  They give an example here  of two different images of a palm tree  that have the same neural hash  but then a third image that has different content  and different hash.  Doc Rock, you were about to say  that the rate of false positives is very low  in the order of what, one to a billion or something?  No, it was in the trillions.

Start time: 791.58
End time: 860.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the point.  I think one thing, people get freaked out  because they think there's going to be false positives,  but also I have this conversation with my friends all the time  because I think people hear the word billion  and they hear the word trillion,  but they don't know how to put something to it.  There was a guy a long time ago that made a text file  that was literally a billion as put out  as like ones and zeros or something,  and the text file was like stupid long.  This has a billion characters in it.  Just to show somebody, you'd be scrolling that thing  for like 40 minutes to get to the bottom of the text file.  I use one that kind of mess,  if you take say the person who identifies  of the Christian faith,  if I gave you a dollar every day  since the person you look up to was born,  I'd be at 740 some odd million.  I'm still not at a billion.  So like billion is a very big number.  Trillions even bigger.  Trillion is more than that.  So the false positive things  that they've put into effect has been good,  and everyone's mad because Apple won't talk about  how they're doing it.  Well, if we tell you how we're doing it, man,  then people can figure out how to undo it.  They're pretty clear.

Start time: 861.36
End time: 958.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This white paper is pretty clear.  But,  Yeah, they left some stuff out.  So we should flatten this notion that  A, you might be fingered incorrectly,  that that's a very, very, very, very low probability.  That's not the problem with this.  But people do have, not just people,  some pretty serious people have an issue with it.  This is a letter that is circulating now.  It has last count 1800 signatures  from well-known cryptographers,  privacy and security experts.  It's at appleprivacyletter.com,  an open letter against Apple's privacy  invasive content scanning technology.  I'll point out my initial reaction  to what Apple's doing after reading all of the material  that was.  This seems like they're really,  they want to do something about child pornography,  and they're trying to do it responsibly.  But I have to confess, I've been convinced otherwise.  First by this letter,  and then by a caller to the radio show,  but I'll explain that in a second.  This letter says,  while child exploitation is a serious problem,  and while efforts to combat it  are almost unquestionably well-intentioned,  and then this part's in bold,  Apple's proposal introduces a back door  that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protection  for all users of Apple products.  And the reasoning the EFF gives, the CDT gives,  and somebody I really respect,  Dr. Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins gives,  is that it is a slippery slope.  And at first I thought, is it a slippery slope?

Start time: 959.23
End time: 961.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate slippery slope arguments.  Well, that's the thing.

Start time: 961.36
End time: 1135.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a problem with the way they're doing it right now?  No.  But, and at first I thought slippery,  I had the same reaction.  Ugh, a slippery slope, everything's a slippery slope.  Everything can get worse.  But you don't act today on what's going on today  on the potential that it could get worse,  because everything's a slippery slope if you do that.  Everything can get worse.  Matthew Green said,  yesterday we were gradually headed toward a future  where less and less of our information  had to be under the control and review of any kind  of control and review of anyone but ourselves.  For the first time since the 90s,  we were taking our privacy back.  Today we're on a different path.  And this is the slippery slope people are talking about.  The pressure is going to come from the UK,  from the US, from India, from China.  I'm terrified about what it's going to look like.  Why would Apple want to tell the world,  hey, we've got this tool?  Now let me, I want to get your opinions, all of you.  I'm just going to say one more thing and I'll stop talking.  A guy called Joe, hello, hello.  A guy named Joe who is in Brooklyn.  That's okay, Stacey, we know your dog.  That means some delivery, some wonderful delivery is coming.  Right?  She's going to run off to silence the animal.  Joe, who's a regular in our chat room and our Discord server  as a Club Twit member from Brooklyn, very reasonable,  said, okay, here's why this is potentially a problem.  Now that Apple has said we could do this,  the issue is governments coming to them saying,  well, okay, I got a new database  and I want you to do the same thing for that database.  And the problem is when you're operating in a country  like China or Saudi Arabia or Russia, they can do that.  And so the premise is, well, what if the Saudi Arabia  where it's illegal to be gay said,  I have a database of images of gay people.  I want you to also check against that.  Or there's actually a database, a terrorist database  with so-called terrorist images.  The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism  has created a similar fingerprint database,  but no one knows what's in that database  because there's no external oversight.  What's to keep, this is what the EFF is talking about,  what's to keep the US government or China or Russia  or any other government saying,  Apple, if you want to do business in our country,  in addition to that NECMEC database,  we've got a database of terrorist images we want you to flag.  Can Apple at that point say,  well, okay, we'll do it for channel pornography,  but not going to do it for you,  in which case the country can say,  well, then you're not going to do business in our country?  In fact, I would submit Apple's already opened this door  by saying we can do it. It's too late.  What are your thoughts, Stacey?

Start time: 1136.82
End time: 1315.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay. So first, this database has existed for a while  and is used for Facebook.  So it's not that the Fed are unaware that this is possible.  So that's one. I don't think Apple has opened any door  that hasn't already been there.  Two, this is such a tough issue because we're basically putting  the potential human rights violations of governments  against the rights of children.  Or rather solving a documented and real problem  with child pornography.  And this gets to the heart of what I always talk about  and think about as we're building out the tools  for what will essentially become a potential surveillance society.  Right?  And we have to grapple with these issues,  not just by saying I'm going to ban this tool  or I'm going to fundamentally break this tool  by adding encryption or maybe I'm banning the tool  by saying we can't have cell phone photos.  I mean, that horse is out of the barn.  So now what we have to do is we have to figure out,  and this is hard, does a company have a moral obligation  to people in other countries or do they have a moral obligation  to their shareholders to make as much money as possible?  And we can't say that Saudi Arabia is not going to ask Apple  to do this, for example.  What we can say is Apple maybe don't give in to them.  And the issue here isn't, I know this is a fraught issue  and I understand that this is very, this is fundamentally,  it has the potential to be a huge problem.  And I am, like, I was like slippery slope.  I see the slippery slope.  I've seen it before.  But we deal with this in regulations all the time.  That's the point of making regulations is saying this is the line  we're going to go to today and this is where it's going to stop.  And as you see, we move back and forth over this line over time  as MLK would say the moral arc of the universe shifts.  So the question then becomes, what do we expect from Apple?  What do we expect our government to do?  What kind of rules can we put in place?  It's not to say shove this horse back into the barn  because it's already out.  We have this capability.  Everyone knows we have this capability.  We're going to have more cameras and more places,  which means other people who have less money  privacy-focused values as Apple are going to be able to offer this as well.  So let's have this conversation and let's see where we can draw these lines.  Let's understand where other governments are going to draw those lines.  And then let's work from there.  That's it.  The issue Joe brought up, and I think it was appropriate,  was when Apple operates in another country,

Start time: 1315.76
End time: 1345.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it doesn't matter what we say, it doesn't matter what the government says.  When Apple operates in another country, it doesn't matter what we say,  it's what China says.  So when China said to Apple, no more VPNs in the App Store,  Apple didn't have a choice of complying.  They only had a choice of leaving China.  And Apple's not going to leave China.  It's too big for their business.  So what we could say is, well, yeah, Apple should only do business in the United States.  Is that the choice?

Start time: 1347.36
End time: 1348.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the choice we have to make.

Start time: 1350.36
End time: 1359.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think Apple's going to do that.  Google left China, but to be fair, Google didn't have a lot of business in China.  Apple does.

Start time: 1360.36
End time: 1399.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if everyone from a Western country, if China or Saudi Arabia says,  let's just go gay people in Saudi Arabia, or the Uyghurs in China,  I mean, it's documented what China's doing there.  But there are plenty of companies that are complicit in that,  that work with the US.  If someone wants to make that their goal,  they could come up to Apple and say, look, you are killing gay people,  this is theoretical, killing gay people in Saudi Arabia.  Don't listen to their government if everybody in the EU and everybody in the US  decided to boycott them.  I mean, part of this is like...

Start time: 1400.36
End time: 1418.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we don't do that.  Apple is doing that in China,  and no one's saying get out of China, Apple, because it's not okay with us.  Right.  So this is the problem.  All right, Doc Rock, your turn.  Where do you come down on this?  I'm sure you have an opinion.

Start time: 1419.44
End time: 1578.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course I do.  I think that solving this issue is bigger than the fear of a bunch of people in the room  freaking out over what might happen later, and here's why.  I know that sounds kind of glib, but here's why.  There are people that you know right now that if the emergency came up,  you had to go somewhere, you could take your child to and hand it to them  and trust them to care for that kid for a week.  Why?  Because the reputation of the relationship you've built with them  and the way that they behave, the way they hold their self,  their core values, if you will.  From now, backwards, there has been no other company  whose core value has been more about your privacy than any other large tech companies.  And yes, they're not perfect. Nobody is.  But they've been the best in the business.  Right.  So they're going to take your stuff and do something with it for you,  you know, Joe Schmoe on a personal level?  No, not going to happen. Right.  If you look at the lovely charts from Jason that you love so much,  like Apple could probably walk away from Saudi Arabia and not care  because they cover it sooner or later. Right.  China's a little bit harder, but they also have a better pushback to China, too.  Everyone thinks, well, they won't walk away from China because the amount of business they do in China.  Well, guess what?  One of the things that they have in their strength is the same amount of business that they do in China.  Apple pulling out of China pulls out billions of dollars from China.  So China's not going to pull that flex any faster than Apple would pull that flex.  Everyone loves to throw that one around.  That one makes about as much sense as screen doors in the submarine.  I've been to Foxconn. I've literally walked around the campus of Foxconn.  I've been in the building where they're freezing iPads to see if they can handle it.  So, yeah, no, that city, Foxconn City itself, where everyone is,  there's over a half a million people working on all myriad tech, not just Apple stuff.  But trust me, there's no one's walking away from anything.  That's like, you know, when Alan Iverson was one of the biggest jerks in the planet,  but the Sixers could not get rid of him. Who was going to be the guard? Right.  Some you have a brother-in-law right now. You can't really stand, but that's who your sister picked.  Never mind. I got to get off that subject. Leo's going to get me in trouble.  Sounds like there's something you want to share with us there, Doug.  But you just know what I'm saying.  Everyone loves to throw that slippery stuff around. There is a balance.  I get it. I agree. But there's a balance. Come on.

Start time: 1579.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Apple, China may not say to Apple, look, you got to do this.  If Apple really says, yeah, and if we have to, we're pulling out.  Of course, China let Google pull out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think too, because I've been to China many times as well.  People get VPNs before Apple had it in the stores.  Like Golden Frog was my life when I went there.  And so it's not that big a deal.  Like China likes to throw that around because it looks good for the newspapers,  but they can't stop all the people trying to listen to what they want to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree with most of what both Stacey and Doc had to say.  I totally agree that we absolutely need to do, I think, within reason,  whatever we can to address the problem of child abuse.  But I also, I'm troubled by this because, for a number of reasons,  the things you said about any individual government,  once you have this technology in there,  can pressure, force a company to do things with it that was not intended for it.  And I think that there's also,  I think there's, because of the work that I do around automated driving as well,  I see a lot of the problems with perception systems.  And I brought that up originally.  I think that this approach is also problematic.  And while it may not lead to that many false positives right now with the way it's being used now,  I can definitely see where there is the potential for a lot of errors in this.  Because I see this every day with the system,  with perception systems that are being used in the technologies that I cover as an auto industry analyst.  So I'm troubled by the use of a technology that is known and understood by everybody that uses it to be problematic at best.  It's not as reliable as you would want it to be.  And the potential for misuse of it, and not just in China or Saudi Arabia or Uganda,  but even here in the United States, I mean, we have seen in recent years,  government officials that have wanted to use and abuse technology and try to force technology companies to do things.  And while they, to our knowledge at least, haven't really been successful in forcing that issue yet,  I see a huge risk of, if we put this technology out there,  that future administrations will use it even here in the United States in ways that we as a citizenry don't want,  that it would be undesirable for protecting the rights of everyone in the population.

Transcript:  You have to think that Apple has made this calculus.  I would hope they strategically have gone down the road that we've just gone down.  I mean, if they haven't, then they're not doing their job and have made some sort of peace with themselves about what they would do.  Should China ask them to do something like this or should Saudi Arabia?  Do you think Apple has said to themselves, okay, well, we'll say no?

Transcript:  They must not understand that they've now made a step that's going to, they're going to get some pressure.  The New York Times points out that US law requires tech companies to flag cases of child sexual abuse to the authorities.  Apple has historically flagged fewer cases than other companies.  Last year, for instance, Apple reported 265 cases to NECMEC, while Facebook reported 20.3 million,  according to the Center Statistics.  That enormous gap is due in part to Apple's decision not to scan for such material, citing the privacy of its users, Facebook has.  I have to think that maybe we don't see, there's more that we don't see that perhaps Apple has already been under significant pressure from the US government to do this  because, well, 265 cases compared to 20.3 million is a pretty big discrepancy.  I don't think all the child pornography is on Facebook and none of it's on Apple. I'm sure that it's comparable. Go ahead, Stacey.

Transcript:  I'm sure there's actually probably more because it is historically private.  I would say I would love for this to open up a broader discussion about what rights people have on their phones.  This has been such a gray area for the last, how long have we been doing the internet?  Let's say 30 or 40 years where we still haven't figured out the right rules for setting privacy.  I don't spend a lot of time on child porn. It's obviously super upsetting for me.

Transcript:  It's a real problem.  I would love for this to be a total straw man argument, but it's a straw man with actual real legs.  We have to pay attention to it. We can't just be like, how many is it really or ignore it like that.  If we had rules that say, hey, they should follow our Constitution and what we...  I know this is only in the US. I'm not talking about the rest of the world.  We have treaties that talk about that.  We should build our laws first and then talk to adjust our treaties to meet those.  But we have laws for search and seizure.  We just haven't proactively talked about what that should look like as a society.  We are relying on court cases and we shouldn't be doing that anymore.  We can't afford to be doing it given the technology we're deploying.  That's my biggest argument here.  If this gets us to actually talk about that, great.

Transcript:  I'm with Stacey. I want to see it come out.  And then, you know, I know it's one of those things that's hard to say, like we'll handle that bridge when we come to it.  But imagine a good that could happen between now and say two years from now when something that becomes a hassle comes up.  If we could take out, let's just use that Facebook number.  Right. And so we take the Apple number and we match the Facebook number.  Look at how much great we've done.  Then if something happens three years from now where we got to argue with some government or whatever.  So what if they're doing twenty three million a year and then we get to add or I think that's what you said.  We add another twenty three million a year to that. Right.  So now we're at forty six million a year that we're just squashing.  And then we double that. I'm sorry.  Triple that because, hey, we're going to do this three years before we run into the first issue.  I'll take that. Like it's just one of those things.  It's like, you know, Russian roulette sooner or later, you're going to be wrong.  But let's not not play it because we might be wrong way down the lane.  The other thing I think we glazed over really quick and double check my math on this.  If you disable the iCloud in theory is not supposed to work. Right.  That's what it said in the paper.

Transcript:  Just the part of the iCloud storage, the transiting using messages.  I know I thought that was odd and I maybe I have to become more clear on that.  Their Apple's feature, which scans photos and text messages, will be available only to families with joint iCloud accounts.  If parents turn it on, their child's iPhone will analyze every photo received or sent a text message to determine if it includes nudity.  Now, this is I don't know if the Times got this wrong or if this is this is not what I read nude photos sent to a child will be blurred and the child will have to choose whether to view it.  That's a whole different thing.  I don't know if the Times got that wrong.  Did the Times get that wrong?  That's puzzling to me.

Talk these things out.  Try to come up with some things.  And then we spend years trying to unprogram the one story that, you know, grandma read or granddad read on the paper and and the Washington Post.  Hey, that's the paper.  Right.

Transcript:  But I have to say, John Gruber, who did a very I think a very good job of breaking it all down, concludes,  Will Apple actually flatly refuse any and all such demands?  If they do, it's all good.  If they don't, and these features creep into surveillance for things like political dissent, copyright infringement, LGBT imagery or adult pornography,  anything at all beyond the irrefutable CSAM, it'll prove disastrous to Apple's reputation for privacy protection.  The stakes are incredibly high and Apple knows it.  Whatever you think of Apple's decision to implement these features, they're not doing so lightly.  I have to think Apple does not want to do this, that this is not something Apple ever wanted to do.  But Apple was under intense pressure to do so from somebody and finally decided,  All right, we're going to do this now because we think we can do it in a way that protects privacy and we will worry about what happens down the road,  down the road, that they compromised, in other words.  But they must see the potential.

That the five eyes were scanning kind of impersonally in an automated fashion all phone conversations looking for words like bomb and C7 and various terrorist phrases.  And they were collecting those phone calls in a database and were then later acting in some way on those.  That happened.  Yeah, that technology existed, I believe.  The US always denied it, but Great Britain, I think, finally said, yeah, well, we've been doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To me, this boils down into an interesting question, which has come up many times before.  This is a whole new category we have, the smartphone, where we are storing our lives for the first time in a single electronic device that is internet connected and is effectively controlled by the companies that make them.  Let's not deny that Apple and Google have control over these devices in a way that perhaps if you thought about it, you really wouldn't want your secret store of all your private stuff in their hands, but you do.  But that's because case law has never dealt with that before.  This is a new, this is kind of unknown territory for all of us, including the courts and the legal system and these companies.  We are storing everything in this phone.  And I think many privacy advocates, maybe I'll include myself, have said there needs to be a much higher standard of protection for these devices because we put so much in here, because we're storing so much in here.  Can I add a nuance to your argument here?

Start time: 2497.36
End time: 2533.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  Because it's important.  Because it's important.  Not only are we putting everything in our phone, a lot of us are uploading it to the cloud where it will stay literally forever.  Combine that with the fact that we have enough cheap computing that you can analyze this data in ways that have never been analyzed and tie it together in ways that implicate or...  So it's not just that we're putting more of our lives on our phone.  It's that it stays there for the entirety of our life and it's really easy to mine that in a way that it has never been before.  That's all.  Yes.

Transcript:  And to your point, the other thing, I run through this and try to explain to my family members about why they need complicated passwords.  And I show them, you know, sort of entropy screens.  And I literally recently had this conversation with my 11 year old niece.  And once I explained it to her, she actually understood it probably better than the people who needed the most.  But explaining to her how I could just go to Amazon and rent a couple of computers to just go through all of the passwords on your computer and probably get that done before we have dinner.  It's different from what everyone thinks.  There's a guy in the basement sitting there just trying all these passwords one at a time until they get it.  And I'm like, no, man, I can scan everything with a couple of computers from Amazon cost me about five or six bucks to rent that for a little bit and just run through everything in your computer and know everything.  So you're right to that point.  And it's only getting better.  But then it also makes me remember to what Sam was talking about earlier.  We are at the infancy of sort of neurocomputer as it is and computing, sorry, and it's getting better.  So the stuff that we're at with the false positive noun and where we are with perceptual imagery now, all of that stuff is going to be in the Moore's law curve on the way up for the next five or six years as well.  So we are sort of real time battling both ends, if that makes any sense.

Start time: 2620.37

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My I think the issue is that law enforcement and people who are sworn to protect us really want to genuine and I'll I'll say this genuinely want to stop child pornography, but also protect us against all sorts of harms.  Look at this smart device as a treasure trove to do that.  Like we've never had anything like this before.  And we desperately want to use it because we have, by the way, we have lots of laws and, you know, child pornographers get arrested all the time and go to jail, as they should.  Using existing techniques and technologies and laws.  There is this kind of, I think, false, you use the word straw man, this is false straw man, this one does not have legs.  These modern technologies allow criminals to really act out because they can now hide what they're doing.  I don't know if that's actually the case.  In fact, I think there's a good case to be made that modern technologies have given police more access.  I think they have a going dark problem.  Really.

Transcript:  One thing to think about, and I'll just make this real personal for everyone who has children.  Not not.  But think about baby monitors.  And I do this a lot in this like my whole thing is the smart home.  So we have put sensors around our house.  And as my daughter grew up, I had to really think about the type of sensors and when was the right time to take like a camera out of her room.  And I think the government, if you think about it, I mean, yes, and I'm paternalistic in the sense that I have a child that I'm responsible for.  The government is somewhat paternalistic in the sense that they're trying to look out for the good of their citizenry.  So we have all these tools and it's really interesting the debate over when and how we choose to deploy it.  Some parents will deploy like keystroke loggers on their kids phone or monitor every single site.  They I mean, the levels are different for everyone.  But if you think about the way you treat your child's how you safeguard your child with increasing ability thanks to technology, this is the same thing that government's trying to do, which is why I think we need to have these like discussions about where we want to draw the lines.

Start time: 2760.52
End time: 2831.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that it's also not unreasonable.  I know we don't like this slippery slope argument.  But historically, the fact that, you know, we've seen a slippery slope happen, that this that these phones exist with all sorts of information.  Law enforcement is given more and more tools, more and more power to investigate.  And somebody there's a good thread.  Alex Stamos has a good thread on Twitter about this and somebody named David responding to him said you could catch and prevent all sorts of crime if you installed a machine learning solution and everyone's devices to monitor their activity for signs of trouble and relay them to law enforcement.  But we consider such ideas unconscionable.  And that's the problem is law enforcement always is going to for now.  Law enforcement is always going to want more access.  This is a this phone is a treasure chest for them.  So they're always going to be pushing for more.  And I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say, let's not give in too easily.  But it's even with this very justifiable reason for this.

Start time: 2831.36
End time: 2912.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's it. It's not just a phone.  It's happening everywhere.  Yeah.  You know what?  I thought I would say real quick.  I'll make this super fast.  I think we also give a little bit too much credit to government and law enforcement for what their capabilities are.  They have the hardest time making the decision on what time to have lunch.  Let's just get that square.  If you ever want to see what pure law enforcement bungling was, go on Netflix right now and watch the story of Willie and Sal from Miami.  OK. And the reason why I bring that specifically growing up as a kid in that exact time frame, all we ever heard was the fear.  And like there was all these cop shows about the narcos taking out these drug dealers and the war on drugs.  That was just it was just very, very talked about at our my age bracket.  Those guys went basically undetected for like twenty five years.  They were the largest importers of illicit drugs in the nation and nobody even knew who they were.  So it's funny, but I think we might be given our law enforcement a little bit too much credit and the stuff that they would be able to do to become Gestapo like, as everyone likes to say, we're at a different time and place.  I don't think they have as much power as people think they do.

And that's the problem with using this as the reasoning for this is if you say, no, no, no, we want to protect privacy.  People assume that you're saying screw the children.  That's not what not what anybody is saying.  It's just a very difficult problem because and I can it's it is a slippery slope.  It is the beginning of some sort of surveillance on a device that contains the most private information in your life.  And and do we want to where do we where do we draw the line?  I guess is the question. Go ahead, Sam.

Transcript:  Yeah, Doc's right. You know that I agree that we probably do give law enforcement and government more credit for their capabilities than than is probably deserved.  But on the flip side of that, you know, there that doesn't mean that there is no one within government or said earlier that there won't be someone within government that will have the capability or the desire to use it and misuse it.  And having that technology available to them, I think, you know, does set a very dangerous precedent in terms of the kind of society we want to live in.  You know, I think life inherently has some risk associated with it.  Not and I'm not saying that, you know, that we want to put our kids at risk.  Absolutely not. But, you know, I don't think we can I don't think we can ever, you know, get to a completely utopian society where nobody does anything wrong.  But I think, you know, letting letting our leaders, you know, whether, you know, whether they're in government or law enforcement, get the tools to to try to achieve that, I think will inherently invite the potential for abuse of that, you know, whether it's at, you know, on a large scale or on a small scale.  I don't think that that's the kind of abuse that we want to try to that we want to allow that we want to enable with with those in power.

I suspect this is going to be a conversation that will appear on every show on the network this week.  In fact, it's all we're going to read about for some time to come.  I wonder if Apple will respond to this pressure or just go full speed ahead, which is typically what Apple does.  They just kind of ignore. I have to say, neck mix response, which is telling Apple ignore the shrieking protests and go full speed ahead was a little tone deaf.  You know, this is a cover. I think you're exactly right, Stacey.  This is something we have to talk about. We have to figure out. We have to think about deeply.  I'm sure Apple has, but they need to talk to us a little bit more about their thinking.  And I would like to hear assurances that we're going to draw the line.  This is not going to this. This isn't the beginning of incremental loss of privacy across the board.

Transcript:  While I tell you about Kevin Rose's new podcast, Kevin came to us and said, you got to tell them about modern finance.  I said, Kevin, I know about modern finance. I'm a huge fan.  In fact, you'll remember this Stacey, when we started talking about NFTs, which was all the rage a few months ago.  I was confused. But the very first episode of MoFi, as we fans of the podcast call it, was all about NFTs.  And it made it very clear to me. The investment world, the world of modern finance has changed dramatically.  Not just NFTs. There's bitcoins. There's robo investors. How do you know how it works? What's right for you?  What it even means? Kevin Rose is the guy to explain it.  Modern finance helps to demystify crypto, decentralized finance, and more.  Of course, you know Kevin Rose from his years on the screensavers, on tech TV, and he's been on all of our shows many times.  We love having Kevin on whenever he can. He's a venture capitalist.  In fact, according to Bloomberg, one of the top 25 angel investors in the world, he currently at True Ventures.  He was at Google Ventures for a while. He has his own startups, a number of them, all of which were founded by him.  A number of them, all of which were very successful. Time Magazine called him one of the top 25 most influential people on the web.  I consider him a true friend, but also I think he's very, very good at interviewing people, at explaining things.  This is a show, if you're interested in crypto, this is the show for novice and expert alike.  Modern finance, they do two, something interesting too, two shows on the one feed.  They do a weekly consensus episode that's exploring weekly news, explains what it all means, breaks it down for you.  The other is an interview episode with individual crypto founders, NFT artists, and others.  So between the two, you're going to get a very good understanding of what's going on in modern finance.  Modern finance will equip you to discuss and understand the crypto landscape and, maybe even more importantly,  know whether or not to invest and how you should invest and what the risks are.  Feel informed about what you're getting into. Don't miss out on the next big thing.  Join Kevin Rose on Modern Finance every week. You don't want to miss a beat, the Modern Finance podcast.  MoFi.net is the website. I call it MoFi, but it's probably best to search for Modern Finance on your favorite podcast application.  Make sense of all the coins and the chaos. The financial landscape is harder than ever to navigate, but you don't have to do it alone.  Download and subscribe to Modern Finance wherever you listen to podcasts. That's Modern Finance on every podcast player known to me.  Don't be the last person on the next train out. Listen to Modern Finance and get ahead of the future of finance.  I'm really proud of Kevin. In fact, I strongly suggest not only subscribing to get the new episodes,  but going back and listening to some of the earlier episodes. That first episode on NFTs, as I said, absolutely clarified this in my mind.  He's very good at explaining this stuff. Modern Finance. MoFi. I love it. What do you think, Stacey?

It has that same feeling, but not as noisy.  And it's super funny that I have this on my desk because my project is to take the sucker part and lube it,  which will make it quiet.  Wait a minute, you shouldn't lube your keys. That sounds like a bad idea.  No, it's a lot of work. You got to take them apart.  What are you lubricating it with?  What's the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I recognize you, but I don't like it. I know who you are, but I don't like you.  How about the Pixel 6? This is an interesting story because I compare it.  I want one. Yeah, well first of all, it makes me want one.  But I compare it to what Apple does, which is zip nothing.  We know pretty much there'll be an iPhone 13. It'll be next month.  And you know, we'll know basically be thinner, faster, lighter, the best phone we've ever made.  We know all that stuff. But Apple is, you know, they literally,  there was a guy in China who was sharing pictures of the prototypes that Apple sends to case manufacturers.  Apple sent him a cease and desist and said, we're going to turn you into the Chinese government.  You got to tell us where you got those. I mean, they're dead serious. You don't mess with them.  So Google, which has a leak problem as well, has apparently taken the opposite point of view.  If you're going to leak it, we better leak it first.  So Google invited a number of journalists.  I always call them tame journalists, people they know are going to be positive about it,  in to sit down with Rick Osterloh, their hardware chief, and get a demo.  They weren't allowed to record it. They weren't allowed to, you know, do anything.  They basically had to sit and listen to Rick, who's great. I like Rick.  But it ended up being a basically a puff piece for the Pixel 6.  But they showed it. We now know what it looks like.  In fact, there's even a page on the Google store of the Pixel 6, even though it won't be out till October.  Is this a good strategy? Who's got the better strategy, Stacey, Apple or Google?

Transcript:  You put a conversation space in there. I'm not a conversation space.  You put a placeholder in someone's brain because, yes, I had the benefit of being September 12.  So every year from a birthday, there's a new iPhone announced.  The day before, like normally the day before or the day of.  Somewhere, you know, it starts at about the 10th, right?  So depending on the calendar, I'm normally within a couple of days.  And then that's exactly what I get for myself every year. It's always two weeks later, whatever.  But what they've done here for someone who's not in a tech space, is not going to buy two phones.  They basically put a conversation holder.  And it's like, I was really, really thinking about getting this car.  But now I know this other car is coming.  Or I was thinking about getting this phone. Now I know this other phone is coming.

And they're still selling the iPhone 12 like hotcakes.  Google probably decided we can't get much worse than the sales of the Pixel 5.  They've got nothing to lose.

Transcript:  They did announce a new chip. They were very cagey.  They didn't really say what I think is the case, which is that Samsung is making this chip.  It will be based on Exynos.  But they're going to call it the Google Tensor, because there will be machine learning capability.  Of course, TPUs, the Google Tensor units, are machine learning units that Google offers on the cloud, hence the naming.

End time: 4068.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  US phones always have Qualcomm because Qualcomm has the patents on LTE and stuff.  They need to use that in the US.  CDMA.  And then in the rest of the world, they usually put Exynos in their own processor.  But yeah, they continue to buy Qualcomm.

Start time: 4068.90

Start time: 4129.67
End time: 4142.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, I like that.  Because then I always have my finger on the lens.  I don't know why.  Something about the way the phone naturally is held is my finger is right there.  So having a bump might help with that.

End time: 4200.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When they did the 6P, we had images that leaked out months before, as you would expect.  And in those images, it looked like that bump actually stuck out a lot further than it actually did in reality.  In this case here, I think it is still pretty prominent.  But it had a bar that went across the entire...  It was at the top of the phone, not part way down.  But it still effectively had a bar all the way.  And it was fine.  I had no issues with it.  That was the first...  A bar is better than a bump.  I agree.  Before that, I had other brands.

Start time: 4201.45

Transcript:  For what it's worth, the TPUs have been used in data centers for a long time.  And actually Google is not the only one that uses TPUs.  NVIDIA builds TPUs into a lot of their SoCs as well.  So they're very highly regarded for doing the matrix math processing that's required for processing neural networks.  That's interesting.

Transcript:  So one of the groups that got to go in with Rick Oosterloh, Sam Rutherford from Gizmodo,  and he did get a demo of the tensor chip that I thought, okay, that's a good selling point.  Rick played a video of somebody giving a presentation in French.  Now, in the past, Google still has live captioning, right?  So you could watch that video and it would live caption it, but it would live caption it in French.  Now, you can not only run live caption, but you can also put it in interpreter mode,  and the thing can translate in real time while it's putting a caption up on a video.  And apparently, it did quite well, and that's kind of amazing.  That's a reason to get that, I think.  There's also a new voice dictation feature in the Google keyboard, Gboard, that lets you speak  instead of type while texting.  Well, we've always had that, but the Pixel 6 can correct mistakes in real time.  I think that's always been there, but maybe that's something they showed off.  I guess maybe something they're going to do better.  Anyway, so you think this was a good strategy on Google's part because it's got you to pause.  Instead of buying, here's the thing, Google is going to sell a 5A all of a sudden.  They've announced it.  August 26th is the rumor, $450.  So maybe there is a phone for them to kill.

Although Tim Cook did warn in the analyst call last week that the chip shortages for the legacy nodes, the non-Apple custom chips, might in fact cause a short supply for some of these new iPhones when they come out.  So that might happen.  Sam, are the chip shortage easing up?  I know you cover this.  No, not yet.  No, because it's automotive as well.  It's hitting a lot of industries.  Yeah.

And as with Apple, you know, it's oftentimes it's those legacy components, you know, in an ECU, you'll have a microcontroller in there and you might have three, four or five other chips on that board, you know, that are often older style components that could be anywhere from 28 to 90 nanometers.  You know, so they're old parts that are still being used.  And that's often what is missing from a lot of these vehicles.

Transcript:  My purple guy, my cam guy.  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  There are hiring guys, according to Forbes, gyms, nail salons, mom and pop stores and more set to go on epic hiring sprees in the coming months because there's pent up demand for all these services.  I know I walked down the street in Petaluma.  Every single restaurant has a sign in the window saying help wanted.  Help wanted.  I'm excited about getting to go back to the movies or go back to the gym or maybe go out to eat.  Well, there are millions of jobs that will have to be filled first.  So where do these businesses turn to fill these roles fast?  I got to tell you, putting the sign in the window, probably not the best method.  What about Zip Recruiter?  Right now you could try Zip Recruiter free at ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  One post on Zip Recruiter casts the widest possible net.  Post your job listing on 100 plus job sites, job boards.  So you're going to get out to the largest number of people.  And by the way, including social networks, the most people see.  But don't worry, you're not going to flooded with applications coming into your inbox or or into your phone calling you at home.  They all go to the Zip Recruiter interface, which is great because that means Zip Recruiter do some do some very cool things.  First of all, Zip Recruiter's matching technology will scan resumes across this network of millions of job seekers.  And if there's a match, if that candidate fits your open role, they'll actually proactively invite them to apply for your job.  That's pretty cool.  And the interface means not only do you not get the phone calls or the emails, it's very easy to review all the applicants.  They pre format the resumes.  I know this from firsthand experience.  We use the recruiter all the time.  They pre format the resumes, makes it easy to read.  You probably have some absolute musts.  You can pre screen candidates with yes, no questions, multiple choice, even essay questions.  So you can eliminate people who just don't fit your needs.  Exactly.  You can easily review recommended candidates from Zip Recruiter, invite your top choices to apply for your job.  That encourages them to apply faster.  According to Zip Recruiter's internal data, jobs where employers invite candidates to apply get two and a half times more candidates.  And that's good for you.  The more choices you have, the better you'll be able to pick the exact right person.  Zip Recruiter's technology is so effective that four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day.  I have to say for us, we've done this several times now.  I can remember Lisa posting at breakfast and within an hour or two we get, I love it because she goes, oh, this person's great.  Oh, this person's great.  We get great candidates within the first few hours before lunch.  Before lunch.  Right now you could try Zip Recruiter for free.

Make hiring a pleasure, not a pain.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  ZipRecruiter is, and I can vouch for it, the smartest way to hire.  Let's see.  Well, I got some more Google stories as long as we're in the Google verse.  All the things you miss, Stacey, on This Week in Google.  Actually, I take it back.  We never talk about Google on This Week in Google.  I was like, what are you talking about, man?  We never talk about that.  Did you get your $2.15 check?  I do not.  The Google Plus class action.  So remember there was a privacy breach.  Google exposed the private data, 52 million users in 2018.  They got sued.  It was a class action suit.  Actually, you were on the show at the time.  I remember we talked about this.  There was this first small breach of like 100,000.  And then all of a sudden there was this huge breach of millions.  And since nobody's been working on Google Plus anyway, Google's fix for it was just to shut the whole thing down.  Okay, that's fine.  That's it.  It's over.  The class action suit, Matt Maddock and Zach Harris versus Google filed October 2018.  Blamed Google's lax approach to data security.  The case settled in June of last year.  Google agreed to pay out $7.5 million.  Now it's time for math.  Here's your math problem.  Take out half that money, three and a quarter, for legal fees.  The lawyers are the ones that get rich on these.  1.7 million people filled out the right forms by October 2020.  So you divide the three and a quarter million by 1.7 million and you get a whopping $2.50 per person.  Congratulations.  You're a winner.  You're a winner.

Transcript:  I know we make fun of this, but you do have to have some incentive to get people to file class action suits, right?  Because otherwise, why the heck would you do it?  And they can be a deterrent to the type of things like arbitration or lackluster approaches towards privacy.  All of these things like this will help deter it.  I don't love them.  I'm just like, we always mock it.

They're converting plants that have been building gasoline cars for decades to building  EVs and building battery plants, which is the other piece of this, because if you're  going to build EVs, you got to have batteries.  And so they're investing billions of dollars in new plants to build giant lithium ion  batteries. So they're they're they're product planning is all on assuming that they're  you know, they're targeting getting to that 50 percent or more threshold by 2030.  But, you know, that's to do that, to make that a realistic proposition.  You know, they they need some help like on charging infrastructure, for example.  We need a lot more chargers if we're going to have that many EVs on the road and some  extra purchase incentives for consumers to make it more affordable, because they are  still the price gap is closing, but EVs are still more more more costly to purchase than  gasoline vehicles at this point.

Transcript:  Yeah, Toyota and some of the other automakers selling plug-in hybrids.  Yeah.  But Toyota in particular, you know, because they sell so many hybrids, such a big percentage  of their sales now are hybrids, especially some of the most popular cars like the Toyota  RAV4.  A quarter of those in the US now are hybrids.  And in Europe, over half of RAV4 sales are hybrids now.  It outsells the Prius.  The Prius is on its way out.  You know, nobody's buying Priuses anymore.  People are buying RAV4 hybrids instead.  Interesting.

Start time: 5753.64
End time: 5778.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because RAV4 has a little bit more style, a little bit more functionality, a little bit  more normal.  Yeah, more room.  And here's the crazy thing, like having the i3 and then having an electric 5 Series, I  prefer the i3 better, even though the 5 is way more comfortable, doper ride like the  whole nine yards.  It's just the idea of like, I might actually have to go to the gas station at some point.  And that drives me crazy because I would rather never go.

Transcript:  Well, and I'm sure especially for you, you know, living in Honolulu, you know, the traffic  is really bad.  The i3, you know, it's got a nice small physical footprint.  It doesn't take up much space on the road.  It's going to be easier to park, easier to maneuver around in traffic.  It was epic.  Yeah, it's a cool little car.  It's kind of weird looking.  It was funky to drive.

Transcript:  It is weird looking.  Lisa was in the market for an electric vehicle because Michael finally got his driver's  license and is taking the bolt.  And she looked at the i3, she said, I'm not going to buy that.  It's too funny. So what did she buy?  She bought a Mini Cooper, which is basically an i3 with switches.  Well, it's cuter.

You know what the funny thing about it is, as funny looking and as ugly as that car was,  I get more when I was driving that thing around.  I got more compliments out of that car.  Really?  I get out of a gorgeous electric five series.  Why? Number one, the circus bear mentality.  Six foot, two fifty dude climbs out of that thing.  You know, you're like, you fit in there.  And I mean, I fit.  I got mad space in here because it's extremely spacious.  It's it's freakishly spacious when you figure how small it is.  Right. So it was the yeah.  So it was one of those things that everybody I think they were more  freak freaked out that how the heck did this middle line that could get out of that little car?

You know, it's it's it's definitely more compact, but it's still roomy inside.  Depending on what your timing is.  Early early in the year, Nissan is going to launch the Aria,  their own compact crossover, depending on your budget.  You might also want to look at the Polestar 2.  It's quite a bit smaller than the Model S.  It's really good to drive. It's quick.  The Volvo XC40 recharge.  That's that's another battery EV.  So there's a whole bunch of them that are coming to market.  And of course, you know, if you if you decide that maybe going small  is not what you want to do, you can also get a Hummer EV.

Sam and I were talking about the radio show this week because  he was driving a Mustang Mach-E up in the wilds of Michigan  and found it a little hard to find those electrify America chargers.  That's that's going to be the trick.  Does does the Biden executive order do anything about  beefing up our electric charging network?

Start time: 6093.64
End time: 6123.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it talks about, you know, adding more EV chargers,  you know, building out the charging infrastructure, adding, you know,  they want to add five hundred thousand public charging stations,  which is great, except that you can't do that through an executive order.  You know, that's that's something a lot of what was in the executive order  is basically saying suggestions.  Congress, Congress, you know, you should do something about help me out here.  We need to do something. Yeah.  Yeah, because Congress has got to give some money first in order  for them to do it. Yeah.

Transcript:  I wish more of I mean, this is a nice way.  I'm just thinking of an easy word to say, I wish more fossil  heads would get their head around that electric vehicles will be very helpful.  And everyone goes, well, it costs more to do this.  So there's these weird, you know, mythical arguments of which  costs more to run and which costs less to run.  One of the things I know living on an island with the way our weather works,  it's just a general wear and tear of driving from a combustion engine vehicle.  The stuff that drips onto the ground causes the asphalt not to really stick  and pop out. So I knew you were just here.  Our government spends every single day  patching like three thousand potholes and they come back a month and a half later.  Right back out. I saw them doing that.  So that's one of the things that EVs will do better is because they turn.  You're not dropping like caustic things onto the ground.  And so infrastructure will actually save more.  Yes. Batteries are environmentally think.  Go ahead. Sorry, because I would get upset because they don't understand that  your gas thing is not just the gas and whatever, you know,  using all the batteries or worse.  That stuff dripping on the ground is extremely caustic.

Many of the cultures got here in order to help run factories for Dole  and farms for Dole. Right.  Plans. So when you came from some place where people didn't have things,  you get here, your first generation, you want to provide your kids  things better than the next. Right.  And so that everybody does. Right.  But it's amplified here because of the whole American dream stories, whatever.  I come from a place where I was walking, catching trains or maybe even still  riding a four legged vehicle.  And now I get to own a car.  When my kids are old, I'm going to get them a car right away.  So you have a large family.  You got five or six kids and every kid gets a car.  So it gets it gets crazy.

Transcript:  I was in Traverse City for a conference this week, and they  an old friend of mine introduced was working with  this UK company called Zapp Scooters.  They introduced their first electric scooter that's going on sale.  They're going to start deliveries in Paris later this month.  And it's a really cool looking scooter.  It's got about a 40 mile range.  We'll go I think it'll go up to about 50 miles an hour.  But it's it's got removable batteries so you can take the batteries out,  take them inside and charge them up.  You can get spare batteries just like you used to do with your  with your Samsung phones.  Leo, you can get spare batteries in there.  And it's it's actually in the in the rundown here.  The Zapp Scooter and  it's it's actually it's a it's designed as a more premium scooter.  And it's a really cool looking design.  And I think it's definitely that that's the sort of thing that  especially in cities, especially in crowded cities.  I think we need to get more people adopting micro mobility solutions,  whether it's a great school.  I agree.  You know, scooters or other small vehicles like that.  Apparently it is Scooter McScooterson.

I've never cared about this until I went to San Diego.  The like a couple of months before the situation, as I call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another reason why I say it was right.  If more people would do the micro mobility.  Yeah, you just say for this is a great conversation, Leo, because you just been here.  There's a lot of driving for things that are under a mile.  And it drives me insane because I lived in Japan  where you don't get in a car unless it's over two months.  They have great mass transit.  Two mile is the threshold.  But there's a lot of places where you're just going to the store.  The store is less than a mile away, but nobody will walk.  Everybody will drive.  And that's what makes it crowded.  It's the short trips that are obnoxious going to work and from work.  We get that. But it's the everyday little short trips.  And so Biki, which is those little mint green bikes you saw,  has helped out a lot, but mostly the tourists, rather,  because they come from places that had bikes.  So we're still trying to get it out of the head that I need my own car.  And of course, you saw the gigantic 2003  Toyotas that are like lifted this high off the ground.  They look brand new, but it's just obnoxious for an island.  Like, where are you going with that?

I know a lot of you love technology.  That's why you listen to our shows. I do, too.  That's why when Udacity was launched in 2011, ten years ago,  they're just celebrating their 10th anniversary.  I was really excited.  It was started by a Googler who noted that a lot of the people  were applying for jobs at Google, even though they came out of prestigious  universities and got fancy degrees in technology and  computer science didn't have the real skills that they needed to work at Google.  So he started Udacity, said, we're going to do and the very first thing  Udacity did is the nano degree.  We're going to go to companies and say,  what are the skills people need to get jobs at your company?  Udacity is a unique part time online education program  geared for people like you looking to take your technology to the next level.  They offer the latest cutting edge nano degree programs,  which you can't get anywhere else.  Things like AI, deep learning, flying car and autonomous flight engineer,  intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer,  robotic software engineer.  And they design these courses by partnering with industry leaders,  Microsoft, Google, IBM, AWS and more.  In fact, team leads at these top companies are often your instructor.  People were passionate, who understand the skills you'll need to work with them.  If you love learning and you want to get a job in tech, Udacity is for you.  Even if, I mean, honestly, I take their courses just because I love this stuff.  And it's a great way to learn.  Udacity can help you master the latest tech skills and techniques.  Of course, they've got the videos that you can watch the lectures on your own time  at your convenience.  But more importantly, and I really appreciate this,  they focus on active learning.  You actually their courses are project based.  You actually have to implement the things you've learned.  And that makes a huge difference in your understanding.  You've got to test your knowledge.  You've got to do these projects.  Now, you're not doing them alone.  You're doing homework and projects are reviewed by qualified professionals.  You'll have real human feedback and code reviews.  So you really kind of get used to the kind of environment that you'll be working in,  in big tech.  And of course, you have access to mentors 24 seven.  So, yes, you're going to have your I tell you, it's hard.  You're going to have points where you go, I'm what do I do?  I don't know how this works. How do I do?  You ask a mentor.  It's a it's really a successful way to do this.  And and you can do this in your own time in as little as five or 10 hours a week.  You work at your own pace any time of the day or night.  There are mentors available all day and all night, 24 seven, because they're global.  And you can graduate in as little as three months.  You might have a better job before next year.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  And maybe it's a good thing, because according to the World Economic Forum,  75 million jobs are going to be replaced by automation in the next three years.  That could very well be yours.  Prepare for the future with Udacity.  Over 14 million people in over 240 countries now use Udacity.  You can see the course listings at Udacity.com.  My suggestion is look at them and pick something that gets you excited.  Don't pick something because you say, oh, I have to do this or I should do this.  Pick something that you say, I want to I want to be an autonomous flight engineer.  I want to learn this because I tell you what, that passion is going to drive you  through the learning, you're going to be better at it.  And when you get that job, you're going to be happy.  Wouldn't you like to be happy in your job?  Wouldn't that be nice?  Once you enroll as a student in specific course offerings, you're going to view  the online course, you're going to complete a series of projects and support courses.  They have free courses.

They're also covered with mud because the kids, when Michael was little,  they would just go off road.  They'd ride everywhere.  They trashed the things, but they are so much, so much fun.

So I thought they were pretty cool.  I like electric.  I'm all electric.  We've got electric bikes, segues, electric vehicles.  I think it's great.  I just love it.  Let's see here.  What else should we talk about?  Firefox lost almost 50 million users last year.  That's depressing.  Out of a total of 250 some million.  That's a big drop.  We talked about this on security.  Now, I really think it's important.  What do you think?  That there be a diversity of browser ecosystems.  Firefox is kind of the last holdout.  Everybody's gone Chromium based, not just Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge.  I use Vivaldi.  I'm using Vivaldi right now.  That's Chromium based.  Brave is Chromium based.  Everything is.

Transcript:  Do you think that their slide was due to when it hit the Mac edge for the Mac was  dope, it was fastest for a minute and then it got kludgy for the minute.  It was like the fastest browser for the Mac.  Yeah.  And I was like, I can't believe I'm saying this.  I just got really judging.  Now, it is junk.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I wonder.  I wonder if that did cause any slide though to Firefox.  And I'm also makes me curious what the heck happened like edge team, because you came  out of the gate like, yeah, we got this.  And then I don't know what happened.  It's a huge drop down over a year.

Start time: 7175.40
End time: 7189.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a huge drop.  I just think Chrome is more and more dominant and edge didn't help.  There is Safari.  We Mac people use a web kit based browser.  But what do you think, Doc Rock?  Because I know you use Macs all the time.  Do you use Safari?

Start time: 7190.38
End time: 7249.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use Safari as my primary browser, but I'm finding more and more because I am doing a  lot of stuff with content creation and doing things where I have to do what we're doing  today, call in to someplace else.  I always have to use Chrome for that because the one thing that's great about Safari is  the security.  But that security comes at a cost when I can't do regular stuff.  Right.  Because, you know, and again, I get what they're trying to do and I appreciate that.  I don't mind having two browsers.  Most people that irritates them, they sort of just say screw it and they just use Chrome.  So they're kind of a the most flexible, but they're the ones that's also mucking up the  security because that's where your friends breach and they get your information, even  if you are tight.  Right.  So it's kind of for a person like me, it drives me nuts.  I wish we would just use the right tools for the right job or everybody.  I don't know.  I'm on the thing about the consensus.  And right now, recently, strangely enough, I've been using Firefox a lot.  I might go back.

Start time: 7250.82
End time: 7269.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I switched to Firefox.  Focus on iOS is great because it's got ad blocker.  It's got privacy built in.  They're still using WebKit.  You can't do anything about that on iOS, but you can at least use a user interface on top  of WebKit that does more to protect your privacy.  I agree with you.  I like Firefox focus.

Transcript:  Their new security stuff has just been really, really nice.  And it hasn't seemed and again, I've only been messing with it for about two months now.  It hasn't seemed to cause a performance issue.  And that's why I've been enjoying the heck out of Firefox right now.  So I'd be super upset if they went, you know, still no better battery life on a

Transcript:  MacBook than on Safari.  Safari really is good on the battery.  I think.  Chrome is not so good.  So somebody in the jar said Safari is secure because Apple doesn't spy on you.  Here's another laugh.  Elon Musk as CEO of Apple.  I think this book got it wrong.  It's by a pretty reputable reporter, Tim Higgins, The Wall Street Journal.

Start time: 7319.26
End time: 7331.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know Tim.  And, you know, I think that there may be certain elements of the story that might be  wrong, but I think that the fundamental is probably right because I'm.  Oh, you're the first person I've heard.

Start time: 7331.62
End time: 7337.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I know that Tim and Elon both said, we've never talked to each other ever.  I've never met the guy.

Start time: 7338.08
End time: 7384.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think that that's BS because they were sitting three feet apart from each  other at a meeting with Donald Trump back in 2017.  There's photos of them sitting on either side of Safra.  That's when he called him Tim Apple, I believe.  Right.  Yeah.  So, you know, they have met and I'm pretty sure they have spoken.  Now, the thing that may be wrong in Tim's story, you know, because what he's has is  hearsay, he didn't get it from either Elon or Tim.  But, you know, I think that I'm very, very confident that Tesla did have conversations  with Apple about an acquisition during one of the numerous.  Elon tweeted this.

Start time: 7384.40
End time: 7407.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what Elon tweeted.  Cook and I have never spoken or written to each other ever.  There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla.  There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever.  He refused to meet.  And by the way, Musk rubs it in by saying Tesla was worth about 6% of today's value.  In other words, Tim could have got a deal.

Start time: 7407.20
End time: 7513.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't believe that tweet.  I think Elon's lying.  Which he's been known to do once or twice.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I think he did request a meeting with Tim.  I wouldn't be surprised if Tim did not want to meet directly with him to talk about an  acquisition that maybe he talked to somebody else.  What's the CEO's name?  Luca Meistri.  No, no, no, no.  Maybe Meistri.  I'm thinking of the other.  The CFO.  The CEO is Jeff Williams.  Jeff Williams.  Yeah.  So I wouldn't be surprised if there was a conversation between Tesla and someone at  Apple.  Yeah.  And I also would not be the least bit shocked if Elon insisted that he be CEO of the combined  company.  That was because this is something we've anybody's been following Elon for a long time  knows that part of the reason why things have gone the way they have at Tesla is because  he is a micromanager.  He owns like 22, 23 percent of the stock in Tesla.  Yeah.  And the reason why he has retained that level of control is because he after his experiences  with PayPal and Zip2 and his previous companies, he did not want to give up control of any  of his new companies.  So he's got similar stakes in SpaceX and all his other companies.  And I would not be the least bit surprised if a condition of any deal.  And this is why no other automaker would ever consider buying Tesla unless it was in  bankruptcy and the stock was wiped out, is because they don't nobody else wants Elon  to be part of the organization.

Start time: 7515.32
End time: 7537.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Higgins tweeted that the anecdote comes from Musk's own telling of the story, according  to people who heard it.  Tim did not hear it, but others did and said, oh, yeah, Elon said this.  I could totally see Elon Musk BSing because it sounds like it's a great story.  So I was talking to Tim.

Start time: 7537.44
End time: 7539.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Elon probably told that story.

Start time: 7540.02
End time: 7567.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is how the story goes.  In 2016, I thought, you know, Apple wants to do cars.  They should buy Tesla.  I called Elon Musk and said on one condition, I'm CEO.  I called Cook, I rather Cook thought he meant staying CEO of Tesla.  No, no, no. Elon says, I mean, CEO of Apple.  At which point, Tim Apple said, if you had hung up on me, I could totally see somebody  be guessing that story.

Start time: 7567.70
End time: 7571.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And and and he was absolutely tell that.

Start time: 7571.58
End time: 7598.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly that way.  Yeah. So so maybe that didn't happen.  That's that story was told by Tim.  I mean, Elon, but doesn't mean it happened.  But the principal was probably exactly right.  It was exaggerated.  All right. Good.  Because Higgins, I think he's very well respected.  I didn't know you knew him.  So that OK, that makes a lot that makes a lot more sense.  Somebody told him, oh, yeah, he was.  Elon was going around boasting that Tim Cook hung up on him after seeing a few.

Start time: 7600.93
End time: 7610.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a hard time believing that that Tim Cook would say that to anybody.  Never. But I totally believe that Elon would insist on being CEO of the combined company.

Start time: 7610.80
End time: 7758.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can see Tim saying, Elon, you're high.  What have you been smoking? But that's all that's all.  Hey, good news.  Apple has beaten a patent troll.  And the amazing thing about this story, it was actually a federal judge in martial  Texas that threw out the patent, a three hundred eight million dollar patent  infringement from a company that I think charitably we could call.  A trolls, OK, Patent Troll personalized.  I was trying to come up with a better phrase.  What do they call them?  A somebody that there is a non practicing, a non-np,  which is a non practicing entity, personalized media communications.  Apparently, the judge was a little Judge Rodney  Gilstrap of Marshall, Texas, was a little affronted at the whole thing.  He said personalized media gets nothing, in fact, has to cover Apple's legal costs,  or at least some of them.  But what he was affronted by is a process I didn't know about  that it's no longer done this way.  But back in the 80s, when the term of a patent would last 17 years,  the term began not when the application was entered,  but when you were granted the patent.  So personalized media applied in the 80s, but slow walked it.  They they didn't finish the paperwork waiting  to see if the patent would be worth anything.  The company filed hundreds of applications in the late 80s  and 90s when these rules were in effect, but no patents were awarded until 2010.  And of course, at that point, they've got, you know,  17 years from 2010, not from the 80s.  The judge was ridiculous.  The rules have changed it now since 1995.  Your patent term starts  with the date of application and lasts for 20 years after that.  So this is called this technique was called Submarining.  And in fact, if you ask me, it's a giveaway that you're a patent troll.  If you do that, they apparently would wait to see if the patent was going to be worth  anything before following through.  They didn't want the clock start ticking until they knew they could make something out of it.

Transcript:  Yeah, we got a demand letter from them for some ridiculous amount of money.  They actually made a mistake with us because they asked for so much money  that would have been cheaper to defend it in court.  You and so, you know, I almost thought that was personal audio, personal audio.  OK, that's different.  This is personalized media based in the fine Sugarland, Texas.

Start time: 7795.38

Start time: 7798.88
End time: 7846.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they actually filed dozens of lawsuits and they usually settle  because companies go, well, it's going to be cheaper just to give you some some money.  Last year, a jury in Marshall.  I think Marshall is going to get a new reputation.  This used to be the home of these patent lawsuits because  the jurors were so pro the little guy and so Andy, the big guy.  They actually cleared alphabet of claims.  It was infringing patents from personalized media for adaptive video streaming.  There is a case against Netflix, which they got moved to New York.  So that's not going to be as probably as successful as successful as they'd like.  Anyway, good.  I always like seeing a non practicing entity.  Take it in the shorts.  Is that OK to say that, Stacey?  I don't even know what it means.

Transcript:  Yeah, I thought I found this very disappointing.  And I know it's disappointing probably in the same way a tire mom is disappointed  in their children, right?  You could be president.  Why are you just hanging out with a job? Right.  So with this, Google has done a couple of things.  They've said that they can do machine learning on the device  for nine different models, which is very nice on a battery powered device.  They can track packages, people, vehicles,  familiar faces if you pay a subscription and animals, including dogs and cats,  possibly raccoons.  The person I talked to was telling me a story about the raccoons. But  I'm sad because they don't do anything with this,  except make notifications a little bit better.  And in the smart home, I feel like, hey, if you see a familiar face,  in the home or coming in the door, maybe you want to disarm the security system.  Maybe you want to give me that option.  Or I would love to see, you know, if you see my dog on my furniture,  play a siren, you know, these are the types of things I think.  And Google has.  Beat into us that it is really good at machine learning,  and it is usually really good at machine learning.  So I'm perplexed as to why they didn't do more with this.  I guess that's why I'm disappointed.  They're perfectly fine as a revamp.

Well, even, even that, the only, the only doorbell or the only camera we've had  on the outside is one wise camera that I set up in the backyard just to watch a  Robin's nest that had robbed from Rob's nested in one of the bushes  beside our garage.  But, you know, we're we're just not into that stuff.  So it's.  But, you know, it's interesting that, you know,  Google has, you know, not done as much as they could, you know,  with the AI in this thing. Yeah.

You're going to get like all myriad versions of just if you said nest,  I mean, sorry, not nest alone ring alone.  There's like 27 different looking rings.  And so, you know, you got people like me who buy the high end just because.  And then you get other people like, I'm going to get the five dollar one.  I got from, you know, some bootleg place and it just would make the hallways look  bad. So we can't do it.  But we're working on trying to get the board to come to some decision to allow  it because it's extremely high for the UPS man.  We all get packages every day.  So I know my UPS man.  He's been my UPS man for 30 years.  So like I Matt knows Apple days.  OK, I know he's not home yet, but let me call him and let him know.  I will be there. Apple Day, Matt.  Leave the phone.  Yo, he knows he will text me.  Hey, I'm almost there.  I will take off from wherever I am.  It's a good idea. You still got a sign, right?  Get to know your UPS guy.  It's a marvelous thing.  So, yeah, I I agree.  I some of the stuff, you know, that's not quite there yet with the smart home does  feel like a letdown when you run into that situation.  And so for me, again, a big one, say I'm cooking Shabu Shabu and I get a false  positive on my Nest smoke detector.  I can't just say, hey, you know, do you people can you kill the smoke detector?  I'm Chef Boy, I burn them up today.  Let it happen.  And then they'll be like, OK, but you can't.  I like either got to disable it or, you know, mess with the don't  pay any attention to this for an hour thing.  It's I'm with Stacy.  It should be smoother by now because it's been so long.  And I guess my other fight is when you live in a place that only has air  condition, I can't get a smart thermostat because they all want to work off of HVAC.  We don't use H. We only got back.  So I don't know what to do.  It is driving me insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you think, Stacy, part of the reason they don't make these smarter  is they're concerned?  I mean, Google, poor Google.  Any time they do anything with AI, people go creepy, crossing the creepy line.  You think they're worried about that?  The creepy line?

Start time: 8190.32

Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, so I had in like 2015, I think 2014 even a Netatmo camera.  Yeah.  Netatmo.  I don't know how to say it.  And when I had it, it had familiar faces free actually.  So if it recognized, it recognized all my family's faces and if it didn't see  them for a while, it would turn on, it would arm the security system basically.  And when it saw us come home, it would disarm it.  And that didn't feel creepy.  Netatmo did everything locally on the device.  The object detection models are running locally on the Google device, which  makes it less creepy.  So I don't know if it's a creepy factor or if it's just, I really, I just don't  understand and it makes me sad because I really, I do like people.  I do think what they're doing in the smart home is actually pretty nice.  So yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 8247.46

They're not actually doing anything creepy, but just because it says Google,  people are going to think that.  And I forgot where I heard that.  It might've been Renee, but that's true.

Transcript:  I just had, yeah, I had Sarah Spangler on the show a couple, a couple months back.  I thought this was both a crazy thing and a really scary thing.  Cause space or swarm is tiny.  She's one of the founders of swarm.  We should say, so our Spangler is the CEO.  She's also a former Canadian astronaut.  Just so fancy.  Um, they make these things called tiles and they connect to the tiny little  S uh, satellites that are up there.  In the war or orbit.  Um, and the cool thing is they can deliver internet access to things, low  bandwidth internet access for $5 a month.  I'm actually testing out a swarm satellite service right now or eval kit right now.

Start time: 8442.82
End time: 8451.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So she's kind of like a mini star link sort of going.  Is it low bandwidth star link?

Start time: 8451.36
End time: 8466.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Basically it's a low power WAN.  So it's low power wide area network.  This is like, you know how I always talk about the internet of things  needs connectivity, this cheap ubiquitous and like the sidewalk, like sidewalk.  Yeah.  It's like sidewalk, except this is satellite based.

Start time: 8466.64
End time: 8472.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, and they have 121 satellites in orbit, so it's, it's a non-trivial  network they've got up there.

Start time: 8472.72
End time: 8483.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they've done it and they're going to have, I can't remember.  I'm sorry.  I I'm, I'm writing a story at it actually right now, but I haven't got  all the data in there yet.  It's got TKs.  I have some stats.

Start time: 8484.38
End time: 8502.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  750 data packets, 750 data packets a month, but that's $5 a month and it's global.  So who would pay for that?  The company that made the IOT device or would the end user pay for that?  I would think most, well, it depends on the business model you want to have, but

Start time: 8502.80
End time: 8504.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  probably maybe it'd be part of a subscription like a nest subscription.

Start time: 8506.96
End time: 8509.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You'd make it, if you were doing consumer, it'd be a subscription.

Start time: 8509.92
End time: 8524.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you were building a, like this is their, their customer base.  A lot of them are like in the industrials kind of world.  So they're like monitoring sensors on gas pipelines.  And this is great for them.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  750 data packets.  I don't know how many bits that is, but it's not a lot.

Start time: 8524.42
End time: 8525.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She says they can send email.

Start time: 8526.30
End time: 8541.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She wants me to test out sending email, but you can do downlink, but not uplink.  They have the technical capability for uplink, but they don't advertise it.  And it's not where they want to go.  Well, it's not going to be up to them anymore because SpaceX is now the owner.

Start time: 8543.64
End time: 8545.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They get cheap connectivity for IOT devices.

Start time: 8547.14
End time: 8550.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And do you think that they'll somehow roll this technology into Starlink or

Start time: 8551.39
End time: 8557.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is, or do they just see this as an adjunct business?  I don't know enough about where Starlink I'd have to research where Starlink is.

Start time: 8560.47
End time: 8568.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are they in the KU band or are they?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  I mean, I used to cover it.  So I feel like Starlink is in a separate band, so you can't roll these together in

Start time: 8569.75
End time: 8569.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the sky.

Start time: 8570.00
End time: 8575.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it just be another business that's that they would do because they've already got  these satellites up there.

Start time: 8576.28
End time: 8579.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm trying to think of the logical reason to have a dual band receiver down

Start time: 8583.04
End time: 8595.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that could do KU or.  Right.  Right now, if I weren't talking, I'd be furiously looking up what band Starlink is.  Starlink is too expensive.  I mean, you really it doesn't make any sense to use it for IOT.

Start time: 8597.24
End time: 8613.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The receivers are bigger.  Everything, you know, none of this makes any sense.  So it seems like an interesting expansion of Starlink.  What do you think, Sam?  I know you follow Elon quite closely.  I think it's a good question.  I think it's a good question.  Quite closely.

Start time: 8617.58
End time: 8647.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is this I'm not really familiar with this particular one.  You know, I think Starlink, I think, is is a fascinating technology and the ability to  provide connectivity everywhere.  I love the concept.  So far, what I've seen from early betas of Starlink, you know, it's not as good as was  claimed, but, you know, maybe when there's another 10,000 satellites up there, then  then maybe it'd be good.

Start time: 8647.84
End time: 8688.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I follow the Starlink subreddit and it's expensive.  It's well, it's 100 bucks a month, $500 for the gear.  But if you are in an area where you don't get Internet, yeah, if there's no cable or  fiber, you are, you know, it's the only option.  It's a really for a lot of people.  And I have to say, the vast majority of people on this on the Starlink subreddit on  Reddit love it. They're thrilled.  And there's a lot of people saying, when do I get it?  When do I get it? Elon's also started to imply that it will be mobile at some point,  which is to me very interesting right now.  It has to be tied to an address.  But at some point, he says we're going to be able to make it so that you can have a  mobile device doing this, which would be very interesting.

Start time: 8688.98
End time: 8714.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the real challenge there with with the mobile part is that you have to keep the  the antenna aimed at a satellite.  You know, this is battery power.  Yeah. And the battery power.  Yeah. See, I want it on a cruise ship.  So I can tell you the Starlink beta.  You know, he he had a hard time just finding a place where he could get a clean view of  the sky challenge.  You know, even a tree in the way of structures.

Start time: 8714.96
End time: 8724.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Is to kill the signal.  We have a host who does Floss Weekly, Jonathan, I know who is raving, but he's in Oklahoma.  So, again, it really helps to have no trees.

Start time: 8725.02
End time: 8746.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You found out the twins have that thing, too, on the New England coast, somewhere not that  far away from the headquarters.  They actually got one for their beach house.  Oh, nice. And yet he said, yeah, like it was all good at first.  And then the tree, you know, got to get those trees out of the way.  It became not winter anymore.  And the tree boom is like, oh, I got to move this thing.

Start time: 8747.44
End time: 8754.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to put it on a pole taller than the tree.  That's the key. You said it's the KAKU band, Stacey.

Start time: 8755.24
End time: 8794.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is the KAKU. So we're talking, you know, swarm satellites are down here.  Elan's are up here.  There we go. Up here.  Elan. Yeah.  Sarah's. Yeah.  And then their radios are going to be transmitting at different decibels.  And I don't see it does not seem reasonable or possible.  Now, Starlink has been focused on building software that can really optimize for coverage  and communication.  Like, I don't believe Elan and his mobile stuff right now.  I'm just going to tell you honestly.  So maybe there's some like maybe swarm has.

Start time: 8795.08
End time: 8796.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have little faith in Elan.

Start time: 8798.30
End time: 8827.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Magical technologies.  Or this could be the other thing that swarm has is access to the same satellite air  waves. So the same spectrum that Orbcom is using.  And I can't remember the wavelengths, the frequency range right off the top of my head.  But so this could be a play to get access to more airwaves, which would then have more  could allow Elan to have more capacity on SpaceX.

Start time: 8827.80
End time: 8833.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is interesting. This is the swarm eval kit for evaluating.  That's what I have.  You have one of those?

Start time: 8834.50
End time: 8836.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's my. Oh, should I tell people?

Start time: 8836.32
End time: 8848.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is a solar panel.  This is a solar panel that the transmitter is just this little antenna.  That's all. Yeah, it's so there's a battery.  So it'll run. Yeah.  So you have one. What do you do with it?

Start time: 8850.14
End time: 8858.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I well, I want to take it out next week.  I'm hoping to take it out to the Olympics to test actually where I won't have connectivity.  She doesn't mean the summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Start time: 8858.64
End time: 8862.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 8863.74
End time: 8881.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd like to take this to the Olympics and stream the swimming event.  It would not work. You couldn't stream.  It's one way. It's one way only.  Yeah. And by the way, the data packets are one hundred ninety two bytes up to one hundred  ninety two bytes per packet.  So it's really a very low bandwidth, but suitable for optimized for sensors.

Start time: 8881.84
End time: 8915.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting.  You know, in companies like Bechtel, you know, when they're doing these things in their bridges,  they put sensors in that when they're walking, when they do the bridge walks, they can walk over the bridge.  Actually, Bechtel is big in the Bay.  So when they walk across the bridge, they can detect if there's any cracks or any issues  that you're having, you know, with the cabling or whatever.  So, yeah, this would be cool because I was just looking at the picture here.  And even with Ag, like you can tell if you're having some problem in the field, you can  just send a signal and then someone knows to get there right away and solve it.  So, yeah, it's kind of cool.

Transcript:  We'll wrap things up with a happy birthday to the World Wide Web launched 30 years ago,  August 6th, the very first website ever launched.  Tim Berners-Lee, August 6th, 1991.  It was actually it said the World Wide Web, W3 is a wide area, hyperlinked something or other.  Pretty cool. It's hard to believe this thing that we take completely for granted is only 30 years old.  That, you know, it was invented before or after a lot of us were born and pretty cool.  So there is a project to restore that page was launched in 2013.  Oh, wait a minute. NPR says here it is.  You can go there. Let's do it.  Info.cern.ch. Browse the first website.  That's it. It's pretty basic.  A wide area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.  Would you have invested money in this if you'd read that sentence 30 years ago?  I don't think so. Stacey, find out about Swarm.  We'll talk again on Wednesday on This Week in Google.  We missed you terribly last two weeks.  I can't wait to get you back. Stacey's website, Stacey on IOT.com.  Subscribe to her free newsletter. Check out the events.

If you are not yet a member of Club Twitter,  I might want to encourage you to help support the network.  It makes a big difference to us.  It has really turned out to be a real success.  It's a way of supporting Twitter by donating seven bucks a month.  We've decided to give you some benefits,  including ad free versions of all the shows.  In fact, if you're a Club Twitter member,  you're not even hearing this because it's cut out of the show.  You also get, by the way, audio and video.  You also get access to our great Discord, which is a lot of fun.  We've really been enjoying the Discord.  I think it's my new social network.  And the Twit Plus feed, which has all the good stuff  before and after the shows that hits the cutting room floor.  We just scrape those up.  We package them into sausage and send it your way  via the Twit Plus bonus content feed.  All of that, seven bucks a month.  But mostly you do it for the warm and fuzzy feeling  that you're helping support what we do here at Twit.  And we really are grateful.  Want to know more?  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon, 2 30 Pacific.  That's 5 30 Eastern Time, 21 30 UTC.  You're invited to watch us live if you want. No charge.  There's a live audio and video stream at Twit.tv slash live.  If you're watching live chat with us live, of course, there's the IRC,  which has been around now almost as long as the World Wide Web.  I think I started doing it in 92 at IRC dot Twit dot TV.  There's also the brand new Discord channel.  If you're a member of Club Twit, you can tweet chat live  and of course, do the animated GIFs  at Discord, Discord channel.  You can get shows on demand after the fact on our website, Twit.tv.  There's a YouTube channel devoted to all of our shows.  Each channel has each show has its own channel.  Or you could subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
