Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 47, for March 26, 2006.  Joining us now via his ISDNY, so high-tech, it's the latest thing from 1992, Doug Kay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess if you have nothing good to say, you might as well at least sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounding fantastic, practically like you're in studio.  From Skype land, we have John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How you doing? And Patrick Norton as well, who is seeing red sniper dots on the window pane.  Is everything okay now, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just the neighbor starting her construction project again.  Okay.  Now they can fire it back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome everybody. We had invited Robert Scoble of Microsoft Corporation to join us to talk about our top story, but he can't make it.  Maybe we'll get him back next week. Actually, there's a bunch of Microsoft news.  The biggest story, of course, is that Vista Consumer Edition won't be out until early 2007.  Business Edition comes out late 2006 as planned.  That just makes me laugh.  Why would they release it? Clearly nobody in business is going to adopt it until the Consumer Edition is out, right?  Is it just so they can test it?  I don't think that's true.  What's the rationale? Why release the Consumer... What is the story? Why are they doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the word on the street is that they have some multimedia issues in the main part of the code because they want to incorporate all this cool stuff.  Right.  I don't know. I mean, the whole thing sounds a little fishy to me. It's not as though they haven't done this before.  There's one rumor on the net that says it suggests that it's possibly some licensing deals haven't been signed off on.  And maybe it's going to be harder to get them to sign off on them because Microsoft doesn't like to license anything.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  L.A. Times says it's a big yawn. Everybody's happy with XP.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's my question too. I mean, you know, take a look at an IT department. These guys have fought for years to get something stable.  And like it or not, they've got something stable. I can't think of anything worse than having to get rid of XP and go to Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, that same issue happened with Windows 2000. I think they were very reluctant to go to XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it took a long time.  A lot of them didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft has to light a fire and have to say, well, you're not going to get updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many times are you in somebody's office and they fire up the computer and there's Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I had my choice, that would be the version I'd be using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? So, you know, I...  We all assume that every few years there's a new major version of Windows and that we're all going to follow it.  I wonder if that eventually breaks and we just stop doing it at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, one of the things I have an issue with is that what's the difference?  What are you going to... What is Vista bringing to the party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Patrick, you played with it more than anybody else. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a new user interface. They've taken out most of the really innovative stuff like the file system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in terms of what the end user would notice, it would be interesting to see.  They plan to ship the file system after Vista ships, whenever Vista ships, dot, dot, dot.  You know, the interface, they're trying to clean it up and really make it, I think, more OS X-like.  They're trying to root out the security problems.  The thing they keep coming back to these days is that it's going to be more secure. It's going to be better.  You know, and everybody kind of looks at each other and nods their head and, you know, goes, uh-huh.  We believe you. That's definitely your goal.  In terms of usage, it kind of reminds me a lot of going from 95 to 98 or 99 to XP.  Only maybe not so dramatic. You know, some new icons, some new desktop action, the start button's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what I think users are crying for is a more secure operating system.  They hope that it will have been rewritten greatly so that it's safer and more robust and less prone to spyware infestation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the things they've done is if you install it yourself and you basically enable everything it wants you to enable.  One of the more amusing aspects is that it asks your permission before it does anything.  So you go to change the screen size, screen resolution, you get a dialog box back.  So it's like, you know, did you do this? Are you sure you want me to do this?  Well, but it's also maybe the only way they can lock everything down at some levels.  The flip side is it's going to be, you know, application four star z seven x four seven three dot exe has asked if it can do something to something DLL.  At which point, you know, the user has no idea what they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, I'm almost expecting it to say, you know, when you're in a Word document saying cut and paste, are you sure you want to cut and paste?  Is this how you do the one doing the cut and paste?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft has done this before.  I mean, they've had some annoying, you know, are you sure you want to delete messages in the past?  People just disable them.  I also think that they can, you know, there's a balance.  One of the reasons Mac is safer is because it does ask your permission before it makes any system changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, hey, I have an idea.  What's that?  Maybe they should just toss the whole thing and come up with a operating system that doesn't use this ridiculous registry.  The centralized registry. I mean, this is all communistic.  It's unbelievable. It's like the Politburo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Vista still have a registry, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope so.  It never occurred to me that they would walk away from that model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, it would break every program in existence if it didn't.  So I guess it would have to just as XP has some support for when not any in the system, not any just in case.  Yeah, yeah, but I agree with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the registry is one of the things that bothers me most about all of those recent Windows operating systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's very trouble prone.  Explain to us why the registry is such an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the biggest problem for me is that I can't get rid of things.  You know, if I have a piece of software and I don't like it, you know, there are remnants in the registry that I have a hell of a time getting rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have one centralized file. It's fairly opaque.  It's actually a number of files, but it looks like one central file with everything in it.  And if you uninstall a program, you have to modify the registry.  If you install a program, you have to modify the registry. That makes it less robust.  It means getting rid of traces of a program are much more difficult because it's hidden away in this opaque file.  It's why spyware loves the registry because they can put all sorts of things in the registry.  And it's frankly fragile.  I don't know if it is a very good way of doing what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  An interesting thing will be to see the uptake on the OEMs.  And when either version starts coming out, to what extent they offer both XP and Vista on new machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a great little controversy going on because an Australian IT journal, Smart House, on Friday,  published a story claiming internal sources at Microsoft saying that 60% of the Windows Vista code had to be rewritten.  Microsoft immediately denied it and said, in fact, it's not being rewritten.  There have been no code changes in the Vista code base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're using that proven Windows XP code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been working on this thing since the year 2002 or whatever.  Since 1990, I think.  But it's like, how are you going to do 60% in 9 or 10 months? It's not going to be doable.  So that story seemed a little ludicrous.  Yeah, I think it's bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think a couple of people sort of did the math and said, well, what's the cost of rewriting 60% of every line of code in the Windows operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, then again, it may have just been a criticism.  Maybe it should be rewritten.  Exactly. It didn't mean they're going to rewrite it.  Somebody came up and said, 60% of this code is crap. It needs to be rewritten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've been told by Microsoft Insiders from a year ago that when they threw out the file system, that that was actually not the first version of the file system.  They'd gone back to the drawing board at least twice to rewrite the thing.  That it wouldn't be the first time they've tossed out code and said, we've got to start over. It's not doing it.  And in fact, I think that's probably why they pulled the, what is it called, WinFS or the new file system out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Well, I started about six months ago and I was in a dinner meeting with Jim Altshyn.  Robert Scoble was there and they gave a big fancy demo of Vista.  And I turned to the guy next to me and I said, don't we really already have most of this stuff in OS X?  And I think the thing that they were so excited about were, let's see, you know, visual windows that you could see through translucent windows.  And then the equivalent of Spotlight, I forget what they call it in WinFS.  I said, you know, gee, we've gotten used to this already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was their response?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't say that out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you should have had me there. I would have said it.  Well, it's been said now.  Of course, I wouldn't have been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is, you know, related, I guess.  There's a huge exploit going down or number of exploits now, zero day exploits on a real flaw in Internet Explorer.  And we're back again to this, the so-called create text range flaw.  Microsoft says they're working as fast as they can to provide a patch.  And if necessary, we'll do an instant patch instead of waiting until April 11th, their normal patch date.  There are this there are already this was discovered on Thursday.  There are already hundreds of websites, according to searchsecurity.com, hundreds of websites that are exploiting this flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And which versions of IE are affected?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we know all versions of in fact, the vulnerability, according to Secunia, is confirmed on a fully patched system, fully patched system with IE six and SP two.  I don't know if IE seven is vulnerable.  Can you tell us what it does, Leo?  Yeah, it's another one of these buffer overflow issues and allows it allows a website or malicious spam, HTML spam to embed code of any kind onto a site, onto a computer to co-opt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you say there's a bunch of sites using it.  What are they using it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're putting they're putting a thing called SD bot, which is a Trojan horse program on it's basically they're co-opting the computers, they're zombieing the computer so they can use it to send off spam.  SD bot is an IRC bot that, you know, hooks the computer up to an IRC network and then waits and waits instructions.  So essentially, they can do anything they want to your system.  Here's the this Secunia discovered it.  It's an error in how the create text range method is processed on a radio button control.  So you have to go to a website with a radio button control.  This can be exploited by a malicious website to corrupt memory in a way that allows the program flow to be redirected to the heap.  This is a traditional way of, you know, buffer overflow and arbitrary code could be executed.  And the code would be to put something like SD bot in your system.  It's apparently it's spreading like wildfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's spreading like wildfire by the poor unfortunate souls who use Windows IE instead of Firefox or Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  And we've been saying this for a long time.  Don't use IE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been saying it for years.  Use Opera, use Firefox, do not use Windows IE.  That's what the target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are two incidentally, two other serious flaws that are being investigated right now.  Microsoft says users can protect themselves by configuring IE to prompt before running active scripting or by disabling active scripting in the Internet and local Internet security zones or set your security to high, which means most of the websites you go to won't work.  Those are separate attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not the same as this text area overflow.  No, this is another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So all the more reasons for the fire.  It's just a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did no extend to Apple do a pretty large group of updates for us?  And they did last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did.  And we had talked about there were some pretty serious flaws in OS 10.  And as far as anybody knows, Apple's not doesn't tell you what they're patching.  But as far as anyone knows, it looks like they patch those flaws.  Anyway, kind of kind of an interesting mess for Microsoft between delay of Vista and these Trojan horses.  And you've got to think that this is this is more of what you were saying, John, that Microsoft's just really struggling right now.  Yeah, I don't like to see it, but I do have the sense that they're dead in the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that Bill is going to have to come back to work or something.  I'm not absolutely sure what the problem is.  You know, Alchin, by the way, had already been in the office.  He says even though Vista is not shipping until 2007, he's still going to retire in 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Steve Sinovsky is going to take over.  He was the program manager for the office team.  But I thought he was a marketing.  The new guy is a marketing guy.  He's not a technical guy.  No, well, he started as a programmer.  OK, so he's you know, and he leads the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably turn marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess when you look at the news, you know, you're talking about the news.  I don't know this guy, so he may be a genius for all I know.  But I do know that years ago you started to see this erosion of the really best coders over at Microsoft all getting sick of being bossed around and decided that they should be managers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I've talked to a number of people that have seen this phenomenon over there.  And I think it's an inevitable situation where you have a bunch of old programmers can't really program.  When they get to be 30 and no offense to you coders out there who are in your 30s.  But generally speaking, you know, all these kids who can spend all night and eat pizza and live off of diet coke or coke are probably, you know, really the bread and butter for the.  They're all doing their web 2.0 companies now.  Yeah.  Well, the point is, though, at Microsoft, is these guys were like, you know, they're not going to be in the same position.  So you have Microsoft filled up with that kind of situation from what I can tell.  MSN says that actually some Associated Press story.  I'm sorry.  It was published by MSN that Apple could be the big winner from the Windows 8.  And you know, it's a big deal.  And I think that's the problem.  And I think that's the problem.  And I think that's the problem.  And I think that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's the problem.  I don't think that's I think that's a bogus story.  Who's going to who what general member of the public is going to?  Oh, God, there's no Vista.  I'm not going to buy a computer.  I'll buy a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just don't see that happening.  I think you make the decision about what you're going to buy before you go to the store.  Yeah.  It's like you're buying a Windows box or you're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.  You're buying a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're buying a Windows box or you're buying a Mac.  That's right.  And the only the only issue is does the does that Windows box come with XP or Vista?  And for now, you have for now, there's no choice.  There'll be a period where you can get either.  And don't you think people want to wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the public cares.  I don't think the public even knows what Vista is.  We're talking about our geeky audience, you know, and ourselves, you know, we know, but that's about it.  Small audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the key, though, is that the the upgrade licenses are going to be disappointing for Microsoft.  I think that's the big source of revenue for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's kind of key to the whole enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the longer they wait, the longer they're counting on it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dell has purchased Alienware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what is what is Alienware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw that Alienware makes a high end gaming machine.  They're very expensive.  You get a good Alienware box like seven grand and a big margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're not all that expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're one of the first boutique gaming machine vendors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously, Dell, who is trying to do gaming platforms, but they just don't have the cache of someone like Alienware.  You know, why is Alienware buying Alienware anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Dell getting out of this deal?  What what is what is Alienware?  What can they do that Dell can't do?  They can sell a computer at 100 percent markup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they can do.  I mean, Dell makes their money from other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, the thing is, is that I just don't get it personally.  I mean, Dell could have created their own Alienware company and, you know, then it allows you know, what it does is it allows them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is like a proctoring gamble move.  It allows them to have a different name and a different branding and access to some other channels.  Because at this point, Alienware is so far from what they were five years ago.  You know, their entry level gaming machine started like seven hundred and eighty six hundred and seventy bucks, something like that.  You know what I mean?  There's you know, they're but they have a reputation.  They're not beige boxes, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are Dell machines anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody makes beige boxes.  OK, they're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're you know, hey, Dell makes a crummy looking box.  It's not beige, but it still looks like it was designed by some guy in Texas.  It's a charcoal box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not it's not just the box.  It's the brand, too.  I mean, Dell has the ability to make everything boring.  It's very staid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's what you want in business.  I think this is I think you hit the nail on the head, Patrick.  You said it gives them access to new channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully, they don't we need a computer that ugly.  I don't think you guys have been up in the site forever.  Sorry, I just had to say that.  You like my website forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dells. Yeah.  What about it?  But Dells, what do you think those machines look good?  I don't think they look that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're easy to open.  They look as good as a Mac.  Does anything do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, does anybody else put a little work into it, like maybe hire a design team, get Frog Studios or  get all your high score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Get off of you.  People put it on.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look decent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the two people.  What's what's decent?  What looks decent to you, John?  You want a G5?  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see other boxes that look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like a mid 80s.  A G5 Mac looks like a mid 80s appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Dell box looks like a 57 Studebaker.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  We get the point.  I'd like to let you guys fight for the rest of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Pat likes a 57 Studebaker.  That was the wrong choice.  Exactly the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's something wrong, though, if John's defending PC boxes and Patrick's defending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I get it backwards, but John defending the Mac boxes and Patrick's defending the  PC box.  It just doesn't sound right.  Well, who's going to defend Apple in France is the real question.  Somebody better.  Oh, I think you would have.  Where do you come down on this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is very interesting.  Well, the gang decided last week that nobody cares.  Oh, you already did this story?  I'm sorry.  Not really.  Well, can you tell us about the story?  I think it's a little bit of a mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit of a mystery.  I think it's a little bit of a mystery.  I think it's a little bit of a mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you already did this story?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't law.  It wasn't.  It's still not law, but they finally passed this bill and Apple is saying it's state-sponsored  piracy and the next thing they'll be doing is giving away free movies.  You know, I'm somewhat sympathetic with the French house here.  I think that it's clearly monopolistic of Apple.  I mean, they're really, they use the leverage of the iTunes music store to sell iPods.  On the other hand, I don't think the French government or any government has the right  to say to any company how they can do business.  It's not like you can't buy the same songs somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how very neocon of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know what the upshot is going to be is Apple just pull, it's only 2% of their  business.  They just pull out of France.  The only way this has any impact at all is if 20 countries do it.  I think only the French would try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it'll be interesting to see if there's a number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you think that Apple will come back strong on this and say, and just pull it right  up, pull the plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they're going to just pull out of France.  What's the point of staying there?  The French can do their own thing.  They're fine with that.  They've always been this way.  The French are kind of this way.  Right.  I don't think it's going to kill Apple or anything else and, you know, maybe there'll  be some other marketing strategy that brings something else in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do support the notion, though, that, I mean, what Apple's doing with this DRM and not licensing  it is, you know, it's pretty monopolistic.  I mean, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the law says that there's like two different sets of points in the law that are really  interesting is one is that all and it's not just Apple.  All of the specs have to be made open enough that all the players can play any of the locked  sources of music.  Right.  And the other thing that's interesting is they're producing the fines for piracy down  to like, you know, a hundred dollars from two hundred fifty thousand dollars or, you  know, I mean, some remarkably small amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes, you know, I've, when they first came with that, the first thing I thought  of, you know, that's what this two bit piracy should be.  It should be like a traffic ticket.  It shouldn't be like a life sentence in jail or an execution the way the RIAA would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's going to enforce it if it is that serious?  You know, and on the other hand, if it's just a fine, maybe it'll get enforced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the RIAA has been having a jolly good time whipping out civil lawsuits  against people.  That's true.  They don't have to have a...  It's, I'm sure that's how they're funding themselves these days.  That's my new theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The state of Illinois has fined a fellow two hundred fifty dollars for, take a guess, borrowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wi-Fi.  Yeah, a guy was sitting...  Now, you know, this is another example of some bonehead that sits in his car outside  someone's house.  Yeah, but what's wrong with that?  Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  All he has to do is give it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If he gives it back, he can get the money back.  If he was borrowing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that, you know, I have a lot of issues with this.  As far as I'm concerned, if there's an unopened channel and somebody wants to just throw...  They're throwing it into the guy's car.  The signal, I mean, he's not going into the house.  I've argued this till I was blue in the face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, in the state of Illinois...  They're almost arguing it.  It's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, the guy who's the prosecutor there too used to be the guy pushing this  to some guy.  I have his name, but anyway, he's the head of the IT department too.  I mean, I don't understand what he's thinking.  I mean, this is a bad precedent.  It's going to cause nothing but like...  This is like police have enough trouble with cocaine dealers.  They don't want to go around enforcing this kind of idiotic who cares?  I mean, who cares that this guy was...  What was it, killing this guy's bandwidth or was he like, you know...  It just makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir, sir, take your hands off the computer and put them on the steering wheel.  I can see them.  What is the source of the internet access you're using, sir?  Mr. Dvorak, please do not get hostile.  What is the name of the IA...  I mean, it's just like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's...  I feel for the police who have to enforce it.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anyone...  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess if you're sitting in a car at night outside a building, typing on your computer,  they might ask you some pointed questions, just as you said.  Where did you get that access?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it take to just kill the connection or close the box?  I mean, I don't get how the guy got caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was sitting in his car outside.  I think it was outside of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I mean, how dumb is he?  The cops pull up and, you know...  He probably didn't know it was illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be fun to read the police report, you know, pulled up behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great idea, Patrick.  We should be able to get the police report and read it.  I'll work on it.  It's a blogable, dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a blog.  It's a blogable.  I'll work on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There used to be all sorts of other reasons you didn't want to be caught in your car or  parked somewhere, but now there's a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what you have to do is you have to be making out with somebody and then have the  computer on the floor just in case, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, officer, I was just making out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, move along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Toshiba has announced another delay in the HD DVD.  It won't be out now.  It wasn't going to be out by the end of March.  It's now not going to be until sometime in April.  They don't say when.  They say it's because they're waiting for the movies to come out.  I still believe the conspiracy theory that there's tough HDCP issues to solve with this  HD DVD.  Maybe.  You might be right.  Are you going to run out and buy one when they come out?  Buy one?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, that's the problem.  I don't think it matters when they ship.  I don't think anybody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do want it, but I'm not going to buy one.  I'm going to borrow one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So you'll be all excited about getting this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to be excited.  I would like to see some HD DVD movies.  I mean, if you have an HD system and you watch Showtime HD or Mark Cuban's HD Net and you  watch some of these movies on HD, you don't really want to watch the movies without HD.  They just don't look as good, especially if you're blowing them up real big.  I think HD's terrific.  I think it's a great technology, but there's no way of doing the pre-recorded thing and  the public still hasn't quite made the complete transition yet.  When they do, though, I think the old stuff's going to be tossed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I agree with you.  I just don't think that it's going to be HD DVD or Blu-ray that's going to bring it to  the masses.  I think it's probably digital delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think.  The file sizes are too big for digital delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the relationship between the Toshiba announcement and the overall availability  of HD on DVD?  Are they controlling the format?  No, there's two formats.  They control HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blu-ray is from Sony.  Sony's July.  We're all waiting for movies to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so far behind on that stuff.  I need to catch up.  I need to get a VCR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  My tip to you, Doug, stay away from the Betamax.  I don't know if they're going to last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've had one on order for a couple of years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So have you, Preston Grala, Brew Haha, you know Preston, don't you, John?  Yeah, I do.  What's the Brew Haha?  I missed that one.  Well, this is the two-tiered Internet quote.  I don't know if you talked about it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the FCC.  No, we didn't.  The FCC guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The chairman of the FCC was apparently misquoted by Preston Grala and his blog saying that  he favored a tiered Internet and having a priority fee that allows you to prioritize  your bandwidth depending on how much you pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we blogged that one on the Dvorak site.  It sounded terrible.  I mean, I think this FCC guy must have been inundated with hate mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, apparently he never even used the word tiered.  The reporter added the tiered into a comment.  If you read the quote apparently, I'll put links in the show notes, but if you read the  quote apparently, that's not what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did he say that the word tiered would make such a huge difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wasn't he actually talking about just paying more for higher bandwidth, for higher speed?  Wasn't that all it was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Martin also added he supports network operators' desires to offer different levels of service  at different speeds at different pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Different levels of service at different speeds.  I think that's kind of tiered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he said that consumers who don't pay for higher levels of Internet should not  expect to get higher levels of performance.  He did say in a following press conference that the Commission needs to make sure that  there are fair trade ways to ensure that consumers get what they are purchasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like tiered to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that last part is kind of revealing, or get what they are purchasing.  I've had some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't use the word tiered.  He's saying tiered.  If it was all about speed, that would be one thing.  Yeah, you get more for your money, you buy faster speeds, but he's not talking about  that.  He's talking about different levels of service, not different levels of speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's also talking about actually getting the service you're supposed to be paying for,  which I think is a big deal.  Oh, we never had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's never going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's never going to happen, but it's amazing to watch how heavy some of the package shaping  going on at some ISPs is when you're dealing with people who download a lot of video or  download a lot of audio.  It's kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody disagrees that Internet service providers shouldn't be able to, as Comcast does, as  everybody does, charge extra for higher speed.  That's been going on all along.  When we say tiered, we're not talking about speed, we're talking about services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, let's talk...  One aspect of this is the new Cisco routers.  One of the people pushing this, by the way, would be Cisco because they got these new  routers that do deep packet analysis on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and they say, well, if you want to have voice over Internet, sorry, you'll be paying  a little bit more.  It's not about speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, if they can look at the deep packet analysis router, can look at your service  and see that you're using Skype a lot.  And they say, you're using, this is ridiculous, you're using Skype, you're chewing up this  or that, even though you're paying for it.  But you're not paying for Skype, you're paying for whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's precisely what we don't want.  And I don't think that Chairman Martin actually endorsed that.  I think he's talking about different prices for different speeds, not tiered in the sense  of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  This is not resolved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Different levels of broadband service at different speeds and at different pricing.  I guess you could say, well, what does he mean by different levels?  Does he mean you get to use VoIP if you pay a little bit more?  You're right.  I mean, I think he needs to make a clarifying statement, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe that anybody who wants to download competitive services over the last mile of  the major cable company or AT&T-owned service should be forced to pay extra for the content  they signed on to the web delivery to begin with.  You know what I mean?  It's like, that's pretty much what this comes down to.  That peering is void and that you're not paying for bits, you're paying for the bits that  they're willing to let you pay and that the people who actually use the bandwidth they  think they're paying for should be capped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This reminds me of a conversation I had with Cablevision a few years ago when I said, you  guys really, you're a data service.  And they said we can't make a living as a data service.  We have to...  Oh, bull.  We don't, you know, the numbers don't work.  We can't charge you by the bit.  We have to charge you for premium content and premium services.  And that's what...  Yeah, but the...  That's clearly what they want to do.  That's what Comcast is trying to do to you, John, when they try to install this service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know for a fact that it was Comcast that did it, but Comcast recently  up my speed to a substantial, I'm like 6.5 megabits per second up and... or down and  then a three...  They're doing that nationwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing that nationwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus, Mary Joseph, DeVorex using her system.  Quick, give them more bandwidth.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing it for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing it for everybody.  I will blog about it.  But the thing is I got this message from one of my spyware firewalls saying, you know,  you have some tiered service.  What was it called, Leo?  It's a thing from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a layered service.  LSP is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, I got a layered service note saying that some DLLs are trying to be installed.  It seems unlikely that it was from a browser or something I was doing on the net.  It seems to me...  I don't know where it...  I just blocked it so it didn't get stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason your software said watch out is because spyware uses this layered service  provider capability to insert itself into Winsok.  Basically it modifies your TCP IP stack so that it can hook stuff into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I put that past Comcast because when I first signed on to Comcast and I used their little  disk to get the service running, if you run all the programs on it, it does install some  weird spyware, which I again blocked because I didn't see what the point of it was and  it didn't do anything for one or the other.  So I think that at Comcast, I don't know whether they know that this is a bad idea or somebody  sold them ability goods, but I suspect, although I can't confirm this and I need to, but I  suspect that they're playing some silly games with people's computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that's the kind of thing you would do, for instance, if you wanted to keep an eye  on whether they were using BitTorrent or Vonage or some other service that you wanted to charge  them for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  In fact, I could see them doing it.  I mean, just one example of what Comcast does when you get subscribed.  All of a sudden, they go in and patch a bunch of stuff.  Outlook Express, not to Thunderbird for anybody interested in my complaints, but if you run  Outlook Express after you get a Comcast cable modem, it says, when you boot it up, it says  Outlook Express by Comcast.  Yeah, I hate that.  I don't even know what the point of that is.  It's kind of embarrassing.  Of all the things I want to put my name on, that's not one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft builds that capability in, by the way, and everybody used to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, that brings up a good question.  Is there any reason to ever install the software that comes from your ISP?  No.  Especially for a cable modem.  Well, any machine you buy today has the ability to route to the cable modem or a router that  you might have at home.  I just don't see why anybody would need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and the reason they want you to do it is so they can install all this adware on  your system.  Right.  At the least, get a banner in your Outlook Express saying, brought to you by Comcast.  Don't you think, John, that there's probably quite a few unsophisticated users who might  say, well, thank you, Comcast.  I'm so glad you provided me with this.  I am absolutely sure that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a goodwill thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just trying to build it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, these are the same guys, you know, when I was talking about people poaching signals,  you know, somebody from Comcast, some Comcast installer sent me a note.  Because I noticed in some parts of the country, you'd go like Chicago, for example, and if  you check in anything about the fifth floor and you boot up your laptop, you get connected  immediately to somebody's local Comcast wireless.  I mean, it happens just automatically.  There's nothing you can do to prevent it.  You know, you can turn off.  You don't even have to actively do it.  You don't even have to do anything.  But I said, gee, they're putting these things in and then they're turning them on and these  poor people are basically feeding the whole neighborhood.  And this installer wrote me an email saying, hey, you know, we haven't got time.  We have to do so many installations a month or I'm sorry, a day, and we just haven't got  time to explain all the details about security.  And so we just, you know, hook it up, turn it on and we're out of there.  And so there's all kinds of people coughing out, you know, bandwidth.  And you know, these guys are complaining about not making any money selling pure bandwidth,  but they're giving it away in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I just saw this and this kind of bugged me a little bit.  I saw that the PodTech network, which is a podcast network, has just received five and  a half million dollars in series A funding from Venrock and US Venture Partners.  And I thought, wait a minute, there's a podcast network getting five and a half million dollars.  That's John Furrier's company.  Well, but yeah, explain what John Furrier does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, John's company is essentially, I guess it's fair to say podcast for hire.  So he's out there working with some of the big tech companies, helping them get their  message out through the podcast medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's effectively essentially these podcasts are ads.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now I understand why I got five and a half million dollars.  I don't feel so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't figured.  John's a friend and I still haven't figured it out.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five and a half million dollars because he had a good PowerPoint show and nobody else  has been asking for money.  Nobody's monetized this.  I mean, Leo, if you wanted to put a corporation together, which I've been telling you to do,  we could go get five and a half million dollars in a weekend.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then they'd want something from us.  So what?  As Doug Case.  They're going to want some anyway.  As Doug Case.  So then quit your bellyaching.  I'm not bellyaching.  I was just stunned.  As Doug Case so eloquently said a couple of podcasts ago, he said that there's always  the man somewhere.  There's always the man.  Hey, I heard an interesting thing about Web 2.0.  Apparently the folks at Yahoo are bellyaching a little bit about their acquisition of Flickr.  Flickr is turning out to be a bit of a millstone around their neck.  Really?  Well, Flickr has quite a few photos on its site.  It's very expensive for them to run Flickr.  Huge databases.  People upload their photos.  And the problem is they're not monetizing it.  The only way to monetize it is by selling prints and you can do that and by buying DVDs  or calendars.  But people aren't doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like the three billion dollars Yahoo threw into China for no good reason.  I mean, they do this.  They did it with broadcast.com and made Mark Cuban a billionaire.  What happened to that?  These guys at Yahoo, I have no idea what they're thinking or what they were thinking when they  bought Flickr.  What do they expect to get out of it?  It's not a monetizable system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It isn't really.  In fact, the numbers that I was told, I mean, how many photos do you think, how many orders  do you think they get a week from a Flickr customer?  Five.  Yeah, you're close.  These are all smart money people that have their own printers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't need to buy photos from Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's something like 10 million users and they get 80 orders a week.  8-0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, it's cost them a lot of money and there just doesn't look like there's any way to  make any money out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the whole point of that would be posting like AdSense type ads or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which they don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no ads on it.  Yeah, and Yahoo has a system to do that.  Sure.  Maybe they better do that.  You know, what Yahoo should do, they should take the whole key to Flickr that makes it  a Web 2.0 play.  There's nothing more than the tagging.  I mean, that's the thing that makes Flickr different.  And it also has a jazzy UI.  The API.  Yeah, it's cool.  But anyway, if they would, but those tags seem to me to be like a brain dead way to  do AdSense type ads using the Yahoo mechanism, which a lot of people, by the way, believe  Yahoo's AdSense system is better than Google's in terms of actually getting you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, why don't they just put AdSense on their site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be funny?  Why don't they just shoot themselves if they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, advertising by Google.  They can make a few hundred dollars a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they're lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's better than they're making now.  I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder what it costs to run that site.  It's got to cost a fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I use it all the time.  And because of all the different, the API and all the different ways you can use it,  not only are people using bandwidth by visiting the Flickr site, but the images from Flickr  are showing up everywhere.  I mean, when I post an image on my blog, it takes bandwidth from Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we are bloggers at dvorak.org slash blog.  That's plug number three, by the way.  I will refuse to do any more.  But anyway, we occasionally do a, you know, you'll do a search in Flickr on it using a  tag, you'll find some really good images there.  And you just put them on your blog.  And then you have a nice, you have nice art and who's paying for this bandwagon?  Yahoo.  Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo.  I wonder how many, what percentage of Flickr members actually did the $25 a year?  I pay for the pro account.  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause I wouldn't do it.  You just as a limit on how many photos you don't pay for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, you should go to my Flickr account and you go to, or just do a search on tech  TV.  Cause I uploaded about one third of all the tech TV photos I took when I was over there.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.  Now, did you tag them?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh well, so if I did a search in tags for tech TV, I'd be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll find the, you'll find the cache of photos.  But there's a bunch more that I seem to have on a CD somewhere.  I'm going to upload them shortly.  But there's a, there's a lot, you'll get a kick out of it cause there's a couple of you  in there and you know, it's a, it's not conclusive.  And I don't have the picture.  I did a picture of Patrick once and I blacked it, for anyone out there who wants to know  this.  Patrick Horton happens to be one of the most photogenic guys you'll ever run into.  You said this before.  If you take photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're thinking you're a stalker, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you, it's unbelievable.  But anyway, so I took this picture of Patrick and I, and I monochromed it and I pumped the  contrast and make it look like some sort of a high-end thing.  It's the point of the, it's a great photo.  It looks like, you know, this, it looks like a male model from the thirties or something.  I mean, it's just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this in your, your site here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Copy.  I feel so attractive now, John.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Patrick, like, battling.  I just ordered, I just ordered icons of everybody from Nitro Zac and Snaggy so that we all have  our own little icons of our heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, by the way, on this Web 2.0 stuff, you know, at some point, one of these  Web 2.0 companies is going to tank.  Somebody's going to shut down.  The whole thing will crash.  Well, yeah, that's what I wonder.  Somebody, if somebody decides to pull a blog, pull a plug on something like Flickr, suddenly  everybody panics and says, wait a minute, that's where all my photos are.  All my photos are there.  Exactly.  Or all my, all my mails on Gmail or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, I don't think that's going to happen.  For one thing, I don't think Gmail for sure.  But I don't think Yahoo at this point, this is like getting, you know, kind of having  the camel and the head in the tent.  They can't do that.  They would get so much ill will if they killed Flickr.  I don't know what they're going to do about it.  They're stuck.  They're stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  And what happens if it starts with not one of these companies that's been acquired yet,  but one that's got a lot of mind shares?  A backpacker.  Yeah.  And suddenly everybody says, you know, hey, these things aren't, you know, this isn't  a given.  There's no guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're not.  Yeah, this is, this will happen, but this isn't going to happen for a number of years.  I mean, this is what happened when we started the run up from 97 to about 2000.  It feels like that all over again, to be honest.  It is.  It's the exact same thing.  It's just got new names.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also this time it's like companies with like 10 people, including all of their developers  and marketing period, you know, people and founders that have these like, you know what  I mean?  It's like Flickr had, I think 10 people when Yahoo bought them.  So it wasn't looking like, you know, as long as you don't eyeball the bandwidth cost, it  doesn't look like a real expensive.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a cheap purchase until they started to pay for all of the storage and the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  473 million terabytes a day.  Son of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to know what kind of bandwidth they're using.  It's got to be horrendous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's expensive bandwidth too.  I'm sure that's all Akamai's.  Any other stories you guys are following that you think are worth covering?  I'm just looking through our list here.  I think we covered everything on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's the MS Re-Org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we cover that?  You mean Sanofsky taking over for...  We talked about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alcatel and Glucent finally going away.  I think Alcatel is buying them for $34 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Really?  That much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, some ridiculous amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wouldn't think they'd be worth that much.  Must have patents.  It must be the patents, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you know what it is.  I think the two companies together end up being about 34 billion after the... if they  merge.  It's like four bill labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there something about this time of year that there are relatively few announcements?  It seems like all the news this week is things are broken or things are late.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it?  There's nothing new and exciting coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think March has always been a slow month because...  I don't know, people are...  Especially after C-Bit where you have a whole bunch of people doing all this stuff at once  and you also have game developers and you have the Intel developers forums.  And now there's...  Everybody's pretty much said what they have to say for a while.  I think it's going to be another month before I get interesting news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm hoping...  I'm expecting, in fact, I won't be here, but I'm expecting to get an email from Apple  in the next couple of days because April 1st is their 30th anniversary of the company's  founding and that's a Saturday.  It's a week from...  It's this coming Saturday.  And there, of course, all the scuttlebutt is that Apple's going to have some big product  announcement either the Friday before or the Monday after.  So we'll keep an eye peeled for the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I got one kind of a thing here that would be worth mentioning for people out there  who like to fool around.  Because some months ago we talked about Rightly, which has since been bought out by Google,  I guess.  There's another one out there that Michael Robertson, the old MP3 guy...  Ajax Write?  Ajax Write.  Isn't that awesome?  Yeah, Ajax Write is a pretty nice little product.  So you go to www.ajaxwrite.com.  And it's like an online word processor that's pretty much like a religious...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have to sign up for it.  Right, you can just go on and snooze it.  And it gives you a really good idea of what modern web technology...  See, to me, this is what Web 2.0 is about, is what these new modern web technologies  can do in modern browsers is pretty much as good as a desktop application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And again, difficult to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Impossible to monetize.  In fact, they're not even trying.  They're not even asking you for an email address.  They're just giving up.  So this is Michael Robertson doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Michael Robertson.  He's going to send a note on it.  The monetizing is one thing, but the rightly people didn't have to monetize.  They sold it.  Well, that's the strategy.  I think everybody's realizing that.  A lot of strategy in the early days of the next bubble are all going to be M&A strategies,  you know, mergers and acquisitions.  And that's what you do.  You build the company and you hope somebody comes along and buys it because it becomes  part of this...  Because it's hit.  You know, make-buy decision and people just buy because it's already been made by someone  else and it's not going to be that expensive.  It's going to cost too much to do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How come...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  But like you look at rightly getting bought and Ajax getting coverage, why isn't anybody  paying attention to ThinkFree, which has been doing this forever?  I'll tell you one word, Java.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why.  See, the beauty of Ajax, right, is it's pretty much as good as ThinkFree Office or ThinkFree  Write anyway.  But there's no doubt.  I mean, it downloads instantly and it runs and there's, you know...  And I think Java right now is not in...  People are not excited about Java anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There certainly hasn't been anything new in the Java world for a while in terms of, you  know, good new apps that use the virtual machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's been superseded by PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Java's right.  Java like to epitomizes Web 1.0 if we're going to use this crazy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in 10 years we'll be saying whatever happened to Ajax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we will.  But probably not in 10 years, probably in about five.  It won't be that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or three.  Maybe tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty amazing.  Google's customizable homepage is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think live is really coming along.  I mean, you know I'm no huge Microsoft fan, but I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The search isn't too impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still MSN Search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the new Windows Live Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I haven't even looked at this.  Is there any reason I should?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Web 2.0 start page.  You know, my favorite is NetVibes, which is very much like live.  It shows you what you can do with Ajax.  The reason I like NetVibes, and live is adding more...  Actually adding some really interesting features that probably will supersede anything else  because it's got a big company behind it.  NetVibes is just a bunch of Frenchmen.  But the thing I like about NetVibes is it's a built-in news reader.  You can customize the desktop.  You can put almost anything on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the one you can swing, flip things all over the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just like Google's homepage.  You can drag stuff around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's personalized homepage, Windows Live, NetVibes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's quite a few proto-pages.  There's a ton of them.  I think live, though, is interesting.  Proto-page is the one I'm thinking of.  Yeah, proto-page is pretty amazing.  Live is interesting, though, because of Microsoft adding some real services to this that could  potentially be pretty powerful.  What kind of services?  You know, you've played with it more than I have, Patrick.  I just saw a story about the services in there.  I mean, they have all the obvious stuff, you know, photo galleries and mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're going to do a...  The mapping's pretty good.  The mapping actually may be better than Google's, actually.  Really?  It'll be interesting to watch them.  There's a lot of nifty features inside of the Google.  I'll forward you a link for the mapping stuff that's in there.  They do really good search.  They do pinpoints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have this widget thing so that you can put like a dictionary, NASA's image of the  day, that kind of stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  It's pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The gadget gallery.  It's pretty cool.  and all sorts of stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, the Windows Live Local is pretty cool.  Gadget gallery, I'm kind of back and forth on.  It's nice to have the dictionary in there, but it'll be interesting to watch when they  make it easy to customize them a little bit more.  So you always find like Google's personal homepage a little easier to add stuff to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more...  It's typical, a typical Google thing.  It's a little more stripped down.  I just opened the Safety Center on Live and it says, oops, we seem to be having a problem  with this feed.  Please try again later.  They can't even get...  Proto page is pretty funny looking.  Proto page is amazing, isn't it?  This thing is...  It's so festive.  You know, I think what really is a testament too is how good browsers have become, how  powerful a browser is now.  And it really, if I were Microsoft or Apple or any operating systems manufacturer, I'd  be a little worried.  Really, more and more the operating system is just a host for a good browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is if you are offline...  Well, that's right.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we just talked about with Flickr.  If they go away, all my pictures are gone too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Leo, what's your personal default homepage?  Netvibes.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I use Netvibes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about you, John?  Mine is dvorak.org slash home dot htm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you came so close to a fourth plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was no, a slash home dot htm.  No, you're talking about...  You wanted me to say Dvorak, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've actually done this for a while, the home dot htm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done that home dot htm page since about 1994.  It's still all text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just has a lot of links and it looks like 1994.  Although I see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  It's web point nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mine's actually a page on my laptop, on my computer.  Yeah, that's kind of what John does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John does that, I think, probably on his computers too.  He has a local page.  And that's what this came from, right, John?  This is originally your local page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's a local page.  And I tell people how to make it a local page.  And a lot of people have actually used it as their local page.  I don't have...  I mean, I look at the numbers.  I have about...  This is compared to the blog.  This is a low number thing because it's so old fashioned.  But I probably have about 2,500 or maybe 3,000 people that use it routinely.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about you, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your home page?  Usually whatever website I'm working on at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I sometimes will do that because if I have to go back to that page a lot, I'll  just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Generally, Google search or DLTV or extremetech.com.  That's the DL.TV for those of you who haven't been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're breaking up so that the plug that you just gave sounded like...  Let me substitute a plug.  I'll say it for you, DL.TV, which is where Cranky Geeks is as well now.  Have you done more than one show, John?  Yeah, I think we've done three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you still cranky?  Cranky Geeks has its own home page.  We're still cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CrankyGeeks.com, right?  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually the one guy who gets credit for being the most cranky, we should have  him on the Twitch show once in a while, is Sebastian Rupley.  I like Sebastian.  Yeah.  Yeah, he'd like to do the show.  We should have him as a backup guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's more than welcome.  I won't tell people what happened on Friday.  Well, I will tell people what happened on Friday.  We were scheduled to do this show live in the studio.  It's just one of those days everybody got busy or whatever, but in quick succession,  an hour or two before tape time, I got emails from everybody saying, can't make it.  So it was going to be me and Doug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Leo was not too pleased.  I wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was like, wait a minute.  We got to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't blame you.  I'd be irked too.  I mean, you have all these guys lined up.  You had like seven people lined up and none of them showed up, including myself.  I got two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, there were two confirmed and four potentials, three of whom were potential on  whether or not I would drive them up to Courtney Deere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what happened.  They were all looking for a ride from Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I was a wreck and I didn't trust driving up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay.  It's okay.  As a result though, I mean, I want, look, nobody's making any money on this yet.  I'm hoping we will at some point, but since we're all volunteering our time, I don't want  to take more time than we need to.  So we'll probably keep doing this via Skype for a while and do occasional live ones.  If you want to see John or Patrick, there's plenty of ways you can see them on DLTV and  Cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can also go to the blogs.  But the other thing we might want to, I think we need to get, although you did one when  I was gone, I think getting back into one of these studio audience situations about  once every couple of months, I think would be a really good idea.  I think people will do that.  I think people enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And we, Doug said this, we were one of the few podcasts that actually did a live show.  And that is certainly something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we've done quite a few of them, but you know, it might be interesting.  Next time there's like a bloggers conference or something, we can get like, you know, Daniel  wanted to get your Robert Scoble in.  Right.  Right.  You know, he would be kind of interesting to start with a large group.  Yeah, we can start doing some of that.  And we can have more people too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little update on our web redesign.  It's progressing along very well.  I want to thank the folks at Lullabot.  What happened is we, I went to Amber MacArthur and her team at Archetype and they did a beautiful  design for me, but because we use Drupal, which is a content management system on twit.tv,  it then had to be kind of engineered.  You know, the backend had to be done.  And I went to Lullabot, which is just a fantastic group of people, L-U-L-L-A-B-O-T dot com.  And the reason I'm giving them a big plug is because we ran out of money.  We couldn't pay them.  And I said, look, you know, guys, we appreciate it.  We'll just have to get back to you in a few months.  And they're doing it pro bono right now.  So I thank you very much, Lullabot.  Drupal design or any work of any kind, Jeff Robbins, Matt Westgate and Ted Serbinski,  Ted's really working hard on this and it's looking.  How do you like Drupal, by the way?  Love it.  I hate it.  You hate it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why do you dislike it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Drupal's sort of like a religion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It is very much a cult and I'm in the cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you get developers and you ask them to do something and the first thing they  say is, well, how can we Drupalize your idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you kind of know, but that's true with every content management system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't think that's true.  Doug, have you played with Joomla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  I played with it a little bit, but I don't have an opinion on it one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joomla, I play with the, I have the earlier version, Mambo.  And I.  Mambo, I know, yeah.  Mambo is the same thing.  But I totally hate Mambo.  I'll be honest with you.  Yeah, I can see why, because it's very difficult to get into.  But once you're into it, it's extremely powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing is I think Drupal's code base is a little bit, a lot cleaner than anything  else out there.  It's well written code and it has a lot more modules.  It seems very well supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the old, that's the old sweet versus best of breed argument.  And when we got into it for the Conversations Network, we found out right away that Drupal  was able to solve 20% of our problems and the 80% that was hard, we had to do ourselves  anyway.  Yeah, that might be.  So what are you using?  It's all handwritten.  It's all PHP.  But it's not, it's not important that it's PHP.  Most important is that it's not using anybody's canned code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was Drupal not able to do that you needed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it couldn't handle podcasts.  It couldn't handle audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It handles podcasts very well now, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have a good system for handling large objects in general.  So the actual handling of the mp3 files.  Also, we have a system where we do show assembly every night.  Every night we rebuild over thousands of programs in our archives.  You do a lot of stuff.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, Doug, what's your URL?  ITConversations.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, ITConversations.com is probably the best place to find this.  And that, oh, I should also plug the ConversationsNetwork.org.  That's the other one, ConversationsNetwork.org.  But that's, you know, we had to do things that Drupal just wasn't even close to.  And we got a whole bunch of Drupal developers in.  We decided to make an open source project.  We brought in volunteers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is, what's the name of this open source project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's ConversationsNetwork.org.  It was the content management system.  But we killed it.  We killed it because what happened is the Drupal people got all excited about it and  tried to shoehorn it into the Drupal architecture and it just made it incredibly cumbersome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well we'll see.  You know, one of the things Lullabot is doing, one of the reasons I'm excited about Lullabot  is what we're hoping to do.  You know, there's a Drupal distribution right now for nonprofits called Civic Space.  Very good.  It's very good.  And it makes it very easy for a nonprofit to kind of get a very nice looking website  up quickly with all the features they want.  And I'd like to do that for podcasting.  And so one of the things I've talked about with Lullabot is maybe taking the work that  they do for us and then generalizing it and giving it away as Civic Space has given away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's good for you.  It wasn't good for us because we're all about that content management system.  We're all about producing 60 podcasts a week.  You do a huge amount.  Yeah, I mean I only need to manage 10 or 20 podcasts a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't need to do anything like that.  I'm easily 10 or 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  But anyway, we're talking about designers, a special hello to Dorothy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and that's very important.  I really want to mention that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Our friend Dorothy Amomoto, who's in the hospital trying to recover from cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She is the woman who did the incredible twit logo, the little twit guy.  And it was quite sudden.  She went in for a routine checkup, had blood work done and they found something.  So yeah, Dorothy, I know she's listening and our thoughts are with you, our prayers are  with you and get better soon.  We're sending her a DVD player.  With all sorts of podcasts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I've got the box right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, great.  What did you choose?  Hang on.  Let me see it.  We wanted to get one that would play MP3s and Divics as well so that we could send her.  I didn't even open the box.  It's a Phillips something.  So will it do, it does MP3s, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does MP3s, it does Divics, it does all the different formats and there aren't that  many that do them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fantastic.  Good.  So our thoughts are with you, Dorothy.  Get better.  We also thank the folks at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for the podcast and broadcasting  us on our AOL Radio channel and the podcast channel at AOL.com slash podcasting.  John's available of course at dvorak.org slash blog and crankygeeks.com.  You can do a crankygeeks blog, you should, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Crankygeeks is a blog.  It's a video blog.  It's a video blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  And of course, DL.TV for Patrick's fantastic show.  By the way, Prager and Kevin are here, but I understand that Control Alt Chicken has  released its first episode.  Really?  Yeah.  That's Alex Albrecht's cooking show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, has anybody seen that, or know the story behind that Jack Black movie that's  or that-  Nacho, Nacho Libre?  No, that thing with the-  He's a wrestler.  With the motorcycle.  It's like a movie you can, or it's like a half hour sitcom and it's like, that we kind  of grab from YouTube.  Huh.  There's a lot of Jack Black stuff.  It's actually quite funny, but it's like, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you never know with Jack.  He's always got these projects going on.  He's buddies with Liam Lynch we've had on the screensavers.  What's the name of his band?  Tenacious D. He's got a lot of wacky things going on and he's got a new movie out and  he's got a podcast based around the movie.  Interesting, I don't know.  We have the founder of YouTube, one of the founders of YouTube on Inside the Net coming  up on Tuesday.  Interesting interview.  There's an example of a Web 2.0 company that just took off overnight.  Amazing.  Can you imagine their bandwidth, Bill?  That'd be pretty scary.  Yeah, it would be.  Chicken Cordon Bleu, by the way, is the recipe for this first edition of Control Halt Chicken.  I haven't watched it, but I can't imagine.  Alex Alvareck's cooking show.  That'll be fun.  It should be interesting.  Look at the formats they put it out in.  H.264, Theora, WMV, Xvid, M4V.  How many different formats do you put out DLTV in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that many.  Jeez.  Well, what's cool, though, is what the Rev3 guys have done is they have automated that  whole process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah.  I was going to say, they must have some magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ron their tech genius is basically scripted together, a bunch of boxes off of Linux that  allows them to move all that around.  It's not quite that clean, but it's awfully close, is my understanding.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This Week in Tech.  All right, guys.  Well, it's been a pleasure.  Thank you for joining us for another edition of This Week in Tech.  We'll be back next week.  I'm hoping Microsoft will join us and give us the inside dirt.  Now we definitely will.  Now we'll never hear from them again.  Have a great week, guys.  Another tweet is in the dam.
