Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 304.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a problem.  You know what?  Now I can finally sue Twitter because of Siri.  We predate Twitter.  And now I can say Siri's confused, so this must be a problem.

Start time: 304.74
End time: 309.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't know what the command is.  I tried get directions twit, and didn't like that either.

Start time: 309.92
End time: 323.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Navigate to where the hell am I?  Siri's weird that way because with the Android phones, there's a rigid syntax that you're  supposed to use.  But Siri, they want you to kind of just try stuff until it works.  But then you don't know.

Start time: 323.52
End time: 328.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then I did say Siri, can you get me there?  And it said, yes, Liz.  And that was nice.  I said it didn't get me there.

Start time: 328.78
End time: 367.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It made you feel better.  Lies.  Somebody called the radio show today and asked me if there was a way to get, A, Siri, not  to have a female voice.  I said, yeah, you can use a British or the Canadian voice.  That's male.  And B, if I could get it to say profanity.  She said my husband wants an iPhone, but unless he can swear in his text messages, he doesn't  want it.  What kind of a guy is this?  So I looked it up.  And of course, Gizmodo has an article on how to make Siri swear.  Oh, excellent.  So one way is to change your name to, you know, Mother Fletcher Chickenhead.  And it will say that.

Start time: 367.82
End time: 382.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or your majesty.  Yeah.  So it just says Liz.  I'm disappointed.  Well, I guess it logged into my Apple account.  Oh, you see, you gotta quickly change it while you can.  I did the big upgrade today from four to five.  So today you did it?  So I'd never had Siri before.  Yeah.

Start time: 382.85
End time: 382.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 383.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 388.52
End time: 393.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got a case.  I can't believe you found a case.  I did.  I got a case.  I was bragging about not scratching it already.

Start time: 394.05
End time: 418.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  So Apple's done something I think is close to unprecedented.  There may be another case of Apple apologizing.  But of course, anybody who's following tech news knows that the Apple Maps have disappointed  some.  Somebody sent me an email.  I had been, I said last week that Apple Maps worked well in China.  And I was saying that from an article that said it surprisingly works well because they  got better data.  And then somebody sent me an article said, well, I live in Chongqing and it's terrible.

Start time: 418.56
End time: 420.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it depends on the data.  Yeah, it's data.

Start time: 421.40
End time: 422.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on the source of the bogus information.

Start time: 423.10
End time: 442.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the other issue, of course, is that Apple has to match information from disparate sources.  So Google has to help Tom Tom, other data sources, it has to get it all together.  And Google's got a lot of experience doing this.  Does anybody remember, was Google Maps this bad when it came out?  No.  No.  It was good out of the box.

Start time: 443.51
End time: 448.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They also invested early on in companies like the satellite imagery companies as well.  And so did Apple.

Start time: 448.86
End time: 455.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple bought three mapping companies a couple of years ago.  Google Maps was on the web before it was on phones.  So it had a little more heritage.

Start time: 456.35
End time: 460.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think people were using it for turn by turn directions when the first  day it came out.

Start time: 461.91
End time: 474.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, Tim Cook writes on the Apple website, to our customers at Apple, we strive to make  I should get the Tim Cook puppet.  Where is it?  I got to get Brian Hogg on the line.  He made one for us for the.  Oh, you didn't get it yet.

Start time: 475.73
End time: 491.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he has it.  He sent over the templates for us to make our own.  Oh, we could print our own?  Yeah.  It'll just let's just hold the show for a few hours.  Could you just print some Tim Cook puppets?  Right.  Get a sewing machine.  And then we'll come back with this funny joke.  He sent us a template.  Yeah, he emailed it over.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so we can make our own.

Start time: 492.16
End time: 546.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should put that on the web.  That's great.  At Apple, we strive to make world class products that deliver the best experience, blah, blah,  blah.  With the launch of our new maps last week, we fell short on this commitment.  We're extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers.  We're doing everything we can to make maps better, which apparently involves having you  fix it.  There are over a hundred million iOS devices using the new Apple Maps with more and more  joining us every day.  In just over a week, iOS users have searched for half a billion locations.  He doesn't say whether they found them.  The more our customers use our maps, the better it will get.  And we greatly appreciate the feedback we've received from you.  And a number of people have said it's not our job to fix Apple's bad maps, but it will  get better, right, with use.  That's how Google got their maps in the shape they did now.

Start time: 546.94
End time: 548.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The paragraph, though, is where they actually mention competitors.

Start time: 549.30
End time: 570.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The next paragraph is the one that I think is unprecedented.  Maybe Apple's apologized before, but they never said this.  While we're improving maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the app store  like Bing, MapQuest, Bing's Microsoft, MapQuest is Yahoo, or Waze, or...  AOL.  AOL owns Waze?  No, MapQuest.

Start time: 570.84
End time: 572.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, AOL owns, that's right, not Yahoo.

Start time: 573.53
End time: 582.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AOL owns MapQuest, right.  Thank you.  Or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen.

Start time: 585.37
End time: 587.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty bad.  That's not a substitute.  Oh, my.

Start time: 588.10
End time: 617.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also kind of a shock to say, go to our competitors.  I mean, go use Google.  We're sorry.  There is an implication here that we wanted to provide our customers with better maps,  including features like turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, flyover, and vector-based maps.  This kind of confirms the rumor.  Maybe it was All Things D that broke this rumor that Google had refused Apple the right to do turn-by-turn directions.  And that's ultimately what it is.

Start time: 617.84
End time: 628.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's apparently in the terms of service for access to their map data.  So if you want access to Google's map data and you're not Google, you can't provide turn-by-turn,  which is built into every Android device out there.

Start time: 629.84
End time: 635.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you could make a deal because Motion X GPS uses Google Maps and has turn-by-turn.  So you could make a deal.  A paid app.

Start time: 636.04
End time: 646.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I think the history of this is for a long time, people paid a bunch of money to put garments in their car.  Right.  And then...  And tom-toms.  And tom-toms.  And Magellan.

Start time: 647.35
End time: 647.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Havagon.

Start time: 648.06
End time: 686.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People make bulky devices that you put in your car that are specific to this purpose, and you pay money for them.  Then one of the first Apple...  Like I remember when they demoed, when they first launched their app platform was going to be...  Was it tom-tom made an app that was like $99?  It was $100.  Turn-by-turn directions.  That's right.  And then Google was like, well, we want to include this in our devices, but they were going to charge them like $40 per app user.  So Google put, instead of paying someone else to do that, they put a massive investment into building this themselves.  Ah.  So they finished building it themselves, and they're giving it away for free.  And then Apple was like, oh, we also want it for free.  And Google was like, hey, we paid for this.

Start time: 686.92
End time: 703.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about this for an idea?  They got over $100 billion in the bank.  Why don't they buy tom-tom, garment, and Magellan, and these other guys, and just incorporate the things?  By the way, after they do that, you could fire the guy who gave them that $40 deal, or the $100 deal.  Just go track him down and fire him.

Start time: 703.84
End time: 712.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are buying tom-toms' data.  In fact, tom-toms...  Why don't they just buy tom-toms?  Tom-toms said very quickly, it's not our fault, because people use our tom-tom app happily.  It's not our fault.

Start time: 712.84
End time: 713.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so what's the difference?

Start time: 713.84
End time: 826.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I think it's the data mismatch, the ability to take data from various sources, merge it together in a useful map.  There was a computer scientist in Ontario, Canada, who scraped the Apple Maps and did a little calculation on how accurate.  It's hard.  It's all anecdotal, right?  Well, it worked fine.  You got here.  It worked fine for me.  Well, it didn't work fine for me.  So here's some actual numbers.  His name is Jason Matheson.  He wrote code to determine how accurate the maps are in Ontario.  That's probably the biggest, most important province in Canada.  Not an insignificant one.  It's where Toronto is.  It's where Ottawa is.  It's where the capital is.  I would vouch for BC.  Alright, alright, alright.  So we'll do it in BC, but for now, we've got Ontario.  2028 cities and towns, okay?  688, not even on the map.  551, wrong.  Clearly wrong.  Wrong country.  Wrong country.  Now that's a problem.  That's a problem.  Street names are similar to town names, etc.  389, close, but not good enough.  For instance, the turn-by-turn might send you off a bridge, but you'd get rescued close to where you want to be.  Only 400 out of the 2028 cities are right.  That's a number that really kind of quantifies this, right?  Yeah.  One out of five.  So John Pachowski writing, as I thought, for All Things D, said that the talks crashed over voice-guided directions.  It's huge.  That makes sense, that Apple said, well, we need them, and if Google's not going to give them, we've got to do it some way or another.  Now, you said something about them buying one of these companies.  Somebody in the chat.  Nokia bought NavTech, and Ericsson bought TeleNav, or it might be vice versa.  Nokia's put $9 billion into Maps, and it has good maps as a result.

Start time: 827.64
End time: 836.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who else is driving vehicles around with masks on them, photographing every street in the United States and around the world, underwater, air views?  And buildings.

Start time: 837.06
End time: 841.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've even understood that this building here that we sit in.  3,500 of the best engineers in the world just on maps at Google.

Start time: 843.94
End time: 844.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So good luck competing against that.

Start time: 844.84
End time: 866.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, so for the person in the chat room who said that Garmin wouldn't sell, Garmin has no choice.  It's a publicly traded company.  They could have taken a hostile takeover.  No, they could do an offering and buy the company's enterprise value, which is the real value, is $6.7 billion.  Market cap at $8.1, they could probably buy it for $10 billion.  So let me ask a question.  What would be a problem?

Start time: 866.90
End time: 871.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we making too big a deal out of this?  How important is this really?  We're certainly spending a lot of time on it.

Start time: 872.44
End time: 891.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think maps are coming to be one of the most important things that you can do on a phone, right?  You know, now you can get yourself around the world holding something in your hand and you depend on it.  So once you're depending on something and someone goes in to replace an app that works with an app that doesn't,  then I think that is a bad mistake on Apple's part.

Start time: 892.14
End time: 906.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story goes that Steve Jobs, the original iPhone didn't even have maps that two weeks before the announcement of the iPhone,  Jobs said, we need something that will show off the touch.  What about a maps app?  And they hurriedly negotiated a deal with Google to get maps in there.

Start time: 906.84
End time: 909.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the reality is though maps are now one of the most important things on your phone.

Start time: 910.16
End time: 919.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what this is telling is that nobody at the time realized how important location was going to be and how important mobile was going to be.  I think Apple knew how important mobile was going to be.  They committed to the iPhone.

Start time: 919.84
End time: 961.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  Everybody for the last decade before the iPhone even came out,  were ranting about how mobile is going to take over the world, all the Internet, traffic is going to be over mobile.  You've heard this.  You're older than me.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, right.  And so it went on and on and on forever.  And I'm always like, well, you know, I'll wait and see.  Of course, it finally did.  And now the maps thing shows up.  And as soon as people saw how handy it was, especially you didn't have to have a garment or a tom tom, you could use these little phones,  especially with the turn by turn.  It should have been a you know, right at that point, you should have just gone all in on that.  That's why I think Apple did make a mistake here.  They didn't recognize the importance of.  I think they knew, but they didn't.  Maybe they thought this was good enough.

Start time: 962.02
End time: 979.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, some people are blaming Scott Forstall.  Scott Forstall is the guy who created iOS.  He runs iOS for Apple.  And is this the guy who says he's going to take over the company?  Apparently, he's quite.  I didn't know this.  The story is he's quite ambitious.

Start time: 979.92
End time: 982.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he came out in one of the big publications.  I'm going to take over.

Start time: 982.90
End time: 1044.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he came from Next.  So he's been he was with Jobs, you know, originally.  And he he worked on Snow Leopard, I think Philip Elmer DeWitt, who is really a good observer of Apple's been covering this beat for a long time,  writes now for Forbes, asks the question, does Apple have a Scott Forstall problem?  And I think the issue is even John Louis Gasse says Forstall's demo was flawless.  2D and 3D maps, turn by turn navigation, spectacular flyovers, but not a word from the stage from Scott about apps limitations.  No self-deprecating wink, no admission that IOS apps is an infant that needs to learn to crawl before walking, running and lapping the front runner.  Instead, we're told and this is the quote, the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever.  Would Apple be off the hook if they hadn't said that?  No, they still would.  They still replaced a working service with a nonworking service.  It's the action.

I mean, frankly, I wouldn't go to the events anyway.  In fact, it's very possible.  No, it's very possible that one of the reasons Apple doesn't invite me is that I stopped going to events even after invitations because it's easier for us to cover it here.  If I'm in the event, we can't actually cover them.  So we do what we do.  What we've been doing for the last four years is covering the events from here live.  So are you blacklisted or not?

So that's called blacklist.  I think we might be blacklisted.  The common thinking is that it was because during the original iPad announcement, I took my laptop, turned it around and faced it to the screen and streamed the announcement to our network and garnering the largest audience we've ever had on the network.

If there's a knock on four stall, I'm going to be the blacklist.  For example, if there's a knock on four stall, it's that he wears his ambition in plainer view than the typical Apple executive.  This is what you were saying, John.  Yes.  He blatantly accumulated influence in recent years, including it is whispered when Jobs was on medical leave.  According to an unflattering profile in Bloomberg Businessweek last year,  four stall had such a fraught relationship with other members of the executive team,  including Johnny Ive and Bob Mansfield, that they avoided meetings with him unless Tim Cook was there.  To moderate.  That's not healthy.  So true.  So should Scott four stall take the fall for the maps?  Oh, why not?

Didn't have turn by turn directions.  Turn by turn is a big deal.  You can't just talk to it and it just simply gets you there.  It didn't have street view.  It was like the weird things where you want to get directions from where you are.  You have to like go to your bookmarks to go find it.  There was stupid stuff about it, but that was Google data made into an app by Apple engineers.  It was an Apple app.  This was not a Google app that was replaced by an Apple app.  This is an Apple app with Google data replaced by an Apple app with Apple data.

Transcript:  In June, they said in WWDC.  But even before then we knew it.  Everybody in the press knew it because Apple, remember when there was the debacle about Apple  storing a database connecting Wi-Fi access spots with your location.  Remember that?  It was on your phone.  It was publicly accessible.  Totally.  We could all download the data set.  In their apology then they said, well, we're collecting this data for traffic.  We want to have traffic information.  So it was clear Apple was planning something.  They were acquiring companies.  They acquired three mapping companies.  So it's I don't believe Google when they say we didn't know.  It's a good time to be a cryptographer.  We were stunned.  By the way, somebody's pointed out.  I think this is probably not that important.  But if you look at the icon, the new Apple Maps icon, it's of one infinite loop.  It's very similar to the old one.  You probably can't see that.  But there's circle.  There's one infinite loop.  And you drive down the street right in front.  And it actually takes you onto the freeway overpass and then says jump off onto the freeway.

It was some woman talking to her friend, yacking away.  And the cockroach was headed toward her.  And so nobody says anything.

And he says that if you compare Google Maps to Apple Maps in China, this is Google Maps  very sparse, Apple Maps, lots of information.  And now he says, oh, I was wrong, not using AutoNavv.  Oh, well, he still says it's better.  Well, that went off the cliff.  It did.  Now I didn't read the updates.  People are taking me to task for saying iOS 6 Maps is better than the previous maps.

Google says we don't blur based on government request.  Here's a good example.  Well, they blur personal private property.  This is Mina Mito-Rashima in Japan.  You asked them to.  They'll do it for personal property.  They say we don't do it for government request.  But their data, wherever it's coming from, apparently is this is Aberdeen Proving Grounds  in Maryland.

So they just released their first app on Thursday.  It's Android only, but it looks really neat.  It's called Field Trip.  And the idea is as you're going around the world, ideally in a place you haven't been  much before, you get push notifications saying, hey, this statue is of so and so, or hey,  did you know this restaurant is great, or whatever it is.

We go to meeting, you start the meeting on your Mac or your PC, but you can attend a  meeting on a Mac, PC, laptop, iPad, iPhone, Android device.  In fact, if you've got an iPad, it's a great way to meet with people because the HD faces  that's built in now let's get video from the camera on your desktop, your laptop or your  iPad and you can participate in these meetings.  And face to face is really so important, I think, as a way to get to know somebody.  Oh, you can turn off them.  Yeah, thank you.  We don't need the fine music.  See, she's going to join a meeting on her iPhone there.  But I love it when you got the iPad because you can actually see the other person, body  language, facial expressions, when you're pitching, when you're selling, when you're  training, when you're meeting with somebody, your colleagues across the country.

These earpods, even these new earbuds, which are better on the iPhone, are still crap.  They're listening too loud.  And MP3s are so compressed, you're losing all of the juice.  Fact.  Yes.

Start time: 2377.28
End time: 2390.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are much better compressed audio formats.  If you've never listened to lossless audio, do it.  If you still have your hearing, protect it.  So invest in better earbuds.  They'll last a long time and you can protect your hearing in a loud environment.  So you might be interested in this.  Totally.  This Pono or Pono or whatever it is.

End time: 2449.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't either.  There's a bunch of foo foo.  Give me lossless audio and a good output.  You know what Flea said?  There's a lot of name dropping going on here.  Every musician should have their hearing tested so you can know where they're at in life.  He may be deaf as a dog.  He's one of my DJ friends.  You've got to scream at him.  And they're like, what?

End time: 2491.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flea said, it's not like some vague thing that you need dog's ears to hear, he said.  It's a drastic difference.  You're wearing appropriate ear protection.  I am wearing ultimate ears in ear and they're turned down a little bit low and all that.  Pono's preservation of the fuller analog sound already has, this is according to Rolling  Stone magazine, the ear of the big three record labels, Warner Music Group, Universal Music  Group and Sony, all will be converting their titles to Pono form.  Actually Warner Music Group has converted 8,000 album titles to 192 kHz 24 bit sound.  That's the improvement then.  That's huge.

Start time: 2492.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This will be the equivalent of the digital reference copy.  It should be a lot better.  Yeah, it should be the best audio you can possibly hear at this date.  It should also approach the quality of what we've been having with DVDA and SACD, although  this might even be a little better.  It's nice to see somebody doing that though, but as a downloadable file format, yeah, that  is new and different.  It's going to be giant though, isn't it?

Start time: 2533.31
End time: 2535.98

Start time: 2559.14
End time: 2576.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not an audiophile at all, but I do think that this is a personal passion of Neil Young.  He came and spoke at one of our conferences earlier this year and he could not shut up  about how terrible audio is and how he and Steve Jobs used to sit around and listen to  records and it was so wonderful and it's terrible how we don't have that experience anymore.

Transcript:  You can get a similar experience nowadays with movies.  If you compare a DVD soundtrack, especially older DVD titles and compared to the latest  Blue Rear releases with lossless audio, it's phenomenal, especially if they've got new  productions that are well captured and recorded in the first place.

Transcript:  They're using effectively zip compression.  That's why you get the 2 to 1 ratio.  I mean, you can't compress a whole lot.  But you know what?  Hard drive space is cheap.  Flash RAM is cheap.  At this point, might as well make those file sizes bigger.  This is the Pono player, as Neil Young showed David Letterman.

You don't want to type, type, type, type, type, get up, have a cup of coffee, and it's  gone and your backup's now a week old.  No, you want to have it backed up right now so you can get back to work.  That's what Carbonite does.  Whenever you're online, it's backing up automatically, continuously, uses SSL so you can use it anywhere,  including kind of a sketch open Wi-Fi access spot, any coffee shop, any hotel.  It's completely secure.  In fact, there's even trust no one encryption you can use with carbonite.com.  If you decide, only you have the key if you decide you really want to protect yourself  and your privacy.  And all of this, Mac or PC, less than five bucks a month.  $59 a year per computer.  That is a great deal.  You can even get your data anytime.  You can log on.  It's cloud storage.  You can log on to your Carbonite account on any computer.  They have free smartphone apps, free tablet apps, and there's your stuff.  They do have home office, small business, and other plans.  You can take a look at those.  But no matter what, if you want to try it for free, just go to carbonite.com and use  our offer code TWIT.  And you can try it without a credit card free for two weeks.  I do encourage you to do that because it, of course, depends upon your bandwidth.  So you have to have a sufficient upstream bandwidth and all of that.  But try it.  It's very polite.  It doesn't get in the way.  It doesn't use up your bandwidth if it sees you're busy or the internet is busy.  It just backs down and only backs up when you're not busy.  I think you're going to really like this.  If you decide to buy it, use TWIT again as the offer code and you'll get two months free,  14 months for the price of 12.  Makes it an even better deal.  You got to back it up, please.  You got to back it up to get it back so do it right with Carbonite.  I had a call on the radio show two weeks ago.  A guy was sailing on Catalina Island and his laptop fell overboard.  He said everything was on the laptop.  Thank God I had Carbonite because I didn't lose my data.  But somewhere at the bottom of the ocean, in Catalina Island, there's his laptop.  What are you doing these days, Robert Heron?  Did you see this story about Japanese television companies?

Transcript:  If you look at all of the major HDTV manufacturers for the last few years, there are very few  of them that actually make a profit on television.  I was shocked to hear that.  I can think of one, one company and their profit margin was less than 2%.  That's not a very profitable industry.  If you look at how pricing goes in the retail channels, there is no profit to be had for  the people selling the TVs either.  You have companies like, take Best Buy for example, they're on the ropes.  Markets are so thin, nobody's making money on this.  Even with the extreme integration for some companies, like take Samsung in particular,  or Sharp, they're making the chips, the panels, every stinking part that goes into it, and  yet they're barely turning a profit.

Transcript:  To my knowledge, most of the TV manufacturers haven't made a profit in about five to seven  years.  Holy cow.  This isn't measured in the billions.  A lot of them are.  It's the other companies, the other products that they have in their line.  Mobile displays tend to pay for the big screens that we all love.  Selling lots of tiny displays at an extreme profit works out a lot better for them.  In the case of Sharp, they're also banking on the fact that their solar technology, which  is manufactured very similar to how LCD panels are manufactured, they're number one just  about in the world.  I can't think of a better company in terms of technology for solar panels.  That could be their saving grace going forward.  They have some of the best facilities in the world to make thin film transistors that go  into LCD screens and the same tech that goes into solar panels as well.  They need that $4 billion plus loan right now just to float them along until hopefully  the market and everything turns around for them.  It's kind of an amazing number.

It's not cheap to do and the last few years have just been difficult for all of these  folks.  Sony apparently is looking at medical technology.  Anywhere you can basically get a display and charge a premium for it and in those markets  too.  It's a lot easier to charge more in business to business transactions than it would be  to sell to the consumers who spend all their time looking for the best deal to begin with.

Transcript:  That's really been cool.  Did you know that your site is automatically mobilized?  They use responsive designs, so you don't even have to worry about it.  When you put images on there, it automatically generates seven versions, one for each size,  so that even from the smallest to the biggest screen, you'll be able to...  You'll get exactly...  Your people get exactly the same site.  They'll know what they're going to get.  Did you know that?  Yeah.  It's an amazing thing.  It's astonishing, actually.  You know, and Squarespace, I like the confidence of a company that says, just try it for free.  I don't want a credit card.  I don't want any personal information.  Just go to squarespace.com, click the Try It Free button.  You got to give them an email address so you can recover your password, your name of your  site and a password.  And that's it.  And now for two weeks, you can use everything on the Squarespace site.  You could try the responsive designs, the 50-plus designer templates.  The stats are great.  I mean, amazing stats.  All the import from existing blog sites like Blogger and TypePad and WordPress, but you  can also export out so you're never trapped.  Google Maps integration.  You don't have to use that crappy Apple Maps.  Use the Google Maps integration.  It's just beautiful.  I want you to try it free right now.  You don't even use the offer code.  Just go to Squarespace and give it a try.  If you decide you want to buy, I'll tell you why you want our offer code because we're going  to save you 10% off your first purchase.  Now if you go to the pricing and take a look, they have monthly and also annual.  You'll get a bit more bang for your buck on the annual plan because you're going to get  10% off of that, right?  The annual plans include something very nice, a custom domain.  If you've got a .com, .org, .net, .biz, or .info name in mind, you haven't registered  it yet, they'll register you for it and hook it up to the Squarespace sites for free.  Like noagendashow.com, boom, it just goes there.  How's it going?  Is it still refreshing?  Have we killed the site?  No, we can't kill it.  Can't kill it.  It is, look at that, snappy.  You know why?  We don't even know it, but the guys at Squarespace are flipping switches to put more bandwidth.  More bandwidth!  We need more bandwidth!  Somebody's hitting the Dvorak site, turn on the bandwidth!  The engineers, they put more coal in the furnace, the turbines spin up.  Hamsters.  And it's just amazing, they never go down.  $16 a month and look what you get, unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth.  I don't know anybody that does this.  Good storage, you can have as many contributors as you want, so it's great for a professional  magazine or whatever.  And all of that for $16 a month when you buy the annual plan.  They also have an $8 a month plan.  But you're going to get 10% off that first purchase no matter what you buy.  If you use the offer code TWIT9, that's all I ask is that if you decide to buy TWIT9,  but do do the free site.  And we asked them, and we said, do you mind that everybody's starting sites for one off,  like I'm having a party next week, I'm just going to do a Squarespace.  And they said, no, we don't care, it's fine.  Everybody start a site.  We've got more bandwidth.  Use it up.  Squarespace.com.  Give it a try today.  I know you're going to like it.  If John used it for no agenda show, you know it's good.  Because John is a wizard web designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the story, I think he just misses the whole point.  That's what I'm thinking.  Again, Philip Elmer DeWitt here.  Well, this is the same article I'm thinking about.

Start time: 5751.30
End time: 5759.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says Apple, well, actually, he refers back to a very interesting article by Holman Jenkins.

Start time: 5760.32
End time: 5823.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the one I was bouncing off of.  This article by Jenkins, he goes on and on about kind of missing the point.  Well, God, I thought it was a very powerful article.  Powerful article.  What he claims, it seems to me, is that Apple is going to lose it because the iTunes model  is not going to work with TV, and they're not going to do the deals, the content deals,  and the video business is not like the music business.  He says this in there.  It's not like the music business that's failing.  I'm thinking this is not what Apple TV is about.  It's not about selling content.  It's about bringing out, using the expensive design team that Apple has, world class, by  the way, considered one of the best industrial design teams in the world, in any company.  Just bring out a nice looking TV, put it in the Apple store, because the whole deal right  now is retail stores.  Apple needs to have another product to sell.  Just have it in there.  Instead of buying your TV from Costco, you go to Apple's store and you buy a really nice  LCD, and that's it.  This conjecture about iTunes is nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would be the point of Apple making a TV if they were just making a TV?  Because they're a hardware company.  They're a hardware company.  It would be better.  They would have integrated Apple TV within it.  Isn't that the point of making something new?

Start time: 5837.38

Transcript:  Android-based TVs.  Well, there's Google TV and LG does that already.  You can put a stick now into just about any HDMI port.  An MHL stick.  You don't even need that.  It'll work.  It'll turn any TV with an HDMI port.  You don't have to have MHL?  No.  And then you can run Android apps.  It will run.  It's a full Android computer on a stick that can be powered off the 5 volts coming from  an HDMI port.  Wow.  And there's about 10 people currently making these products because it's like, oh, that's  a great idea.  Because then you can just slip, have the wireless built into the stick, the networking, everything,  have a nice 4.1 experience, plug that into any TV and add that desktop right there.

End time: 5952.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's HDMI.  It's port agnostic.  You could have, it could be over what looks like a USB connector.  So on one end you could have USB to HDMI and the MHL is the transport link between them.  It really has nothing to do with the port itself.

Start time: 5953.00

I basically just invested in all.  They're like $70 products that are coming down the line right now.  As soon as one of these appeared, it seemed like everyone jumped on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm wondering why somebody didn't do this sooner.  So now you've got everyone else jumping on it.  But it was bringing me back to the point that if you're going to have Android TVs, that's  kind of a more Wild West environment for software and applications.  And iOS, the one thing it does well is I'll hand iOS to my mom and you know what?  I feel fairly safe giving her that environment to play in.  There's not a lot that she can totally torch a system with.

Start time: 6091.18

Start time: 6097.28
End time: 6114.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be instantly attacked.  You have to assume that's going to happen.  That's not a good idea.  Well no, but hopefully the operating system has some built-in good defenses.  You can protect your Android device nowadays with applications or if you don't open it  up to rooting and all the other good stuff, you're saving yourself some potential.

Start time: 6114.66

Transcript:  I turn most of that stuff off.  And I'd say that most of the apps I see from the independent offerings from the manufacturers  are kind of weak.  Why they aren't simply offering the Android marketplace right now, it's kind of beyond me.  And that I think is really what Apple is looking at.  And well they should be at least.  And having their own TV that can just simply take that experience and link it from your  mobile devices to the bigger screen.  I hope they make a projector.  I do like this line.  I bet you it'll be well calibrated and a really good quality display too.  But it will be a premium product.

Transcript:  I do like this line though from Holman Jenkins' column in which he said, Apple used to be  preoccupied with making great products.

And then I got the Joey bra, which is a bra with a pouch like a baby kangaroo you can  stick your iPhone in.  It's a bra?  With a pouch?  It was too small.  But everything else I've ever bought on Kickstarter I've never received anything.  But now apparently if you go to some, for instance this Vintage Goods, or is that what  it's called?  Vintage Goods?  They were going to make vintage style leather bags.  Kickstarter got a cease and desist from another company 10 hours before the project closed  and it was on its way to getting funded.  It disappeared saying this project no longer available.
