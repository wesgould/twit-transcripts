Transcript:  Alright. Well there are a lot of tech stories that you will have something to say about that Congress can get involved in for sure.  But you said as you were reading the rundown how kind of blown away you were by the number of breaches we have this week.

Transcript:  It's been a rough week for cyber security.  Terrible.

Start time: 244.38
End time: 377.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The biggest one of not only the week but of the year I was reading Brian Krebs.  Krebs on security does a great security blog.  On Friday he tweeted, Stand by.  Massive breach news.  And he broke the story of first American title.  Now I don't know if you've ever bought a house.  But if you have chances are pretty good that the title company, the company that kind of does the title insurance, maybe the escrow,  was first American title.  They are I think one of the biggest if not the biggest.  They're a fortune 500 company.  They have 18,000 employees.  Their revenue 5.7 billion last year.  So it's a big company.  They had a little feature on their website.  I think a lot of companies have actually.  I know like a lot of sites when you go to your account it's got a site name.  FirstAmerican.com slash question mark equals.  And then there's a long number.  Your account number.  And one of the favorite things hackers like to do is decrement or increment that.  Right.  Well.  Up by one down by two.  If I am 7349-445-72 let's try 73.  Turns out you can in fact you could in fact do this with the links that you were sent with your title information.  This would be your home application including your Social Security number, your credit history, your driver's license image, your home address, your email, your birth date, any possible kinds of information.  The kind of information you give a title company when you buy a home.  And by the way not just the buyer the seller.  And it turns out that record.  You could decrement and decrement all the way down.  Brian went down to 00000075 which is a title record from 2003.  And then incremented all the way up.  And that's where he gets the number.  Eight hundred eighty thousand records.  I mean the worst breach since Yahoo.

Transcript:  And of course OPM was pretty bad.  OPM also.  But that one went to the Chinese.  Right.  So they never put it on the dark web.  So you're pretty secure.  It's just the US government the Chinese government.  And you know it's pretty safe.  We don't know who if anybody access this information because it's been there since 2003.

Start time: 398.18
End time: 403.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 404.16
End time: 436.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It started the really sad story.  As soon as Brian called them they turned it off.  So it's fixed.  But the sad story is that a developer named Ben Shovel found it.  And he said he tried to get a hold of first American.  They just blew him off.  So he ended up calling Brian and Brian has a little more clout and was able to to get them to pull it down.  But that's about as bad as you can get.  885 million plus.

Start time: 438.00
End time: 443.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it also includes things like routing numbers.  I didn't even think of that but you're right.  It would include bank information.

Start time: 444.00
End time: 491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tax information.  It's all out there.  I mean I don't you know I've long said this.  I don't think the free market can solve privacy because neither the buyer nor the seller wants to pay for it.  So you know in a situation like this I don't know why they shouldn't face lawsuits for this.  This is so unbelievably egregious.  And like how this could go on this long without anyone you know like code auditing the system or taking a serious look at it.  And the thing that really gets me about this story Leo is you know if you look at their Twitter account their radio silent on it or at least they were the last time I checked it.  And you know it's just if you're going to put everyone else's information at risk with this they're just keeping their head down and waiting for it to blow over.

Start time: 493.69
End time: 518.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also might simply be so completely gobsmacked.  I mean it's interesting right because you know one of the other big stories this week of course the attack on Baltimore.  Right.  Baltimore's been shut down for like three weeks.  Three weeks.  From a ransomware attack but we'll get into that in a minute.  But half of what's going on right now you know when a lot of these attacks come out is the first thing you have to do is figure out if anything's been leaked.  Can they trace it?  Can they find information that has been out there?  They circle the lawyers.

Start time: 519.24
End time: 531.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could look at your web logs if you had them going back and see when those pages were accessed.  How many times they were accessed.  If they were accessed a long time after the transaction that kind of thing that would be a giveaway.

Start time: 531.02
End time: 531.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 532.16
End time: 538.96

Transcript:  I love the statement released by First American.  It might sound familiar.  At First American security, privacy and confidentiality are of the highest priority.  Unless we have to do anything.  We are committed to protecting our customers' information.  As long as it doesn't cost anything.  We will have no further comment until our internal review is completed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't make the 5.7 billion dollars a year we make if you don't continue to give us staggering amounts of information.  They also could be trying to figure out, you know, can they fix it?  What else is wrong?  They probably have pen testing teams in there screaming through everything they can.  Right.  Because now that the horse is out they should probably rebuild the fence.

Transcript:  The sad thing is really, I mean maybe they were also penetrated, but this didn't require a spearfishing attack and advanced persistent threat.  Just a web browser pretty much is all you need.

End time: 637.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, what I think is so important about this is as I've started running for office.  Liability, please.  Liability, absolutely.  We need liability laws on this.  But I've talked to so many people that work on the InfoSec teams at these large corporations.  And they've talked to me about why these disasters happen.  It's typically not because the people in charge of the security architecture are inept or they don't care.  The truth is they're not supported by upper management.

Start time: 637.53
End time: 639.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they'll go to management and say, we got a problem.  Correct.

Start time: 640.00
End time: 655.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they get blown off and they don't have the resources.  This is why I feel it's so critical that we up the legal liability there.  When it's more expensive to do this wrong than it is to do it right, that's when you'll see them take this seriously.  It all comes down to the bottom line.  Of course it does.

Transcript:  In Baltimore and beyond, this is the New York Times Today.  This is actually great writing from the New York Times.  Credit to Nicole Pearlroth and Scott Shane.  As you know, Baltimore for three weeks now has been shut down by ransomware.  It's frozen. Thousands of computers shut down.  Email disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts and other services.  Here's the bulletin they put on the city of Baltimore webpage.  The city of Baltimore is currently unable to send or receive email.  If you need assistance, call us.  The ransom, $100,000, city officials to their credit refuse to pay it.  In a side note, I just read an article I think was on Motherboard that a lot of the companies that get hired to remediate ransomware, what do they do?  They pay the fine. They add 10, 20% for profit.

Transcript:  So do not pay the Bitcoin ransomists, okay? I'm just saying.  But here is what, this is the great writing again from the New York Times, Pearlroth and Shane.  Here's what frustrated city employees and residents do not know.  A key component of the malware that cyber criminals use in the attack was developed at taxpayer expense, a short drive down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at the National Security Agency.  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Eternal Blue. You remember this shadow brokers leak of a bunch of NSA exploits some years ago.  NSA never really explained how it happened, although if you piece it together, it sounded like an NSA contractor decided to take those files home with him.  So not so he could steal them, but so he could work at home.  He was running a Kaspersky antivirus on his machine.  One of the things Kaspersky does is quarantine threats, whether intentionally or not Kaspersky recognized that the guy had a bunch of really good hacks on his machine.  So they quarantined him and sent him back to the home office, which happens to be in Moscow.  The Russian secret police apparently have people working at Kaspersky.  It's unknown how close Kaspersky is to the Russian secret police, but they certainly have access to those quarantine files and the rest is history.  The thing I said on the radio show today, and I think this...  And I wanted regular people here, not geeks, is this is the problem.  The NSA, the top spy agency in the United States, the most security focused, these guys really know their stuff, couldn't keep this stuff internal for long.  And you want us to put back doors in all the encryption.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you couldn't even if you didn't.

Start time: 831.58
End time: 840.96

Transcript:  And this is, Leo, this is where I really want to give Microsoft credit because they really took a risk in moving forward and they came out...

Start time: 851.30
End time: 858.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should say Eternal Blue is an SMB exploit that takes advantage of an old version of SMB, Microsoft's file sharing technology.

Start time: 858.10
End time: 892.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, absolutely.  But their legal team has come forward and they've had a lot to say about the NSA stockpiling zero-day weapons and talking about how we need to have a national ban on them doing that.  Because what happens is these zero days are out there.  It prevents people from patching it.  And rather than kind of using this for cyber warfare and being able to use it to get their own way, we should have them working proactively with Microsoft, with other architecture to plug these holes and address it because it's exactly as you said.  It's just going to get weaponized against the American people.

Start time: 894.60
End time: 959.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From the same article, Eternal Blue, the SMB exploit that allowed these malware programs to be warmable.  So that it's one thing if you get one computer in the Baltimore city government with ransomware, but what happens is it uses Eternal Blue to worm its way to all the computers.  Eternal Blue was so valuable, former NSA employees said that the agency never seriously considered alerting Microsoft about the vulnerabilities and held on to it for more than five years before the breach.  Before the breach forced its hand.  The breach was two years ago.  So for seven years that SMB one flaws existed.  Right.  So, but, but Brianna, let me, let me please counter you though.  Clearly, you know, national warfare struggles.  Espionage is all going to become cyber based.  Right.  That's where we're headed.  Right.  If our, our, if our NSA, our, our, our NSA is not allowed to do that.  If our NSA is not allowed to develop tools to do cyber warfare, then aren't we tying both hands behind our back?

Start time: 960.00
End time: 982.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a good argument for that.  Have you read Countdown to Zero Day about Stuxnet source?  It's a great book.  It's a fantastic book.  And I won't like go into all the details, but I will say the, the technical wizardry that they use to basically shut down the centrifuges in Iran.  It was brilliant.  It's certainly that kind of cyber warfare is going to.

Transcript:  No lives were lost, but it shut down their nuclear capability.

Start time: 985.24
End time: 992.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of an optimal solution.  But there was a collateral, a lot of collateral damage because this worm was spread all over the world.  So look, I'm not.

Start time: 993.44
End time: 1002.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, if you fire up a Windows machine that is not patched for Stuxnet, you will get it.  Yes, you will.  Because it's endemic on the net.  It just constantly outmatched.

Start time: 1002.37
End time: 1013.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  So this isn't all or nothing, Leo.  Right.  Like it's, we live in a dangerous world.  We do need to take this seriously.  But in this particular case, the NSA was unable to keep this safe.

Start time: 1013.08
End time: 1040.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would invite you to say for five years until somebody who deserves to get the there is no patch for human stupidity T-shirt decided to take to do work from home.  If you're working at the NSA, you don't take.  I'm pretty sure I mean, I could be wrong.  Rules may have changed.  I don't know anybody.  The NSA that well, but we spent the I got spent a couple like a day with the NSA.  They have some pretty uptight people.  They're really uptight and they have rules in place.  And I'm pretty sure.

Start time: 1041.08
End time: 1044.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those rules didn't stop Edward Snowden.  And then several years later, did not stop.

Start time: 1045.00
End time: 1047.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is no patch for humans.  That could be the short version.  Right.

Start time: 1048.00
End time: 1098.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, until the government is not run by humans, I think we've got a problem.  I feel like we're not going to give up developing these tools.  Right.  But I think there is an analog here and that is biologic weapons.  So there is also a lot of incentive for governments to create biological weapons.  But we have a I don't know if it's Geneva Convention, but we have an agreement among governments that they won't do it.  And the reason is these pathogens that probably do exist in labs, I'm thinking, should they get out, would wipe out the population of the of the country.  Right.  So so there are restrictions on this kind of warfare.  Maybe we need.  Is it even is it even possible to get people like Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, China, Russia to agree to some sort of cyber moratorium?

Start time: 1099.72
End time: 1111.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you're talking to people at the NSA, if you're talking to info sec experts, they are talking about this.  The United States cannot go it alone and solve these kinds of problems.  And we're talking about truly unilaterally disarming.

Start time: 1112.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.

Start time: 1113.42
End time: 1130.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we've got to do exactly what you're talking about.  Form form alliances with other nations.  We're so good at that right now.  Well, it's not great, but we can change that.  We can change that.  So, you know, the truth is we just can't isolate ourselves.  We need to engage with other people.

Start time: 1131.76
End time: 1136.32

Transcript:  This is all one giant mess.  You know, for example, I am fine.  He's cryptography fundamentally.  I don't know how she doesn't get it.  I don't know if she I think she totally gets it.  But her priorities in terms of national security, that's much more important to her than to than maybe not every bank account in the planet getting hacked.  I mean, it's it's you know, the priority you talk to people at different levels of government.  I mean, one of the fun things about DEFCON is who you run into drunk at two in the morning.  And people who are at the front lines have a very different perspective from people at home.  And if somebody spends their entire day, you know, we get you know, we get hit by this, we get hit by this, we get this, we get this.  And people are constant.  There is the whole cyber warfare thing.  You know, there's little skirmishes going on all the time.  There's all sorts of mayhem going on.

Transcript:  I just read an article about there's a little island off of Manhattan that we do practice cyber attacks on the grid.  And it was just in the Times Today, I think.  And and every six months, they bring down the grid and see how fast we can get it back on this island that nobody's allowed to visit.  It's a private military installation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to bounce off what you were saying with Diane Feinstein.  She voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act.  She voted to basically she's very against cryptography.  In my experience, I think it's faulty thinking to think any particular political party is going to come to your rescue on this issue.  When I talk to people, I'm not talking about political party.

Transcript:  And that's the real problem because Eternal Blue was first used by the North Koreans.  They they used it to bring down the British hospital system, the national health system.  That was the first use of it.  They brought down German railroads, 200 organizations, 200,000.  I'm sorry, organizations around the world.  Russia used it with not Petia.  So North Korea had Wanna Cray, which used Eternal Blue, not Petia.  Use Eternal Blue.  It was aimed at Ukraine, but it ended up leaking out FedEx cost them 400 million Merck cost them 670 million.  So these companies could reasonably lobby and say, look, we got to do something.  But I think you also have to convince these countries.  And I think it's a case of you have to say the damage, the collateral damage to your influence.  Promise. How do you convince North Korea?  Yeah, here's this. Here's the island, by the way.  Have you ever been to Plum Island, Patrick?  No. Off Long Island Sound?  No. Well, you can't go there.  Good.  And it's it's it's where DARPA runs war games for a massive cyber attack.

He walks through the sort of how towns and cities got to where they are  with the ex-urban production and then how big box stores are dying  and this sort of endless series of things.  I understand.

If the NSA is going to stockpile these weapons,  we need to have a process to be able to get emergency patches out.  And that's why I do think we need to be funding free and open source software  for local city governments to use.

In an interview in March, Michael Rogers, the admiral who was in charge of the NSA  during the leak, said this.  Well, I don't think he said well, but he's thinking it.  If Toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck and welds an  explosive device into the front and crashes it through a perimeter into a crowd of  people, is that Toyota's responsibility?  The NSA wrote an exploit that was never designed to do what was done.

Yeah, these exploits are developed and kept secret by governments.  This is exactly what you were saying, Brianna.  For the express purpose of using them as weapons or espionage tools, they're  inherently dangerous.  When someone takes that, they're not strapping a bomb to it.  It is already a bomb.

It's because apparently the security systems detected the creation of several accounts  in a short period of time and shut them down.  But Google is happy to say we've restored access to the Gmail accounts for the  Baltimore city officials.  It's because they created a million accounts all at once.  So just next time that happens to your city.  Slow.  Make one every 15 minutes.  That's a valid edge case.

This is a memo obtained by the Military Times.  Apparently a Navy prosecutor decided to embed hidden tracking software into emails  sent to defense attorneys, including an Air Force lawyer involved in a high-profile  war crimes case of a Navy SEAL in San Diego.  The tracking device was an attempt to find out who was leaking information to the editor  of Navy Times, a sister publication of the Military Times.  It was also sent to Carl Prine, the Navy Times editor.  So the Air Force is treating this malware as cyber intrusion on their network and have  seized the Air Force individual military council's computer and phone for review.

Casper is a sleep brand that was the first to say, first to realize that the markup mattress  stores were making was more than 100%.  The only benefit was you could lie in the mattress for five minutes in the broad daylight  while a salesperson looked at you like, what are you doing?  Take your shoes off.  Let alone really trying a mattress for what it's intended for.  I'll let you fill in that sentence.  But honestly, they said, we don't have to do this.  We could sell direct to consumers.  Some bright boy said, well, yeah, but wait, how are they going to decide whether they  like it?  And they came up with this brilliant plan.  Here's the new Casper mattress.  I'm about to open it.  They said, like my jammies?  They said, well, what if we let people try it in their house for 100 days?  This is the brand new hybrid mattress collection.  Now rewind this for a second because I'm going to tell you something you're not going to  believe it.  So, oh, wait a minute.  Don't rewind it.  That is comfortable.  Look at that.  Isn't that nice?

Transcript:  Durable, but gentle springs.  Doesn't mean they still can't fit it in that surprisingly compact box.  It doesn't mean you can't open it up just like I did and open it and you take it out  of the bag.  They must have one of those giant vacuum machines you have for when you got a lot of meat.  Only it's the size of a mattress.  I have the small one.  Yeah, I have the small one too, but I want a mattress-sized one so they suck all the  air out so it's really compact.  The new hybrid mattress collection, I have to tell you, is the best Casper I've ever  slept on.  It offers luxurious comfort and resilient support, elevated lift for active support,  durability for all body types.  Here's something I really like.  So, on some mattresses, when you're trying to get out of the bed, I don't know if you've  noticed this, the edge is not stiff.  The mattress, as you're getting out of bed, collapses.  You sort of slide off.  Yeah, it rolls you up.  So, they've got enhanced edge support.  It has a firmer perimeter.  So, if you've ever had that experience, this supports you as you're getting out of bed.  A security tub?  It's like, yes, you have an edge.  You could press up again.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's awesome.  You get added lift from the springs.  There's still open-cell foam so it sleeps cool, which is really important.  You don't want a hot mattress.  The coils are, of course, individual, so the air can flow around them, but also you can  sleep next to somebody and each have your own kind of comfort zone.  Yeah.  I think this is the best mattress they've ever made.  It's so soft and comfortable.  The only sad thing is we already had the Casper, and foolishly, I told my brother-in-law, oh,  we're getting one, but you could have it.  By the way, it's gone.  He took it within minutes.  Joe and Debbie just, it's gone.  I said, where'd it go?  Oh, no, they took it.  So now I want to get another one.  You gave it to them.  Well, I have the original Casper, which I love.  I did give it to them.  I didn't know how much I'd like this one.  And have you tried the glow light?  Have you seen that?  No.  That's so cool.  It's not a mattress.  It's a light Casper cells.  It's hard to describe, but you can lift it up off.  It's not connected to anything.  It's got a battery, and it glows and it will dim down as you're going to sleep, and then  in the morning it slowly comes up like the sun slowly comes up.  If you have to go to the bathroom, you pick it up and you shake it and it gives you a  very dim glow that you can get to the bathroom and back.  It's hard to describe.  It's really, anyway.  I think this is not a, this is like a side business, but that just shows you they've  got engineering to spare.  A lot of brains.  Because you know why they got brains?  They get good night's sleep.  If you don't get a good night's sleep, you're not thinking, you're not thinking solid.  So here's the deal.  You get $100 towards select mattresses when you go to casper.com slash twit one.

You don't have to fit it back in the box because unlike Patrick, we don't have mattress sized  vacuum sealers.  So they come and they get it and they refund you every penny.  So there's literally no risk.  100 days to sleep on it.  I love this new hybrid.  This is try it.  Well, yeah, try it out.  I guess that's what you say.

Transcript:  One of my complaints about the video game industry, you know, I work with Unreal, which  is a giant, unwieldy engine.  I really feel like with creativity, limits really help you make a better product.  Like I always think about that.  Have you ever seen Dr. No, the original James Bond movie?  That great first set in there where Dr. Strangways comes in, it's got that great light on him  that terrified, it's just a table in the room and the light up there.  That happened because they ran out of money for that set.  That's the most striking shot with that.  Limitations can really help creativity.  So the way I feel is, you know, I was looking on my PlayStation 4 and looking for games  to buy this month and I'm bored with everything, our industry, shipping.  And I just really love this idea about putting out a really small, like graphically bad handheld  with that's all about the gameplay and these cute little gimmicks.  I think it'll be fun.

This is actually in Edge magazine.  So let me actually let me go to the Edge story since they came up with this.  It's deep within the story apparently.  But let me see.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here's something.  Brought to life by renowned Swedish industrial design firm, Teenage Engineering.  So that's who's designing the Play Day.

Start time: 2695.98

Oh, so it could be like a time turner.  It literally is a sort of time shifting game.  But I mean, it's also again, I've got two buttons, a thumb pad and a crank.  What can we do with this?  Right.

Transcript:  All right.  I we had a little that was a little amuse-bouche,  a little sorbet, a little refresher, a palate cleanser,  a palate cleanser in between the havoc that is today's tech news.  I we mentioned last week that Grindr that the CFIUS,  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  is ordering the Chinese company that bought Grindr some years ago  to sell them and in the meantime not to put give any data to the Chinese.  Well, now we know why.  It turns out that Beijing Kunlun Tech Company,  which took control in January of last year,  stepped up management changes, consolidated operations, cut costs.  In the process, some of the company's engineers in Beijing got access  to the Grindr database for a few months.  Now, Grindr, in case you don't know, is a gay dating app.  It's Tinder for gay people. Right.  And of course, I think the real concern is blackmail.  If you're a closeted member of Congress or in the defense.

Start time: 2984.34

End time: 3011.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very personal. Yep.  It could be used against you, could be used for blackmail.  It could be all sorts of things.  So I agree it should be sold.  But I think now we know that the security was very lax.  Reuters, which reported this, found no evidence the app's database was misused.  Nevertheless, the decision to give engineers in Beijing  access to Grindr's database was, well, a misstep.

Start time: 3013.28
End time: 3017.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3017.92
End time: 3035.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's very clearly a valid worry. Absolutely.  People could be blackmailed or extorted about that.  And, you know, it's not just Grindr.  That's not the problem here.  It happens with large data aggregation.  And we need to be thinking a lot more critically about Facebook.  About Facebook. I got some things to say about that.

Start time: 3035.42

Start time: 3037.74
End time: 3078.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that is one thing that I've been told by security experts is if you don't see  the data, for instance, from this first American title breach,  if you don't see it on the black market, on the dark web,  then it was almost certainly China,  because that's what happened to the OPM data.  That's what happened to the anthem insurance data.  It just disappeared like the data was exfiltrated, but disappeared.  And the theory is the Chinese government is using it to track agents,  to to blackmail, to keep an eye on Chinese citizens abroad, that kind of thing.  And so that's why they're breaking in.  I would bet you the first American title.  Actually, there's no breach there yet. They're just a flaw.

There's a lot to say about Huawei.  This is tragic.  Chu Zhangxuan, a Chinese student,  leader of the Marxist Student Association and Peking.  Chinese students apparently are making farewell messages, videos  among amidst crackdowns on labor activism.  I could I could show you it's in Chinese,  so it probably wouldn't communicate to most of us. But  he this is a way of saying, you know, he's saying I was interrogated, I was tortured.  It was done on campus.  He says, if I disappear, it'll be because of the Chinese  secret secret police, Beijing police.  He disappeared April 29th.

Start time: 3141.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very reminiscent of Tiananmen Square.  You know, that happened when I was just a kid.  It was all about people wanting to be able to express political opinions more openly.  And I think it's very notable like China has actually  that's one of the most scrubbed incidents on the Chinese incident is Tiananmen Square.  They just refer to it as the Tiananmen incident.  It's very, very troubling.

Start time: 3166.14
End time: 3241.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I say I mention this only to underscore that the Chinese government  has not a great history of human rights and so forth.  So when we talk about Huawei, it's somewhat understandable that maybe  I mean, I can if if the US government or the defense  agencies have evidence that Huawei  was co-opted by the Chinese government, that they might become  adversaries, whether it's industrial espionage  or cyber warfare, that that would be reasonable to say,  we got to stop using Huawei stuff.  And that's kind of what's happening at this point.  Huawei is persona non grata in a lot of ways.  Started last week when President Trump signed an executive order  banning the use of Huawei gear in.  And actually, what he banned was selling United States  companies selling their gear to China, to Huawei,  which pretty much puts Huawei out of business.  Shortly thereafter, Google said, OK, no Android license.  They did subsequently say, well, we're going to give you 90 days  and we're going to keep giving you patches.  But it doesn't I don't know if that 90 day.  This is part of what's so confusing about this is this back and forth thing.

Start time: 3241.38
End time: 3259.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. If I'm if I'm correct about this and please correct me if I'm wrong,  it was the the US Department of Commerce and then they were added  to the entities list and the entities list is basically a list of companies.  The American companies are forbidden to do business with  unless they have a specific written exemption with that.

Transcript:  I mean, the the thing about the operating system is probably the least troubling  thing, because they can replace the operating system.  And more importantly, they can get access to it because it's so much of it is open  source. Arm licensing has apparently been shut down.

Start time: 3273.94
End time: 3330.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Arm, the English company, has said now we're going to withdraw a license.  Qualcomm, which makes our chips used by Huawei, says we're not going to say any  more chips. Huawei makes its own Kirin processors, but those are arm chips.  Huawei can't use micro SD cards in its phone.  Huawei can't buy Gorilla Glass from Corning while I mean, while I can't buy  memory from Micron. Right.  So the order which Trump signed Wednesday  prohibits the purchase or use of any communications technology produced  by entities controlled by a foreign adversary and likely to create undue risk  of sabotage of US communication systems or catastrophic effects.  So that means we can't buy their stuff.  The Commerce Department now has 150 days to produce rules that can identify  particular countries or persons as foreign adversaries.  According to Politico, that's very likely to name China and Huawei or both.  Or either or both.

Start time: 3340.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is an interview with Donald Trump.  Yes, this is awkward.  This was Thursday afternoon.  Remember, Trump addressed the press and was asked about Huawei.  This is what the president said. Huawei is something that's very dangerous.  You look at what they've done from a security standpoint, from a military  standpoint, it's very dangerous.  So it's possible that Huawei even would be included.  Wait a minute. Now, this is where OK, got it.  They're very dangerous.  Then the next sentence is, so it's possible Huawei even would be included  in some kind of a trade deal.  If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly  included in some form, some part of a trade deal.  Reporter, how would that look? Trump.  It would look very good for us.  Reporter. But the Huawei part, how would you design that?  Oh, it's too early to say we're just very concerned about Huawei from a security  standpoint. So there's two different things he's saying here.  One is they're dangerous. The other is, well, once we have a trade deal,  they're not so dangerous.

Transcript:  So this is my all along been my concern.  And then I'm Brianna, I'm going to ask what you think.  But all along, my concern is it's unclear because we haven't been given evidence  is we know Huawei is kind of a crappy company.  I mean, we've Father Robert said, yeah, they were the Huawei guy was wanting  around the trade show, taking pictures of the competitors stuff.  They've been you know, they've been caught doing that, you know,  not such great stuff.  Yeah, not not, you know, corporate espionage, not security stuff.  I also everyday scumbag.  Normal. Many companies.  You know, one of the accusations is they flew tech reporters to Paris and London.  Well, every freaking company I've got offers every week go to.  Hey, how'd you like to go to Computex?  All expenses paid. I mean, that's very common. Yeah.  So that I don't know if I don't know if that's I mean, it's not good,  but it's not national security bad. Right.  They haven't shown as national security evidence, but maybe they can't  because that would reveal sources.  So I understand. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a valid concern.  So I want to I want to preface my remarks by saying  InfoSec, like cybersecurity, this is 10 out of 10 important.  It's the right thing for us to be thinking about as a country.  But what is the evidence so far that Huawei  is spying on the United States?  There's nothing there's nothing in the public domain.  There's not been any evidence shown to us or any kind of information  security person that we can point to and say this is an unusual threat.  The best thing that they've they've come up to show is basically  a different forks of Huawei software could potentially be, you know,  code signed in a malicious way and weaponized against us.  Is that the UK stuff or the Vodafone stuff?  It was the it was the UK stuff.  You know, again, a valid concern, but every single company  that is like not doing cybersecurity correctly  is going to end up on this entities list.  Like this could be a lot of people out of business in the United States.  Plus the title company.  Right. Exactly.  And I really want I want you to think for a second.  What happens if China does this back to us?  What happens if China says, you know what?  If you're a Chinese company, you can't do anything with Microsoft software  or Google software, or they decide to throw Apple out of their country again.  Like this really could be a digital cold war.  The fact that it could backfire

Transcript:  It's the right problem.  And it's a wrong approach.  What would you suggest?  Well, Huawei, what they themselves have come forward and said is like, look,  we understand you have concerns.  We're willing to let you in, show you our hardware, show you our software,  allow code auditing like process.  It's worth pointing out. It's very hard to prove a negative.  And it's very hard to prove that there's not a secret back door  in hardware or software.  But it's it's a step in the right direction.  So I think we should if we have concerns about spying,  I think we should bring them in, should try different solutions  to verify that this is not being used maliciously against us.  And then if we have to take it to DEF CON, you know, DEF CON4, we can.  But I don't think we're there yet.

Transcript:  It is this is the other price is so difficult because and Trump  just really confused it because if he said security, security, security,  I feel more comfortable.  But when he says security, security, but oh, if we make a trade deal, never mind.  That really sounds like it's a good possibility that this is purely political.  Right. On the other hand, we've talked about this before.  In fact, there's really no reason to allow Huawei or any Chinese  networking gear in because most of that is software driven  and there's nothing to stop them.  Maybe Huawei is completely pure as a driven snow right now.  Not a lot of evidence that they are, but let's say they are.  There's nothing to stop the Chinese government in a month from saying,  oh, by the way, here's some little code that you could insert into the switch.  Would you know?  Well, if you want to not disappear, use this.

Transcript:  I mean, there's also been a lot of anecdotal evidence that come out  and that has come out.  And one of the things that has come out in some cases is you will find that stuff  that has been shipped from factory X, from company X.  Has been rerouted and things have been manipulated.  Editor boxes been open somewhere in between leaving the factory and hitting  the classic supply chain. Yeah.  And it's it's I mean, it's interesting, right?  Because there's there's a there's a lot of there's a lot of places  for the wheels to fall off.  There's a lot of places for things to go wrong.  Code is incredibly complicated.  Maintaining code is incredibly complicated.  Like, oh, wait, did we just forget to update the code or did we put  the wrong code on that one because some technician was up for 22 hours  trying to get everything packaged for the delivery and screwed up  and saw their own software?  It's really, really messy. Yeah.

It's for us to have a really serious conversation as a nation  about cybersecurity, to work with other nations, to develop a framework  about this stuff.  And that way, it's not just American safe.  It's people all over the world.  This isn't just an American problem.  This is a worldwide problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this, yeah.  By the way, the U.S., apparently, according to Bloomberg,  is considering blacklisting five Chinese video companies,  none of which I'd ever heard of.  Go to Amazon, look for a cheap camera.  Well, that's the thing is there's a lot of those cameras on on Amazon.  Yeah.  Many of them may not be branded with those particular brand names.  Here's Russell Brandam writing on The Verge.  It's a it's a convincing case when it comes to restricting Huawei's role  in network infrastructure, as I just said.  And it's a case a number of officials have made in that context.  But it makes a lot less sense for exported hardware.  Why shouldn't Corning Glass or Micron Flash memory be sold to Huawei  for use in phones?  They're not even bound for the U.S.  They can't sell them. They don't sell them here.  They're bound for Europe. Right.  So the infrastructure security argument makes no sense  for those phones.  And if the problem really is just that China has a history  of intellectual property violations, which is what President Trump says  and trade secret theft, the same logic could easily apply  to other Chinese companies like Lenovo and Drummaker DJI.  With catastrophic consequences for those companies in the industry at large,  most of these companies make the a lot of money on the West,  particularly on the US.  We know ZTE is practically non-existent  after the similar restrictions last year.  I could imagine Huawei, even though they're they're pluckily saying,  no, no, we can we can soldier on. We don't need Android.  We don't need your stinking Corning Glass.  We don't need we've we've been stockpiling parts for years.  We can continue.

Start time: 3864.60
End time: 3917.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have like three months worth of parts, probably. Yeah.  But but it's also it's you know, they are.  So, I mean, part of it, you know, to muddy the waters even further,  you know, one of the one of the arguments about this is, oh, you know,  the real challenge is that, you know, they're trying to clear the way  for American companies or other companies to create the five.  Basically all of the 5G hardware that's going to run the network.  And I don't want that into I mean, there's there's been the  they're clearing the path for other companies so that Huawei doesn't get all  the business by the fact that Huawei's prices may actually be cheaper  or their tools, blah, blah, blah.  There's the other one that's like, oh, the American government is pissed  because the Chinese government will have the back doors instead of the NSA  having the back doors at the switch level.  I mean, the number of because there's no hard information,  the number of backstories and conspiracies on this just, you know, it just  every couple of weeks, somebody's got another theory.

Start time: 3917.92
End time: 3954.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could I say something about that?  It's utterly legit with 5G, though, like there's a philosophical difference  that the Chinese government wants to embed certain kinds of technologies  within the 5G infrastructure code for the standard they are advocating  that will allow them to basically backtrace who says what, right?  To basically track where communications come from.  The American standard that we're pushing for is far more privacy oriented.  So, again, my solution to this is we can't we've seen this in the EU,  this danger of Balkanizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's completely possible to me, in fact, seems likely  there is a security threat.  The Trump doesn't really understand that he understands trade.  So he conflated the two.  And that if he would try to make the resuscitation of Huawei  an agenda with his trade agenda, that the intelligence agencies will say,  no, no, Mr. President, you can't do that.  So I guess we could take that part out of the equation.  Here's what Bloomberg said.  And this is actually scary.  The Bloomberg's headline is the tech Cold War has begun.  And this is how they wanted it.  China now has no choice but to pursue technological independence  and will burn the cash to achieve it.  Stratecary Ben Thompson, who lives in Taiwan and is very familiar  with Chinese culture across the straits there,  says this is this is something China has been preparing for.  It is actually a very Chinese thing.  This goes back to the Boxer Rebellion and and China closing its doors  to the West culturally, I think.  And I may be no expert, but culturally, I think there's a long history  in China of rejecting the West and say we are the Middle Kingdom.  We're the center of the world.  We don't need you.  And in fact, if they decided that, I think what would show up is  maybe they don't need us, but we sure as hell need them.  Well, I mean, that's a big problem.  You were talking about before the show, rare earth materials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Colpin writing in Bloomberg says even the briefest of bands  will be proof to them that China can no longer rely on outsiders.  We can now expect China to redouble efforts to roll out a homegrown smartphone  operating system, design its own chips, develop its own semiconductor  technology, including design tools and manufacturing equipment  and implement its own technology standards.  This now they've got the resources to do that, whether they'll do it well.  I don't know. But this can only accelerate, he writes, the process  of creating a digital iron curtain. Right.  That separates the world into two distinct mutually exclusive technology spheres.  That doesn't on the face of it seem like a very good thing.

Transcript:  It doesn't. We're seeing a balkanization of the Internet already.  You policy splinter net.  They call it a splinter net. Yeah, I like that.  I do want to just say in this is this is not my opinion.  I'm just sharing my father-in-law's opinion, who is, you know,  he immigrated here from China.  I would ask most Americans to take a breath and to realize  many Chinese people feel an immense sense of pride with Huawei.  It's the company that's kind of gone toe to toe with Apple.  They do consider it a national treasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and I think you can make a case that.  Our national security is better served by free  and open trade with an adversary than by closing the doors,  entangled interests. Absolutely.  Exactly. As long as China has an economic interest in the United States,  it's highly unlikely that they're going to attack us.  And so it worries me.  It feels like the wrong direction.  And I don't want to underestimate the cyber security dangers  Huawei presents to our network and our allies networks.  But there's got to be a better way than closing the door entirely.  It doesn't seem like the best policy.

Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  Ben Thompson, good article, as always, from Strutecary.  Final paragraph.  This is the true war when it comes to technology censorship versus openness,  control versus creativity and centralization versus competition.  These are, of course, connected.  China's censorship is about control facilitated by centralization.  That, though, should not only give Western tech companies  and investors pause about China generally, but it should also lead  to serious introspection about the appropriate policies towards our own tech industry.  Openness, creativity and competition are just as related as their counterparts.  Infringement on any of them should be taken as a threat to all three.  So it's an interesting take on all this, which is we should double as China  doubles down on closing its doors.  We should double down on opening our doors.  I agree. It's a very interesting take from somebody who's very smart.  All right. But meanwhile, I sure want to get that play date game machine.  That sounds cool.

OK.  I agree.  Meanwhile, Intel just announced nine I9 processors.  So Intel traditionally, historically has been unable to cross four gigahertz.  They can't get below 10 nanometers.  They can't. So I think they've given up on the 10 nanometers, honestly.  They say they're going to do them, but they haven't.  Well, they're trying.  No one's no one's denying they're trying.  You've got companies like TSMC making seven nanometer processors.  But anyway, OK, I'm just saying.  But Intel has apparently been able to crack the four gigahertz barrier.  They are now this is an I9, the 9900 KS,  eight cores, all of which can run at five gigahertz all the time.

They're also doing some badass pricing.  And yes, Intel left a badass door the size of a house for them to drive through.  You know, Intel, Intel for a long time was like, you know,  Ryan and I used to talk about this before he went to go work at Intel  about how Intel.  What are you talking about, Patrick? I don't know anything.  You know, the NDAs are fine.  And but the but what we would talk about is is that Intel  didn't really care about PC users.  They didn't really care about PC power users, especially.  What was their market? Well, the majority.  No, I mean, they make it.  They make a ton of money in a lot of places.  We don't want to get that granular. Right.  But in terms of that's the only thing I know. Yeah.  Well, so what happened, right, is is is, you know, Intel, much like Microsoft,  never really made it in handhelds and mobile.  And that was a huge problem because the vast majority of the planet  is going to interface with the Internet and computers in the form of a phone.  That said, you know, and then they well, OK, so we're going to do  we're going to do Raspberry Pi competitive.  Well, that didn't seem to work out.  We're going to OK. We have this amazing.  That the Edison, right? Yeah.  They killed a lot of stuff.  And they went back like, oh, you know, we can make really fast processors  for enthusiasts and professionals.  But the majority of the market, though, is actually laptops, you know,  and and laptops in a certain price range.

And if you want to use Microsoft Office, they have a very credible web app  that runs just fine.  All the office apps run just fine on the web, or you can use Wine  if you want, if you really need it, or you can use LibreOffice.  There's plenty. I'm using Darktable and Raw Therapy instead of Photoshop and Lightroom.  Really? Yes.  Actually, Raw Therapy is very good.  I would recommend it. I'll give it a go.  I've never even heard of it.

We haven't seen any exploits in the wild.  If you're running a server,  multiple users on one processor, absolutely, because any one of those  processes could be malicious.  But it's hard to get a malicious process on my computer at home  that could that could then get the right chunks of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it was it was discovered.  It was patched and then it was announced.  Yeah. Yeah.  You know, but I mean, we've seen we've seen numbers anywhere from three to nine  percent for typical home user scenarios with the patch to as much as 40 percent.  A lot of the numbers you heard were for the latest generation  and the latest model processors.  That's scary.  And then as they get older, it tends to have a more dramatic  impact on performance.

Start time: 5489.18
End time: 5516.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No kidding.  And I asked Steve this and he thinks it's possible.  I'm not sure it's possible to mitigate in a newer design  without turning off speculative execution.  There's he says you can.  And I don't know enough about processor design, but he says  that it is the flaw is this leakage of information between processes.  And he says it's completely possible to still have speculative execution,  but to have policies in place that keep information from going to.

Let's talk government.  Okay. Let's do it.  Because you want to be in government.  I do.  You crazy person.  GDPR.  Now, I looked and looked for conflicts of interest from this site because I'm not familiar with it.  Truthonthemarket.com.  And I think this is actually a fairly balanced summary by Alex Stapp of GDPR after one year because it was exactly a year ago.  And the fines, $55 million, most of that for Google.  Cases, 281,000 cases. 37% are ongoing.  Only 0.1% appealed.  Now, here's the unintended consequences.  Some of these I agree with, some of the I don't.  Article 15, the right of access.  You can access the data the company keeps.  Unfortunately, sometimes the data goes awry.  Amazon accidentally sent 1700 Alexa voice recordings to the wrong user following a data request.  This one I've got to read more about.  This is from Jean Yang.  I don't know if this is true.  Jean writes, today I discovered an unfortunate consequence of GDPR.

Transcript:  That's yeah, I mean, I was more worried about what we would have to do for GDPR.  I was nervous that we, in fact, after this new copyright law, I'm worried that we would have to block European listeners because frankly, the entire show is us commentating on other people's stuff.  Right.  Including this.  And under the new copyright law, that might be something we are no longer allowed to do.  There's no fair use commentary.  So, oh, this is good.  There's Poland.

They've challenged it, saying the legislation would bring, oh, they're right, unwanted censorship.  They filed a complaint with the Court of Justice.  So I guess one thing you could say about GDPR is it's well intentioned.  Maybe over time it will be the edges will be sanded off.  They'll get better.  You can't you don't know what the consequences are until you try it.

We don't want Congress like setting the whole the standards with that.  And maybe Congress.  Who?  I don't maybe the answer is for certain things you bring in like the certification board like USB is the standard.  This worked pretty well.  Maybe the answer is to empower more standards boards and then the civil process holds people to you know, complying with it.

Transcript:  I'll check.  OK.  The issue is now the U.S.  government is going to indict on under the Espionage Act.  And whether you like Julian Assange or not, and honestly, early on I was rooting for him when WikiLeaks released the drone strikes that killed journalists and innocent civilians.  That was an eye opener.  And I think they did a service.  He's being indicted now, though.  And the original charges from the U.S.  government were for helping Chelsea Manning or not even helping offering in a chat to help Chelsea Manning hack the Defense Department.  The new charges are an expanded indictment obtained by the Trump administration that the Espionage Act is extremely broad.  17 counts of violating the Espionage Act.  And this is where it's problematic for obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010.

Start time: 6248.56
End time: 6273.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, in my opinion, if you want to bring a case against Assange, if you have evidence that he or people in his employ were directly responsible for hacking attempts in the United States, that is more valid to me.  But like it or not, WikiLeaks is a publisher.  And this is an attack on the First Amendment.  So I, you know, I think there is a case to be found here that I could feel good about.  This is not it.

Transcript:  Jamil Jaffer of the Knight First Amendment Amendment Institute at Columbia University says, this is the New York Times, the charges rely almost entirely on conduct that investigative journalists engage in every day.  This indictment should be understood as a frontal attack on press freedom.  Yep.  You know, governments don't like leakers.  No.  And I understand why.  But the First Amendment protects journalists who publish those leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And be honest, the Obama administration was as hard or harder.  Absolutely.  Than almost anybody we've seen in decades on whistleblowers and leakers.  But even they declined to go this far.  It's interesting because there's a great film that came out last year, The Post, which is about the Washington Post, you know, and the publisher and the editor and the reporters and the story in the court case.  And it's really interesting when you look at this because, you know, there's a great moment with the lawyer shows up for The Post and he looks like he's 12 in a sort of shiny all-American kind of Midwestern way.  And the editor for The Post is kind of like, you're our counsel.  And but he's dealing with these arguments like, you know, when the Washington Post published details of the D-Day invasion on the day before the events, it's like we're talking about a historical survey and looking at information going back, you know, decades, you know, or and it was horrifying.  When you start when you start looking at what the Pentagon Papers leaked, it's you start realizing that just everybody knew everything was screwed over there.  And then tens of thousands of more people died.  Yeah.  Because there was there was no.

Transcript:  There there.  I mean, there are I am very sympathetic to the military in particular when to safeguard that information.  Leo, earlier in the show, you mentioned that we don't want to compromise sources and methods by our intelligence agencies.  That is utterly valid.  But these things are a balance.  And this is just a very extreme act.

Start time: 6406.58
End time: 6463.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll watch this with interest.  One of the reasons the Obama administration did not pursue it is they were concerned about being overturned by the Supreme Court.  Yeah.  By court because because of the First Amendment.  So obviously, if this prosecution goes forward, first, he's going to have to be extradited.  I wonder because the British law prohibits extradition if additional charges are filed.  So in other words, the U.S.  could extradite based on the initial charge.  But if they start to pile on charges, apparently I read British law says, yeah, we're not going to extradite them then.  So this may affect that as well.  Of course, Assange's lawyers say that he's being charged with a crime for encouraging sources to provide him truthful information and publishing that information.  And so any fig leaf that this was about hacking is now gone.

How many people I gosh, this is a story of my life.  I'd go to a new company.  We're going to a radio station in San Francisco.  This is in 1984.  I was the new music director and they said, yeah, we we generate our playlist for our DJs using this PDP 10 or 11 with a giant eight inch floppy.  And they said, here, you just put the floppy in.  You close the door.  The head on the drive ago.  I mean, loud.  And then it had a teletype.  One of those old dot matrix things are going to print out a playlist.  For some reason, within a few days, that eight inch floppy stopped working.  I don't know what happened.  And we bought a PC.  Thank you very much.  Business software is notoriously bad.  Truth.  Are you running Windows XP IE eight so that you can run that very important line of business software that some you know, the boss's nephew's neighbor wrote when he was in high school.  But now he's left and he we haven't seen him in 20 years.  But the software that's all we got.  Captera.  There is great business software out there for every possible business.  CRM.  We're actually looking right now using Captera at new CRM solutions.  I.T. project management, e-commerce, link management tools, web conferencing or yoga studio management or veterinary business management.  There are nine hundred thousand reviews on here.  Seven hundred categories, thousands of products.  And the best thing is you can filter it down.  You pick the category, filter it down, say, I want only the best reviews.  It's got to be a web application or a local application.  I want it to be able to take care of this many customers, whatever it is that you need.  Filter the results, compare them side by side up to four at a time.  They'll even show you a list of related categories for further options and then read the reviews.  There are there are a thousand new reviews every single day.  By verified users, Captera is great about making sure those reviews come from people actually using the software.  So you can actually find a program for you that and read the reviews and know it's right.  No more Google search, no more calling Joe and counting.  No matter what kind of software your business needs, Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.  And once you find that perfect software, please leave a review because it's share your knowledge with other buyers.  That's what makes Captera so incredible.  Here's the best part. I left out the best part. It's free.  Free free, not freemium, not later they'll charge you nothing.  Millions of people use Captera to find the best business software for their business.  You should too. Captera.com slash twit C A P T E double R A Captera.com slash twit.  Thank them for their support.  Use that URL. That's a way of showing them you like our show.  We appreciate that.

Worse than that, operating like Uber as rideshares.  So that a Tesla owner, which only uses his Tesla on average for two hours a day,  so there's 22 hours of unused time, would flip a switch and say, go ahead, go out, go out little Tesla.

Transcript:  When have batteries ever exploded?  Let me tell you a story about a phone.  Driving his Model X around.  By the way, consumer reports did ding the autopilot.  Apparently, Elon really wants to get to the point where the cars you just say go and they drive.  And one of the key features would be the ability to change lanes.  Consumer reports said, do not use the new automatic lane changing feature.  It's worse than a human driver.  It cuts off cars.  In some cases it breaks laws.  If you turn it on and they said, you know, normally we think of these things as driver assist.  In this case, this is the driver has to has to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't do the wrong thing.  It's not making your life easier.  Oh, my gosh.  So again, Elon, when you win some, you lose some.

Transcript:  So, Josh Hawley passed or filed legislation on Thursday, the Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act, or PECAGA.  That's not very good.  It would prohibit game developers from adding both loot boxes and pay to win microtransactions to a game targeted to those 18 or younger, or games where the game makers know those under 18 are playing.  So that's pretty much every game, right?  You can't say, oh, yeah, there's only 19 year olds who play this one.  Ed Markey from your home state.  He's a good guy.  He's actually a great senator.  Dick Lumensol from Connecticut, also a good senator, also sponsoring the bill.  Hawley said, he's a Republican from Missouri, only the addiction economy could produce a business model that relies on placing a casino in the hands of every child in America with the goal of getting them desperately hooked.  I can't say I disagree.  Loot boxes.  What's a loot box?

Start time: 7424.71
End time: 7450.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a roulette wheel, right?  So if you are playing a game, say Fortnite, you want a particular skin, you've got to keep playing or you need to pay money until you get the item that you want.  It shows up in a loot box and then you have it.  Sometimes the things in a loot box are cosmetic, like a cool costume.  Some of sometimes they break the game or it's pay to win.  But but the key is that it's random.

Start time: 7450.22
End time: 7459.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's random.  You don't know what you're going to buy.  So it's gambling in the sense that it's going to cost you five bucks or ten bucks.  What?  Turn on your microphone.

Start time: 7470.60
End time: 7490.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say you could get that's exactly it.  Yeah, they're very popular in gotcha games where they're like kind of like Pokemon.  You're collecting all these animals.  And so you get an egg that will hatch that will hatch an animal and it might be a good animal or it might be a bad animal.  Right.

Start time: 7491.36
End time: 7504.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  You don't pay for it in Pokemon Go, whereas you would be these loot boxes.  So I can.  So it's not it's not it's not it's a bill.  It's not it's not even got a committee yet.  They're of course Congress is in recess until next month.

Start time: 7504.82
End time: 7544.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what do you think?  Well, I can really see both sides of this.  You know, the truth is that the game industry has really moved away from the point where you pay sixty dollars for a game and you own that game and you just play that game.  Unfortunately  I have to say though, having been here for a few decades, there have been cycles like this before.

Start time: 7558.50
End time: 7573.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's partly because the video game industry is hit driven, right? Like the movie industry.  They make a lot of games, they're expensive to make, they're gambling there be hits, most of them are not.  So those people lose their jobs and then some people like Epic get big wins.

Start time: 7573.66
End time: 7610.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. Well, in this particular case, they figured out a free to play mechanic that really drove growth and exploded revenues.  And they're kind of expecting that growth to go on forever.  This is the downside to this. If I am an adult and I play something like Final Fantasy, A New Realm,  which is the most egregious pay to win game you will ever play in your entire life.  I know people that have spent $40,000 on that game.  What?  I do. I swear.  Adults.  Adults. If an adult wants to make that bad choice.  That's their bad choice.  That's their bad choice. Just like going to Vegas.

Transcript:  We do most states restrict gambling. That's changing very rapidly thanks to the lottery.  But so, yeah, isn't it parents jobs to keep their kids from doing this?  I mean, it's not a hard thing to keep your kid from buying loot boxes.  It's very hard.  Why is it hard? You just don't give them purchase access. How are they buying stuff?

Start time: 7642.28
End time: 7664.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so they're not going to go down to the supermarket, the 7-Eleven,  the Home Depot or any other thing with an end cap that allows them to turn their cash into a credit card?  I mean, I've raised a couple of creative little problem solvers.  So I'm pretty sure at some point if they need to figure out how to get credit card access,  my little campers are going to trot down and put two people together.

Start time: 7671.74
End time: 7685.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the middle ground I would like to see. If you're going to have loot box mechanics in the game,  I think you should have to publish the odds.  There you go.  You'll get certain things just like you do in Vegas with slot machines.  That makes sense.

Start time: 7705.12
End time: 7717.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say about this though, the reason that's important is because  you literally have game developers that sit there and they have all the information,  how often you log in, what you want to do. They will adjust the odds on that.  They have machines.

Start time: 7717.86
End time: 7746.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is exactly the people that have the most control in Las Vegas casinos are the ones that  manipulate the slot machines because that's where most of the revenue comes from.  Of course.  It's like, oh, I could have sat up doing, there's the word for the people who do the  statistics for insurance companies. All those people might be actuaries.  All the actuaries, the really insane ones all migrated to casinos.  But I'm with you. But it's also crazy when you think like people have paid,  I think play to win games or pay to win games are kind of a nightmare in general, kind of ruins gaming.

Start time: 7747.84

Transcript:  I agree. And Apple's with its arcade plus trying to create a new economy for games.  I think there are responsible people. Stadia might be a solution as well, the Google solution.  There are responsible people trying to fix this.  I don't know if Google is trying to fix it. I just think they're trying to get away around.

Start time: 7766.38
End time: 7774.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, I would argue Stadia is going to accelerate this because you're not paying for it.  So it's going to like increase those kinds of mechanics.

Transcript:  At this point, the number of games on my phone I've stopped playing because I paid for a game  and there's still advertisements. That at this point is just there's so much about  game developers need to make money. They can't make enough money. Is it they can't make enough  money off a single sale or is it just too lucrative to not do the additional stuff?

I don't feel like they extorted money out of me. I paid for things that made sense  strategically. I got to level 40. I've deleted the game now because I did.  You got to level 40.  Well, once you get to that's the highest level. Once you're done.  No, I know.  It's like, what's the point?  That's impressive.  Tell Frank I'm at 40.  He'd be very jealous.

No, but the point was, before the promo, the point was, I wouldn't,  I'd be sad if I couldn't play some of those games because it was governmentally regulated.  I'd be sad if I couldn't drink.
