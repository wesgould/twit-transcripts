Transcript:  see the president. I saw him on video. Yeah. He actually that's a big keynote for  South by Southwest to have the president of the United States. I think that's got to be a  first. He went to tell the techies visiting South by Southwest that we need them. That we  need the tech community to get involved and help make government more efficient, more  transparent. Great message. I think it resonated well. Unfortunately all of that  completely got superseded by one of the questions towards the end of his presentation.  Somebody asked him about the Department of Justice versus Apple case. Well who wants to  pick it up here? Why don't you pick it up here? You could pick it up if you want Mark Milley.  He said we got to stop fetishizing, boy this is a mistake, stop fetishizing smartphones that  they can't be allowed to be black boxes and that the tech industry should work with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  boss is on the same message as... That's one thing that's interesting. It doesn't seem like the  government is actually of one voice on this. The NSA is promoting strong encryption. The NSA  says we need, for security, we need end-to-end encryption everywhere. The FBI says we can't  enforce the laws if we have it. So there isn't really kind of universal agreement in the  government. David where do you stand on all of this? You know I'm not sure I took away the

Start time: 320.30
End time: 392.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  same message from Obama's speech. What I got from him was a typical Obama reason measured  effect. I heard him saying let's not just slam the door and say neither one of us can move.  Let's see if we can come up with a solution. And I mean I have to say there must be a  solution. If all the posturing went away and this weren't being done in the public eye,  I'll bet you they could come up with a solution. For example, I mean I don't know the  particulars of the software code but suppose the FBI gave Apple the phone, said don't create a  back door. We don't need to have it. You're not going to give it out. But can you find the data  on there for us? You know help us hunt down a terrorist without sacrificing anybody else's  privacy. I mean it seems like there is a precedent for this which is the warrant. Right? If  someone wants to search your home, they get a warrant by a judge who then says okay we need to  search the home because we suspect you of something. So this idea of we need to pursue our  investigation through your private area, it's not a new idea. And it just seems like Obama's  right in that there could be some compromise. That was the argument he was trying to make in

Start time: 393.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that throughout the history of technology there have been ways for the government to get access  to things. Whether it's going to AT&T and pulling information off of their servers from cell phone  data or whether it is having a back door within Skype or just about any other software out there.  In the specific Apple case what they're asking Apple to do is to create a special version of  their operating system that only Apple has access to. And the government would be able to bring  phones to Cupertino and say install that version of your operating system on it so that we can  brute force hack the passcode and get access to the phone. What Apple is saying is that if we do  that then somebody might hack our systems and get access to that software and then they have a key  to everyone's phone in the world. Isn't it telling though that the FBI could do exactly what you say

Start time: 452.26
End time: 629.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David? They could say well here's the phone. In fact that's what they used to do. Here's the phone.  Just give us the data. But they chose not to. I think the FBI is very interested in establishing a  precedent. And the precedent that worries me, the precedent they'd like to establish is not Apple's  going to help us open up this phone but that we can compel using the courts a tech company to write  custom firmware. And that is I think what their really long term goal is. It's not about this phone.  It's about getting a tech company to do this. I'll tell you why I disagree with you David and with the  president. The president said you can't take, and he's a politician. Politics is the art of compromise,  of negotiation. And of course from his point of view there's always negotiation that can go on.  You can't take an absolute view on this he says. If your argument is strong encryption no matter what  and we can and could create black boxes I think that does not strike the kind of balance we've lived with  for 200, 300 years and it's fetishizing our phones above every other value. And I think he's missing the point.  I understand that. That's a good political point of view which is no no we can, if we sit down we can work this out.  But it's not about politics it's about math. In my opinion I think the technologists he's talking to  probably are thinking the same thing. It's like the government saying well we don't like this 2 plus 2 equals 4 thing.  Can we work it out? Can we compromise? Is there something we can do? Can we make it 4 and a half?  Because the encryption exists, the math exists, there's nothing anybody can do about that. It's out there. It's done.  In fact there's a guy with a tattoo on his chest of strong encryption. There's t-shirts.  And we've done this once before. The government said with munitions, or rather said that the strong encryption was like munitions  and in the mid 90s, you remember this David, they said you cannot export strong encryption.  So what happened? And we have history as a lesson here that apparently is not being paid attention to.  What happened was Netscape said alright well if you're going to insist on you know we can't export 128 bit key encryption  we'll make 40 bit and it'll be in all our browsers. We can't make a separate browser for the US and Russia.  So we'll make one browser. It'll have 40 bit encryption. And here we are 20 years later.  The fact that 40 bit encryption was in that browser means we still have to support 48 bit encryption on websites.  And it has become a real security problem to the point now where many companies like Google and Microsoft are trying to force  this weak encryption off the internet. But it's hard to do. So this was an example of by Fiat, by legislative Fiat,  the government saying well you just can't have strong encryption. So what it does, it doesn't just break it for bad guys.  In fact it doesn't break it for bad guys because bad guys can access strong encryption. It's out there. It's easy.  Everybody can do it. So all it does is it takes strong encryption away from normal users.

Start time: 630.02
End time: 673.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and the government has argued that you know Apple is doing this for marketing reasons to protect its own business.  But I think in many ways if this were the precedent that were set that the government could go to an American company  and say you need to build this version of your phone so that we can get into it. That really does potentially put American technology  companies at a disadvantage if people do prioritize security over all else. I mean you know a company like Xiaomi or Blackphone  or these non-American companies could get a potentially big boost from people who do prioritize their privacy.  And then Apple and Google and the other companies would be at a disadvantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Apple cited in the hearing was Telegram which is this huge messaging service from the creator of the Facebook of Russia  that has very strong encryption, is used throughout ISIS's organization.  And you know you can't go to them and tell them to build a version of their software that the FBI can have access to.  They're not going to listen.

Start time: 703.24
End time: 733.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well here's the real problem right now is WhatsApp. Forget the iPhone. WhatsApp is being used, it has strong encryption.  It's owned by Facebook. Facebook acquired it. And it's invisible to law enforcement. You can use WhatsApp for crying out loud.  Free app out there and there are lots of others. There's Wire just got updated. It's a Swiss company.  It's using OTR, strong public key crypto. It's open source. How are you going to stop that?

Start time: 733.96
End time: 779.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know it seems to me part of the problem is that there are so many conflated issues to argue about.  In other words, are we arguing about being spied on? Are we arguing about the government pressuring a private company,  I mean a commercial company to bend its ways? Are we arguing about the San Bernardino terrorist?  So let me ask you, Aliyo, if there were such a solution whereby no innocent individuals could have their phones broken into,  but only bad guys or suspected bad guys so that all the other issues of this go away, would that be satisfactory?  Oh yeah, of course.  So you're not saying even terrorists should have their privacy?

Start time: 779.92
End time: 854.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying you cannot limit terrorist privacy without breaking it for everyone. That's the real problem.  And I understand, look, there's a long standing tradition and this is a tradition we all have to support, this is what society works,  that if a court based on reasonable cause orders a search of your home, that that's legal and proper and law enforcement can do that.  And in fact, up till now, there's only been, we talked about this last week, one place in the whole world that was protected and that was your brain.  The courts have held that the one place law enforcement can't force, you cannot be forced to testify against yourself.  You can be forced to give a fingerprint, a hair, but you cannot be forced to divulge the contents of your brain.  We're going to, courts have already said this, we're going to mark this out as a private space.  The problem is, so that's why I'm saying it's not a political negotiation because of course, you should be able to with a lawful warrant search anything.  That's what our nation is based on. The problem is it's too late.  Encryption exists and you can tell Apple not to encrypt iPhones, but it doesn't mean that somebody can't use them WhatsApp on their iPhone.

Start time: 855.48
End time: 907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of what bothers me about the analogy with regular warrants and searching your home is if law enforcement wants to come into my home and search what I have, I have access to that warrant.  I can know about it. I can get a copy of it. I can take it to my legal team with all that we've seen from what the NSA has been doing on spying.  We don't know when they're asking tech companies already for our information.  And that's already been happening. That is already a precedent.  So if we're talking about now breaking encryption to getting into these sorts of devices, of course the San Bernardino shooter is the example everyone's talking about right now.  It's at the center of it. But in no situation is that where this would end at all.  There's already been hundreds of requests that are similar and there's even dozens I think from the Attorney General or something like that.

Start time: 908.20
End time: 945.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And even in this interview at SXSW, Obama expanded the scope of what we're talking about here outside of San Bernardino.  He also brought up the example of enforcing tax, like IRS taxes.  He was like, everybody shouldn't have a Swiss bank account in their pockets.  And so that already suggests how far does this go?  Let's say I don't report my Amazon purchases on my tax return.  Can they then access my phone data to see that I purchased some stuff from Amazon and then send it to jail for it?

Start time: 945.42
End time: 949.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David, I like your hypothetical, but do you think that that's possible?

Start time: 951.12
End time: 965.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wanted to clarify what we were arguing about because I know there are people on the Internet who say, you know, no access to anybody at any time.  You know, it doesn't matter if I have child porn. It doesn't matter if I'm a terrorist. It's the principle of the thing.  So I was just trying to peg where you are.

Start time: 966.56
End time: 1049.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm kind of standing back from that argument.  I'm also not anti-government, which a lot of I think technologists just don't like the idea of government at all and think privacy should be universal and so forth.  But it doesn't even matter. What I'm saying is, yeah, you can have different points of view on that.  But I think it doesn't matter at this point. You can.  Somebody will make a strong encrypted phone. It won't be a United States company, I guess.  Somebody has already made many messaging programs that are completely secure. Telegram is actually a poor choice because it's using its own role, your own encryption, which is easily broken, apparently.  But there are other systems. You know, you've got to figure that the government also is this is a little bit of a specious argument from the government because they've even said, well, we're not too worried.  You've got the Internet of Things coming. You're going to be putting 20 things in your house that we can use to spy on you at any time.  Remember that Harvard-Burkman Law Center study called Going Dark, which really concluded and so a lot of good people on that, that there's no problem with going dark.  So I think law enforcement is not I think what they're seeking is some pretty broad ability to compel tech companies to rewrite their firmware to their benefit.  And they may get it. I wouldn't be surprised if they got it.  And I think President Obama's right to say that this we should resolve this before it gets to the Congress because Congress probably isn't going to write the good law.

Start time: 1050.80
End time: 1105.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really also concerned about what we do here in the United States, what this will mean for other countries.  I mean, I know China's watching it closely. That's something we've covered a lot of the journal.  And there's questions about, OK, if you know how far the United States gets in its ability to compel tech companies to essentially create software for them to help them in their pursuits.  What will that mean when when China asks the same sort of thing?  And then there's also been this WhatsApp executive in Brazil who is arrested, I think, for like only a day.  But nonetheless, he was arrested because WhatsApp wasn't able to turn over some data that the government requested.  And the company argued, well, the data doesn't exist. We can't give you what doesn't exist.  And but there's a fundamental misunderstanding on the side of the government as to what exists and what is possible and what is new and what's there or isn't.  And this guy got thrown in jail for it.

Start time: 1106.70
End time: 1121.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's kind of unfortunate because I really do feel like the president went to South by with a strong message, which was let's get the tech community working with government to make government more efficient, more responsive.  But it's gotten completely overwhelmed. You had to move, David. Are you OK now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. It's you know, it's an argument we've been talking about since since this news broke weeks ago.  And it's probably we've that we've dealt it to death ad nauseam.  But I but I was a little disappointed.  I feel like the president, I understand he's a politician.  He's going to expect a political solution to this.  I think he doesn't understand that it's not a question at this point of political solution.  There isn't there's there's the math and the math is not, unfortunately, tractable.

Start time: 1172.10
End time: 1181.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I think it's going to turn out like like can what if a judge says Apple, you lose like what are they going to do?  Put 13000 employees in jail. That will almost certainly happen.

Start time: 1181.71
End time: 1269.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder what happens.  OK, so let's say it goes to the Supreme Court. It'll go to the Supreme Court no matter what.  If Apple wins, if Apple loses somebody, whoever loses is going to appeal.  It'll end up in the Supreme Court if they take it.  And let's say they rule against Apple. Who goes to jail? Tim Cook.  Who goes to jail? I think Apple I think Apple complies is what happens.  Yeah, I think Apple doesn't want to comply.  But I think Apple, if it was a, you know, if it's a court order and they've appealed it all the way and they lost, I think Apple complies.  They're not on an unlawful company.  But but I think ultimately this shouldn't be decided by the courts.  This should be decided by Congress.  Unfortunately, Congress is going to almost undoubtedly do the wrong thing.  But they it's they've been asked before.  This is, you know, clear is the template for this.  The Assistance to Law Enforcement Act that Congress passed in the 90s that said telecom companies like AT&T must cooperate with law enforcement.  That's why there's a secret room in AT&T in San Francisco because of Kalea.  There have been attempts to pass a Kalea for digital providers that have failed so far.  I suspect we'll see an attempt at Kalea 3 in Congress.  And then let's play this out.  It's the scenario you kind of talked about, Nate, where, OK, now any company that wants to do business in the United States has to sell broken encryption.  And if you want and if you're a bad guy, then you just go buy this the black phone.

Start time: 1269.74
End time: 1380.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think honestly, you know, I think it would put us at a bit of a disadvantage.  I mean, I'm kind of disappointed that the government itself is doing this in such a public way.  And, you know, trying to put a little, you know, fire under under Apple for this, because, I mean,  of all of all the resources that they have, of all the brilliant people in the world, they can't figure this out on their own.  They're very publicly saying Apple needs to do this for us.  And the fact the matter is, is Apple doesn't just belong to the United States.  Google doesn't just belong to the United States.  Like these are global companies that have their own, you know, whether we like it or not, political and social power and their own influence all over the world.  And and these other governments are going to come at these companies in similar ways.  So we might like it right now because, you know, the United States government is trying to get its own thing.  But when it spreads and this becomes the norm and the practice, then there are flawed products out there for everybody.  And the simple fact, I think, is that new technologies will be developed and there will be new secret ways for people to share what they need to share and to communicate.  And, you know, the bar will just always always be moved.  So, you know, I think it's a little bit defeatist.  I think it's a little bit short sighted.  It's definitely not just about the San Bernardino shooter's phone, but it's about, I think, changing the expectation that we have as consumers for what we have in our pockets right now.  You can see encryption as being something at least being safe and private.  But they're removing that expectation of privacy in a way or they want to.  I think the government wants to remove that expectation of privacy in a way that mirrors some of the state backed companies and technologies that you do see in countries like China.  Yeah.

Transcript:  You know, sitting in the back of my head through all of this, I think it was Jeffrey Fowler of the Wall Street Journal who did this great column that I never saw coming.  I didn't even think about this, but Google and Apple or competitors in some way have a very different approach toward privacy.  Apple is trying to make more and more with every month about how little of your data it maintains, about how few connections there are between its various apps.  Google, on the other hand, is like, oh, yeah, we know where you go.  We know your email.  We know your money.  We know your phone.  Now we have our Nest thermostats knowing when you're home.  And they create products that exploit all this data in really clever ways.  You know, so when you are using Google Maps and you start typing in an address, I have to type in like two letters of the street.  And it knows exactly where you're going.

Transcript:  How does it know that?  I haven't typed it in.  Well, it's because it also has access to my Gmail and to my calendar.  You know, it can it could give us things in exchange for this data.  And followers saying Apple is is hog tying itself by saying, oh, no, we're all about privacy.  We're never going to make those connections.  So what's curious about all this is the timing.  So Apple's big marketing push.  And I'm on the receiving end of PR missives about this all the time.  Every new there's a time there's a new Apple product.  They're like, and by the way, we don't maintain any of your data.  They're trying to make it a sales point.  They are.  And so in some ways, that's in the back of my head through all of Tim Cook's protestations about this privacy thing.  They're making a big public stink about just how seriously Apple takes privacy as a competitive advantage.

Transcript:  And there's some merit to the Department of Justice saying, see, Apple's using this as a marketing opportunity that there is some merit to that.  It is a valuable marketing opportunity.  I think it's a little bit of a misrepresentation because we know, for instance, that Apple could have they even said, well, if the if fruit  had backed up his iPhone to the cloud, we could have given that to the FBI.  So Apple has access to all this stuff.  They choose not to mine it for information as Google does.  Ironically, my Nexus 6P, which is encrypted by default, can be protected with a strong password that Google couldn't write a backdoor to.  I mean, this is as encrypted as an iPhone and doesn't have that kind of weak four digit or six digit unlock if I don't want it to.  But at the same time, any device you use, if the and this is why I worry if the Department of Justice or anybody can compel a company to write custom firmware for that device,  there's nothing we have in computing that can't be cracked and opened.  True. I mean, Google could push firmware onto it onto an Android device that would give them access to all the data on that Android device as well.  So that's the real I think that's the real risk.  And I do unfortunately think that that's the the precedent the government wants to establish is, you know, in the pursuit of law enforcement under court order, we should be able to get custom firmware written for any device so that we can see what's on that device.  Yeah. In fact, while you're at it, why don't just give us that firmware so we can just put it on there as necessary.  That way we don't have to keep bothering you.  Yeah. I think that's the ultimate.  That's the end.

Transcript:  In some ways, I wonder why we're getting so, you know, hept up over this issue on our smartphones.  There are so many other realms where we're routinely being data.  Exactly.  I mean, how do you know that Verizon isn't listening into every cell phone call you make or looking at your records?  How do you know your grocery store isn't saying, oh, loading up on the Entenmann's pastries a bit this month?  Are you Leo or or how do you know Visa and MasterCard aren't, you know, perusing your credit card statements there?  All around us are things that we could be getting worried and upset about.  And every time a reader says, you know, this really bothers me about my privacy.  I'm like, if you're going to be paranoid, be rational about it.  Yeah. You have much bigger fields to plow.

Transcript:  We'll get real paranoid because frankly, you have no privacy.  And that's true.  In fact, you use as an example of Verizon.  Verizon, of course, is putting super cookies on all the web traffic from Verizon customers for a couple of years.  They got in trouble with the FCC.  The FCC is now finding Verizon the amazingly huge amount of one point three five million dollars.

That information to.  It's a kind of a sad fine, to be honest with you.  It's it's a slap on the wrist, you know, and unfortunately, the super cookie will continue.  The FCC has said that you have to be clear that you're doing it to Verizon and you have to have an opt out.  But, you know, here's the truth.  I bet you notice this, David.  People don't really care.

Like traffic speeds on Google Maps.  Sign me up.  It's just their parents.  It's just old us old guys who still have one toe in the privacy thing.

David, but I mean, honestly, I think as to we're taking over slowly, please do.  Would you?  I'm old and tired.  But the fact of the matter is, I think that it is really easy to to to point to people, millennial or older or younger and say, you know, hey, well, you don't even you don't care about privacy.  You like just getting free stuff you like and you like the advantages of Google Maps.  I think there's there's there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how this technology works and what we're giving up in trade for those services.  So, you know, the first time that someone signs up for a Google account or a Facebook account, maybe nowadays they're in middle school or something like that.  Do you think they really have an understanding of what data they're giving away?  No.  And as you live your life, I mean, you yourself, Pogue, you just said that, you know, you're looking at these people and you're getting these frustrated reader comments and they don't understand they're being paranoid.  I think you, myself, Mark, all of us as journalists need to do a better job of explaining what the hell people are giving away.  And we don't do a good job of that.  Most detectives, I bet because people don't really care.  People glaze over really care.  I think people glaze over.  If people didn't care, if people didn't care, why would Edward Snowden be a household name today?  Why would we care about the NSA issues?  Why was Edward Snowden the keynote speaker last year at South by Southwest before Obama was this year?  It wasn't a mistake.  The president rolled through and happened to be talking about these things right as the FBI is suing Apple.

Transcript:  I read a report from a group called Upturn, and this is a report they put out for policymakers in Washington, D.C.,  what ISPs can see, clarifying the technical landscape of the broadband privacy debate.  And the takeaways are, I mean, I'd love to see this published in the Wall Street Journal or the Bloomberg Business Weekly or in Yahoo Tech.  Truly pervasive encryption on the Internet is still a long way off.  For instance, 86 percent of health sites do not encrypt browsing.  86 percent, 90 percent of news and 86 percent of shopping.  And your ISP can see right into that.  Internet of Things devices often transmit data without encryption.  Most people are using messaging apps that are not encrypted by default.  I guess Apple's is, but that's just they use it because that's by default.  And that's what Apple's kind of made their name.  But even with HTTPS, ISPs can still see the domains their subscribers visit so they can collect where you're going and what you're doing.  It's all there.  Your ISP knows a huge, people, I often tell people this on the radio show.  What are you worried about Google and Apple?  Your ISP is the expert in what the hell you're doing on the Internet.  Yeah, and they are already cooperating with the government.

This was the box the FBI was going to require all ISPs put into their network operations center to keep track of what their users were doing and keep track of it for two years just in case.  Just in case the FBI wanted to investigate them.  You think they're really only holding onto that for two years?  Well, they changed the name, but basically the rules are the same.  So yeah, Carnivore was maybe not a good name.  So now.  So, so they decided to do something else.  But basically that that surveillance ISPs are required or strongly encouraged to keep 18 months of data.  Yeah.  And they know everything and they're handing it over.

Transcript:  To answer your question, Nathan, I think I think there's also a big audience question about the coverage of all of this stuff.  Here we are, you know, for men in the tech industry, all tech writers, you know, sitting here discussing what we think the masses feel about privacy in the tradeoffs.  We're not most people.  We're the echo chamber of the, you know, techno gentia or whatever.  I think Edward Snowden freaks out the masses because it was said that they could see where we go on the Internet.  But people suddenly were like, wait, the NSA knows what porn sites I go to.  Now that would freak out everybody.  Yeah.  But I don't think they care what what what they say on their phones or what address they put into Google Maps.  I think many younger people say, I don't care about that stuff.

Transcript:  I mean, this is this is in this is in the national dialogue, whether we like it or not.  So I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and say that if they really knew what was happening, they would care.  Because when I've seen examples of them being enlightened to what has happened, people seem to care.  And people have lots of questions for me, whether it's, you know, my aunts and uncles or whether it's my, you know,  middle school cousins or my peers at publications, some of whom are millennials and some of whom aren't.  So I think, you know, it's just like it's just like that city hall reporter where no one reads the work that they do  and that, you know, local newspapers wondering why they're even, you know, have that person at those meetings.  And then as soon as the corruption comes out, suddenly people care.  You know, the L.A. Times, we had a situation.  I used to work there years ago where they won a pollster for exposing corruption, this small city called Bell.  And it was in South L.A. And no one cared about Bell.  But then once the explosion was corrupted, people suddenly started caring and talking about it.  I think right now we have a situation where it's easy to say no one cares about privacy and all of these things.  But it's in it's in the national conversation. It's in popular culture.  We're talking about it, whether we like it or not.  I think as as as journalists, as media, the whole fifth estate concept that we're here to our job, it's our job.  So give them the information now.

And we did you know, how to not leave tracks.  We would run these stories and guess how many people clicked on them.  Yeah, it's us that cares.

The unwashed masses where I'm dealing with normal people and I don't spend a lot of time trying to explain how to be safe.  I say talk about having safe, but how to be encrypted or private.  Mostly what I do is I say you're not.  And so you shouldn't put it on Facebook if you don't want somebody to see it, that you're that it's a it would be a mistake to assume you're communicating privately.  Yeah, unless you really take the effort, take the time and the effort to.  And that's the irony of all this.

And they'll they'll be able to catch the people who are doing bad things.  I think a lot of people feel that way.  But that's not really what this country was founded on.  That's where I think it's, you know, people who do care about history and about civil liberties get fired up about this stuff because they understand the differences between, you know, our country and China or Germany.  60 years ago.  Right. Yep.

Transcript:  Well, one of the differences is that we have the rule of law that we have a court system that protects is supposed to and I think does for the most part protect individuals rights while giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate.  And I know I think that that's a good thing.  I think that's one of the strengths of this country is the rule of law.  It's one of the real foundations of America's greatness.  I also feel like this is unfortunately kind of moot at this point because of the ability to use strong encryption and any attempt to undermine strong encryption is misguided.  But it's a difficult I think it's a technical argument almost.  Yeah.  And it may be that that's not an argument politicians will ever understand.  They don't ever want to say, oh, well, two plus two is four always no matter what no matter what I think they would like it to be negotiable.  We're going to take a break.

You open it up, the mattress opens up, smells great, feels great.  It's a combination of latex and memory foam that eliminates the negatives of those and  brings you all the positives.  So you get this beautiful firm mattress with a supple top that breathes.  Man, and that's one thing.  I had a memory foam mattress.  I didn't like it because I didn't breathe.  This breathes.  Oh, and is it comfy?  It's cool throughout the night.  And the nice thing is you buy this online, which saves you a lot of money because they  don't have a middleman.  They don't have resellers.  They don't have showrooms.  You might say, well, wait, I want to sleep on it before I commit.  You can.  You have 100 days.  Buying online is completely risk-free.  Casper will give you free delivery.  You sleep on that mattress for up to 100 days or 100 nights, I guess.  And if you don't like it, any time in the first 100 nights, you call them up, the courier  will come.  They'll take it away, refund you every penny.  It is lovely.  It's so nice.  A good night's sleep, we're really learning, is an important critical portion of health  and wellness and a state of mind.  While you're there, check out Casper's pillows.  I have Casper pillows too.  I love them.  Another kind of dual layer pillow that is, get the king size because it's like a body  pillow and you just wrap yourself around it.

I've been on the radio in LA since 2004.

I could address the issue on stage and then win or lose tomorrow we'll have had our moment  in the sun.  You don't want to have it afterwards.  And you don't want to have it too far ahead.

She's like, I'm not getting that big phone.  I'm not doing it.  Meanwhile, her signal strength isn't as good as mine or cameras not as good as mine.  So people like that will be very happy.

Apple should probably upgrade all of its laptops because the Skylake processor is out.  Intel has put out the laptop version of that.  I doubt we'd see that in a MacBook though, would we?  Are they going to do the mobile?  Probably not.  Maybe the MacBook Pro.  Yeah, they'll do it in the Pro.  They'll probably do it in the Air.  Could.  Maybe we'll see a whole new...  Sometimes Apple slips those out and doesn't do an event.  This event is not a big event, right David?  What does the invitation say?  Loop me in?  Loop us in?

I would guess this is the Steve Jobs Theater or something like  that.  Wouldn't that be the first time they've done that?  I would guess it would be like that.

I have every room in the house that has Sonos, but it's hugely expensive.  It's really overpriced, let's face it.

There's a lot of competition.  Everybody's buying other people's speakers.  If you could, say, use something like a Chromecast audio to enable streaming.  I think the Chromecast does pretty good multi-room.  And maybe add a Dot to give it voice.  Or maybe Amazon.  Don't you think Amazon could do something like this?

Start time: 3695.04
End time: 3718.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

They're working on a whole new line of them.  I think with the Chromecast and Apple's Airport Express thing and some of the stuff they did  with Apple TV on audio...  Yeah, they tried this.

And I didn't really buy it that he sold his Macintosh tube amp and his Clipshorns.  I'm sure he kept those around.  You're probably right.  Yeah, I don't think that Hi-Fi sold all that well.

Let's put ourselves in their shoes.  To make a product, spend years on it, really believe in the product, think it's the greatest  thing ever, and people don't buy it.  It must be very...  You scratch your head.  Why?  What did we do wrong?  Does anybody really understand the American consumer?  Oh, look, here it comes.  I bought it.  I ought to get some mileage out of it.

Transcript:  It's funny.  Usually Ian brings us Britishisms,  but that was a Texasism.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite.  It's time to back up.  Oh, man, I had a painful call on the radio show today.  Guy calls up Omar.  He says, we got bit by ransomware.  I said, a business?  He said, yeah.  I said, well, that's okay, because you have a backup, right?  He said, the ransomware got copied to the backup.  So the only backup we've got is two weeks ago.  So the first thing I said is fire your IT guy.  He said, you're not the IT guy, are you?  He said, no.  I said, fire your IT guy,  because he didn't do right by you.  Next, get Carbonite.  Actually, Carbonite, on their website,  if you go to carbonite.com and you go to resources  up at the top there, and there's white papers,  they have a white paper on what to do  to protect yourself from ransomware.  Carbonite is a great solution.  It's backup done right.  See, what Carbonite does is it does versioning.  So even if you get stuff encrypted on your hard drive,  and even if it backs up the encrypted files,  you can always get back to the latest version  right before the encryption.  It's just the best.  If you're in business, if you're at home,  automatic cloud backup is the solution.  You don't want to backup next year.  Well, you could backup your next year computer,  but it shouldn't be your only backup.  You've got to get it off site as well  in case of a big disaster like fire or flood.  Carbonite cloud backup will protect the files  that keep your business or your home running smoothly.  You know, one and a half million people use Carbonite.  This is the stat I love.  They have restored 50 billion files to date.  That's 50 billion documents  that would have been lost forever.  That's kind of an amazing number.  Whether it's human error or disaster,  Carbonite protects you.  Start your free trial at carbonite.com.  No credit card required.  Use the offer code quit and get two free bonus months  if you decide to buy.  Right now is a good time.  They get 30% off as well.  Use the offer code twit though to get that benefit.  Carbonite.com.  You've got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right.  With Carbonite, I saw this poor guy Omar.  He was calling saying,  well, is there anything I can do?  And I said, no, and don't pay the ransom either.  Don't do like that hospital in LA did.  $17,000 ransom.  A lot of times what happens with ransomware,  it's kind of bittersweet,  is law enforcement cuts off the ransomware server.  So you pay them your Bitcoin,  but the server's down, you can't get your decryption key.  So, you know, once it happens, don't pay them.  Just, you know, bite the bullet and have a good backup.  Have a good backup.  That's something we can tell our readers.  Yep.  That's kind of one of the most important things to do.  You guys, college basketball fans, March Bandits,  you got the bug?

It's like having my mommy in every room.  So the guy...  There's this story...  Yeah, plug it in somewhere.  Oh, yeah, bring the plug too.  We can't just bring the Echo.  So this guy in Jersey is listening to NPR's Weekend Edition  and they did a story on the Echo.  And how it was helping customers do all sorts of things,  including set their thermostats.  So a listener wrote in to say that he was listening to NPR on his Echo  and reset his thermostat to 70 degrees.  Jeff...  This has been going on our listeners for a long time now  because many of our listeners have them.  Jeff said he was listening and she heard her name  and he started playing the NPR News.  So yes, you have to be careful when you say her name.  Although this is a problem.  They've added...  Now it used to be just A-L-E-X-A and Amazon were the trigger words  but they've made Echo a trigger word now.  So I don't know.  We're going to call it Bob.  We have to call it Bob.

So, Amazon did something interesting.  They made these two new Echoes, the Tap, which is an Echo without a plug.  It's a battery-powered Echo.  And they made a Dot, which is an Echo with just a little speaker,  the idea being you plug it into a big speaker.  That's why I ordered two of them, because that's really what I want.  I want to make my Sonos Echo aware.  But the only way you could buy it was through your Echo, which is weird.  It's Echo Inception.  Yeah.  Why did they do that?

It's less than a penny.  So you could easily have your own set of skills.  But there's so many skills now.  And they have to be enabled that it's kind of out of control.  You need a dictionary to do that.  So you listen to music.  We gave one to my father-in-law.  And he listens to Elvis all the time.  He says, Echo, play Elvis.  I think I just still really like hearing music sound good.  I know.  It's not the best speaker.

Transcript:  Well, I guess there's a little bit of a question.  For Amazon, for Echo, it makes a ton of sense right now  because you can buy lots of things from it.  For Amazon, it's huge.  I buy stuff all the time.  Exactly.  But for Samsung, they have...  What's the name of their Internet of Things?  SmartThings?  They bought SmartThings, which is a great...  In fact, the Echo works with SmartThings.  If you're Samsung, the likelihood is that you would have it  control those SmartThings products.  But Echo already does it.

Start time: 4937.02
End time: 4945.35

Start time: 4948.02
End time: 4966.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  since this is where they say they're going to spend some money  and develop and grow their company,  I feel like for all the folks who already have Sonos speakers,  like all three of us really,  they're going to have to sell some sort of device  that you plug into your existing Sonos speakers  to get them to control it.  You're not going to want to get rid of the hardware.

Start time: 4967.08
End time: 5002.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm feeling like Sonos,  what they said in their announcement was,  we're laying off people.  Oh, and by the way, forget that part.  We realized that people are,  what we focused on is playing your music collection.  Which is what they already do.  And we realized that's not the future  that most of our users are using streaming services.  They do support Apple Music now, they just added that.  Paul Thurotte says it stopped working with Microsoft's Groove,  his anyway, stopped working a few days with Microsoft Groove.  What is that?  It's what Echo says.  I don't think I know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's what happens,  Sonos lost track of the name.  But it does work with Spotify very well.  It works with Amazon Music,  your own collection with Tidal Music.  So Sonos does do a good job,  but I just feel like they say we're going to try to...  How do you go from 0 to 60 with voice recognition?

Start time: 5032.12
End time: 5045.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, I don't think it would be that hard  if you're Sonos, you are like a premium brand.  You make really great sounding hardware  that sells at a high price.  So it might be a small market for four Wi-Fi speakers.  But who do you go?

Start time: 5071.68
End time: 5089.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has those mics, so clearly they're aiming at this.  Yeah, I mean they...  I bought, I have...  I'm not going to buy all new Play 5s.  Which is why if you buy something like the Dot  that works with your Sonos speakers that has...  They should partner with Amazon.  Or it has Nuance built in or someone built in.  Why doesn't Amazon let this ecosystem just go everywhere?

Start time: 5166.30
End time: 5176.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

And those AI, those artificial intelligence assistants  or whatever, are much further along and more capable  than Alexa is.  I mean, the utility here is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but somehow it's qualitatively different.  David, I always quote you because when you were talking  about you, the first I'd ever heard to really explain  why drones were so interesting to people,  because for the first time they were seeing  their everyday life from a third dimension.  And it really resonated with me.  What do you think the secret...  So you're clearly good at just kind of figuring out  why these things catch on.  What do you think the secret is?  Why is the Echo so much better  than the better speech recognition in Google Now or Siri?

Start time: 5271.49
End time: 5285.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, for the Echo,  I think there's two magical elements to it.  One is its vocabulary is so small  that it's very accurate.  It has a very small number of things  it needs to understand.  And speaker independent,

Start time: 5285.80
End time: 5288.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so anybody in the room can talk to it without training.  That's right.

Start time: 5289.36
End time: 5300.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5300.26
End time: 5311.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  once you get to the multi-Echo situation.  We have one in the gym and one in the kitchen.  They both respond all the time.  So you have to put them distant from one another.

Start time: 5313.76
End time: 5322.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that would probably be the solution.  You know what?  That's why they added a third name  is that people are starting to get more than one Echo.  Yeah, that's probably why.

Transcript:  And they've created this next generation Siri  where it doesn't just look up information,  it actually executes it.  You can say, what liquor store has Vogue Cliquot  that's on my way to my brother-in-law's house?  So it needs to know the inventory of every liquor store.  It needs to know who your brother is, where he lives.  Or you can say, buy me an aisle seat to Austin  this Friday after 6 p.m. and returning the following Monday.  It will know what all that is.

Start time: 5364.34
End time: 5380.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This always frustrates me because Apple bought Siri  and then took some of those features out.  You used to be able to make reservations with Siri  when it was an app and they took it out.  So good for them.  So they must have cashed out.  They got their three years with Apple,  got their stock vested  and they're going off to do it once again right this time.

And it can do hundreds of different commands  and you can stack the options like that  in a conversational way.  So you can say,  find me five-star pizza restaurants with Wi-Fi  that are open until midnight tonight.  I found a Domino's Pizza near you.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're wrong.  Why is Domino's so good?  Why don't robots know about good pizza?  Sound Hound is an...  That actually validates your point  that Sonos could come up to speed pretty quickly  because Sound Hound, how did they...  They had the technology to listen to music.

Start time: 5431.57
End time: 5488.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've spoken with the CEO about this  and what he said was,  this was their goal the whole time.  They've been working on it for the last decade.  But Sound Hound was the product  that they needed to put out there  to create a company and have ECs and stuff  kind of on board.  That was their interim.  And they were able to build a little bit  of the speech recognition and things like that.  So this, they say, was the goal the whole time.  But it works quite well.  And they have open APIs.  So Sonos could come up to speed really quickly.  I think what they need to do is,  just as Dave mentioned,  buy somebody.  is get those Ray mics,  build the hardware, get it out there.  Boy, I think it's harder said than done.  I don't think it's something  that can happen right away.  But in the next year,  I think Sonos could have a small little device.  And like you mentioned,  they have those Ray mics  in the current Play 3, right?  Or Play 5.  The current Play 5.  I mean, they're already making steps  in that direction anyways.

Start time: 5505.80
End time: 5551.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a long history with speech recognition,  not by any foresight on my part.  I got a horrible wrist ailment called Tinosynivitis.  It's like some inflammation thing.  And I couldn't type.  In the late 90s, I was having serious,  I only do two things, right?  I type and I play the piano.  Those are my two careers.  And the doctor said,  simple, just stop using your hands.  Great.  So I started with Power Secretary.  What?  A $2,500 program.  I remember that one.  The very first speech recognition  from what is now Nuance.  And you spoke like this.  You had to separate words.  It was unbelievable.  So that's how I started.  At the end of the day, I'd be like,  hi, honey, how was work?  Period.

The president spoke.  So there would have been more news there this year, but we just felt like there's other  events like we're going to cover NAB.

I'll tell you something about beards.  You still have to shave, don't you?  You don't just let it go crazy.  You've got to groom around the beard.  You don't want it to be the neck beard.  I've got to get you Harry's.  Where's my Harry's?  Look at this.  Here we go.  I'm going to give you this.  Harry's makes the best razors, and they sell them to you at  half the price of the drugstore blades.  In fact, they come to you direct from the factory in Germany.  Harry's, when they started, they said, where are the best  blades made?  Well, there's two companies.  There's two factories in Germany.  Okay, let's buy one.  And they did.  And they engineered the blades for performance.  They engineered the blades for sharpness.  Man, this is a great blade.  I have the Winston set at home because that's got the...  In fact, I got the Winter Winston with the copper  handles, beautiful.  This is a Truman with a plastic handle.  Winston sets are metal handles.  But really, it's the blades that really are what matter.  Everything is beautifully designed, and they come right  to your door.  And if you're paying 32 bucks for an eight-pack,  forget it.  Get Harry's.  Now, here's a great deal.  This is something new.  For a limited time, they're so confident you're going to  love your Harry's shave.  They're going to let you try it for free.  So go to harrys.com slash twits.  Sign up for a shave plan so you'll subscribe to blades and  either the gel or the cream.  I like the cream.  A lot of people like the gel.  And that will be shipped to you, depending on how often you  shave every month or every other month.  But when you do that, they will then send you a beautifully  crafted kit with a razor handle, with a five-blade  cartridge, the starter set of Foam and Shave Gel,  and a travel cover.  All you have to do is cover the $3 shipping charge.  So it's a great way to try Harry's.  subscription.  You don't have to worry about it.  But I think you're going to like it.  It's the best shave ever.  And everybody I've given Harry's to, including you,  Nathan Oliverus Giles, it's time to clean up that neck beard.  I give you your Harry, your first Harry's kit,  harrys.com slash twit.  I'll have one for you next time.  All right.

Transcript:  Go away.  Hey, some sad news.  Actually, an interesting story.  A guy named Robert Palladino who taught for many years  calligraphy at Reed University, and that's where Steve Jobs  credits him in that calligraphy class with his sense of design.  Steve, as some know, went to Reed, couldn't afford to stay  there, only went there I think for one semester or two,  but ended up after dropping out continuing to go to the classes,  he audited Robert Palladino's calligraphy class and became  a lover of great fonts and typography.  Palladino was a Trappist monk for many years.  He was a great writer.  He was a great writer.  He was a Trappist monk for many years, a Roman Catholic priest  and a calligrapher, and he passed away, I'm sad to say,  on February 26th at the age of 83.  For years he would give babies he baptized,  baptismal certificates that he had handwritten out there.  That would be something to have.  And of course, you know there's a font called Palladino  and Macintosh and that's a tribute to Father Palladino.  He says, I never met Steve Jobs.  He was actually, he says, because he taught him,  so I guess he met him, but I don't think he really kind of  remembers Steve Jobs, but he was very glad that he had some  influence on him, although he never owned a computer.  Wow.  No, had no interest.  He liked to write.  He did have an iPad Pro.

It really roiled the chess world because people didn't like  the idea that a computer could best,  the best human in the world easily.  Well, 20 years, fast forward 20 years, they've never been able  to make a Go playing computer.  It's very hard.  It's a 19 by 19 board.  There's only one kind of piece.  It's just a stone.  You place pieces on the board.  You take turns placing pieces.  And the goal is to occupy territory.  You know, there's small versions of Go.  Kids often play with a five by five board.  Same idea, you surround territory to command it  if your pieces are in there and your opponent surrounds you.  He takes your pieces off.  At the end of the game, you count how many squares you  control.  Whoever controls the most squares wins.  It's a very difficult game to play for computers,  for humans too.  And for people.  It's kind of a complicated game.

He's like Michael Jordan in Go.  Yeah, you might say that.  He's not currently the number one ranked player.  In fact, there's another guy who is number one who says,  all right, I want my turn.  AlphaGo, created by a company called DeepMind, Google  bought DeepMind in the fall of last year, was the first  computer designed really to win at Go.  It played a bunch of games against less proficient  players.  But more importantly, it was a learning AI and it played  tens of thousands of games against itself and taught  itself to play, which is fascinating.  It was a five game match.  Game one, the computer wins.  Shocking.  But Lisa Dole said, well, wait a minute.  I didn't play that well.  Game two, the computer wins.  Shocking.  But still there was some question, is the computer  playing well or is Lisa Dole thrown by the computer's  style, which is non-human?  Game three, which was on a Friday night, the computer  wins again.  And this time, for the first time, I heard a number of  Go players say, no, you know what?  This computer played better than any Go players ever  played.  And that's it.

Like a human at all.  At one point in one of the matches,  the machine made a move that was so unusual,  Lisa Dole got up from his seat and left the room  just to contemplate.  He was shaking.  He was shaking.  And he's still on the clock.  I mean, it's a lot like chess where you're on the clock.  And so it affects you to wait, but he was just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we had on the new screensavers,  we had the president of the American Go Association  on to talk a little bit about this,  because you need to have a Go player to explain it.  He said, one of the things that happens with Go is,  as you're playing the game as a human,  you're always calculating, well, how far ahead am I?  How many more squares do I control?  And even if you're 19 ahead, you kind of continue to build.  If you're 19 behind, you work harder.  He said, the computer doesn't work that way at all.  It's calculating its chance of winning the game.  It doesn't care about the current standing.  It's just saying, what's the best move to win the game?  Even if I only win by one square, I don't care.  And that's not how humans play Go.  There's also a lot of tradition in Go.  This Verge had a good Verge piece.  Let me show you a little bit of the game of Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is really cool.  I don't think I'm as fascinated by this as everyone else supposedly seems to be.  Maybe it's because I don't care about the game Go very much.  I know it's like a huge milestone for AI.  But it also kind of feels like when IBM's Watson beat a human being in Jeopardy,  or the chess situation you talked about.  Maybe I'm jaded or I've seen too many science fiction movies,  but it's kind of like, well, this was going to happen.  This was inevitable that a computer reached this point.

I don't know if you can still get it. My kids used to love it.  It gives you a creature and the creature's goal is to learn to walk.  So it tries many, many strategies of legs and walking.  It's got four legs and it learns to walk, but it takes a long time.  But watching it learn to walk is fascinating and creepy at the same time.  Breve Walker.  Breve Walker. My kids loved watching it.

Here's a, you want to watch a little video? Sure. Let's watch a little video.  These are the Breve Walkers. So what's creepy is it's not doing so well.  It's not doing so well. It's like a little, it's like they're all over the place.  Yeah. What it shows you is AI can evolve and a thing can learn.  And eventually over time it actually does learn to walk.  And in the meantime, there's some pretty funny failures, just like the ARPA,  Grand ARPA Challenge where the robots fall over.  Yeah.  Don't kick them though, because I think we really shouldn't exacerbate that problem  that we're going to face in the near future.  Oh, I was going to mention this before we had to let David go.  Google is working on voice recognition that's offline.  And because it's offline, it's a lot faster, like 20 times faster,  because it doesn't have to go to the server.  And isn't that really where Siri falls down a lot is I can't get on the network.  What did you say?  Yeah.  What's interesting about this is only 20 megabytes.

And you can just go to android.com slash beta, I think, and say, if you have one of those devices, you have a Nexus device.  I put it on my Pixel C, too, the split screen, makes the Pixel C quite usable, I think.  Interesting.  It's a revolution.  But what's interesting is how stable this is.  This is the first release.  It won't be out until, what is it, fall?  Yeah.  Or later.  And it's working pretty nicely.  There's a few little glitches here and there.  I like how it consolidates notifications into a single chunk, and then you can expand the chunk and see what, you know, all of the notifications are.  It really helps a lot with that.

So I don't know if maybe there's something wrong out here.  Anyway, nice.  And it's good that they released it.  And while I wouldn't recommend it on a phone that you absolutely need to have, I haven't  had any problems with it, which is surprising.  It means it's closer.  And I think it's one of the reasons they released it.  It's closer than we thought.  As to what they will name N, they're not saying.  It's got to be a dessert.  It begins the letter N.  OK, here's a quiz.  Nougat.  That's what I think.  But here's a quiz.  Can you name all of the Android dessert versions?  Oh, I can do it.  I won't make you start.  Well, they never released.

Transcript:  I want to know what you guys think.  So we're hearing a lot of people say that they are now being automatically upgraded  from Windows 7 and 8.1 to Windows 10, like without permission.  We've said for a while, watch out, because first of all, they put that really annoying  ad on Windows 7.  You're ready, you can understand.  Okay, that was bad.  I think we're going to have to do a little bit of a review of that.  But then they moved the Windows 10 upgrade to recommend it in the update process, which  means for a lot of people, if you have, I think it's even the default in Windows,  recommended updates are automatically applied.  But even then, it would download Windows 10, that's annoying enough, and then put up a  thing saying, I'm ready, you're ready to go?  And you would still have to say yes.  Except I'm hearing more and more from people who say, no, I woke up in the morning and  I was using Windows 10.  That's wrong.  That's terrible.  And now they've done even another bad thing.  This is from Woody Leonard on InfoWorld.  They just pushed out a patch Tuesday on Tuesday, KB3139929.  It's a security patch for Internet Explorer.  And it says, this security update resolves several reported vulnerabilities in IE, the  most severe of which could allow remote code execution.  Yikes, that's bad.  Gotta patch that, right?  Oh, dot, dot, dot.  Additionally, the security update includes several non-security-related fixes for Internet  Explorer.  Well, you know what it does?  It says, this update adds functionality to IE 11 on some computers that lets users learn  about Windows 10 or start an upgrade to Windows 10.  Now what you'll get is a blue banner when you open a new tab in IE, which is a new tab  in Windows 10.  Now, here's the worst part.  This is a critical update.  You're going to get it.  so you might want to know that versus...  and then it will say, OK, restart.  But that's appropriate because that's security.  So you can't upgrade.  So you can't upgrade.  So you can't upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're in a cockpit.  So it kind of fits.  You can't move around, which is one of the problems with VR is you saw that kid walking  and falling over.  You want to force people to sit down and just look around like this.  It does very well with that.  And so that's what you're in.  You walk in a Valkyrie cockpit and you take off.  But I think No Man's Sky is the one.  I keep talking about that.

Transcript:  It's a lot easier, I think, for games than it is for movies, for example, which Spielberg  and some others are experimenting with ways to do that.  But it's a complicated question.  Also the reason the director is there is to show you what to watch.  You're not supposed to be like, oh, Jurassic Park, you're looking the other way from the  T-Rex.  Oh, what happened over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  worlds.  I would think, though, when this game comes out, they'd have some sort of online component  so you could find your friends and do things together.  They've got it, right?  I mean, solo play, you might just be anywhere, but maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm very intrigued by these ice plants.  You can't stay outside too long because you'll freeze.  Some of them are inhabited.  Some of them are not, but all of them have sentinels that will get you if you do bad  things.  I think this is...  To me, this begs to be a VR title because you're really in this immersive world.

End time: 8171.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's a story they haven't talked about, what that story would be so far.  But yeah, you can shoot...  So the example you brought up of the sentinels doing bad things, there was one planet I went  on and just to see what would happen, terrible, I shot a bunch of...  You shot an animal.  Don't shoot the animals.  And the sentinels came out and then they're trying to...  They're trying to kill you.  And the thing is, if you kill the sentinels, they get stronger and stronger.

Start time: 8171.98
End time: 8191.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's more and more and there's big walkers that come after you.  I think the best thing to do if you shoot an animal is get off that planet right away.  Right away.  It could be Spore.  Remember Spore?  How excited we were about Spore?  How we thought this was going to be?  It was from a great guy and a great team and Maxis and it was terrible.  This could be that.

End time: 8221.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing with Spore is I don't think anybody got to play it before it came out.  There was like a veil of secrecy around it.  Oh, really?  Interesting.  And Will Wright was talking about how it was going to be like the game to end all games.  It was like sort of that guy Peter Molyneux who does the fable and black and white who  just like oversold the game before it came out.  I think Will Wright has learned his lesson.

On the Monday following the switch to daylight savings time.  Nine million.  Now they did a study in Indiana.  Indiana kind of some of its daylight saving time.  Some of it's not.  They did a study in Indiana.  This doesn't save energy.  It costs them an extra nine million in energy.  This is why we did it in 1918 to save energy.  It doesn't save energy.  It's for the farmers you might say.  No.  Farmers save energy.  It's for the farmers you might say.  No.  Farmers don't care.  They have electric lights now.  They don't care.

And you love it Evan, right?  Yeah.  Or the Navajo reservations for some reason observe it.  But let's leave time alone, shall we?  I think it's time.  Stop DST.com.

But because UTC doesn't observe DST, we're at a new time UTC.  And I have to do the math.  We are at 2200 UTC.  If you want to watch live.  Do the math.  You can also be in studio.
