End time: 178.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody's wife did. Cashmere. I had to look me up because I try out everything and like,  I forget that I've been in something to look at it. That's your story, right?  And I thought and you're sticking to it. I tried this out and so I looked at it.

Start time: 179.21

End time: 200.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that, wasn't it? Like 90% men? 86% men.  86%? Yeah, I'm low.  So my wife's position is that there aren't real women in there. They're all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some some woman came out and said that she was hired at $35,000 a year to to create characters constantly.  Just every day she'd do like, you know, but look, it has a trusted security award.

End time: 228.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says they're right on the on the front trusted security award. It's not.  And it's 100% discreet until the until the database goes up.  Cashmere Hill in the Fusion wrote an article saying we should just not look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't look. That reminds me...  You've hurt your eyes.  I'm watching Russia Today.  There was one of the shows and the girl calls the co-host out. He was on there.  Oh, jeez.

End time: 263.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody sent me a note. I don't know if this is true or not, saying that it was actually Madison was not a double opt in system so that others could sign you up for it.  And you would appear in the database even if they did it as a prank. I don't know if that's is that true or is that?

Start time: 263.02
End time: 280.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure it's true. I got signed up by some joker to J date.  Oh, God, I get worse stuff than that.  Well, anyway, I kept getting these dating solicitations.  And now that was a J. I don't know how this happened, but it was J date and it was all everyone was in Syracuse.  It was just a ludicrous.  Well, the guy who signed you up was in Syracuse.

Transcript:  A lot of sites have gone in and said, like, in my blog post, I went in and I looked at at the list of government domains.  Yeah.  And found that there were five people with the city of Houston's domain who had signed up for it.  And that's fine.  That's I didn't want to go any further.  Oh, please go further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if you found that if you found, say, that a city council member or the mayor of a town was in it, you know, the question becomes, are they are they broken any laws?  Do they position themselves as being morally upright?

Start time: 346.38
End time: 348.98

Start time: 353.00
End time: 366.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If there wasn't a verification email, which apparently there wasn't, then nothing you find there is probably unless I guess they paid by credit card.  How did this work?  Maybe you can explain.  And that's how they pay per incident.

Start time: 367.43
End time: 371.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or how does that?  It's like all the rest of them.  They're all the same.  It's a monthly fee or?  It's a monthly, yearly fee.

Start time: 372.60

Start time: 380.36
End time: 382.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't going to say you went there.  That's been all over the place.

Start time: 383.00
End time: 395.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's been all over the place.  We had it on our site.  That is the place.  The you know, that is they were matched up by credit card.  So if you if they were able to match the credit card to email address, you know, that's that's much heavier than you're busted.

Start time: 396.10
End time: 401.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.  All right.  If Donald Trump were on there, that would be a story.

Start time: 404.00
End time: 406.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess.  Yes.  You'd have to do with it.

Start time: 407.14
End time: 409.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He'd be more likely to buy the place.

Start time: 411.41
End time: 412.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not prostitution.  It's not.

Start time: 413.59
End time: 421.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure the place is crawling with prostitutes.  But but that's that gets the guaranteed date.  But you would have to prove that.  Right.  I mean, it's not anything.

Start time: 423.08
End time: 432.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not against.  I don't believe that infidelity is against the law.  Maybe in Texas, it might be in the military.  It is not in the military.  It is.

Start time: 433.48
End time: 436.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there were a lot of military, a lot of documents, my domains in those emails.

Start time: 437.26
End time: 453.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is an indictment of somebody who signs up with his government address or his military.  It's stupid.  Indictment.  Right.  They're guilty of stupidity.  But what's the tech angle in this story that they claimed it was secure and safe.  They even have that trusted, verified.  I think that's tech angles.

Start time: 453.06
End time: 456.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is everything is like this.

Start time: 456.60
End time: 461.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you put something online, you can't guarantee it's safe.  It's security.  It's privacy.

Start time: 462.02
End time: 483.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think anyone who trusts the any of these sites, I think one of these days, the big  bust is going to be Facebook.  Amazon.  Amazon's interesting.  But Facebook deal with it because they never throw anything away on Facebook.  At least that's what they say.  So all your crazy personal photos that you have supposedly deleted can all be brought  back.  And it'd be pretty interesting.

Start time: 484.18
End time: 489.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the privacy one.  The financial one would be Amazon because it is.  They have credit card numbers.

Start time: 489.20
End time: 499.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have credit card numbers.  Is it possible to, if you're Jeff Bezos or Tim Cook, say, look, I don't care what it  costs.  This must be secure.  Is it possible to do that?

Start time: 500.73
End time: 500.82
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Start time: 501.47
End time: 501.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's impossible.

Start time: 503.30
End time: 508.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's nothing that would be hackable.  If it's on the Internet, it's not possible.  Interesting.  I mean, you could just...

Start time: 509.08
End time: 554.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've had this conversation.  We had this conversation with somebody who is an expert, Steve Gibson.  And I said, is there anything Sony Pictures Entertainment could have done differently?  Well, there's a lot they could have done differently, but is there anything they could have done  that would have been sufficient?  And then the counter example I use is Shelley Adelson, founder, creator of Comdex, sold  Comdex for a little bit of money and then built casinos in Macau that were just cash  cows.  His Sands Casino operation runs the back office operation for Vegas casinos, for Atlantic  City casinos, for Macau casinos.  If there were something in the world you would want to secure, it would be the back office  operations for a massive casino operator, right?  I mean, that's...  It would be one of many.

Start time: 554.63
End time: 556.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think banks are in the same league.

Start time: 556.10
End time: 569.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but banks have shown that they're kind of ignorant about this.  But you've got to figure, Shelley had the best guys on it.  He was hacked by Iranians.  So I think that proves your point that there probably is nothing that is unhackable.  If you're targeted...

Start time: 570.78
End time: 574.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're targeted, it's like if you, you know, yeah, being targeted is not good.

Start time: 574.56
End time: 587.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the tech angle, I think, that Josh Herman had it at the All, where he said that  this is...  It was one of the things we were supposed to read.  This is new territory in terms of the personal cost of hacking.

Start time: 588.44
End time: 590.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are not assignments, Phillip.  You don't have to...

Start time: 592.17
End time: 596.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I did my homework all day.  Yeah, no, there's different ways to pursue this.

Start time: 596.00
End time: 600.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't think of it as an assignment.  It's just what we might talk about.

Start time: 600.53
End time: 627.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  Anyway, his point was that it's one thing if your credit card gets hacked, you may lose  a little money, but usually the bank makes it good.  But if you were cheating on your wife and it gets discovered, that's real cost.  That's real personal cost.  And this is new...  His point is this is new territory for hackers.  And my question is, what was their motivation?  Were they trying to expose a fraud?

Start time: 628.10
End time: 639.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They came out with this...  The impact team.  They said that it was to...  They hated this site because it was encouraging sin, and so they went after it.

Start time: 639.83
End time: 641.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They furthermore claimed they'd been in it for years.

Start time: 642.44
End time: 665.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were also after it because they were charging $19 to expunge your data, and completely  you could quit and your data would stay there, or you could pay $19 to leave.  And even when you did that, there was still data that remained.  And in fact, when they did their dump, they had proof that indeed the $19 deletion didn't  delete.  And that incensed them.  It doesn't take much.

Start time: 669.33
End time: 674.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you credit that they felt it was immoral, does that imply that this is maybe Iranian  hackers or something?

Start time: 675.14
End time: 679.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, some guys.  They're Americans.  They're Americans.  I'm sure.

Start time: 680.08
End time: 682.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, English was their second language.  Is that what they said?

Start time: 683.02
End time: 683.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't see that.

Start time: 684.27
End time: 693.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was one of the things...  There was a Q&A with them and something didn't come across clearly and they said, is our  English not right?  Did you not get that because we didn't say it right?

Start time: 694.51
End time: 695.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.

Start time: 695.14
End time: 724.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you read the transcript, it was clear that they were not first time English.  I have someone who's a friend of mine who has a theory that women were involved in it  because there are three sites at Avid Life Media.  There's Established Men, there's Ashley Madison, and there's one called Cougar Town or something  like that.  And they said, Cougar Town can stay up.  That's fine.  That one's okay.  These other two have to go away.

Start time: 725.04
End time: 728.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So from that, they extrapolated that it's probably a woman or women are involved?

Start time: 729.54
End time: 731.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or a young man who happens to like older women.

Start time: 732.00
End time: 735.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on that database so we won't take that one.

Start time: 737.87
End time: 738.82
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cougar Town.

Start time: 739.10
End time: 786.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old would the Cougar have to be for you?  Maybe called Cougar Life, I think.  Cougar Town's better.  That's a TV show, isn't it?  Yeah, that's right.  That's what I'm getting at.  Here from Boing Boing, the TLDR on the Q&A, the hackers behind the breach.  First released snippets of data in July.  After nearly 30 days, they'd ended up 10 gigs, followed by another 20 gigs.  There's a third data dump of, I think, 30 gigs, and they say they have 300 gigs more,  including internal company emails, files.  This is a Sony Pictures-style hack.  How hard was it, the Impact team?  We worked hard to make fully undetectable attack, then got in and found nothing to bypass.  They prepared for the worst.

Start time: 787.42
End time: 789.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got nothing.  Yeah, no resistance.

Start time: 790.00
End time: 806.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was their security like?  Bad.  Nobody was watching.  No security.  Only thing was segmented network.  You could use pass1234 from the internet to VPN to root on all servers.  But they do have a trusted security award.

Start time: 806.12
End time: 810.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got the little sticker.  They got the sticker they felt was good enough.  They have the graphic.

Start time: 811.08
End time: 818.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When did you start hacking them?  Years ago?  A long time ago, in the readme of the first data dump over the past few years, they claim.

Start time: 819.94
End time: 823.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we know for a fact that this is actually the hacker or is this somebody?

Start time: 823.79
End time: 825.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that this is, they believe, right?  This is...

Start time: 826.30
End time: 830.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They use the same cryptographic key that they used to do the dump to contact them.  That's right, they have the key.

Start time: 831.35
End time: 855.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use the PGP key.  They say tens of thousands of user pictures are in the next dump, but we will not...  One third of them are intimate pictures.  I think penises is correct.  Okay, I was trying to avoid the word, but anyway, yes.  One third are dick pics and we won't dump them.  Not dumping most employee emails either.  So there is this kind of moralistic tinge to it.

Start time: 856.00
End time: 862.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they were supposedly the hackers for moral reasons.  It's very interesting.  I think it's a non-story.  Okay, well, we're moving on.

Start time: 863.00
End time: 863.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for the heads.

Start time: 864.26
End time: 865.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, don't you think it's kind of just...

Start time: 866.00
End time: 871.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not really a tech story, but it's hard to turn your...  It's like hard to...  Well, no, it's a tech and society story.

Start time: 871.20
End time: 877.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a society story.  It's where we have come to as a result of this and there will be more like this.

Start time: 877.12
End time: 887.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it is a cautionary tale, but you make a good point.  What are you going to do about Amazon?  I mean, you're going to not use Amazon?  What's the worst that can happen?  You get a new credit card.

Start time: 887.55
End time: 888.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, happens all the time.

Start time: 889.34
End time: 907.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, big payments from Target to Visa.  Was it Target?  It was Target, wasn't it?  That was hacked.  And of course, in the past, the tradition has been that the credit card companies just eat it.

Start time: 908.33
End time: 908.96
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Start time: 909.31
End time: 949.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Up to 50 bucks.  They just...  Well, they not only eat the liability, but they eat the cost of sending new cards out and all that.  8, 10, 2, yes.  This time, they went to Target and said, no, you guys didn't do the job.  They nicked them?  They nicked them for hundreds of millions of dollars and not an insignificant amount of money.  Issuers receive payment for some of their costs under rules laid out by Visa.  They have the choice whether to accept another payment that will reimburse them for any fraud.  Target agreed to reimburse Visa $67 million, and that's just one credit card company.

Start time: 951.08
End time: 988.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  So, Leo, you may not have seen this because it was kind of a regional story, but a month or so ago,  the law enforcement down in the Rio Grande Valley on the Texas-Mexico border  confiscated a bunch of credit cards that had numbers that had been stolen during the Target hack.  And that they had waited this long to start kind of producing these, and they were being distributed all along the valley.  And they shut them down.  But so far, a lot of the credit card numbers had not surfaced, and they just now are,  which so you're not safe for a while after something like this happened.

Start time: 989.81
End time: 1015.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will this be better now that they're putting...  I mean, all my credit card issuers are sending me cards with pins in them.  I mean, chips in them.  I got one.  No pin, just chips, because apparently it's chip and sign October 1st.  Yeah, chip and sign.  Which I don't know exactly what the benefit is to that.  None.  Yeah, I mean, we're still swiping a card or tapping a card and signing.  Like, that's your identification.  Chip and pin would be much more secure, and of course, we're the last country, I think, in the world not to have chip and pin.

Start time: 1015.32
End time: 1026.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because there's some...  I bet, I don't know this for a fact, but I noticed this took forever to get the smart cards,  because there's a patent. It would cost like 50 cents extra or something to make pay for this.

Transcript:  Well, Leo, here's the incentive. You probably talked about this.  In October, the rules change.  It used to be that the banks paid...  If there's any fraud, it went to the bank.  And starting in October, the link in the chain that had the weakest security pays up.  So all the retailers who are usually the weakest link are upgrading their equipment,  and all the credit card companies are putting the chips in,  and the whole thing is supposed to get more secure.  And whoever doesn't get secure gets stuck with the bill after October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because nobody...  If somebody steals my card and they go wandering into some place  and nobody cares enough to check ID or do anything,  and then the bank gets stuck with the bill,  there's no incentive for the retailers to try to put a stop to this.  They figure just the bank will pick it up.  Yeah, that's a plus.

They don't sell any themselves, but they do these reference designs.  You love the NUC.  I do. I'm a big NUC fan.  So they do these reference designs, and then companies come out and they make them.  The Intel-powered 2-in-1  is giving business owners, small business owners, what they want.  Both.  Not just one or the other.  They don't want to choose between A or B.  If both will help your business,  they want A and B.  It's not hard work or innovation.  It's hard work and innovation.  Versatility and strength.

Right on the off screen.  By the way,  did you notice the latency?  It's very good.  This thing just keeps up.  That's a problem sometimes with those Stylus devices.  They're a little lag  between when you draw it right on it  and then you can save it.  I made a mess but I saved it.  It's a permanent mess.  You just press the save button.  It's called a screen off memo.  There's a lot of nice features in this.

End time: 1505.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They sent me the  S6 Edge Plus and I like the edge.  I thought, well, if I was going to  buy one of these, what would the cases look like?  They have cases.  They're not very protective  because they have to expose the side of the screen.  That's always the weak point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on most of these cases.  Glass is glass.  You can have a gorilla case,  but if you hit a rock from the point  and the glass is going to break,  it doesn't matter.  This case is a flip case.  The funniest case that Samsung is offering,  and I don't think it's available yet,  is a keyboard case.  Have you seen that?  It makes it like a Blackberry.  But not, because it flips around  from the back.  It goes right where the on-screen keyboard is.  When you tap a key, it taps  the on-screen keyboard.  That's how it works. It's not electrical.  It's tapping the screen for you.

Nothing on that one.  Oh, good.  I was shocked when earlier this week,  Google, without any fanfare,  Apple would have had at least an event,  put out a router.  The OnHub router.  I read about it somewhere.  It immediately went there.  It was already sold out almost everywhere.  I think Jason...  Did you get one?  Who got one? Oh, Jeff Jarvis, I think,  went to Walmart and got one.  I ordered mine, but it won't be coming until October.  The Walmart one, they say, is just a few days off.  Why is Google doing a router?

Transcript:  Kind of like the Amazon Echo.  They put out a statement saying that they're not gathering  that information.  But, you know, I'm tempted  because there's some cool aspects of it.  The three lights.  If your thing is working, it's green.  If it's not working, it's red.  If there's something funny about it,  it's orange.  And then apparently there's tools that make it really easy  to figure out what's going on.  This is a piece of bad technology  that we're living with.  It is. They're crap.  They're cheap.  So someone who can come in and make routers  work simply and easily,  the way you want them to work,  that's a worthy goal.

Transcript:  The goal of the original Apple router  that they still sell,  but I suspect they don't sell a lot of them anymore,  was this very same thing.  It was supposed to be taking  an arcane piece of technology and making it simple.  But anyone, I think,  who owns one of the Apple routers  knows that when you get down to it,  it's not that simple to use.  One of the interesting things about this is  it's very limited. It has only one  hardwired Ethernet port.

Start time: 1912.02
End time: 1939.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't help with buffer bloat.  So buffer bloat is putting too much RAM  in a router.  As RAM got cheap, router manufacturers said,  hey, it couldn't hurt to have more RAM.  So they put more RAM in.  But the problem is, more RAM  broke  the prioritization of packets  in such a way that streaming media,  Skype particularly,  really can suffer from too much RAM.  They call it buffer bloat.  It's hard to know whether that router has

Start time: 1940.02

By the way, there's my name on the DSL Reports.  What's your name doing there?  I think we brought it down.  Avoid this man.  I think we brought it down. This is an HTML5 test.

It supports Weave.  It supports Brillo.  Brillo is the Internet of Things  OS that Google  announced at the Google I.O. this year.  Weave is their mesh networking  for smart  home appliances.

And his wife comes up to me after  and says, later this year,  she says, she won't say  any details. She says, later this year, you're going to have  plenty to write about.

I actually like a commute  because it gives you time to think.  It gives you time to listen to podcasts  and audio books.

I like what  Philip is saying in that  a lot of  times rumors make Apple  going all in on something, and then they  come at it from a different point of view.  The TV,  I think, is the best thing.  There were all the rumors that Apple was going to do an  actual television set, and  they never have, and probably never  will. I think what they'll do is  they'll look at ways to make driving  more pleasant, or to make  the controls  of it more Apple-like.  That seems unlikely. Why would  Ford go to Apple

They already got burned by Microsoft.  Microsoft Car.  I think it's one thing to have an  entertainment system in there. After all, they use  QNX now, and Android cars.  But another thing entirely,  for some third party to do the  drive train, to do the drive electronics,  I think that scares an auto manufacturer.  I think that no auto manufacturer wants  to cede that responsibility  to a third party. I would guess.  I think it'd be a hard sell

You need access to the accelerator, the brake,  the gear shift, the clutch, the steering wheel, all of that stuff.  No clutch. You don't need a clutch.  It seems pretty obvious that Apple's doing this.  Unlike the TV rumor where you didn't see all this kind of noise around it,  you're seeing a lot of noise around this Apple car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was assistant state editor when I came to the Chronicle in 90.  But I had done a lot of freelancing from maybe 85 on occasionally doing tech stuff because I was interested in it.  All you had to do was know a little bit and you were the guy.  I was running at the alternative newspaper I worked for in San Antonio, the San Antonio Current.  I was running a computer bulletin board in the early 80s as an online newspaper.  We were putting our stories up there, although it was a modem.  We only had one line so you could dial in, read, hang up, someone else dial in, read.  It was an online newspaper.

Apple says, lies, damn lies and statistics.  Why are they saying this? Why?  A survey from a company called Music Watch, 5000 people, which at least earlier this week,  said that 48% of those who tried out the new Apple Music service had stopped using it already.  Apple says, oh no, the number is much lower.  And I would guess Apple would know.  Well, but maybe they lie.  Maybe they're lying.  79% of people who sign up for a trial are still using the service.  To me, this is all moot because it's still free.

Start time: 3555.62
End time: 3580.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We won't know anything until October when the three-month trial is over.  And then we'll only know if Apple chooses to tell us.  Now this story was like fun with bad stats.  Almost everything in the original Verge story was wrong.  Apple had announced that 11 million users had signed up and were using it.  And they made it 11% of iOS users.  It's really more like 1.5%.

Start time: 3583.88
End time: 3602.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was interesting to me that Apple came out quickly and actually said something.  Normally, even if something's wrong, they tend to stay in black box mode.  And it was interesting that they came out very quickly and corrected the numbers.  Do you think they're a little sensitive to the whole thing?  I think they are sensitive to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think also, I mean, it's not like Taylor Swift where they changed their business model on a Sunday.  That's clout.  I think we may be getting a little bit of the Jimmy Iovine influence.  I mean, he knows what a bad story in Music Watch means.  He's not going to take that line down.  And it also may be a little bit of the, you know, Katie Conten is dead and now we have Steve Dowling.  And everything in Apple PR has loosened up a little bit.

Start time: 3638.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Katie is not, we should hasten to say not actually dead.  She's not dead. She's gone.  She's probably not even sick.  She's relaxing. She's probably a lot better off than she was.  Former beloved Apple media spokesperson, but somebody who really kept it tight-lipped on a tight ship.  Yeah, that might be.  I think a responsive Apple to this kind of thing though does kind of indicate that they care enough  to make sure that the perception is at least that Apple Music is viable.  I don't see anything particularly different from any of the other services.  Not enough to switch.  And furthermore, we've heard a number of tales of woe from even from Apple stalwarts like the loops Jim Dalrymple.  I think probably scaring people off a little bit.

Start time: 3685.14

Well, the day, you know, I got into the trial and got into it and the light bulb went off when I bought or added to my music the $150 box set for every song Pink Floyd ever did.  Oh, man.  And I have access to that and I don't have to pay $150 for it.  And so when I, when that happened, I kind of went.  That's a big difference.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I am.

But really, there's a lot of people for whom that is not the case.  Nevertheless, more and more we're seeing the assumption that you just kind of have high speed, unlimited bandwidth.  In fact, T-Mobile, though, if you do have a T-Mobile, doesn't charge you for data for most of the music services, Spotify, Apple Music.  You could stream all you want.  It doesn't cost cost you anything.  Huh?  Yeah, I think if you add, if you add the file to my music, if you do it, click on that plus button and add it to my music, you can stream it.

Transcript:  How about this?  I got a message today from a very disgruntled Apple customer.  He wants to use Apple Family Sharing.  His kid, he's got a kid, is 12 years old.  And the nice thing about Apple Family Sharing is that you can buy music, TV shows, movies, share it with your kids, Apple ID, and then they don't have to buy the music they can listen and watch.  But in order to do that in the U.S., I don't know if it's the same in Germany.  You sound like you guys are using it because I seen nodding heads in the U.S.  I think the Apple Protection and Privacy Act, COPPA, somebody under 13, they have to take special privacy precautions.  They need, before you can do this, your kid has to create an Apple account and you have to prove that as a parent you're approving this.  So this guy was pissed because he says, I don't have a credit card. I have a debit card. That's what I use.  They won't accept a debit card. Apple says, why is this? Most debit cards are acceptable.  Because I guess kids can have debit cards.  This is the way of this is Apple's method. I don't think COPPA specifies how you prove it, but they do require that the company makes, you know, verify that the parent is approving this.  So the way Apple does it is what's the what's the CVV? What's the security code in the back of your credit card?  And then that way they know, well, you're an adult because you have the credit card. So, yes, we're going to let you create this account.  What do they do in Germany? How do they verify? Do they verify something similar?  So this guy was pissed. He says, I'm going to have to get a credit card to do this.

What about Dre? What about Dre?  You know, it's funny when when Apple acquired Beats, of course, the chief acquisition at Beats really wasn't one hundred ten thousand subscribers to their streaming music service.  It certainly wasn't the headphones. It was Jimmy Iovine.  It was Dr. Dre and it was Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, the people, the musicians, the musical people behind the scenes at Beats.  And Glenn Rubenstein over here, one of our great guys who was a music promoter and booker, said, you know,  Dre's history with women is not so hot. Apple might not really want to promote this Dr. Dre nexus.  I would agree with that. And now that Straight Outta Compton is out, the movie about NWA and some stories are resurfacing about Dre.  One example, him beating up in a club, beating up a woman reporter because he didn't like what she'd written about NWA.  I think she implied that Ice Cube was more important than Dr. Dre.  So he takes her in a stairwell and literally pins her down and pummels her.  Stories like this. Dre is now apologized to all the women he's hurt. So that's OK. Everything's fine.

Start time: 4083.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No reason to personalize it. Apple actually issued a statement. Did they? What they say?  They said he, you know, he says he's a change. He apologized. He's a changed man. You know, move on.  I suppose it would be. Yeah, I don't think I Jimmy Iovine seemed to be the guy that they were pushing the hardest in that beat steal.  And I thought I thought Dr. Dre disappeared pretty quickly.  I mean, he was in one picture showing his Apple watch and I hadn't heard from him again until this new album came out.

Then it goes out of the way because it is a mirrorless,  so there's no mirror, but there's still a curtain.  But if you turn it to silent, it does a digital curtain  because it's a video camera basically.  So you don't have to have a shutter.  You just turn it on and off real fast.

Transcript:  So I'm walking by the barbershop yesterday.  Let me see if I can find this photo.  I'm walking by the barbershop yesterday and I look through the window and this kid,  he is not happy about getting his haircut.  He's making the most sour puss face I ever saw.  I came in, I said, can I take your picture?  I asked his dad, can I take your picture?  I said, he's just he looks so miserable.  Probably his first haircut.  Under there. That's what I thought.  Oh, it's it's a first haircut or something like that.  So I said, I said, why are you so that's somebody else?  Why are you so that at HDR?  Yeah. Why are you so look at that?  I said, why are you so unhappy?  So I'm not unhappy listening to audio book.  I said, why he's pulled out his iPod touch.  He was listening to Diary of a Wimpy Kid while he was getting his haircut.  I have high hopes for the future of this country.  Isn't that awesome? Yeah.  I don't think how do they cut around the ear buds?  You know, I didn't see earbuds, but I don't know how he's listening.  Maybe it's coming through. I don't know.  Coming through the sheet.  It was the cutest thing I ever saw.  Just hearing it in his head.  No, he showed me it was a diary for Wimpy Kid.  He showed me it was he had it on his iPod touch.  I didn't mean he did anything.  We love audible.  We love audible. Kids love audible.  Adults love audible.  One of the things that research shows is that kids who listen,  you would think, oh, I want the kid to look at a book and read it.  Kids who listen to audiobooks, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, great choice,  become better readers because they're listening.  They get engaged. They also bring out the book.  They look at the book.  I want to talk a little bit about a group of kids that,  you know, James Patterson, of course, the great bestselling author.  He is teamed up with audible to help a group of kids.  They call them reluctant readers.  James says, I was a reluctant reader.  My dad was a reluctant reader.  But reading is so important.  I think it's maybe the single most important thing a kid can learn in school.  So Patterson is on a personal mission to inspire kids to discover that reading is fun.  It's entertainment. It's great.  And this summer he's partnering with audible to create a program that encourages young readers  to make their way to books by listening to audiobooks.  I think we found one young reader who is very much into his audiobooks.  The program focuses on family listening.  I think that's a great idea.  I have very fond memories of listening to It's Not Easy Being Brown with My Kids.  It's just wonderful.  It recommends titles, suggests genres that parents and kids will enjoy together.  In fact, Patterson's put together a recommended listening list.  And audible, kudos to you audible, is providing those audiobooks at a discount.  Plus, reading guides for families, particularly on Patterson's featured series,  middle school, Daniel X, and Treasure Hunters.  They're having an Instagram campaign to have kids and families show where listening took them.  Countless studies have shown that listening to books improves early literacy skills.  It expands vocabularies. It elevates comprehension.  Narrators can bring the text to life, which helps kids there.  That's a great one, Treasure Hunters.  Which helps kids really get engaged in reading and in stories.  And they can listen while cleaning their rooms, while getting their hair cut, while on the road.  That's what we did. We were on a road trip and we listened the whole way.  It was so much fun.  For a special summer promotion to encourage reluctant readers, just a reduced price, just $4.95 a book, audible.com slash Patterson.  Patterson. P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.  I was listening to his, I wanted to hear his first book, Along Came a Spider.  Great book.

And I met everybody and I listened to their business model and I could tell.  There's no business model.  Well, their pitch was China. We've got a problem with China. They all want to have cars.  If all of China gets a car, the planet's going to heat up and go to hell.  So the solution is to give them Segways.  And these things were selling for what, $600 or $700?  No, no. I just bought two.

The saddest story of this all is that Segway was just...  Segway had fought for years to keep a Chinese clone of the Segway out of the United States.  It was fought successfully.

People say, no, first of all, didn't happen.  That was the New York Times taking straight aim at the owner of the Washington Post.  There are those who say, yeah, it happens.  It's a startup.  Well, 10 year old startup, but it's like, you know, it's a...  More than that.  It's a very engaged company.  When you go to work for a company like Amazon, you expect to work long hours, get emails  in the middle of the night and things like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you fall down?  My thinking on this whole thing has gotten...  I thought originally that it was the Washington Post versus the New York Times because they've  been chiding each other.  Right.  So somebody decided to take a pot shot at Bezos.  But now I'm thinking, this is, you know, if you look up unions versus Amazon, I think  you find the genesis of this thing.  Amazon's been fighting the unions left and right.  The big newspapers are all unionized.  I don't know about the Chronicle, but the New York Times is a huge union operation.  This is what it is.  It's just, give it to this guy because he won't let the unions in.  That's what I think.

Transcript:  What I think happened here is that, you know, when they talk to both current and older,  former employees, former employees usually have some kind of gripe.  And I think there are probably pockets where you have, you know, unacceptable managers,  managers who abuse their people, who kind of take the kind of approach.  And there are some who don't.  And there was a, in one of the later, the story by the guy who was an Amazon employee  who sought to debunk it...  Yeah, he published it in a meeting.  Right, right.  He was in a meeting, he said, where the guy said, yeah, we used to burn people to the  ground in this place.  And so I think they may have done that at one time across the board, but I suspect,  you know, that it's probably been diluted since.  And the New York Times probably just got kind of a blinder view of what actually happens  in there.  It's too complex for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say that they got chided by the ombudsman person, I think.  You know, the people who say, oh, you look at any of these companies, you look at Microsoft,  you look at Apple, you look at Facebook, and you get the same kind of behavior.  People went back to say, look at the soul of the new machine, the same kind of startup  intensity, the long hours.  That's a good point.  I don't think...  But I don't think it was the long hours that bothered people about that article.  It was the woman who had the miscarriage and was told she had to come back to work.  The bullying.  I do think that Bezos Bezos Bezos is different.  I think he's missing the gene for human empathy.  And he's got control of a company and a lot of people.  I could be wrong, but yeah.

Transcript:  You pointed us to Joe Nassera's piece in the New York Times, the opinion pages.  And I think the Salient article, Nassera writes, it's worth remembering that Amazon is a first-generation  internet company.  And his peers, including Yahoo and AOL, are a shell of their former selves, even as Amazon  has become ever more important and powerful.  Whatever you think about his methods, he has managed to keep Amazon absolutely relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he's burned through...  First of all, you forget that they already did a hit piece on Amazon for what goes on  in their warehouses.  There was no air conditioning.  People were being worked to death.  And finally Amazon, okay, they put the air conditioners in.  This is strictly about the white collar workers, their upper level management.  And I totally believe what the Times reported, that they work these guys just as hard as  they possibly can.  And when the guys start to break down, they get rid of them and bring in a new crop.  They're treating people like they're fungible.  There's plenty of people who would be happy to work at Amazon.  You get a good training.  You can only do it for so long because there's too much.  Other companies aren't like that.  People get hired by Apple to do a certain job and they stay there for 30 years.  There's got to be something different about Amazon.

Start time: 6106.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Twenty years ago, last July, Time ran a cover story on cyber porn that was immediately ripped  to pieces by the civil libertarians, among others.  Mostly Mike Godwin, the Mike Godwin of Godwin's Law, that any internet discussion will eventually  invoke Hitler.  Anyway, the source for this story was a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate who purported to count  how many pornographic pictures there were.  This is the early days of the internet.  So we're talking about Usenet and porn, BBSs.  And you know, Time just loves two things.  One exclusives and two numbers.  So he was offering us an exclusive access to the numbers of pornographic pictures on  the internet.  And I was a green enough writer to get a cover opportunity.  I just I ran this thing late in the week about Thursday as I'm finally reading this report.  And I'm starting to think, oh, this is really shoddy research.  But I was too deep into it and I was too green.  And I went ahead and wrote this cover story.  And we had a picture of a kid with wide eyes and at a keyboard.  And obviously shot there.  Great photo.  You see it there.  Great photo.  It was a Photoshop thing.  And inside it had a naked man humping a computer.  I mean, the art was amazing.

Transcript:  The rule about any new medium is pornography becomes the first thing that makes money.  Anyway, the cover came out and Godwin, all the guys on the well, you know what that was?  I was a member.  Yeah, you still have a well address, I believe.  I know.  I finally...  The fortune got tired of paying $100 a year.  So I lost that account.  Anyway, they leaped on this cover and ripped it to the ground.  They hired...  They got some academics to look at the methodology and it was terrible.  So Rim hung around for...  His name is Marty Rim.  And he hung around for a couple of weeks.  He did an interview with the New York Times.  He was on ABC Nightline.  And then they started to find out about his past, which had some weird stuff in it.  And he disappeared.  And nobody had seen him for 20 years.  So we were coming up to the 20th anniversary and I thought, if I'm going to do something  about this, because it had kind of haunted me.  I'd looked for him.  Did you regret it?  Oh yeah, jeez.  It was terrible.  I had to stop writing.  I became an editor.  Really?  That's not hyperbole.  You became an editor.  Wow.  I edited science for 12 years.  Editors, as we know from last week.

They get lost in the desert.  They climb over these hills.  Mirages appear and disappear.  And they're about to die of thirst when they go over one more hill and there's an oasis.  And there's a pool of clean, clear, cold water.  And the writer goes and he sticks his head and he's drinking the water.  And the editor, he realizes, is standing behind him pissing into it.  And the writer says, what the hell are you doing?  And the editor says, it's okay.  I'm making it better.  That's a good joke.

They say they're sort of interested in my story about it, but they feel uncomfortable  about hiring a detective.  But they said, if you want to do it with Kickstarter, that's okay with us.  Raise the money on Kickstarter.  It took me like three days and hired the guy and got a home address and a work address.  And I waited and I thought I had fantasies of doing a whole podcast and I taped a bunch  of interviews with everybody around the story.  And then I finally said, I got to go try to find the guy.  So I drove down to, he lived outside White Plains and I took a day and I drove down.  I really, really in the morning, I parked outside his house and I waited and waited  and waited and waited and nobody ever came out.  And I knocked on the door and the dogs were barking and finally gave up.  And I went to his place of business where before she wised up to me, the receptionist  identified him from his picture.  Oh yeah, he works here.  And then, and then she got freaked out and wouldn't talk to me anymore.  Anyway, he was clearly ducking me.  In fact, he scrubbed all his link.  He's got a new name.  He changed his name.  He changed his name.  Why was he ducking you?  You know, I'm not quite sure.  It may be that...

They targeted websites providing illegal and harmful information.  Falun Gong.  Yeah.  And or advertisements for pornography, explosives, firearms, and gambling.  I have mixed feelings about this.  You know, we talk a lot about porn on the net or whatever, but you want the opposite,  which is this kind of censorship.  That's where it's all headed.  I hope not.

Transcript:  And that's our bread and butter.  But but but one thing I can say is that because this this is my job now is I can see our traffic from Facebook,  from Twitter increasing as the homepage declines.  That's that is true.

Start time: 7293.22
End time: 7299.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 7300.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. We we probably post at least every 30 minutes stories from both our premium site and our free site.  You know, we have that strategy of a free and premium.  And and some of them really take off.  Some of them don't.  But it is a but we definitely and we don't post a story that people are expecting to see.  We hear about it.  So they are coming to Facebook looking for that.  I don't think that used to be the case.  But I think people now get on Facebook and say, I'm going to see what the news is.

Start time: 7376.12
End time: 7388.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're huge is the thing.  That's why I'm I'm willing to believe this, because Facebook is so big.  And it's really about people going to read stories, whereas Google is really a search engine.
