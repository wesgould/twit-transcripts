Transcript:  Fun, fun fact for everyone. I don't have a driver's license.  Oh, so that's going to be really fun for me to figure out in Seattle is it going to be like I'm trying to figure out like, do I get a car?

Start time: 348.20
End time: 350.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you have to get if you're on the West Coast, you have to have a car.

Start time: 350.88
End time: 362.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my husband's going to get a car.  The bigger question is, do I like and I'm not sure because there is public transit and stuff.  So we will figure that out.  I don't know. Are you going to be in Seattle or are you going to be in Bellevue, Kirkland?

Start time: 362.96
End time: 367.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 368.23
End time: 374.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  So we have we'll have a temporary place to stay for a couple of months and then we'll figure out the living situation.

Start time: 374.82
End time: 392.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just remember, it's not just about transportation on the East Coast.  I know because I've lived on the East Coast having a car is difficult just because there's nowhere to put it without paying an exorbitant amount of money.  There's parking on the West Coast.  We can put our cars places.  So I know you don't believe me now, but driving can be an enjoyable experience.

Start time: 393.74
End time: 400.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't believe you, but I will get that a thought.  All right. Let's let's go ahead.

Start time: 401.82
End time: 547.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's jump in because we do actually have a rare a rare opportunity to talk about a new story that didn't just break but is still breaking.  And one that unlike a lot of other tech stories, the non-tech press has picked up and ran with it because it is so big and it's so impactful.  Of course, we're talking about WannaCry.  There's a couple of things that we know about WannaCry.  We know that it was developed from the leaked Eternal Blue that was released by the Shadowbrokers.  That was an NSA tool.  But by the way, one of the very first reporters to pick up the story was our very own Kurt Franklin, who is a co-host on this week in Enterprise Tech.  Now we know that the initial infection was via emailed link or attachment.  So this was a it looked like a phishing attack.  But once infected, a computer would check a domain to see if it responded.  It would exploit an SMB vulnerability and some versions of Windows in order to spread laterally.  So once you had a computer on a network that was infected, it could infect other vulnerable computers on that network.  Then it installed the double Pulsar backdoor, which was interesting because that would stay even if you paid the ransom.  This is crypto crypto where and of course, it would demand three hundred dollars in bitcoins.  Now we have to wait for the numbers because they're still kind of trickling in.  But anecdotally, it looks like we're talking about over two hundred thousand systems.  It's probably going to end up being in the half a million systems by the time this thing is done.  It seems as if XP is taking the brunt of the attack.  Ten, as far as we know, is not vulnerable.  Eight, I think unless you've got one of the very first versions, it's not vulnerable.  So we're talking about XP, Vista and Windows 7.  But Windows 7, probably not because it's probably been patched.  Now, again, the first impact was hundreds of thousands of systems followed by one hundred and fifty countries, including Europe, Asia, some of the Americas, continents, not continents, continents, continents.  Yes.  It shut down manufacturing at Renault in France and Romania, shut down manufacturing at Nissan in England.  It also affected and this was the big one.  This is the one that caught people's attention.  Health services in Britain, which which evidently are running Windows XP.  And you actually had to have patients who were diverted because systems weren't working.  The intake systems weren't working.  Now, let's start with that because that's that's a good background.  Is this as people are calling it, this is the very first worldwide cyber attack.  I mean, the one that people have have looked to and said, OK, this is what we were waiting for.  It's finally here.

Start time: 548.18
End time: 577.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if I go ahead and say it's the absolute first one, but it certainly meets the scale we've been promised.  People say this is going to come.  This is going to happen eventually down the pike.  It's going to whack you in the face super hard.  And this is at least meeting that bill of sale.  I mean, there is actually a photo I saw on Twitter on the way up here of a Russian train like control area.  And so the screens actually just blocked off with the same malware we saw a second ago until they couldn't run the trains.  I mean, this was global and systemic across our important infrastructure and our life.  So I think it meets all thresholds of crisis.

Transcript:  Christina, what about it? Is this the digital Pearl Harbor?

Start time: 582.52
End time: 598.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if it's that, but it could be.  I mean, it certainly had the potential to be.  I mean, at least the first attack was mitigated.  But now we have all of these other variants that are coming out.  It's it's it's certainly scary.  I mean, I think it could be.  Yeah.

Start time: 600.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why do they only ask for three hundred dollars?

Start time: 601.84
End time: 615.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's actually this is very well studied.  That's the pain threshold below three hundred dollars and below.  People are saying that's less than the time it would take me to fix my system.  Above three hundred dollars, people are saying, I'll just go to a backup.

Start time: 615.98
End time: 640.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So the three dollars is the sweet point, sweet spot, pain point, whatever that thing.  That's amazing. Because, I mean, I was told that all the crypto from this is flowing to three separate wallets, three wallets total.  But I mean, it can't be that much money in aggregate if it's only three hundred bucks per.  I heard one of like thirty in it.  But I mean, to me, the amount of chaos has been caused for the small dollar amount.  Right. Really out of whack.  Like, what a bit of mischief for like some change.

Start time: 641.16
End time: 668.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, well, I mean, if you're just building, if you want to do it for the laws or you just want for a little bit of cash or, you know,  you they might be looking at, you know, you know, local laws like anything above a certain amount would go from a misdemeanor to a felony or whatever.  I mean, you have to there's a lot of things.  Plus, like you said, the threshold, if you're more likely to get three hundred dollars and five thousand dollars.  Right. Because you're like, you know what?  I'll just go to the bank. I'll get three hundred dollars. We'll pay it.  We'll just get just we just want this off of here.

Start time: 669.86
End time: 693.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've actually done studies about this because this is not the first crypto ransom software that we've seen in the wild where, yeah, six hundred dollars.  That's too much. People won't pay six hundred dollars on the on the most part unless it compromised a vital system versus three hundred dollars,  which is three Bitcoin or less than less than a third of a Bitcoin.  That's that's something that people are willing to look at and say, you know what?  It's worth me not being annoyed.

Start time: 693.80
End time: 701.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just love it that it's 17.6 percent of a Bitcoin is fine.  Point five Bitcoin way too much.  That's the thing. I want to think.

Start time: 702.43
End time: 709.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But regular people don't think in Bitcoin.  They just say three hundred dollars or like, you know what?  That's less than an Xbox or whatever.  I could just pay it and be done with it.

Start time: 710.02
End time: 752.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've read things before and I don't know how it works in this case, but I know that in other ransomware attacks,  you know, even getting people who are willing to pay the three hundred dollars going through the process of buying Bitcoin  and going through that is a challenge in and of itself.  And so you wonder to like there might be people who are willing to pay three hundred dollars  but aren't willing to go through the hassle of going through a Bitcoin exchange and signing up for those accounts  and connecting things and setting up a wallet and transferring stuff over.  You know, so you have to wonder to like how much potential like why maybe the amounts are less just because  depending on who your target is, they might not be willing or able to go through that process.  That all sounds very valid.

Start time: 753.16
End time: 761.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the fact that they shut down the NHS for less than the price of a three day pass to outside lands.  Ironic in some ways. It's kind of funny to me.  They don't know where it's going to go, though.

Start time: 763.64
End time: 768.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, they released it into the wild and they just assume it's going to hit certain computers that are vital.  I know that's so irresponsible.

Start time: 768.84
End time: 774.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, Robbie made a good point about like for the lulz, you can't be that indiscriminate and that awful for the lulz  unless you really have to know.

Start time: 775.31
End time: 814.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really what for the lulz is though.  Unless you look at it and you say, OK, what percentage of computers are running Windows 95?  What percentage of computers are not patched?  And you're just like, you know, if we just ask for three hundred dollars, every single hospital, there's a lot of hospitals, that's three hundred dollars.  Every single small mom and pop shop, three hundred dollars.  Every single little place that's still running Windows 95 because A, they can't afford to update their hardware, their software.  B, they're using legacy software that they need for their business.  A lot of hospitals have to use old stuff for their business.  You know, people are like, why didn't you patch it?  Because if they do, it'll break something that's very important to keeping somebody alive somewhere.

Start time: 815.96
End time: 913.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a great thread on Twitter, I think from a Microsoft employee who works on .NET stuff.  And he was kind of talking about how these fifteen million dollar like MRI machines are running Windows XP embedded  because when the machines were created, that was the most up to date modern embedded system you could use.  But the manufacturer might be gone.  And, you know, in getting a patch and getting things done is very complicated.  And there are a lot of things that go into why something can or can't be updated.  And it's not simple as to say, well, just update it because maybe the manufacturer isn't in business or maybe, you know,  support has been outsourced out to a lot of different areas.  And as you were saying, you know, Robert, like if updating one thing could break a bunch of other things and air gapping  and things like that and isolating things on the network is great, but you still need systems that need to talk to one another.  It's a really complex problem to solve, especially when you're looking at organizations like the NHS or hospitals in general,  where funds are cut all the time and they don't have big budgets to have security as maybe as up to date and as much of a priority as it is.  And it becomes very expensive to look at replacing certain systems that are working just because of something else.  You know, it's a really, really complicated problem when you start talking about these sorts of very important vital systems,  you know, like hospitals.  But I think that whoever created this and that'll be a very interesting thing is to figure out who's behind this,  depending on what part of the world they're from, even three hundred dollars, even thirty thousand dollars could be a lot of money to them.  And then if this continues to go on and affect more and more users and more and more people pay up, it could, you know, that that money,  that the value for them could go up, too.

Start time: 914.54
End time: 1012.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, let's talk a little bit about the mitigation, because here's a few of the things that we know.  We know that it didn't hit the United States as hard as it hit Europe for a couple of reasons.  One, we're on weekend, so everything is shut down already.  Two, by the time it rolled around to the United States, people knew about the attack.  And so the phishing emails were being blocked upstream.  So that really, really helped.  And then, of course, there was the accidental discovery.  There's a British researcher.  All we know is that he's known as at Malware Tech Blog.  He he works for an L.A.-based threat intelligence company, but he lives probably in southwest England.  He was looking at the traffic that the malware was generating and he noticed that it was it was beaconing to a domain that did not exist.  And so he registered the domain and the attacks abated.  If you were already infected, it didn't it didn't work.  But if the malware tried to install yourself on the system and it did receive a ping back from the from that that entry,  which was what we want to cry dot com or want to cry dot org, then it wouldn't install itself.  It was a kill switch. So he found that by accident, by accident.  But it worked. It very much mitigated it.  Now, here's here's the fun part.  And I really want to get your input on this because you've got the non tech press and even some of the tech press seen at CBS got caught up in this saying,  well, that was a bad attack, wasn't it?  And it's as if it's over.  And it's like, no, no, no, no, no.  In fact, this morning we've had security researchers who have been verifying on Twitter.  There is a second variant in the wild and they move the kill switch that will not work anymore.  That took what?  Yeah, I mean, not even that.

Start time: 1012.84
End time: 1029.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it was that simple to take down, you can correct that mistake.  But I mean, for eleven dollars and some experimentation points to that guy for saving a lot of people, a lot of problems.  When I read that story, I thought it was almost like a joke.  Like this can't really be what happened.  But it's amazing. It also shows the power of one person tinkering around the edges even against a global catastrophe.  I like that idea.

Start time: 1029.82
End time: 1041.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it was from what I understand.  It was just a standard honey pot.  So he had a Windows XP honey pot.  He had a tap.  He got he watched the infection traffic and then he's like, oh, what's this domain?  Oh, it's not registered.  Let me register it.  Oh, wow. That fixed it.

Start time: 1041.84
End time: 1054.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I can track.  I can track it with this tap.  I can track the pings coming from all the different IPs.  Oh, well, I fixed it.  And of course, everyone can be just like the person who made the variance just like, oh, yeah, let me just take that.  It was literally let me take out that check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the story that I read about this particular solution was that when they first did it, they thought they made a mistake and they made it worse.  And they were like, oh, no.  And they were freaking out.  And then it turns out, no, it's the direct opposite.  But you can imagine the emotional whiplash you would go through like, wow, what's this?  I've made it worse.  Never mind. I saved the world.  I mean, that's a really big three minutes.  I don't know if I can take that kind of term.

Start time: 1091.00
End time: 1100.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those are great hats.  We tried to actually buy some Devo hats to wear on the show today, but we couldn't figure out how to get them shipped here fast enough.  We could have 3D printed them for you.  We did not think of that.  OK.  All right.

Start time: 1100.88
End time: 1136.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, something else about the story that I find kind of interesting.  One of I won't mention which one, but a US ISP decided they were going to protect their clients by blocking the domain.  And someone had to reach out to them and say, that's actually the absolute worst thing you could do.  Why would you do that?  I know.  It's like, no, no, no.  That was the kill signal.  You just blocked the kill signal.  So it's amazing that even some, quote unquote, technically minded people didn't actually read the story.  They saw the domain and said domain must be bad.

Transcript:  That's because no one understands security.  Security is so complex.  The number of journalists I know who I actually would trust to explain security to me is very few.  Like Zach Whitaker from ZDNet and maybe one or two other people.  Zach's fantastic, but he's almost one of a kind.  Zach's great.  We have a story of his later on in the rundown.  But I do not write about security on purpose because I always feel like a charlatan and I'm always covering up for a lack of personal knowledge.  And I feel like that's not abnormal in the field.

Transcript:  Writing for security is scary because it's so easy to get wrong.  It's so incredibly easy to get it wrong.  I mean, I cover security, but I lean on a lot of senior security experts.  I lean a lot on security researchers.  You got to call those people.  You got to talk to them on the phone.  You got to let them walk you through what's going on.  Because if you try to write it in a vacuum, which a lot of tech press does for a lot of things, right.  Well, I just know I'm just going to write this thing with security.  You can't do that.  You have to talk to people.  You have to talk to these researchers.  You have to get their knowledge and put it in your article because if you don't, you're just spreading a lot of bad information, which is worse.  Yeah.

Start time: 1203.30
End time: 1261.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have to make sure that you're talking to the right researchers because sometimes they, you know what I mean?  Like there can be there just like there are kind of, you know, you feel like a charlatan as a journalist.  There can be charlatans in the security community, too.  So it really becomes imperative to know you're talking to the right people, explaining it the right way, being accurate.  Like, I mean, I'm glad I don't have to do this anymore because it's easy to get it wrong, you know, and it can be very bad when you get it wrong.  I mean, as you were stating, you know, the fact that people thought, OK, because this first variant, this kill switch was found.  Oh, well, that's over. It's like, no, this is this is literally just the beginning and it's easy to get caught up in the rhetoric.  It's also bad, too, I think that what makes security difficult is that we have so many stories that are like, oh, this is the worst thing ever, that I think that the general public has a certain sense of malaise and and learns to just kind of ignore all the big threats.  So that when you have a situation like this, which really could be like the worst thing ever, I don't know how seriously people take it.

Transcript:  You know, I always trust the security researchers I know from DEFCON, from Black Hat, the ones that I've known for years, and they are almost never the people that you see in the headlines because they don't believe in this.  I'm going to get it out first. That's I'm going to get it right. And then I'm going to tell you what's going on. And I love that analysis.  But Christina, you brought up the point of the general public. We got to ask because any time you get to a general public story, there's always going to be the question.  Well, whose fault is this? And there's a lot of that. In fact, the New York Times put out an op-ed today essentially saying Microsoft, this is on you.  Boo. And I couldn't I could not disagree more. This is a patch that was put out for most of Windows in March of 2017.  They actually released a free patch for Server 2003 and XP, even though they don't have to anymore. Those products are end of life.  They're dead. They're dead. And they've been warning you that it's going to be dead for years.

Transcript:  Oh, call on me. Call me. It's not. It's not. I mean, that and that and that that really kind of goes back to the sky is falling.  The sky is falling. It's got to be someone's fault. It's it's.  It's the nature of the beast is what it is. It's hard to point blame.  I mean, clearly it's the people who made this. It's the NSA who had this, you know, this exploit and they were holding on to it.  And then they were they they basically they're they're shoddy security allowed it out.  But to yell at Microsoft is ridiculous. It's like when you yell at Microsoft because some third party hasn't made it a driver for the newest version of Windows.  And you can't yell at the hospitals. You can't yell at these businesses because, like I said, some of them, they don't have a choice.  They have to use these legacy systems if you want to get, like you said, an MRI, if you want to get a CT scan, if you want to do all this stuff.  So it's a sort of weird nature of the beast.  And to have this op-ed that says, well, it's Microsoft's fault, it sort of misses the point.  And it really simplifies the issue, which is we have created these systems that don't that you can't update.  And there's not really anything you can do that because you're talking about 100 machines that are 100, 200, 300 thousand dollars.  You're not going to update it because, like, oh, we need to put Windows 10 on here. Right.  We know we need to get patients in here. We need to take care of this.

Transcript:  Really importantly, about 45 minutes ago, Snowden tweeted a new Microsoft blog post from your security team and especially I think Brad Smith, who's on their kind of corporate legal side of things.  And the Snowden tweet was Microsoft officially confirms the NSA developed the flaw that brought down hospitals this weekend.  And the Microsoft post actually calls out NSA and what's the actual quote here?  Stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments.  And so they're turning this around and kind of a contrary to the New York Times op-ed and saying, look, if you guys stockpile this stuff and you get hacking this release to the wild, this is what happens.  Can you stop doing that and work more with us?  So then who's really at fault here? Is it the NSA for uncovering things it can use in its job?  It's a Microsoft for not supporting software in perpetuity.  Is it Times op-ed columns for being all very old, technologically illiterate people?  I mean, I don't know exactly where to drop the blame, but I mean, it's definitely not one person and certainly not a simple answer.

Transcript:  Also remember, this is actually a multi-part exploit.  So it's at least two discrete parts. The first part is the phishing attack.  So either attachment or email link that leads to remote code execution.  Once it was installed, then it did the second part.  The second part was an exploit of the Samba vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Networking.  So that's the part that was developed by the NSA.  That's the part that allows it to move laterally.  In the past, when you had a phishing attack, you'd infect one computer, maybe the computer that that was authorized to connect to.  But this one will actively search out other vulnerable Samba installations in any given network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, so once you get past the firewall, you are all the systems past that firewall are on the same level.  And if you can move laterally within that, it means that you've essentially bypassed the firewall for all of those computers.  I see. Okay, so there's one firewall for all the cool stuff.

I'm sorry if you work there, you are competent, but you don't have the resources.  But they don't have a competent IT team.  So they don't have the ability to put things in zones.  And even if they did imagine in a hospital, if every time you needed to approve an emergency service, you had to go through five different layers of security.  People would die. People would die. Right.  That's not good. Or in a manufacturing plant. That's not good.  Yeah. Someone enters in the wrong password and suddenly you shut down the assembly floor.  That's not going to work either. People won't let you do that.  So there are this. I think this is the story that I like.  There's a story of inertia here.  We do not want to under any circumstance change the way that we work.  We want the tool to change, but the tool can't change because what they attacked here was human nature.  It's always fishing.  Once you get into fishing.

Or they're going to be going through their huge email inbox and go, I'm going to click everything I see.  So this is going to spread.  And if it's the second variant, which it probably is now, there is no kill switch.  So we're going to be in for a really great ride.

Transcript:  The church provides gear for me.  Whoa.  The Lutheran church gave me no gear.  I'm just saying.  Catholics are really big in the gear.  Well, folks, speaking of gear, this episode of TWIT is brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell.  Now, I know that you've seen this.  We've had this on so many shows on the TWIT TV network.  Yes, it's a doorbell that replaces the device you currently have on your home.  Yes, it includes everything that you need to be up and running, including the doorbell itself,  the adapter plate, all the little tools to have it up and running in just a few minutes.  In fact, I bought this kit before Ring was a sponsor of the network for my father who lives in Las Vegas.  He was able to install it in about four minutes and had it up and running and I was connected.  It was very impressive.  But it's more than just an electronic doodad.  It's more than just something that you can hang outside so people know that you're geeky.  This is a security device in a security ecosystem that is paralleled by none.  Today, over a million people use the amazing Ring Video Doorbell to help protect their homes.  Because Ring knows home security.  They know that it begins at the front door and it doesn't end there.  They're not just providing you a technical solution.  They're giving you a solution that kind of takes into account a little bit of human nature.  That's why they're extending that same level of security that they provided in the Ring Video Doorbell  to the rest of your home with the Ring Floodlight Cam.  Now, just like Ring's Video Doorbell, their new Floodlight Cam is a motion-activated camera and floodlight that connects to your phone.  It's got HD video and two-way audio, so it lets you know the moment anyone steps on your property  and actually lets you have a two-way conversation with them.  You can see and speak to those visitors, even set off alarms right from your phone, no matter where you are in the world.  With Ring's Floodlight Cam, when things go bump in the night, you can bump back and immediately know what it is.  Whether you're home or away, the Floodlight Cam lets you keep an eye on your home.  And Floodlight Cam offers the ultimate at home security with high visibility floodlights  and a powerful HD camera that puts security in your hands.  It was named the Wall Street Journal's Best of CES 2017.  I trust my parents with the Ring ecosystem.  They've got a Ring Video Doorbell on the front door.  We've got a Floodlight Cam in the back.  What that allows me to do is, even when my parents are not home, I know if someone's coming up to the front door and peeking through the window,  or if someone's trying the door in the back, seeing if maybe it's ajar.  It's that that tells me that my parents are secure, because I know if someone's scoping out their place,  it gives me a peace of mind and it lets me know that my parents are protected.  So here's what we want you to do.  We want you to be always home.  And with Ring, you can do that.  Ring has a day of up to $150 off a Ring of Security Kit when you go to ring.com slash twit.  That's ring.com slash twit.  And we thank Ring for their support of this week in tech.  All right, let's let's move on because I'm done with fishing and with worms.  I want to talk about something happy, shiny and new, specifically the Amazon Echo.  Oh, I'm sorry, the Amazon Echo Show.

I do not.  When the leaks first appeared, which I have a feeling is what forced them to go forward  with the announcement.  But when the leaks appeared last week, I was like, there's no way this is real.  And then Evelix was like, yeah, here's your here's your product photo.  And I was like, OK, so this is what this looks like.  Why?  Why, Amazon?  Why?  They made the fire phone.  That's the biggest question.  Yeah.  Well, the fire phone was attractive for.  I mean, OK.  It was attractive.  It looked like any other phone like the Echo and Echo Dot look fairly good.  And I even think that the look, the really creepy camera for your bedroom that I kind  of want.  I do.  I kind of want it because I'm terrible.  I'm the worst.  I'm the worst.  I have a first.  I kind of want to look.  But at least those have some sense of design, I suppose, especially when you get the dot  or the Echo in white.  I think they're they're nice looking.  This, especially in white, is just terrible.

Like, you know, the Echo and the Echo Dot are kind of designed for a bedroom or a kitchen.  This is they're literally being like, oh, put this, you know, and put this everywhere.  Make this a centerpiece because you're going to use this to use the Amazon version of your  FaceTime that no one is actually going to use.  And you're going to use this to watch Netflix, even though I bet the lag is significant on that  atom processor.  And you're going to use this to, I don't know, give visualizations for your music, I suppose,  which all sounds great.  But that means like that makes the screen the center point.  So like they really want people to show this off, which which makes to me, which makes the  ugliness factor that much more egregious.  That's what kills it.

They want it to be the center point.  I cannot imagine.  And I'm somebody who in theory would would like an object like this, even though I would probably never use the screen.  I'm the sort of person, like I said, I'm probably going to buy the look because I'm a dumb person and I'm an idiot.  And I'm like, oh, I don't have a full length mirror.  This would be great.  Just invite Amazon into my home to have photos of me everywhere.  And like, I'm that person who literally is like buying into that argument.  And even I'm looking at this.  I'm like, there's no way I'm putting this in my house.  There's no way I have an Amazon parent.

Transcript:  So someone who works for Amazon is a parent at the school that I live at.  And she was trying to explain to me all the things, the reasons why I would like this.  And her primary thing was it works with all of the Amazon voice assistant skills.  And I was like, I can already use those with my Echo.  And she goes, well, this is for the people who don't have an Echo.  This is for the people who don't have an Echo.  So they'll have them buy an Echo.  I know.

End time: 2392.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, yes, there is.  For letting NSA into your house more easily.  Yeah, that's every computer you own.  I'm sorry.  This is like, I didn't buy a, I can say Echo, right?  Yes.  I didn't buy an Echo or a Dot because it felt like a huge privacy violation.  I mean, to Christina's point about the show, that's a whole different kind of catalyphish.  But I mean, this is adding even more capabilities into letting people into my house and to collect data.  And frankly, no, it does not feel good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm actually with you.  I have an Echo.  It is unplugged.  I only plug it in whenever I'm doing a project that requires it.  I have the voice assistant on my phone turned off by default.  I have Cortana on my Windows 10 computer turned off by default just because I don't like data leaving my network.  Yeah, sure.  That's a me thing.  It's probably stupid, paranoid, but it's a me thing.

Start time: 2419.39
End time: 2434.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that's completely not paranoid.  But you know what I'm surprised about?  The amount of like hackers and security researchers that I know that I meet at DEF CON that I hang out with that have Amazon Echo and DOTS.  They love those things.  They're like, yeah.  They're super cute and fun.  No, that's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They build the Amazon skills for them and they're like, oh, it's so awesome.  Look at all the stuff I'm playing with.  And that makes me feel like better about my own poor decisions to let these products into my house because objectively I know that you're both right.  I'm like, I should never have this.  I should turn all this off.  I have three of them.  And then I'm like, I really like to listen to Spotify with my voice.  I really like to control Spotify with my voice.  I really like to get my news updates.  I like to be able to listen to Twitter or whatever.  I like that convenience and I'm willing to give some of that up.  But this what's interesting to me too is when we talk about those skills, they are designed for voice.  And obviously with the Fire TV, there is a visual interface for some of these things.  And so there's precedent for that.  But most of the people who are creating skills are doing it again without the need for a screen.  So I don't see that unless they can really make the developer play to say, oh, you should really be developing screen based responses, which is a very different approach to doing things.  I don't even know how good the experience is going to be.  And honestly, if you did want that visual experience, wouldn't it be better to just have your nice, attractive TV that's already in your home and have your Fire TV stick connected to that?  I mean, OK, you don't get the camera for the voice calls, but let's be honest.  Even the biggest Amazon diehards are never going to use the Amazon voice service because you're never going to be able to convince your family members to like open the Amazon app and make a video call when they could just FaceTime or use Duo or whatever or Skype or anything else.  We're already pretty invested in our video systems.

Start time: 2531.80
End time: 2549.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only thing I'll add to that is FaceTime, Skype, Google Hangouts and all the other consumer grade video conferencing solutions are bad.  And so this one actually has a high fidelity and a reliable connection that I can use across both oceans and continents.  I will buy one just for that.  No, it's still going to be bad.  The thing is, you can do it on the app.

Well, if you're going to do that, you can do that from the from the Amazon voice assistant app on your phone, which has a nicer screen.  And it's already.  Yeah.  So there's no use.  It's weird.  It's a very strange placement.  It doesn't make sense.  It's going to be.

Transcript:  I think if it were more attractive, they might be able to convince people to do it just because of how successful the other echoes have been.  Right.  Like I would even be open to buying one for my mom if it were more attractive.  I would have like probably considered it as like a Mother's Day gift or something.  Honestly, I'm like, OK, hey, we'll get this in a month.  But instead, like I'm like, I could never put that in my mom's house.  I love my mom.  I don't want to do that to my mother.

A lot of people didn't know what to do with the Echo.  When the Echo first came out, they were like, so this will help me shop more.  And it turned out to be a blockbuster product.  It was it was not just a blockbuster product.  It was a new genre inventing product that everyone's.  That's a good point.

Start time: 2629.21
End time: 2690.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  The Echo.  I am.  It was funny.  They weren't they didn't give out review units for a while on Echo.  And so you had to actually buy one and like apply to get one.  And so when I was at.  Yeah.  And so when I was at Mashable, I actually got one like very early.  And so I was able to do the review when it still only had, you know, a couple of skills.  But even then I was like, this is amazing.  And you're right.  I remember when it was first announced, we all were kind of like, what?  Like, what is this?  This is it was something that the most of the pundits and most of the tech press didn't  quite understand.  And then it came out and it was a good product and they've continued to make it better.  So, yeah, I think you're right.  For all of my and I've been like the biggest hater on this thing.  I will I will add the caveat that like I didn't believe that that the Echo would be as big  as it is.  And then it came out and I loved it.  I think that if they could come out with a more attractive version of this, that would  be my only thing, honestly.  Like, who knows?  They might have real potential.  I think the ecosystem for the Echo products is huge.  I just don't.  I think the way this one looks is going to automatically make it do away, at least for  me.

And this is the fact that Amazon also announced their and I can't say it a word calling.  It's a new skill that allows hands free.  I know.  Right.  It allows for hands free sending and receiving of calls to anyone with an echo or the Amazon  voice assistant app.  So it will work on phones.  It will work on all of the devices.

Transcript:  But actually, Christina, we're going to be talking to you for the next one, because this is something that's going to be in your world.  OK, Amazon wasn't the only one who released interesting news about voice assistance this past week.  We're going to talk about Microsoft's effort.  But before we get there, let's take another quick break to thank another sponsor of this week in tech.  Now, hey, you guys lose things, right?  Yeah.  Because, Christina, have you ever lost something that's shiny?  So many times.  It's too easy.  I say it's easier now because so many high value items are so small and designed to be so portable that it's it's easy not just to walk away from them, but it's easy for them to walk away from you.  Recently.  Yeah.  Phone keys, bag, pet.  Bag, pet.  Yeah.  Well, if only there was a device that we could use that we could attach to our most treasured technology possessions that would allow us to make sure that we always knew where they were that would allow us to find out down to the meter where they might be located.  Well, folks, that exists.  It's called the tracker.  The tracker is a coin sized device that you can attach to anything you find valuable to your keys, to your phone, to your computer bag.  And yeah, even to your pets.  And it allows you to link it up to your phone so that you can with a single app, find out exactly where it exists, where it is, where it's going.  Now, tracker is possibly the best, the easiest way to track your things because it uses a lithium battery that lasts for about a year.  So you're not going to be constantly changing out the battery on this thing.  It's good to go.  Not only can you pair a tracker, you can pair up to 10 of them with your phone and get things like separation alerts.  So as as you're walking away from your bag in the coffee shop, you get a little notification on your phone saying, hey, hey, are you sure you want to be moving away?  Because I'm almost out of range.  You can even do reverse tracking.  You can push a button on your tracker and it will make your phone ring even if it's set to silent.  I mean, how good would that be if you know where your keys are, but you can't find your phone?  Push the button, listen for the tone.  There you go.  Now, with the tracker, you never have to worry about losing your things again.  The new tracker Bravo is that coin size device and it's constructed with anodized aluminum.  So it's the thinnest, most durable tracking device ever.  Once you pair it, you can find out where all your items are.  And here's what I really love.  It uses something that they're calling mesh GPS or crowd GPS.  It allows you to find out where devices, even if it's gone beyond the range of your Bluetooth transmitter and receiver, the way it does that is as long as your tracker is within within range of another tracker user,  they can still get the beacon and you can still get the notification.  That means that if if your phone has wandered across the world and it is now somewhere in India, you can still push that button and find out on what street it's located.  It's that cool.  In fact, a while ago for one of my other shows know how I had a gig bag that I left in our garage at the high school.  And unfortunately, someone opened up the garage during one of our open campus days.  Someone had wandered into the garage, took my gig bag and left with some prototype devices.  It really bummed me out.  But what really ticked me off was when my audience said, wait a minute, you've had the tracker on your network for a year.  Why don't you have one on your bag?  And yet I was one of those smack my head moments.  And with over four point five million devices, ShipTracker has the largest crowd GPS network in the world.  So, again, you're always going to be able to find your item, even if it's wandered away from you by miles, by by states, by countries.  And the distance indicator on the tracker app will show you if you're getting closer or further away from your item.  So there's a little bit of detection finding skill involved.  And with a 30 day money back guarantee, there's no reason not to give it a try.  Folks, are you tired of losing your stuff?  Well, you can stop losing your stuff today.  Go to the tracker dot com and enter the promo code twit.  You get a free tracker Bravo with any order.  That's the tracker.  T H E T R A C K R dot com promo code twit for your free tracker Bravo with any order.  And we thank Tracker for their support of this week in tech.  All right, let's move on to a lesser known voice assistant, but I think one that is important nonetheless.  That's Cortana.  Of course, Cortana is built into every Windows 10 device.  It's in the Xbox one.  And now Microsoft wants to make it a standalone device.  They don't want it to be tied to the PC.  They don't want it to be tied to your TV.  They want it to be something like what Google and Amazon have with their respective voice assistants.  Oh, at Build, which was this last week, it was clear that Microsoft wants to go after this market.  They see it as lucrative.  I think they saw what most tech journalists saw at CES.  Everything is Amazon.  Everything had an Amazon integration.  I mean, the refrigerators, washers, dryers, TVs, they're all they're all realizing why  build my own thing when I can use Amazon's and Microsoft wants some of that.  You all saw that.  I mean, how many of you went to CES?  Yeah, no, it's ridiculous how big the echo has gotten.

And I said Apple's different privacy rules and how they segment data.  And so I don't mean that in a way to cast aspersions.  But I mean, Cortana is somewhere in the middle of my experience between a word and then Siri at the bottom.  That is that good?  Yeah, I'm trying.  I don't want to trigger anyone by accident.  But Cortana is fine.  I have it on Windows 10.  But I've never thought of myself.  I really have to have this more devices.  But then again, I'm the guy without a dot or an echo.  So maybe I'm the weird person out here.  But this sounds like a reasonable move, but not one that I'm exactly jumping up and down screaming like, yes.  Yeah.

But OK, let's talk a little bit about what Microsoft is doing here because they realize that even though technically they have a much larger installed base than Amazon ever will because it's included in Windows 10.  Right.

Transcript:  And for example, I have about a dozen Windows 10 devices in my lab, all of which have Cortana turned off.  And I don't think I'm alone in that.  I think a lot of people see that.  Hi, I'm Cortana.  How I'm your voice assistant.  How can I know?  And they're like, no, no, no, I don't want to.

Start time: 3434.80
End time: 3527.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I do.  When I when I've reviewed Windows laptops, I certainly usually will use Cortana more than I ever used, say, Siri on the Mac, because Siri on the Mac is garbage.  Yeah.  I mean, it's superfluous.  There's really not a point to it.  Whereas at least Cortana, you can get some interesting results and do some things.  But it's I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  Maybe I'm wrong in this.  But where I understand, you know, Siri and Google Assistant on phones and how that can be useful, I think really where the voice assistant stuff has become the most useful.  This is what Amazon nailed was realizing that it is the secondary devices in the home that are that are these speaker types of things.  That's really where it becomes interesting.  And that's why at CES we saw so many integrations.  And and that's why Microsoft is obviously so interested in expanding Cortana into this space, because I think that at least for me, the way I use stuff, I mean, I might use Siri to set an alarm on my phone and I might use maybe Cortana for a similar purpose to.  Connect to a network or to, you know, do some sort of quick search if it's just faster.  But in general, I don't even think to do that.  I tend to instead.  Get the most value out of those sorts of voice assistants if it's set an alarm or set a timer or play this channel or what's the weather, you know, those sorts of things that are really best suited for a third party device rather than something that's integrated into my computer where I can just Google something.  Or my phone where similarly I can just, you know, open up a web page and type in and I'm right there.  Yeah, you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And for me, I get it.  I've played with Cortana.  It's actually quite good.  And it gives me interesting analysis, which I don't find from other assistance.  But the problem has always been I have my keyboard and my mouse.  If I'm at my computer, I'm always faster than me asking Cortana to do something.  So why would I ask Cortana?  Every single time.  Every single time there's.  So it's a walk away device.  It's a voice assistant.  It's like the Echo.  And that's what they now realize.  OK, we have to have that device that proves the utility of Cortana.  It's a hands free device when you're away from the keyboard or the mouse.  Is this just Echo Envy?  That's well, no, I actually see this as part of the strategy.  You have to remember, Nadella came from Microsoft's Web Services side.  That's what I'm.  And he's always been about Web Services First.  And part of Web Services First is leveraging the integrated web services.  First is leveraging the integrations that Microsoft can offer that no one else can.  They love using things that they can do that Amazon can't.  And I think they're betting on two things.  The first is they're using the PC model of voice assistant.  So unlike Amazon and Google, they're not building their own thing.  They will as a reference device.  They want partners.  Right.  So they brought in HP, Intel, Invoke Speakers, BMW, Nissan.  They want their partners to build the devices just like just like their PCs.  And I think that gives them the edge as far as penetration.  So you'll see a more varied variety of voice assistants in different circumstances.  You'll find them in the car.  You'll find them in the appliances.  But the second thing, I think this is this is their big advantage.  This is why I would not count them out.  They can offer far more integration than Apple, Google or Amazon.  In the sense that they have your calendar, they have your travel plans, they have your search history.  They have your time sheets.  They have IOT data.  If they're tied into your enterprise network, they have your enterprise networking data and all of those things.  They've already integrated into Cortana.  Cortana can make some amazing correlations based on your contact sheet and who you're getting email from.  But this is a corporate play.

End time: 3682.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not bringing up your time sheets, but it will.  You'll find Cortana doing something like it will know that according to your time sheet, you've worked this much.  So you probably need a vacation.  And it knows that this is when you get paid.  So these are good times to pitch you on vacations.  So it's going to try to sell me stuff?  Not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

So the few times somebody will send me a check, I'm like, I'm going to go to the bank.  The few times somebody will send me a check and I'll need to cash it.  You can now like cash it with like the Bank of America app.  So like you open up your app and you take a photo of the check and like the front side  of the backside and they're like, we will deposit this in your account.  And like you don't even have to go to the bank anymore.  And it's a similar thing.  Like if you actually go to the bank now, like to deposit it through the ATMs, like scanning  the check and like, you know, doing OCR and it's actually quite good.  So that that tech is kind of cool.  But yeah, I it's the six years that I lived in New York, I very, very, very rarely ever  had to write a check to the point that I don't think I ever updated my checkbook with my  New York address.  So, yeah, when I lived in Atlanta towards the end, I think the only way I ever wrote  checks was to my hairdresser and pizza.  And then, you know, and that was it.

I've donated $10,000 to a project to do something at DEFCON because I want them to build something  awesome for the attendees and they let me use PayPal.  The reason why I use PayPal was because I now have $10,000 of spend on my credit card,  which goes to my frequent flyer mile.  So if you're looking for a quick way to get to your your what do they call that?  The because you have to have a certain spend in order to get mileage.  Now, that's a very easy way to do it.

OK, and that's much less than it would cost if I actually tried to hit that spend.  So if you're looking to do that on your frequent flyer account, that's actually a decent way to hack it.

It's a Jesuit thing.  All right.  All right.  Let's move on to something else that is that is not checks or cantana.  A laptop.  And this actually hit me because I was flying back from from Malta on on.  When did I get back here on Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  I got back over the weekend and Delta actually had me check my laptop into my bag because they were afraid that a travel ban was going to take place while I was in route because it was a 31 hour trip.  Oh, wow.  And I transferred twice and they were like, well, if it happens and you hit the United States, they're not going to let you carry your laptop through.  This this is something that DHS will be doing.  They're not exactly sure when they're going to institute it, but they're going to be banning laptops in the cabins of all airlines going from Europe to United States.  Previously, they had banned it just from a certain number of countries.  Now it will be any European flight.  You will not be allowed to carry a laptop in the cabin.  You got to put in your check.

In fact, an Airbus 320 last year had to make an emergency landing after one of these was set off and it actually blew a hole, a decent sized hole through the fuselage was able to land.  But that spooked a lot of people because they knew that they were trying to do it and they had finally figured it out.  They're not releasing any of the technical details.  But from what I was able to hear on the darker side of the Internet was it's a combination of a binary explosive and actually using the lithium ion battery that's in the battery because they've realized there's a lot of chemical energy in there.  And if you can have a big enough runaway reaction, it's very energetic.  Right.  It does actually explode, especially if you combine it with the binary reagent.  So this is not security theater then?  This is not security theater.  This is actually so but but it kind of still is.

So the fact that like, OK, we can't take laptops on your computer.  You think the terrorists are still like, well, you know, let's still let's keep doing that laptop thing.  There's actually a whole thing.  I know they're putting them down here.  Let's keep putting that laptop thing.

Transcript:  But I want to go with with what you were saying.  Where do you stop?  Because the problem isn't the laptop.  The problem there it is.  The problem is the lithium ion battery and that lithium ion technology exists in your phone.  It exists in your watch.  It exists in your tablet.  It exists in any mobile device.

And so I need to be able to charge things all the time.  So I can't check these like bricks.  So I bring them on the plane.  I stick them in a thing.  There's nothing that would stop someone from doing the same thing with a brick.

Transcript:  And that's by design because they've actually had in 2016 there were 33 incidents of fire.  This was not malicious.  This was just devices catching on fire.  It happens.  You pinch a lithium poly pack the wrong way.  You expose it to oxygen and suddenly it's a runaway pack.  And what the FAA is worried about is that the traditional fire suppressant technology that planes carry do not work against lithium ion packs.  A water extinguisher or a halon extinguisher will not extinguish the flame.  And it's not the flame that will affect you.  It's all the smoke that it's going to release into the cabin.  If it's in the cargo hold, there's no way to get to it.  So we should just not have electronics anymore?  No.

Transcript:  Well, that becomes the irony too, right?  Is that more and more the airlines are moving away from putting in in-flight entertainment, like in putting in screens and TV, you know what, in the planes and being like, oh, no, just use your iPad.  Just use your tablet and sign on to our app on our network and use, you know, the TV.  And then you can use your tablet on your network and use, you know, access your server that way.  Like that's literally becoming one of the ways that they're trying to cut money, you know, on in-flight entertainment things.  So there's like a certain amount of business pressure versus like security theater or maybe not security theater.  Maybe maybe valid concerns like are going to be kind of pushing up against one another if they do start to ban more and more types of devices from being carried on because then it's like literally like what are people going to do?

I like having my phone because I use it when I'm in between on connection.  Of course.  But I mean, this that's actually it's a big impediment to doing business if you don't have your electronic devices with you.

Transcript:  I mean, I'm going way back in the history of computing.  People talk about thin clients in the 90s.  Once we had broadband everywhere, you won't have to have a computer where you got with you or wherever you ended up.  You could just log into your own instance and go from their son was working on this back in the day.  If you remember, son, yes, Oracle, too.  Exactly.  And we didn't go that way as a world of computing.  But maybe if that happens, we'll be forced in that direction really late, much later than we thought it may have ever happened.  But I mean, I cannot imagine not having a computer for more than like when I get out of the shower, I'm like, give me a computer.  It's been like five minutes.

But if you can't use the laptop in the cabin, then, you know, people like employers who try to basically force you to work on, you know, on on on flights, you know, that that's like a great excuse to no longer having to turn literally every free moment when we're not in the office into a into a working option.  You know, because.  Sorry, can't can't can't can't can't can't work on the flight guys.  Can't follow those blogs because they won't let me follow the blogs, man.

Transcript:  Well, let's get this move on.  I do want to talk about something that I think is it's important because this is in its nascent stage and we actually do still have a say specifically.  Comcast and Charter are going to be moving into a new venture and they've decided that it would probably be better in their best interest, of course, if they didn't compete.  I think maybe consumers should have a say in that.  But before we get there, I do want to take another moment to thank another sponsor this week in tech.  And thankfully, it's a sponsor that has something that is near and dear to my heart, and that is eating healthy.  Here's the question.  What do you do when you're hungry, when you're rummaging around and yet the only stuff that you can find is junk food?  It's bad for you.  It's chips.  It's cookies.  It's ice cream.  Well, folks, you need to make sure that your house, that your workplace, that your office, your apartment is stocked with good eats, with things that can satisfy you.  That can satisfy your desire to snack, but won't completely destroy your body in 10 to 20 years, which is why I'm happy that this week in tech is brought to you by Nature Box.  Now, when you rely on your self-control to resist the temptation, you need to make sure that you can be rewarded at some point.  And the way that you reward yourself is making sure that your snacks are hearty and healthy.  Nature Box makes snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.  They've created them with a high quality set of ingredients that are free from artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.  So you can feel great about snacking.  It's no longer, oh, my goodness, I ate a bag of chips.  It's, oh, my goodness, I ate a bag of healthy mini Belgian waffles or Sriracha flavored nuts.  My personal favorites are the Big Island Pineapple, the Cranberry Almond Bites, the Whole Wheat Raspberry Figgy Bars.  They taste fantastic.  I know, okay, those may sound a bit health foodish, but they're not.  They're just delicious, delicious snacks.  And they recently made their service even better.  Now you can order as much as you want, as often as you want, and no minimum purchase is required.  So you can cancel any time.  It's simple.  You just go to naturebox.com and check out their snack catalog.  There are over 100 snacks to choose from, and they're constantly adding delicious new snacks to their menu.  You can choose the snacks that you want, and they'll deliver them right to your door.  Now, with Nature Box, you'll never get bored.  There are new snacks each month inspired by customer feedback.  And if you ever try a snack that you don't like, Nature Box will replace it for free.  How about that for customer service?  Folks, if you are looking for a better way to live, if you're looking for a better way to snack, you owe it to yourself to try Nature Box.  Right now, you'll save even more.  Nature Box is offering our fans 50% off your first order when you go to naturebox.com slash twit.  That's naturebox.com slash twit for 50% off your first order.  And we thank naturebox for their support of this week in tech.  All right. So back to the tease.  Comcast and Charter on Monday, they made a joint announcement that they would, and I'm going to use a quote here,  explore potential opportunities for operational cooperation in their respective wireless businesses to accelerate and enhance each company's ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace.  Unquote.  In non crap speak, what does that mean?  It means that what they want to do is they want to license service from Verizon, become an MVNO.  That's a mobile virtual network operator.  They're probably going to combine it with features that they will integrate into their services so that it gives it some unified communication slash enterprisey feel and then resell it to their customers.  But here's the thing.  They've decided that they're not going to compete.  So going into this venture, they've agreed that if either of them ever want to make another acquisition, let's say Comcast says, hey, you know what?  We can buy T-Mobile or let's say Charter says there's a local operator that we want to buy and it's in Comcast territory.  They have to get the permission of the other.

But I can't imagine this is going to be good for consumers.  Aside from there will be some modest amount of increased competition in certain areas.  But I mean, this is creepy.

They know they know that this is going to trigger all sorts of smell alerts because it  does smell anti-competitive.  It does smell like this would be nothing but a losing bet for consumers.  But here's our argument.  And they actually address this in the press release.  They say this is not going to run afoul of anti-competition regulation because they don't  currently compete in this arena.  This is not a cable infrastructure project.  This is a wireless project.  And therefore, since they don't currently hold any stake in that, they're just saying,  well, you play over there and I play over here.  No, I don't think that makes it better.  But that's that's their argument.  That's how they're going to defend this.  I wonder if that would work in court.

Transcript:  Frank Shaw told me every time.  But people don't know is that sort of preamble to a cable news hits incredibly common.  Like whenever you go on CNBC in your little earpiece, they say, show us energy, show us  energy.  And they pick people that have different opinions on purpose to create an argument on the network.  It's not by accident.  They pick people that are pro and con in a really simplistic fashion.  And then they amp you up and then they have you on performance to argue and then they  just drop you in your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they drop you.  But in some cases they will say, I want you to talk about a specific issue and explain  something.  And that's usually the context that I would go on television would be to explain something  and usually not to have an opinion unless it was expressly asked.  This was a weird situation where I was expressly asked to have to hold an opinion and go on  a show and argue for that opinion.  And that was something that I was.  And it's funny.  I was like, absolutely not.  There's there's no way.  There's no way.  Wait, wait, wait.

Transcript:  Now, OK, but let me let me try to play devil's advocate here.  All right.  We do want another player in the wireless service industry, correct?  We and we would we would desperately like another national player because any sort of  competition on the national level will drive down prices for consumers.  So I could see themselves saying, look, we don't have enough capital to to compete against  another new player.  But if both of us get into this, eventually we will be at the level where we can compete  with the Verizon.  We can compete with a sprint.  We can compete with a T-Mobile.  Isn't that a good thing?  I mean, don't we want to spark that competition if they come back and say, look, if the if  the FTC is going to come down and say this is anti-competitive and we can't do it, then  we just don't invest.  And isn't that a net loss for America?

Start time: 5714.80
End time: 5741.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say because they're using Verizon.  So doesn't that immediately offset some of that?  I mean, I would agree with you if they were actually investing in their own infrastructure  that I wouldn't necessarily agree that that was still I wouldn't I would necessarily  agree with the argument.  I would say that argument would be more valid in this case, though.  You know, they're going to be using Verizon's infrastructure, which to me says that ultimately,  you know, Verizon raises the prices for certain things.  The MVNOs then have to raise the prices, too.  So I don't even know how much more competition you have.

Start time: 5742.86
End time: 5758.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I just looked up the numbers to your financial argument.  And in the first quarter of this year, Comcast had five point seven billion dollars in cash  provided by operating activities and free cash flow of three point one billion.  So the argument that they can't afford this to me is specious.

Start time: 5759.52
End time: 5779.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the other argument here and we'll hear it here as well as the net neutrality debate is the one  that always always trumped out is regulation kills investment, which is not held out by the numbers.  Since the passage of net neutrality, we've seen a market spike in the amount of capital outlay for both  spectrum and for deployment of fiber.  So it's those numbers are malleable.

Transcript:  Money is money because a G is is is talking about specific numbers just for wireline investment over  the last multiyear period since neutrality.  And there is some data that indicates there was a mild impact in the negative.  But I mean, I like how you prepped some mild.  Well, I mean, we're talking about economic data that is inherently politically weaponizable.  And so I don't want to say I'm sound emphatic and clear cut when it's not because how you the data you pick,  the time frame you pick and how you slice it is how you bend things to your own political narrative.  And so that's what it is doing. So I don't want to say he's wrong.  I bet he's technically correct in some ways, but it's a deliberately, I would say,  misshapen image of the broader investment landscape that you're outlining, which includes more than just one area of investment.

I get it that this is the this is the environment we're in.  I mean, I don't think you would have heard an announcement like this last year because they figured that, yeah, they can be held accountable.  But the fact that they're willing to do this openly and to make it sound like it's a wonderful thing for consumers, that's got me worried.  That's that's actually the story for me above the fact that they just announced it.  It's the fact that they think this is going to be OK.  You know, this is cool. Yeah.

Start time: 5952.60
End time: 6009.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the thing is that I think they have a good shot at convincing people, because if you look at what has already happened with a zero rating and how that has been kind of advertised as a good thing to consumers and consumers are like, oh, well, look, I get unlimited data now.  And look, I can get my YouTube videos don't count and this doesn't count.  And look at all these this value I'm getting.  I mean, they're really selling zero rating as being a good thing for consumers, even though ultimately it has a lot of really scary implications that bigger picture people should consider.  But that's not how it's being presented. And I don't think that's how regular people see it.  So, yeah, I mean, if you use enough buzzwords and say competition enough times and we're going to lower your prices enough times, you know, people might still be weary because I think most consumers don't trust their service providers to lower prices.  But they might just see on the surface, oh, well, this is a good thing.  You know, I could see that they could make that convincing argument just because it's already worked with zero rating.  Yeah. Well, and Comcast is a really popular company with consumers.

I'm thinking, when have you ever done that ever?  Also, you just got there.  Yeah, that's like, oh, a few revolution.  A few years back, we had a Comcast rep who wanted to be on this week in Enterprise Tech.  And I had I had worked with this person before.  I really didn't want him on the show, but I was trying to be nice, trying to develop a relationship.  And but their PR people just got really aggressive.  And so at one point I said, OK, fine.  Come on Friday, X, X day at this time.  And it's OK. When when can we expect you to connect?  I said, well, sometime between noon and six.  And it took it took them a second like, oh, yeah, you just wait.  We'll be right there.  Did you actually keep it that way?  No, they've never called back.  Which I'm OK with. So, yeah, sorry about that.  All right. We're going to be back in just a second.  We have one more big story I do want to cover because something interesting happened last week.  And that was that hackers of an election got owned by the French.  But first, let's go ahead and take a moment to thank another sponsor of this week in tech.  Now, we've been talking a lot here about things that we've read, things that we've learned,  things that we've consumed from other media outlets, because let's face it,  information in this day and age just isn't something that's good for you to know.

And we thank Texture for their support of this week in tech.  All right, let's back up a week, because this story I absolutely love,  living in the security world, living in the network world.  This is something I think is going to be the standard going forward.  Now, we know that in France there was a politically motivated attack, cyber attack,  just like we've had in other countries. We had it here in the United States.  It happened in Germany. It's ongoing in Germany, and it's ongoing in the UK.  In the U.S. elections, and what we've seen in Germany,  is you've had exfiltrations of large amounts of information, which are then weaponized.  They can be released along with false information to make it sound like a leak  is much worse than it actually is, and it does sway elections.  Let's be honest there.  Now, the New York Times has a great article about how this all played.  Now, Michael S. Rogers, he's an admiral with the NSA,  he testified in the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday  that his agency saw the attack unfolding.  They were looking at traffic, they were looking at spikes,  they were looking at what the intelligence was saying,  and they said, look, someone is trying to undermine the French election.  So he reached out to his French counterparts, and to his surprise,  they basically said, no, no, no, we got this.  Oh baby, you're way too late on this one.  Yeah, it's like, no, no, we're all over this.  But thanks.  Now, the French knew it because they were actually on guard for this.  They assumed that they would be attacked,  and when they started to receive what they called high-quality fishing attacks  for their employees, they said, okay, it's on, game on.  And now here's what I think was brilliant about their strategy.  They had a war room meeting, and they said,  there is no way we're going to be able to secure every employee, every computer,  it's just not possible, something will leak.  So how do we deal with it?  And they said, well, how about this?  What if we just assume that something's going to leak?  And why don't we influence the leak?  So what they did was they started working in a counteroffensive.  They mixed in disinformation with the cash that would be stolen.  For example, one of my favorites was they created documents that looked like smoking guns.  They had a purchase, a series of emails that looked like a high-level staffer  was purchasing bath salts and stimulants on the Internet and paying for it in Bitcoin.  And this is one of those things that if you were trying to hack the election,  oh my gosh, he's high.  I've got it. I've got it.  I've got them.  But on the surface, if you were just looking at if is the document real,  did it come from the treasure trove, you would say yes.  But if you dug further, you would find out in the Bitcoin ledger,  there is no such transaction.  And that's the kind of information that they sewed into the trove.

So I would respond to them like, please delete your tweet.  So now I've changed the birthday.  I've made it public.  Waited to have populated their calendars.  And I changed it again.

Transcript:  It was interesting how the narrative on this changed so much in 72 hours that it was really running.  Because at first there was a leak and everyone's saying, oh, this is going to lose them the election.  And then very quickly, it didn't come from the campaign.  It was coming from people who were looking at the treasure trove saying, there's something not right here.  This data is... and the one that they found quickly was the Bitcoin one.  They said, this should be a smoking gun.  It's not.  What's going on?

Start time: 6779.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then that puts questions on any of the information because even if it's accurate or not, it doesn't matter.  You now have that level of distrust because the Bitcoin address didn't come out.  This information is not accurate.  So how can we know the rest of this information is valid?

Transcript:  And they took a playbook straight out of the hackers, a play out of the hackers playbook, because this is what they had been using.  They had taken some true information, put in their own false information to seem worse.  The French did the opposite.  They said, OK, fine, we're going to let you get some of that true information, but we're going to see it in false information.  So everyone will assume any information you have is tainted.

Transcript:  But critically, Le Pen only got 39.7% of the vote.  It was the last slide.  The result is that even though they tried their best to influence the election by doing this horrible thing, they not only lost operationally, they lost in terms of results.  So they could have actually defeated this operationally through the methods you've described and still actually had the election filters in their favor.  It didn't work.  But how much of that is the French?

End time: 6865.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like French jokes will get us in trouble with someone.  But I mean, my point is they lost twice.  And so that's what I like about this story.  The election result didn't go the way they wanted it to and they were owned before they even knew it.  And so that makes me very happy.  If we lose to this consistently, democracy is undermined globally, which I think would be not be very good.  So I'm glad we have some tools here to fight back.  And if we cannot apply these systemically across all the elections moving forward and hopefully even new and better tools, this is not seem that complicated.  Shame on us.

Transcript:  Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be watching in The Week Ahead.  On Tuesday, May 16th, HTC is holding an event teased as Squeeze for the Brilliant.  Apparently that refers to the rumored HTC U11 that is expected to include a feature  called EdgeSense that puts touch sensors into the frame of the phone that allows users to  squeeze and swipe the sides of the phone for different interactivity elements.  Trying something new.  On Wednesday, May 17th, Google I.O. kicks off at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain  View, California.  Google is expected to dish out new features to Android O, Google Play updates, and of  course developers in attendance get to fill their minds with all things Google-y.  I'll be there, so I'm sure I'll have some insight to share from the event throughout  the week.  On Thursday, May 18th, the FCC will put up a vote on restoring internet freedom in a  move that signals FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's determination to move net neutrality rules  out of FCC's jurisdiction.  That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.  Join Megan Moroney and me on tech news today every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern  here on twit.tv.
