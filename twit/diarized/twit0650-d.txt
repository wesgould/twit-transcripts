Start time: 256.60
End time: 275.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say,  and this is gonna sound self-congratulatory,  it was just exciting.  I was backstage at the CNET stage when that happened.  Now that's in the South Hall, isn't it?  It's in the South Hall.  And we had people out on the floor doing live hits already  from Central Hall where the power went out.  So we just immediately turned into like CNN.  Blackout Central.

Start time: 275.58
End time: 283.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were like throwing.  I'm standing here in front of a blacked out TV set.  Yes, and it was really exciting.

Transcript:  Yep, the whole Samsung booth went down.  There were a few booths with their own generators,  like this boat that was all lit up.  But who's gonna come visit that?  It was very strange.  To make your way through the bitch.  It was just uncanny and ironic, right?  Of all places.

Start time: 306.87
End time: 313.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, especially since this was the CES where they,  for instance, showed a Kohler bathroom  that without electricity is completely useless.

End time: 316.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Correct.  That's true, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were some companies talking about solar power  and you know they were just sitting back  rubbing their hands thinking, oh yes, come to us.  We're gonna make some more, yeah.  Make some more money today.

Start time: 333.02
End time: 341.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It did seem like though,  were there some breakthroughs?  I guess, I mean in TVs we could talk about  Samsung's micro LED.

Start time: 342.32
End time: 357.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, I mean the wall, right?  The idea of this modular wall-based television  that's so much more fun and exciting  you're not gonna be able to afford it for a long time.  It's a cool idea that you'd be able to expand  and contract a television based on what you need  for your house if you want.

Start time: 358.82
End time: 389.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a TV the size of your wall.  In my opinion that's a spin  because they can't get them,  the micro LEDs are very, very small LEDs  just as they sound like, red, green, and blue.  And they combine together to make a pixel.  But they can't get them small enough.  The only way you can make a 40 TV out of micro LEDs  is if you have a 16K screen.  So they made a virtual TV out of this  because they can't do anything smaller.  So they made a virtual, oh well it's modular.  Yeah, that's true because otherwise

Start time: 389.46
End time: 403.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you wouldn't be able to get it in the door.  That's true.  I mean, the thing is once it's that large though,  you're not gonna be able to appreciate  a much better resolution than that  without getting, unless you're very, very close to it.  Although there were 8K screens.

Start time: 403.86
End time: 438.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were 8K LED screens.  Insane.  What, stop it.  No, really?  It was coming soon.  Oh man.  DLG roll up TV though, that was really impressive.  Unfortunately they didn't have that on the show floor.  But we've all known that OLEDs are flexible  and they can be rolled up.  And we've seen a lot of concepts of small flexible displays  from companies like Samsung.  But for LG to roll out a 4K,  I think it was 65 inch if I remember correctly.  Roll up TV, rolled up into a tube  like a window blind kind of thing.  And that was really, really impressive.  I was just disappointed they didn't have it  on the show floor going all day long.

Start time: 438.36
End time: 457.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was really cool.  The one thing to note about it though,  and David Katzmeier from CNET took a really close look at it.  He was super impressed.  He had the same thing to say that Tim just said,  but they would not reveal the mechanism  into which it was rolling.  It's just a big box.  It's a box, but you couldn't actually like,  Well like what would it be?  See where it was going.

Start time: 458.65
End time: 462.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was probably like two people's hands  just kind of rolling it up manually.

Start time: 462.66
End time: 472.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know how tight the roll was,  I guess is what I'm saying.  We couldn't see whether it was really tight  and it was kind of like a window shade  or whether it was this, I suspect it was a very,  there's David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy said,  I'm wondering what you think,  that 70 inches is the new 55 or 60,  that TVs are gonna get bigger.

Start time: 487.72
End time: 503.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that that's just sort of a truism.  It's like the Moore's law.  They do anyway.  They just get bigger  and we all have this weird sci-fi expectation  that eventually TVs are gonna fill our whole wall.  We just seem to want that.  I'm not sure exactly.  So 146 inches.  Most of us now just watch on this.  I know.

Start time: 503.70
End time: 508.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's so crazy.  I was just watching the football game on my iPad.  It's over now, so I don't put it away

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because that's rude.

Start time: 510.58
End time: 515.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, I think a lot of people,  I look at my son's generation,  they don't care if it's 70 inches or 10 inches.

Start time: 517.46
End time: 520.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't seem to care that much.  They may though when they start to buy houses.

Start time: 521.02
End time: 537.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's an old person thing.  You wanna sit in comfy chairs.  So how about cars?  This is one of the things that's weird about CES.  It's right before the auto show.  And yet there's a lot of automotive technology  at CES, right Tim?

Start time: 538.02
End time: 592.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a huge amount of stuff there.  And a lot of companies use CES  as kind of a launching point for their Detroit show,  actually.  So they'll announce some technology in Vegas at CES.  For example, Mercedes-Benz showed off  their new infotainment system at Vegas.  And then they went into Detroit  and showed off the new G-Class, their big new SUV.  So that way they can get their tech story  and they can get that angle covered in Vegas.  And then they can get their big sheet metal story  done in Detroit as well,  without kind of stepping on their own toes.  Because in Detroit, not that many people  would really care about a new infotainment system.  And in Vegas, certainly not that many people  would care about what is ultimately a new version  of their ancient giant SUV.  So that way they can basically target their story  at the appropriate media  and kind of cover both bases pretty well.  But there were quite a few automotive announcements  at CES.  Byton was probably the biggest one.  New Chinese manufacturer with a relatively low cost,  all electric SUV, hopefully coming to the US in 2020.  Fingers crossed, we'll see.

Start time: 595.08
End time: 625.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So electrics are interesting  because you've got, of course, Tesla,  but then you now have the Nissan Leaf,  which is a big seller.  The Bolt from B-O-L-T from Chevy, which is a big seller.  And every car manufacturer, I'm curious,  they've announced electrics,  but do they see this as the future of the market  or are they doing this for regulatory reasons?  There are countries like Norway where if it's not electric,  you won't be able to sell it in a few years.  What's driving electric?  Is it demand?  I don't think it's demand.

Start time: 625.44
End time: 697.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely not demand.  In fact, I was just looking at some numbers  not that long ago,  and the average incentive price on top of an EV  is in the 10 to $15,000 range,  which is basically how much dealers need to knock off  the price of the car to move those.  So for example, the Chevy Bolt EV,  the electric car outsold the Volt  to their plug-in hybrid last year,  which is on the surface a pretty great story,  but they had to knock off somewhere around $12,000,  $13,000 on every Bolt to get them out the door,  and that's on top of any federal incentives.  So there's a lot of deals like that going on  to get these things out the door.  And the expectation is that they could be the future,  but there are actually a lot of executives  that are skeptical.  There was a KPMG study from a few months back  where I think it was on the order of 60 or 70%  of automotive executives think that battery electrics  are actually a fad,  and they're actually gonna go away.  So that's pretty interesting.  But right now they're allowing these automotive companies  to basically increase their average fuel economy  and ultimately reduce the fleet emissions  of all their vehicles so they get credits,  and ultimately that allows them to go and build  big trucks or sports cars or whatever else they wanna do,  but they're having to incentivize those EVs a lot  in order to get them out the door.  And I'm hoping that that changes this year  with the Model 3 coming out in mass,  but that remains to be seen.

Start time: 697.70
End time: 699.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of the problem is that gas is cheap right now.

Start time: 699.98
End time: 710.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gas is super cheap, and it's still not easy to charge.  All my friends who drive electric vehicles,  and I have quite a few,  because I live in Berkeley, that's like...  I don't do yoga and I don't have an electric car,  so I'm gonna get kicked out.

Start time: 711.02
End time: 715.30

Transcript:  At least you eat granola and wear burger stocks,  so you're halfway though. Granola, yes.

Start time: 718.58
End time: 730.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's still this kind of crazy,  like wait, where's there a Whole Foods?  I gotta charge.  This is just taking too long.  I'm not gonna make my appointment.  I think it's true. This still happens a lot,  and it stresses people out.  And charging is slow.

Start time: 731.02
End time: 740.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if you're used to going to the gas station  and filling up in a few minutes,  you're gonna be charging for,  if it's a supercharger, half an hour,  and if it's not, long, long time.

Start time: 740.50
End time: 781.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so that was actually one of the cool things  we saw at CES was the first production-ready car  with a solid-state battery.  That was the new Fisker E-Motion,  which is a beautiful four-door, kind of sporty sedan thing.  But we've heard a lot of talk about solid-state batteries,  and Fisker was the first one to actually show us  the car that had one in it.  And in nine minutes, that car will do 125 miles  with charging, which is about two hours of driving.  So you figure if you're cruising down the highway  every two hours, maybe, stop, get a coffee,  use the restroom, and in that time,  you'd get another 120 miles of range.  So in theory, that's pretty cool.  And we're expecting to see something similar  from Porsche this year or a little later on.  But solid-state batteries could really change the industry,  and that could get us the charging rate that we need,  but we're still gonna need those chargers, of course.

Start time: 781.62
End time: 789.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Tim, what did you think of the Qualcomm demo of the,  it was basically like wireless charging for your car, right?  That was what I got out of it.

Start time: 789.78
End time: 793.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They put it in the freeway, and you charge as you drive?  Well, you just let it, as you park,

Start time: 793.32
End time: 795.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you just parked over the charging pad.

Start time: 796.02
End time: 850.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're actually working on both.  So the technology is called Halo,  and the basic idea is that, yeah,  you'd be able to deploy this within a parking spot  at a grocery store or something like that.  And it actually will do fast DC charging wirelessly,  which is pretty cool.  So you just park your car over it.  I think the loss rate is only,  it's less than 5%, if I can recall correctly.  So it's actually not that much worse  than actually just plugging the car in directly.  But they did do a prototype last year.  They said, I think it was 500 meters of road in Paris  that they had lined with these things,  and they were actually able to get a car  to charge while it was driving.  It takes a lot of work to make that work,  because usually with these wireless charging systems,  you have to have a direct P2P kind of connection  sort of thing.  But they're actually able to make it work  as the car was driving.  So in theory, if there was a city with enough money,  and I'm guessing it would cost a whole lot of money,  they could make major roads wirelessly charging vehicles.  So you'd have buses cruising along,  just pulling electricity right out of the ground.

Start time: 851.22
End time: 854.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems like they would have to work with,  that'd be a toll road kind of situation.

Start time: 854.98
End time: 855.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably so, yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 855.96
End time: 862.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is fuel cell technology going anywhere?  Because that's another alternative  where you have faster fill-ups, I think.

Start time: 863.44
End time: 962.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely, so we saw that was another thing at CES.  Hyundai showed off their fuel cell electric car.  In fact, Antoine Goodwin on our team drove one  from San Francisco down to Las Vegas  for the unveiling of the car, which was pretty cool.  The advantage of fuel cells,  well, they're basically electric cars,  but rather than having a big battery,  they pull their electricity from an onboard hydrogen tank.  And you can refill those in about five minutes,  give or take.  So yeah, in theory, you could basically get  a full amount of range from compressed liquid hydrogen  in about the same amount of time  it would take you to fill up your car.  Range on those does tend to be  in the 250 to three-mile range, so that's plenty.  And again, no emissions other than water vapor.  We've seen more and more companies working on it.  Both Honda and Toyota have been kind of taking the lead here,  but Hyundai now has this car as well,  which is pretty great to see.  And it's actually quite a nice looking little crossover SUV.  But there actually, the problem is much bigger.  If I have an EV, in fact, I do have an EV,  I can just plug it in my garage and charge it up.  And in the next day, it's fully charged.  So if I don't go further than the range of my car,  I don't even need to think about charging.  With a hydrogen system,  you don't probably have a hydrogen filling station  in your garage.  So at that point, you need to find one.  There are, I think, maybe a dozen or two in New York state,  which is a pretty big state in California.  There's more, but still, they're very, very hard to find.  And getting those things deployed in metropolitan areas  is actually pretty difficult  because hydrogen is, of course, rather explosive.  So there needs to be some regulation on that front too.  So the potential is there, the emissions are great,  the range is great.  It solves a lot of the EV problems.  And the nice thing is it kind of piggybacks on EV technology  from a drivetrain standpoint, so that's nice too.  But distribution there is actually even harder  than on the EV side,  because you can just put a charging station  pretty much anywhere you want to.  You can't really store a big tank of hydrogen  anywhere you want to.

Transcript:  Georgia, how much is gas expensive in Canada?  Somebody's saying in Vancouver, it's $5.25 a gallon.

Start time: 971.90
End time: 984.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's expensive here.  We pay a lot for our gas,  and we're one of the major producers,  so, you know, doesn't make a ton of sense.  It's gone down, but it's still really expensive in Canada.  I wonder why-  And especially in Quebec.

Start time: 985.06
End time: 995.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the government trying to disincentivize people  to use gas, or why is it cheap here and expensive in Canada?  I bet it has to do with taxation.

Start time: 995.88
End time: 1014.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that it's not just even taxation.  I think that it's agreements that we have of, you know,  how many distillation systems we're going to have here  versus overseas, and we really pretty much sell off  all of our crude and then buy it back,  which again, the logic is flawed,  but so a lot of that has to do with us  buying back our own.

Start time: 1015.34
End time: 1031.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not against the idea,  because I think you do want to encourage  the switch to renewables.  Sure.  And it's one of the things that's held it back here,  is that, but if gas prices are low, you know,  everything costs less,  because everything's delivered by gas, drug, and so on.

Start time: 1031.12
End time: 1046.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm kind of assuming,  and this is going to reveal my Canada ignorance,  but that public transportation systems  are probably not much better than they are in the US,  just because of the population density  and size of the country.  So that is interesting.

Start time: 1047.04
End time: 1093.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  We do have, there's certain areas  that have really great public transport,  but our road systems also are really pitiful,  and in Quebec, they're probably one of the worst  in the country.  Just there's potholes everywhere, which, you know,  has to do with- It's climate related, right?  I mean- It's not just climate related.  It's actually also about, they, you know,  they found out all kinds of nefarious things with,  you know, they've chosen to give contracts to people  for 20 years, and so they build roads  that are actually poor road systems,  and the concrete is not made to last  for as long as the contract is,  so that people are constantly renewing the road systems  because of that.  So there's a lot of stuff that kind of happens.  Canada's great.  I really love Canada, but, you know,  there's another side to that as well.

He's done a lot of the most beautiful cars on the road.  Oh, the emotion is gorgeous.  I want this car.  It is beautiful, except for that little grill on the nose,  which I'm not particularly fond of, I must be honest.  But otherwise, yeah, it is gorgeous.  It's got suicide doors,  which is one of the things that we love to see  on concept cars, but they never actually come to production.  But it is a great looking car,  and hopefully a lot of lessons learned  from the Fisker Karma, which was the car that came before.  And that car actually is still available,  another company about the technology  and brought it out with bigger batteries  and a few other tweaks.  Unfortunately, it's still just not a very good car.  We're hopeful this one will be better.  We'll see.

Tesla was a little bit ahead  and then everything went wrong for Fisker  and kind of fell off the map.  It seems very hard to dig out of that,  but I don't know, Tim,  do you think they've kept their panache?

So ultimately I think he's got a sort of clientele  that's going to be very loyal to his design  more so than anything.  So I think that'll help to get that first,  a couple of hundred sold that he's looking for.  Beyond that, that's the big question  and how reliable that solid state battery technology can be  is my big question  because this is still cutting edge technology.  Again, we're waiting to see some major manufacturer  bring out, there's been a lot of rumors  that Porsche's electric model S fighter,  which we think we'll see in just a few months,  will actually be using the same sort of technology,  but we're waiting to see on that front.  So I think that's where I would be most skeptical  and I definitely wouldn't want to be at the cutting edge  of that reservation queue myself,  but I'm definitely eager to see how the thing drives  and hopefully we'll get a chance to take a spin  in one this year, a knock on wood anyway.

Transcript:  Absolutely.  As a second car?  That's a good point.  Because it's absolutely astronomical.  It's unbelievable.  You can get a last generation Leaf  for less than $10,000 at this point,  even if it only has maybe 20,000 miles on it.  It's outrageous how quickly these things drop.  And that's encouraging  if you're looking for a secondhand car,  but the problem is that actually is really heavily  disincentivizing anybody who's thinking about buying one new  because of course, you want that car to be worth something  when you trade it back in again.  So lease rates are generally pretty appealing for EVs.  They're actually relatively affordable.  We got a Kia Soul EV a few months ago  and they took almost half of the MSRP off  just to get us in short term lease in that thing  just because they were desperate to move them.  A lot of car companies know that these new EVs are coming  with more range and like the new Leaf, for example,  on the Model 3 now that's actually in production.  And that's just going to drive the prices  of the existing EVs down quite a bit.

They're all looking at me strangely.  This is our sponsor for the day.  Quip.  Look at this.  Now everybody, well, you probably should know  that an electric toothbrush is the better way  to brush your teeth.  Not just for lazy people.  My daughter says,  I'm not going to get an electric toothbrush.  That's for lazy people.  Well, but you're going to get better checkups  because you brush your teeth better.  This Quip toothbrush is fabulous.  30 seconds per sector, it times you,  gives you a little beep.  But the best part of it is,  it comes by mail.  You get the refills,  the resupplies of the heads automatically.  It is a beautiful electric toothbrush.  And look at this.  It has a little strip here.  You actually adhere this to your mirror  or to your counter or somewhere.  And the toothbrush sits there  so you never forget to brush your teeth.  Isn't that nice?  How do you charge it?  Ah, you don't have to charge it.  It's got a AA battery in it.  So that's even better, right?  You don't have to charge, you just,  I'm glad you asked that.  You just put it on your mirror.  And then, and then you will get automatically,  you'll get the new heads every three months.  See, everybody says,  oh, I gotta remember to change my toothbrush,  but never does it.  This way you get it automatically.  You also get tips, I confess.  How old am I?  I should know how to brush my teeth, right?  You get tips on dental care that I didn't even know.  It's backed by over 10,000 dental professionals.  For instance, I'm reading the instructions.  It says, don't rinse after you brush.  I always rinsed after I brush.  Because of course,  that's how the fluoride is getting in your teeth, dummy.  So even here I am at my age  learning how to brush my teeth better.  It is fabulous, by the way, toothpaste.  Tastes great, gives you a nice minty flavor,  strengthens your teeth.  And of course, it's good for your teeth.  It's got sodium monofluorophosphate or whatever that is  to strengthen your teeth  and make sure you don't get cavities.  They've combined dentistry and design  to make a better electric toothbrush.  And you get new brush heads every three months  for just $5, including free shipping worldwide.  I love that.  Most toothbrushes cannot claim  to be one of Time Magazine's best inventions of the year.  Quip can.  Q-U-I-P.  It starts at $25.  That's a lot less than those big names.  It works just as well or even better.  I think it's more convenient.  And if you go to getquip.com slash twit right now,  you'll get your first refill pack free  when you purchase any Quip electric toothbrush.  Here's a tip for moms, Lindsey.  You know, are they old enough to have sleepovers yet?  Oh yeah.  Kids never bring their toothbrush to sleepovers.  So we got a couple extra heads.  Including my own.  Yes.  We got a couple extra heads and we put their names on them  and when they come for the sleepover,  Aiden, your toothbrush is right there.  It's awesome.

Transcript:  Hey, what's the status of self-driving cars, Tim?  Are we seeing any advance here?  I have to say having driven a Tesla now for over a year,  year and a half, that's not autopilot.  It's-  No, it's not.  It's a nice cruise control.  It's a nice cruise control.

Start time: 1840.68
End time: 1884.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, Tesla's was the best for a little while,  but they're not the best any longer.  Right now, I think in terms of what's available  to the mass market,  the GM Super Cruise is the closest thing  we have to autonomy.  With that in the new Cadillac CT6  and soon coming to other, excuse me,  coming to other Cadillacs,  you'll be able to actually take your hands off the wheel  and get on the highway.  So basically on designated roads that Cadillac knows  has mapped and high enough resolution  and in conditions where the car can actually see the lines  in the road, you get on the highway, you press a button,  and the steering wheel turns blue,  and then you can take your hands off the wheel  and you are good to go.  You still need to pay attention,  but you can look away for I think upwards of 20 seconds  sometimes, so you can't be just reading a book  or something like that,  but the car will take care of itself  and do a pretty good job.

Start time: 1895.44
End time: 1924.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, for Cadillac, it blinks at you very, very noticeably  and sounds a very loud chime as well.  So it'll give you a warning.  I think it's probably about a 20 or 30 second warning  saying we're coming to the end of the road  that I know how to map,  or if the conditions are changing,  if the weather's bad, suddenly you can't see very well.  It'll give you a pretty good warning  and it'll start to chime.  At some point, the car will eventually slow down and stop  if you do not respond at some point.  So actually it does a pretty good job at the handover,  and it has an infrared camera actually watching you as well  to make sure that you are paying attention  and that you are able to take control of the car back.

Start time: 1924.42

Transcript:  We should definitely expect to see it  across the entire GM line.  And Nissan's actually got a really nice system  in the Leaf called ProPilot Assist  that's not quite that comprehensive.  You can't take your hands off the wheel,  but I was speaking with a Nissan engineer  last week in Detroit actually,  and they plan to have Leafs be able  to automatically change lanes on their own by next year.  And by 2020, they wanna have this ProPilot system  be able to actually stop automatically at intersections.  Right now, if you're behind somebody and that person stops,  the car will stop and follow them.  So it will stop at intersections  if it can kind of follow somebody else.  But in 2020, they say this system will be good enough  to be able to stop at a red light or stop at a stop sign  and proceed through all on its own.

We're not gonna just one day wake up  and it's gonna be like January 1st, 2025,  we're all on an autonomous grid.  It makes sense.

Start time: 2000.46
End time: 2053.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than a lot of other companies like Waymo, for example,  who are jumping right to level four, level five,  which is where there's basically no driver controls.  And there's different arguments one way or the other.  On one hand, it kind of makes sense to be iterative  because at that point, you can kind of progressively  make things better and smarter.  But on the other hand, that gray area  between truly driverless and all human driven  is actually pretty complicated  because now not only do you need to make the car  be able to drive itself some of the time,  but it has to actually watch the driver  and hand control back over to the driver.  And that is actually really, really complicated  to know if I'm paying attention,  if I'm in a state where I'm ready  to take control of the car back,  what's my heart rate, are my eyes open, am I drunk?  The car needs to figure out all that before  it can safely hand control back to you.  And that problem right there,  if you make a car that's fully driverless,  you don't have to worry about that at all.  And so that's why we see a lot of companies like Waymo  just saying, forget the whole intermediary steps,  we're just gonna make cars  that don't even have steering wheels  I'm trying to understand that

Start time: 2053.94
End time: 2080.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because one of the problems with this half autonomy  is the time it takes for you to kind of readjust to driving.  So if you're letting the Tesla or the Leaf drive  or the Cadillac drive,  and you suddenly need to take control,  unless you've been really paying attention  as if you were driving,  there's a few seconds to just grok, what's going on?  Where am I, what's happening?  And that's another to be-  It's almost more dangerous, right?  Yeah, I think it's more dangerous, exactly.

Start time: 2080.66
End time: 2118.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you're getting used to being in a car  and not really paying attention.  That midpoint becomes then when you need to pay attention  by the time that milliseconds that it takes  for your brain to kind of be fully activated,  that's a really dangerous set of times.  So you should either be paying attention  or the car should be able to deal with it.  And that midpoint, I think that people end up,  we already think that we can check our cell phone,  do this, eat something, chat with this person,  sing, dance around in the car,  which is already using up a certain amount  of our attention.  So yeah, I agree with you, Leo.  It's kind of one of those things  where it might be even more dangerous to have a midpoint.

Start time: 2224.90
End time: 2264.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  Yeah, certainly.  The crashes that we see are human caused.  Human error.  Right, but those are,  we're so used to that at this point  that people just go, oh, that's a shame and move on.  But when robot cars make a mistake and kill people,  as we've seen with the unfortunate autopilot accident,  but previously, it becomes a major story.  And it's gonna be a major story for a very long time.  And people won't give robot cars the same kind of slack  that they cut human beings.  So it is gonna be a major adjustment for a lot of people,  despite the fact that these cars are already much safer  than human drivers by and large.  There's going to be a lot of trust built up  before people really trust them to be on the road  and be commuting next to somebody who's watching a movie  or reading a book or taking a nap.

Transcript:  Georgia, how do you get people,  how would you, as a psychologist,  approach getting people used to the idea  of getting in a car without a steering wheel  or a brake pedal?

Start time: 2278.12
End time: 2351.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that without a steering wheel and a brake pedal,  I think, as Lindsay said, the incremental is easier  for us to kind of cope with  and not feel that type of anxiety.  I feel that an autonomous car would be much safer,  yet I would not feel comfortable driving  without having, if I wanted to take over, that I couldn't.  And in the end, what happens is habituation.  When we see something enough, after a while,  even if it's kind of scary or dangerous, our brains go,  you know what, I guess it's not that bad  because I've seen it all these times  and it hasn't been traumatized.  We will get used to it, for sure.  But with everything, there's a certain amount of anxiety.  We don't deal well with change.  We deal well with incremental change.  But large jumps in change causes a great amount of anxiety  and unfortunately, we are less and less adaptive  as we get older.  So when we're young and if we've grown up with something,  it's very comfortable for us.  But as we get older, our ability to change environments  and the status quo becomes much more difficult for us.  So I think that also it will be the younger generations  that will find this and kind of embrace it  and wanna try something new and cool.  And those of us that are older  that are not really into technology will be like,  you know what, I'm just gonna stick with the steering wheel  and brake and take my chances.

Start time: 2352.96
End time: 2398.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like it would be better to do it instantly.  Like, because of the-  Especially for older drivers.  Well, there's lots of reasons.  I mean, the incremental approach is gonna,  there's gonna be more traffic deaths.  There's gonna be more fatalities.  And there's gonna, in fact, be an increase in fatalities  from the bad intersection between self-driving cars  and humans and the takeover.  I mean, it's interesting, this happened in,  I'm told by professional pilots,  in aeronautics and airplanes, civilian aviation,  Airbus makes a far more automated plane than Boeing does.  And pilots in the United States,  particularly United Airlines, didn't wanna get Airbuses.  They didn't wanna get the pilot out of the loop.

Start time: 2398.94
End time: 2403.98

Start time: 2405.20
End time: 2435.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it could happen.  And probably an Airbus would not do a good job of that,  but Sully would.  Nevertheless, in the vast majority of situations,  humans make, even pilots make mistakes.  There've been accidents that where the pilot's taken over  and done the wrong thing  and actually caused the plane to crash,  where an Airbus wouldn't have let them do that.  And so it's the same thing is happening.  And this is really the issue of self-driving versus humans,  self-flying planes versus human planes.

Start time: 2436.10
End time: 2465.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that there's another point as well,  which is that our economy is strongly driven,  if I can say that, by the fact that we drive our own cars,  the amount of people that are in taxis  and that are fixing cars  and that are dealing with that and driving.  So a lot of people's jobs depend on us  being the ones to drive that.  And I think that if we just went straight to autonomous,  I don't think that the economy  would be able to readjust fast enough.  There'd be a lot of people out of work because of that.  Like you just go to how many-

Start time: 2465.08
End time: 2534.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really true.  Yeah.  Actually, there's a lot of potential  to create a lot of new jobs.  Once we go to autonomous cars,  at that point, the expectation is a lot of us  will be using ride sharing services a lot more.  So even if I have a car in my driveway in the morning  that takes me to work in the morning,  that car might not be sitting there in the driveway.  Because right now, 95% of the time that we own our cars,  our cars are sitting in a driveway,  sitting in a parking lot, not doing anything.  Ownership is not a fix.  Five percent utilization is not right.  And there's also the need to fix those cars.  Right.  If we go to autonomy at that point,  the idea is that ride sharing will be so popular  that ultimately my car will take me to work  and then my car might shuttle people  from the train station to their jobs all day long.  And then the car will be back and ready to take me home again  and then all night long,  it might again be out doing ride sharing,  that kind of thing.  So utilization will go up such an incredibly huge amount  that our cars will actually need  a lot more servicing than before.  Which means being an auto mechanic  will actually become a lot more important  because we have a lot more cars that need to be used.  There's also gonna be a lot of new services  like cleaning our cars  because we're gonna have people going in and out of our cars.  We're seeing this kind of cottage industry  of people who go in and clean cars coming up  that's really not been there before.  So there are opportunities I think.

End time: 2556.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  I think that we're dealing with efficiency versus economy.  And I think that because of the fact  that the cars will not be run going too fast,  not have as many bumps and bruises,  I don't think that they'll both be able to track.  And I think that a lot of the jobs that it'll create  will be more high-end jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing though.  And also think about the time in the car.  This is what I spent a lot of time thinking about.  If your car is completely autonomous,  you have this contained place,  you're going from point A to point B,  you're a captive audience.  I mean, maybe that is when you meet with your therapist.  Oh.  Or you can have meetings in your car.  You can.  Actually, I have to say, listening to audio books.  I could get a facial in my car.

Start time: 2581.75

Start time: 2594.78
End time: 2606.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, or maybe it's a more private living room.  Or maybe because of 5G,  you're actually having that meeting.  It's like a telemedicine.  You're meeting your doctor  because you're in a private place.  You're on a call with your doctor from the car.

Transcript:  It's probably the case that the economy will create jobs.  I mean, it may be a net zero or not.  But even if it is a net zero change in employment,  it's gonna be highly disruptive.  The people-

Start time: 2623.18
End time: 2644.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it depends on how quickly we transition, right?  If we transition slowly,  I don't think that there's gonna be a problem  as more jobs are created as some jobs deal.  And people are gonna learn to adapt.  If it happens really quickly,  that's when we end up with a large amount of people  that are like, I don't know what to do.  I'm feeling worried, I get angry.  And then we end up with a lot of backlash  against a certain field because of that.

Start time: 2645.00
End time: 2699.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's gonna happen more quickly than most people think.  There are fully driverless cars in Phoenix right now.  Waymo is testing them there.  GM has the cruise AV that they wanna have  on the streets of San Francisco,  available for public use by next year.  And once people get to experience these cars,  they're probably going to want to be using them more.  So I think that those things will come very quickly.  And then, yeah, at that point, it will be very disruptive.  And ultimately, I don't think we really have a good idea  or a good understanding of exactly what it will do  to that industry.  And plenty more.  I mean, if you have an hour commute right now,  you probably wouldn't be too cool with that.  But if your hour commute is you hanging out  in the back seat of the car napping or getting work done  or reading a book or doing whatever,  most people would probably be okay with that.  And so that means maybe we'll see this kind of rush  out of cities again, moving more to the suburbs again,  which would be contrast to the urbanization  we've been seeing a lot lately.  Which so that could have some major changes to everything.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Dan, how have they been, sorry,  how have they been dealing with weather situations  in snow?  I live in Canada.  There's a lot of snow.

Start time: 2707.98
End time: 2768.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how have they been working on that?  Yeah, it's definitely difficult.  That's exactly why Waymo is testing in Phoenix,  there's no weather to worry about there.  But it is definitely an issue.  Ford is the only one I've heard of that's really put  a lot of effort into testing in the snow.  They showed off a concept of their autonomous cars  that actually ignores the lines in the road.  And they use lidar scanners like most cars do.  And they scan the trees and the buildings  and basically the surroundings rather  than actually mapping the road.  So even if the road is completely occluded by snow,  the car can know exactly where it is on the road,  which is pretty cool.  And lidar scanners are actually good enough right now.  One engineer told me that in a blizzard,  they can count the snowflakes in a blizzard.  They can see better than a human can, for sure.  Yeah, so ultimately blizzards and that kind of thing  really aren't that problematic,  especially when you have a car with radar and lidar  and other sensors.  The big problem though is when that stuff starts to build up,  ice and snow getting on sensors is a problem.  So companies like PBG are working on special coatings  that will kind of shrug off that stuff.  So it's a challenge for sure,  they haven't exactly quite figured out,  but I'm optimistic they will pretty soon.

Transcript:  So Tim, chat room was wondering, what about security?  Are there people talking about security at CES  and the auto show about, you know,  because we've seen the cars, famous hacks of cars  where people remotely take over and accelerate you  into a wall and all sorts of things.  Are car manufacturers paying more attention to this now?

Start time: 2797.88
End time: 2876.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They definitely are, but most of them actually  aren't talking about it too much.  I think they're still taking the big corporation idea  that talking about security puts a target on your back.  So by and large, these companies are not really being  that forthright about it.  GM is one of the, a few companies actually is going out  there and working with hacking communities  with white hat hackers, with, you know,  things like bug bounties and things like that,  but that's pretty rare.  But actually in Detroit last week,  John Chen from Blackberry had a keynote speech  and they actually spent the whole time showing off  a developer tool designed explicitly  for basically being integrated into your build process  and scanning for any vulnerabilities within automotive code.  It's called Jarvis and they basically showed off  how you can integrate it within your build system.  And within a matter of minutes,  it will scan over all your automotive code  and look for common vulnerabilities  that your average mobile developer might be familiar with,  but automotive developers, you know,  typically are used to working within very closed systems.  So for them, this is kind of a new world.  So it's actually really interesting for John Chen  and his colleagues to stand up in front of an audience  of mostly automotive journalists  and talk about a developer tool, you know,  something that you would integrate into your make files.  And they spent a long time going into exactly  how much this can make your car's code more safe.  So that's actually a pretty interesting approach.  And there is a lot of work going on in that area,  but again, a lot of it's going on behind closed doors,  which I think is still pretty unfortunate.

Transcript:  It's interesting to see Blackberry doing that.  They've really found a second life.  They bought a real-time operating system called QNX,  some years ago.  And is that becoming the dominant car platform?

Start time: 2889.54
End time: 2919.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It definitely is.  And that was one of the bigger announcements  coming out of CES was a partnership with Nvidia.  Nvidia is now making their GPUs become  kind of the de facto platform  for a lot of these autonomous cars, actually,  because the floating point math used for video games  is actually very similar to the floating point math  used for autonomous cars.  And so QNX now, which is this very bulletproof,  low-level operating system used in nuclear submarines  and power plants and F-16s and stuff like that,  is now becoming the kind of de facto operating system  for a lot of these things, too.

Transcript:  Actually, the Linux Automotive Group  is doing a lot of great things as well.  They're working on autonomy quite readily.  And there's a lot of Linux in cars as well,  but again, that tends to be hidden deeper  down below the surface.  Again, a lot of manufacturers aren't really that keen  to talk about what's running on their cars,  to be honest with you.  But there's a lot of Android hiding in these systems, too,  and we're seeing Android N actually will be running  natively in a lot of dashboards, which is pretty exciting.  So no more Android Auto.  You'll just have Google Home running your dashboard.

Start time: 2980.16
End time: 3022.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And because they're so good  at making their chips efficient,  this was actually a really interesting point.  I had Danny Shapiro from NVIDIA on a panel  I did in Detroit last week, and somebody asked,  what kind of power consumption are you talking about?  And Danny said that you're talking typically about 30 watts  for one of these autonomous GPUs to power a car.  And 30 watts is really not that much power.  You would probably need two of those  for a redundancy sort of situation.  But even so, less than 100 watts is what they're aiming for  anyway when they have a production-ready version  of these GPUs.  And that's essentially relatively low  because you think about autonomous car, an EV,  you want to have all your battery juice going  to actually making you get to where you want to go.  You don't want to have it burning away  at the GPU sitting in your trunk.  So that was actually really interesting.

If you're a 7-Eleven clerk,  this might scare you a little bit.  Amazon Go opens tomorrow.  This is in the Amazon headquarters, it's the first.  But the idea is there's no humans.  You walk in, it recognizes you, I presume from your phone.  You pick up what you want, you walk out,  cameras register what you bought on the shelves  in other places and charge you for it on, I guess,  Android Pay or what they call Google Pay now.

Start time: 3060.64
End time: 3080.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, so you still have to register your phone  when you walk in.  Okay, so you scan it.  So you have to say, here's my phone, you scan it.  Now your phone is matched to you.  And then presumably the system with all the cameras  in the store are taking pictures of you  watching where you go, there are sensors on the products.  I mean, this is like a Vegas mini bar, right?

Transcript:  Right, but what was interesting about it was that  apparently in this demo store,  there were still quite a few employees standing around  to do things like ID checks on the alcohol section.  Yeah, of course.  Interesting.  And if you have any experience,  and this is really the basic version of this,  it's not that crazy when you think about self-checkout  at Safeway or what have you,  but I don't know how often you've done that.  I'm forced to do it all the time.  It's a pain in the butt.  There are always checkers having to come over  and help people with their transactions  for all kinds of reasons.  And those already existing systems  don't let you take alcohol through them usually.  So I think it's a proof of concept  and maybe a little bit getting people used to the idea  that you don't have to interact with a human  because kind of like the autonomous driving conversation,  it's something that people will feel uncomfortable with  for a long time until they do it  and they see those charges pop up easily.  And they'll just be like, wait, I can just come in  and go, how are you gonna know?  And what's gonna, and why are you tracking me?  And I think they're just getting people used to this idea.

Drivers, Uber drivers, convenience stores.  But what is more convenient than have,  and you could put little ones of these everywhere.  You don't have to put wine in them.  You can just put little ones of them everywhere,  and you just walk in, grab something, and go.  I think that's the future.  I'm going to predict this for five years from now.

So there certainly will be a lot of other things to do  at these stores, I would think.  But yeah, I'm super excited about the potential as well.  There are definitely times where, you know,  just going to a gas station and needing a couple things,  it would certainly be nice to just walk in,  grab it, and walk out again, rather than standing in line,  waiting for everybody else to get their coffee order right.

Like I'm going to work for the new zip car fleet.  7-Eleven polisher.  I mean, that's probably a really gross job.  Don't do it.  But there may be some entrepreneurial moments for them.  And you know, there's still a lot to do.  Like my yard is still not,  there are no robots yet to trim my trees.  Oh, that's just a moment in time.  There's plenty, well, sure.  But it's a well.

I also spend a lot of time thinking about  the Amazon warehouse because they're on the forefront.  Yeah, but that's a terrible job.  Well, it's a terrible job.  This is what makes me worry.  This is what makes me take the negative position.  You know, they have the Kiva robots  that drive the stock towers up.  They pick, they drive to the right shelf.  They park this little robot with the pallets on it  right in front of the item that needs to be grabbed.  The humans who work there,  their only job is to intercept these robots,  reach onto the stock shelf and put the item on the cart.  Because there aren't robots with really  well articulated fingers yet.  Essentially because robots don't have good hands.  Yeah.  And so we're paying humans to be hands.  And that is it.  They don't think, they don't move.  All they do is grab and place.  And this is what upsets me.  We've become just the meat bags.

End time: 3631.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

And he's head of AI research at Facebook.  He says, the whole thing is complete BS.  Sophia is to artificial intelligence  as prestidigitation is to real magic.

And yet Sophia and whatever she is,  like you could say it's real or not,  but she is part of getting us used to the idea  that there are gonna be robots who interact with you  on sort of a human level to the extent  that like Chrissy Teigen is getting in Twitter battles  with her about her makeup.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google,  they asked him at this event that Rico did with MSNBC,  Kara Swisher and Ari Melber from MSNBC  interviewing Sundar Pichai, Susan Wojcicki of YouTube.  And of course, it's Kara.  Kara is gonna always ask the tough questions.  Pichai talking about James Daymore,  the employee who wrote the memo saying,  why are we working so hard to hire women?  They don't like technology.  Said he does not regret firing Daymore.  He only regrets people thought of it as political.  Because Daymore is suing saying  that Google discriminates against conservative employees.  Pichai said, I regret that people misunderstand  that we made this for a political belief when we're another.  It's important for the women at Google  and all the people at Google.  We wanna make an inclusive environment.  I do not regret it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

If you wanna interpret that as political,  I think what he's saying is,  if people interpret that as political, that's a bummer.  But we've always said it was just the right thing to do.

Transcript:  I mean, I have no idea what their political stance is  and I don't think they actually really know.  I'm sure they're not tracking.  Google can track anything they want,  but I'm sure they're not really tracking that.  If you look statistically at the employment roles at Google,  I cannot believe the claim  that white men are being discriminated against.

Start time: 4139.44
End time: 4162.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They might have a few white men at Google.  There's a few.  That's a good point.  That's actually a good point.  And I don't even think that he fired him  because of the fact that it was political.  I think that it was just really bad press  and made Google look bad.  And because of that, they lost a whole bunch of money  and got, again, it's all about branding.  And so he costs them a whole bunch of money.  And if you cost your company a whole bunch of money,  you're probably gonna get fired.

Transcript:  It is insulting.  And the other thing that Sundar is saying is  it makes it harder for us to hire women  if it seems that we are discriminating against women  or that we are full of employees  who are going to create a hostile work environment for them.  And Google has, like many Silicon Valley companies,  been actually working very hard  to create a more inclusive environment.  And if you think about it from a business standpoint,  that makes a lot of sense.  Women spend more money in the United States than men.  So if you have a diverse staff,  you're more likely to create a product  that people will buy and spend money on.  From a business standpoint, it makes sense.

Start time: 4206.96

Transcript:  We've said that for years.  One of the reasons computing technology  is so hard to use is because it's designed by engineers.  It'd be nice if you had a few normal people  in the doors as well.  I mean, obviously, engineers have to design it,  but they don't have a really good grasp  of what normal people go through  to try to figure out how to use this stuff.  They go, well, it's obvious.  You just click the mouse, you do the thing,  and then, and then, and people go, huh?  So obviously, a little bit of diversity  and that wouldn't hurt.  Hey, we may be getting a HomePod pretty soon.  FCC approval for the Apple device  that was supposed to come out at Christmas and didn't.  A supplier in Ventech has apparently shipped  the first million HomePods.  They expect to ship as many as a dozen,  10 to 12 million more.  This is according to the Taipei Times.  And that would make sense  since it's about four to six weeks into the,  it's gonna be about four to six weeks into the year.  That's about when they would hit the store shelves.  So if you've been waiting,  did it seem like at CES that Apple and Microsoft  were kind of in the backseat for voice assistance  and that was really Google and Amazon's show?

Transcript:  Don't worry, don't worry.  It did get them a headline.  It was, what's crazy about this story to me  is that the plans to ship 10 to 12 million units  seems really optimistic to me  because that is gonna be an expensive piece of hardware.  And the reason that so many people  own like digital assistant speakers now  is because the price point came so far down.  So you're gonna echo Dot for essentially 40 bucks.

Start time: 4358.64
End time: 4387.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they just want those numbers.  It's like magazine subscriptions.  Whether you get them and you don't want them  because they need to say that there are a lot of power there.  I think Apple's probably not gonna ship  as many of these as they want.  However, I don't think they're as far behind  as everybody else says they are  because people use Siri.  Aggressively and all. They're already using it.  It's already baked into their, in fact,  because so many people use iPhones.  I actually think that Siri is way more a part  of people's lives than we all give it credit for.  And that may be true.

Start time: 4388.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, in mobile probably people mostly use Siri.  At home they're using Amazon.  Google is, you know, of course well positioned,  but not yet taking the market.  The Google claims 60 million activations over Christmas.

Transcript:  Right. It's gonna be hard, even if Apple has this hub.  It's gonna be, I think, a tough pitch though,  even to Apple fanatics, and I'm an Apple fanatic,  because we already picked an Amazon Echo, right?  We already have something.

Start time: 4427.56
End time: 4447.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know, we don't know yet exactly  how Apple is gonna position this,  but I would put a lot of money against the idea  that Apple is going to be, is gonna say  this is the best speaker you can get.  It sounds better than anything else.  It looks more beautiful.  It, blah, blah.  And it's better than Sonos.  But I think Sonos itself has proven  that that's a narrow market.

Start time: 4448.10
End time: 4464.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's over for Sonos.  It's gotta be over for Sonos.  I'm sorry.  I love Sonos.  I have highly invested in Sonos in every room here,  in every room at home,  but it's just gotta be over for Sonos.  They came too late to the game,  and they didn't add enough capability.

Start time: 4464.52
End time: 4475.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised if Sonos sold itself at some point  when they're a privately owned company, right?  Yeah, Apple should buy them.  Well, or Amazon should buy them,  because Amazon actually doesn't really have a premium play.

Start time: 4476.92
End time: 4492.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have the Sonos One, which is a little Sonos speaker  that they put Amazon's Echo in,  but it's not a complete Echo.  Amazon won't let them do, I presume it's Amazon  that won't let them do a full Echo capability.  For instance, I can't listen to my audiobooks on it.  So I'm not gonna buy another one.

Start time: 4493.24
End time: 4496.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if Amazon bought Sonos,  then maybe we would let it.

Start time: 4497.36
End time: 4522.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then, but really, speakers are a commodity now.  Anybody can make a good speaker system.  It's off the shelf.  It's not hard to do, is it?  And people aren't saying,  well, I have to have that finely tuned B&O speaker.  I mean, you're not competing at that level.  You're just competing with all the other guys.  It feels like that's, what is Sonos selling  that isn't generic at this point?

Start time: 4523.00
End time: 4529.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, it's just sound quality.  That's it.  And Apple's gonna try to compete against that.  But again, like you're saying, it's not enough.  It's not enough.

Start time: 4529.52
End time: 4554.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably not enough for Apple either.  Even Amazon doesn't really need it.  Why would you buy Sonos?  You just make one that's as good as a Sonos.  That's not so hard to do.  All right.  And by the way, first alert,  put Amazon's Echo into your smoke alarm.  Sure.  So you put a smoke alarm.  If you're building a new house,  you have to put a smoke alarm,  and at least you do in California,  I presume in most places,  you have to put a smoke alarm in every room.  Might as well have it be Echo enabled,  and now Echo's in every room.

Start time: 4555.00
End time: 4572.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boom.  Sure, the price point's pretty high.  I mean. Oh, is it?  Yeah, I mean, considering that you can buy  a decent smoke alarm for five bucks, basically.  Two dollars, yeah.  That's a little bit of a hard sell,  but it's really interesting,  especially if you want to strategically place it.  We also saw Phillips with Alexa in light bulbs at the show.

Transcript:  I think you're just going to see these devices everywhere.  What is, we talked earlier about privacy with the cars.  What is the privacy, what do you think, Georgia people?  I can't get my finger on this one,  because we have a lot of viewers  who are very concerned about privacy.  In fact, a lot of hosts that are tin foil hat wearers.  I, on the other hand,  am completely on the other end of the spectrum,  because I want all the convenience and functionality  that giving up privacy, like walking into that store,  doesn't bother me.  So Georgia, I'm going to assume you know some normal people.  Or at least have your finger on the pulse of normals.  Are normal people concerned about this?

Start time: 4623.40
End time: 4664.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that a lot of people are concerned  about their privacy,  but I don't think people are concerned enough.  I think that people will usually pick  convenience over privacy.  And I think that most people go by the thought of,  well, if I'm not doing anything wrong,  what does it really matter if they're harvesting  whatever information that they want from us?  In the end, we get so used to doing something  that it doesn't just create any of our threat levels to that.  But what we do is the most important set of information  that we have, and to have that being sold off to anyone,  in the end, they can find out all of our pattern recognition  and figure out where you're going to be, where,  and who you're seeing, and what you're doing because of that.  So I might be one of those tin foil hat people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you are, congratulations.

Start time: 4668.25
End time: 4685.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think that it's something that's really important.  I think that that is something that we are selling off  for convenience, and I don't believe that we should.  I think that if you choose to send that off,  at least get something of value for it,  not just convenience, which ends up being us saying  complacency and laziness, which I think is wrong.

Start time: 4685.00
End time: 4687.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get something of value.  I get a lot of value for this.

Start time: 4688.96
End time: 4725.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you really, most of the things that this can offer you,  you could have a little bit less offered to you.  And I think that that's what I'm excited about,  the HomePod, is that I'm gonna be able to have something  that I feel right now with Apple as it's set,  who knows if it gets sold,  but that my information is least secure.  And so maybe I'm not gonna be able to do  as many things with it, but that I don't have to worry  about someone harvesting all of my information of what I do.  And I think that that's really important.  And we know that there's no way  that they can keep this safe and secure  from all of the data breaches that we've already seen.  So it makes me feel a little bit more comfortable.

Start time: 4726.28

Start time: 4753.00
End time: 4801.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I think should happen is that whenever you turn  on a service that is going to be passively collecting data  on what you do, where you go, any time you opt  into that service, you should get a very bluntly,  very short-worded warning that says,  once you plug in this Alexa,  there will be a record of your voice at all times.  Warning, kind of like a cigarette warning.  But that is going to have to be legislated.  And people probably will choose that convenience  because they're used to it, but at least they know.  And very clearly, because right now it's just so hard  to understand what's happening, right?  It's kind of like how everybody suspects Facebook  is listening to you, like listening  to your actual conversations,  but nobody has actually been able to prove it.

Transcript:  See, well, one of the convenience, I drive a Tesla,  and so that means Elon Musk knows everywhere I go,  everything I do.  He knows when I put my foot on the brake,  he knows when I put my foot on the accelerator.  And they don't even hide it.  I even know this because we called and said,  I think the call went backwards when I put my foot  on the accelerator, and they said, well, let's check.  Let me see, what was the time?  No, no, it went forwards.  So I've given up all privacy, all privacy.

Start time: 4827.32
End time: 4835.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also do this for a living, though.  You're on screen almost all moments as well.  So probably for you, it's a little bit more comfortable  to that. I don't mind.

Start time: 4835.72
End time: 4848.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  But I'm just wondering what the harm,  I'm trying to find out what the harm,  I say this every time.  I understand conceptually, oh yeah,  you shouldn't give up privacy,  but what is the actual harm we're talking?  What's gonna happen to you?

Start time: 4849.98
End time: 4881.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The actual harm is that if you choose to go for office  or you're going to be someone that's going to be,  going against whatever is the government of the time  to that, that they can use all of the information  that they have against you or control that.  And they do, we've already seen that,  leaks of information come out and it can destroy  people's careers, what they're doing,  where they're going to that.  And so in the end, you end up being able to be much more  easily manipulated because your information  is going out there and often you aren't unaware of that.  I think it's the opposite.

Start time: 4882.20
End time: 4890.12

Start time: 4890.24
End time: 4908.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's not the truth though right now, right?  People's political careers and people that are in position  to think have been destroyed because of this.  So it's not right yet, right?  Like I don't worry if I trip and that's on video  because if I trip, like really to get that  to be interesting at all, I have to like-  Shouldn't their career be destroyed?  Repeat on to make it be interesting.

Start time: 4908.36

Start time: 4914.24
End time: 4924.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it might not even be bad behavior.  Often it can be political suicide,  something that's embarrassing or ridiculous or effeminate  or something that goes against the mainstream.

Start time: 4925.44
End time: 4930.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it seems like there also be some sort of ex post facto  like persecution or prosecution,  especially in countries where there is a little bit  of a thought police kind of world.  And if you are saying things that you think are private  behind closed doors and then later they are misinterpreted  or for instance, imagine you're having a conversation  in your home and you are sarcastically  or jokingly talking about like,  we should murder that person, you're joking.  But a jury may not know that if that's out of context later.  If somebody, there are all kinds of scenarios  we can't foresee, but when we're essentially being  electively surveilled, it is a little, it's unnerving.  We haven't seen where this is going yet.

If you're carrying a smartphone,  it's, I think that's a, I think there's no way,  I don't care if it's an Apple smartphone or not.  You're presuming that you're somehow able  to do that privately.  You're not, period.  Doesn't require Apple to cooperate.  You're just not.  So-  I just want people to know that.

I don't think you could say,  well, I'd like to use all these technologies and be private.  I think it's, by its very nature, it's not private.  And it doesn't require Apple to be complicit  or Google to be complicit.  It's, you know, I mean, if some,  if a government wants to eavesdrop on you,  there's nothing to stop them.  They just authorized the FISA Act again.  There's nothing to stop you.  So, you know, I mean, you're carrying a microphone  in your pocket and you're saying,  well, I don't want anybody to listen.  What are you gonna do?  I don't know, I think we're screwed.  But I don't think it's, I don't feel screwed by it.  Tim, you have an opinion?  You want to weigh in?

Come on, are you kidding me?  And what are they gonna do with that?  To Lindsay's point, there's definitely a lack of awareness,  I think, of what these companies already know about you.  So I think some better legislation  around disclaimers would be nice.  But I think ultimately a lot of people have a lot to learn  in terms of what companies already know about you.

Yeah, I think that's a great thing.  And I sort of wonder if that's just gonna happen.

Folks, if you are in the market for a new home,  unless you're one of the one-tenth of one percenters  who's gonna pay for this in cash,  you're probably gonna get a home loan, right?  Can I make a recommendation?  Do it from the best lender in the country.  Number one in customer satisfaction,  for eight years running, it's Quicken Loans,  and especially because they've made a loan product  that is designed for us, the geeks.  It's called Rocket Mortgage.  And what I didn't know, and I learned,  it's kind of interesting, is that  originally, Quicken Loans was called,  I think, Rock Financial.  When Dan Gilbert founded it in the 1990s,  he sold it to Quicken.  They renamed it Quicken Loans.  And then three years later, he said,  I'm buying this back, I wanna run this company.  But they kept the name.  But remember Rock Financial?  I think Rocket Mortgage is Dan Gilbert's way of saying,  we're back, baby.  I love it, I love the name.  It also is a pun because it lifts the burden  of the home loan.  It also brings you the home loan process  into the 21st century,  because you can do it all on your phone,  or your tablet, or your computer,  in a matter of minutes.  You don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to sit there while the bank,  I don't know what it is about loan officers.  And if you're a loan officer,  I'm sure you're a nice person.  But they kind of, they're chatty.  Maybe they don't get talked to a lot, I don't know.  It takes a long time.  They show you their fancy calculator,  and they do the, and they,  look, this is what your payment would be.  And then you're not even done.  And this happened to us.  We went, we didn't go to, I wish we had,  they didn't have Rocket Mortgage four years ago  when they sent our buyer house.  We went to the big bank.  The one lender bigger than Quicken Loans,  the one with the stagecoach and the buggy whips.  And they, so then you go home,  and they said, okay, we need some paperwork.  Okay, we got the pay stubs and the bank statements.  Every three or four days, they'd come back and say,  okay, now we need this.  Now we need that.  A month later, we're going on vacation.  We say, are you done?  No.  We're on vacation faxing stuff to the bank.  We had to get Lisa's sister Debbie to go to the file cabinet,  fax more stuff.  We almost left the house.  Fast forward, the 21st century Rocket Mortgage.  You could do the whole thing on your phone in minutes.  You don't have to go to the attic or anything  because you just go on the phone,  answer the questions you already know,  name, address, birth date.  I think you have to do social, of course.  And then they have trusted financial relationships,  trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.  So they pull all the information with your permission  that they need, crunch the numbers based on income, assets and credit.  They will offer you the loans for which you qualify,  right there in minutes.  And then you say, you choose the down payment,  you choose the term, you choose the rate,  you say, this is the loan for me.  And then three minutes later, you're approved.  That's it. It's done. You're done.  It's entirely online, entirely on your phone if you want.  Apply simply, understand fully and mortgage confidently  with Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  This is really a revolution.  And I'm not surprised.  Dan Gilbert's a smart guy.  They're revitalizing downtown Detroit, really cool company.  And they've got a great product.

I'm not sure I really understand this, but it looks like Apple is going to,  with the new tax bill, be required to repatriate its 200,  what is it, 30 billion dollar international piggy bank.  It'll cost it 38 billion in taxes, 15 percent.  But Apple's already saying all the fun things it's going to do,  contributing 350 billion dollars to the US economy over the next five years.  They gave bonuses to everybody,  twenty five hundred dollar bonuses to all 125,000 or will.

Which is essentially, if you don't know, it's they're just giving you the stock.  It's not the option to buy the stock.  It's just here's some stock. Well, that's a good thing.  Yeah.

Transcript:  So it's not another spaceship campus right next door or something like that.  No, no, no. Really good article  by Horace De Deew and as always, very astute on a Simcoe about the Apple  cash and how it all works.  And what I didn't really grok, by the way,  Apple has 268 billion, 895 million dollars in cash as of the end of September.  But really, that money belongs to I didn't realize this to the shareholders.  It's not considered apples to do whatever it wants with,  unless it invests it in something that will make more money down the road.

Start time: 5677.24
End time: 5682.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is interesting and kind of explains why Apple seems to sometimes be  struggling to figure out what to do with its money.

Start time: 5682.88
End time: 5717.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not typical for it's very unusual.  Horace says many most businesses keep very little cash in their books.  Apple's cash amounts to about 30 percent of its market capitalization.  Part of that is, weirdly enough, they've taken 100 billion dollars in loans.  And that's because they couldn't get the money in the US.  So they borrowed against the international money to buy back stock,  to pay dividends, to pay back shareholders.  So presumably those, I guess they'll pay those loans off.  Interesting. And then buy some stuff.

Transcript:  So we'll see or use it to invest in other products, although I think  it could go either way.  I mean, if we were being a little doomsday about about the HomePod,  but it seems like Apple's actually I mean, Apple is essentially a hardware  company, not a software company, unlike something like Google,  which is essentially a software company, not a hardware company or a data company.  And Apple, as these form factors get more and more  sort of flat, they seem to be running out of things to make.

Start time: 5764.42
End time: 5852.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got to spend it on something. It would be interesting.  They are not big on acquisitions.  And actually, I think this is actually prudent fiscal management.  But acquisitions we've seen. Look at AOL Time Warner and Compaq.  Who bought Compaq? IBM? No.  HP. That's right. Compaq HP.  These big acquisitions rarely pay out  because of the culture clash.  And Apple's got such a strong  culprit culture that they don't want to dilute.  They don't want to mess up.  It's hard to management managers.  People talked about them buying Disney, but Disney has more.  Disney has like one hundred forty thousand employees.  How do you mesh those companies without completely changing Apple?  That wouldn't be a good idea.  So Horace, this is such a good article.  I feel like I learned a lot.  He says Apple doesn't buy business models,  which is what often you buy, essentially, when you buy a company,  you buy their business model or you buy their customers or you buy their cash  flow. That's not Apple doesn't need any of that.  They've got a great business model.  They have an infinite number of customers and they certainly don't need cash flow,  obviously. So acquisition isn't probably the right thing either.  What they're going to end up doing is buying back shares.  Ultimately, that helps shareholders because it means that one share is worth more  and pay dividends to the degree they can.  Although he says something interesting, the tax code in this country discourages  companies from paying dividends. It's not a good tax move.

Start time: 5852.94

Start time: 5863.50
End time: 5896.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I think that they've maybe not given up.  But with the exception of Apple Music, they're they they are just,  in my opinion, not as good at services as many of their competitors.  And so they may turn to the things that they they do know.  They know media. They know how to make things attractive.  They know how to create a sort of a force field of appeal.  And you look at what they've done with Beats.  I think that Beats was way less about the hardware than it was about the music  relationships. So I think they're going to I think they'll continue to progress in  that.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's smart.  Because, you know, so they they last year said they were going to spend a billion  dollars on content. They hired two executives from Sony.  Right. And now what's interesting is they have made some really interesting  acquisitions. They've got we talked about this on Tuesday.  Carson, do you have the they hired or they're going to do a show with.  Drew Barrymore, right? Is that right?  I can't remember. You know, and I'll go back to the the Mac Break Weekly because  we had it all on the rundown for Mac Break Weekly.  But they have three or four really interesting shows.  There's a science fiction show they're going to do.  These all seem like premier kind of HBO quality, even better than Netflix, really,  or or Amazon quality stuff.  I'm very impressed with what they're doing.  My question is, though, what are they going to do with it?  It's not doesn't fit into Apple Music.  Are they going to start a new service?  Apple TV? Are they going to merge Apple Music into something like Apple Media?  What do they do with all this?

Start time: 5980.62
End time: 5999.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, sort of been wondering as well, if they're just going to sell it for a  premium on iTunes, which seems unlikely.  It's pretty difficult to create an audience for premium content by charging for a  front and not bundling it into a service like Netflix.  So it almost seems like they have to have some kind of a premium channel of content  offerings. Or maybe you get it for free if you buy an Apple TV.

Reese Witherspoon, that's who I was trying to remember.  And it's her production company.  It's her production company.  But she and Jennifer Aniston are going to be in it as well.  They had such a flop with Carpool Karaoke and that horrible planet of the apps.  Yeah, that was really bad.  But notice they're not promoting it at all.  I think they I think they they're regrouping.  I think they took a step backwards and said, whoops.

Transcript:  I don't know. I think it'll be really interesting to see what they do with iTunes  as a concept overall.  I mean, Tim, you brought that up.  Yeah. Will they sell content through iTunes?  Will they just expand Apple Music?  Will that just be I mean, when we start to see a little bit more overlap  between iOS and Mac OS, will that will that start to just kind of bubble up?  I had it. I can't.  I frankly cannot believe that iTunes still exists.  It's the way that it does right now.  And, you know, I have kind of a funny story and I can't name names  because frankly, I don't even remember them.  But many, many, many, many, many, many years ago,  I was on a call with a product manager from Apple who was  we were talking about something completely different.  And I just said, well, you know, when iTunes goes away,  because it's kind of a house.  And this person was like, I do not know what you were talking about.  It is a wonderful piece of software.

There's so many they could afford great programmers.  They could make something so much better.  Maybe that's what this will go to some brand new.  They've got the Apple TV.

I don't know if you know the Viking Saints game, and it was insane.  The last quarter, the lead shifted.  How many times I didn't see it because I was working with  like four or five times in the last quarter, last few minutes even.  And and in the very last play of the game,  the Vikings were down by one point, throw a long bomb, a missed tackle.  The guy runs in for a touchdown game over.  Apple Watches told fans you might be having heart issues in great numbers.  You know, they put that feature into the new Apple Watches,  where if your heart rate goes up and you're not moving,  they think maybe you're having a heart attack.  And apparently many people in the stadium tweeted  or Instagrammed this image.  Apple Watch thinks I'm having a heart attack. Oh, my gosh.  During the game.

And if they could tell the difference between that would be really wonderful.  Because for some people, you know, you're not actually aware.  You're like, oh, I'm actually OK.  And you're not.  Which is helpful to be able to have something that most people are wearing  their watch to monitor how they're doing and for safety.  So like, it's not great for telling time.  It's great for all kinds of other things.  But as a time device, it, you know, it falls a little bit short.

So I was like, you're right.  In a couple of years, we're not going to be able to.  But they use the breathe app.  My little kids, when they're getting too anxious and upset, I have them to sit  and use the breathe app and they sit there using the breathe app.  And they're so cute.

There is a killer app and it's different for everybody.  But once you find a killer app, I guess it's true of all technology.  Once you find that one app that you go, oh, I have to have this.  So I have an app called Drafts that lets me dictate, just dump mind stuff into it.  And so I don't have to remember if I tell you I'm going to do something,  I just go tell, you know, do that thing.  I said I would do.  And it all goes in there.  And at the end of the day, it's on my iPad and I can process it all.  And that single app, that plus the workout stuff I keep track of my  that's, you know, it's the only thing that really does a good heart job of heart rate,  except for a chest band.  It's really very accurate.  That's enough.  And then but and I'm sure that Apple planned this.  So then I had to start using my iPhone on my iPad.  So then I had to start using my iMac.

Start time: 6612.80
End time: 6624.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would be it?  Well, first of all, BMW charges you for anything.  A new cigarette lighter on your BMW is $5,000.  I mean, that's just BMW.  If you buy a BMW, do that.  But why?  What was their rationale for charging for carplay?

Start time: 6625.30
End time: 6682.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unclear if indeed there is any.  This actually turned into a bit of a big story because a BMW Canada representative told a  Canadian journalist that Apple was actually changing their rates and so therefore BMW was  simply following suit.  But this actually turned out to be untrue and BMW since retracted that statement.  But right now, if you want carplay in your BMW, you have to pay $300 for an additional  accessory, a one time fee.  And at that point, carplay is free as it should be.  Going forward, though, BMW, at least in the US, will give you one year free, but then it  will be $80 per year after that for carplay.  Apple or BMW says this will actually save a lot of people money.  What?  Because a lot of BMW people have short term leases, so therefore they only have the car  for two or three years and therefore they save money.  But still, it definitely rubbed me the wrong way and a lot of other people the wrong way, too,  that Apple or that BMW is effectively putting up a paywall around carplay, which is a free  service effectively to users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The technology implementation details are very similar across the two.  You're basically putting a thin client in there that then the phone kind of provides  the videos for.  So if you can do one, you can technically do the other.  But a lot of manufacturers don't like to bring Android Auto in the car because Google  actually asks for a lot of information about what you're doing, which gets us back to the  privacy discussion.  Google is asking for details about where you are, how fast you're going, how long you stay  there, that kind of thing.  Apple doesn't really ask that much in exchange.  And so auto manufacturers have been more happy to work with with Apple.  But there is a licensing fee involved about the MFI program made for iPhone or made for  iPod back in the day.  But that's a one time fee.  So there is no recurring fee.  And I spoke with a lot of different folks in a lot of different places to kind of trace  this down and try to find out why BMW would make this change.  And as far as I can tell, there's no plan or there's no change in fee going on.  It's just BMW moving to a services based payment, which I'm sorry to say we're going to  see a lot of in the automotive industry going forward.  A lot of companies are going to try to find ways to make recurring revenue off of people  rather than just that upfront payment that we've had thus far.

Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also cases of ex-husbands or abusive people  or people that have that have gone through trauma that are being tracked or stopped.  I understand.  But sometimes, you know, so there's there is some reasons why I think  the right to be able to be forgotten is something.  We have to take a look in.  Then you shouldn't use this app.  That's not a fair assessment, though.  That's not a fair thing.  Companies should not be given free rein with what they do with our information.  And we need right now, it's the Wild West. It's great.  There's definitely some need for legislation to be able to say  what they're doing and why, and that should be clearly stated. OK.

Start time: 6971.60
End time: 6980.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the only alternative, though, is that Google charges us for this app  and nobody would pay for this, which would mean we wouldn't have the app  in the first place. So you don't need to be a balance.

Meanwhile, the government does not restrict in any way.  It's right to take pictures of your face, match them up in a database  that's corrupt and and poorly run and produces all sorts of false positives.  There's no limit on that.

Start time: 7126.28
End time: 7135.30

Transcript:  We all will be back.  One more segment to come before we go, though, I want to tell you about Tracker  because you the last thing you want to do, you've got a busy life.  You got lots to do.  You got places to go, people to see.  The last thing you want to do is spend the next hour looking for your keys  so you can go.  But how many of us do that all the time?  It's like stop the insanity.  There is a better way.  If there's stuff you know you have, but you cannot find, you need Tracker.  Tracker goes on your keys.  It goes in your purse.  It goes in your suitcase.  It goes on your bicycle.  Goes in your headphones.  Goes on your remote control.  Anything that you misplace.  And by the way, the new Tracker Pixel,  the lightest Tracker ever, it's so small, about the size of a dime,  weighs absolutely nothing.  And that means you can put it on anything.  It pairs to your phone.  It's a Bluetooth tracking device, not GPS.  I should be clear about this.  It's a Bluetooth tracking device.  So you pair it to your phone.  Your phone has GPS.  If you there are a number of ways it helps you find stuff.  First of all, the two way separation alerts.  If you leave your Tracker, let's say my Tracker's on my keys, which it is.  When I leave my keys behind, the phone makes noises.  Say, hey, you left your keys.  And I go, oh, shoot, I left my keys.  Same thing the other way around.  Leave my phone behind.  Keys make noise.  If you can't find your keys, you open up the Tracker app on your phone,  you press the button and the keys make a very loud noise.  And with the Pixel, they have lights, so they light up.  And if it's falling down the couch or whatever, it's easier to find under the bed.  Really easy to find.  I put these, by the way, on my AirPods because I actually bought a second  pair of AirPods because I could I thought I lost them and they were under the bed  the whole time if I had the so now I have trackers on my case.  So not that. Yeah, not on the.

Start time: 7663.64
End time: 7669.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the actual. It looks like they'd probably then be like earrings.  Yeah. No, not on. Yeah.  Although, wait a minute.

Start time: 7669.22
End time: 7823.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a stylish look. I think I might do that.  It could be. It could be fashionable.  I didn't even think about that. Yeah.  Dangles. You also have a button on the Tracker.  So if you if you can't find your phone and that happens all the time, right.  It's not like it's not in this case, it's not like you left it somewhere far away.  It's some it's on the kitchen counter and you just forgot where you put it.  You press the button on the Tracker, the phone, even if it's silence, go, yeah,  I'm here. It's not worth firing firing up by my iPhone.  You just press the button. It's there. You got it.  Simplifies your life.  Now, the larger issue is if you do, you know, your keys fall out of your pocket  and you lose them and then somebody picks them up and takes them somewhere.  Now you open up the phone, the tracker shows the last because Bluetooth  is only good for 150 feet.  So it shows you the last place it saw them.  You go there. They're not there.  This is where Tracker really sings.  It's there. It's the world's largest crowd locate network.  See, there's five million trackers out there.  So that means there's millions of tracker users.  And there it's like they're on your team whenever.  And they don't have to do anything. You don't have to do anything.  You're always participating in this.  Whenever you walk by somebody's keys, your phone says because it's Bluetooth,  Ellie, I see keys or I see a tracker device.  Actually, I see a tracker device.  It's a so, you know, what's the serial number? OK.  And then it pings your phone and says your keys, your tracker was just seen.  Your keys are here. That is fantastic.  And it works really, really well.  In fact, if you've got a tracker, you can test it.  It's not on by default.  It's only when you lose something, you turn on the notifications.  But turn it on now.  And every time you walk by your keys, you get a notification.  There's your keys. There's your keys.  It really works.  Tracker is one of the few Bluetooth trackers that has a replaceable battery.  Even on the tiny tracker pixel, that's huge.  That means you don't have to throw it out when it wears out.  You can keep it going for a long, long time.  They're very affordable.  They even have a 30 day money back guarantee.  And we've got an even better deal.  If you go to the tracker dot com slash twit,  you'll save 20 percent on any order.  On any order.  So go load up on trackers, get the tracker Bravo.  That's the aluminized anodized, aluminized aluminum.  You can get that monogrammed.  You can even print a picture on it or get the tracker pixel.  The new one, there's lots of accessories, lanyards and pitons and things.  T H E T R A C K R the tracker dot com slash twit.  20 percent off.  Boom. Just like that.  The tracker dot com slash twit.  I've used I've used that code because I'm always buying more trackers  because I'm always losing more stuff.  Think of things all the time to put a tracker on.  Thank you, tracker, for your support of this week in tech.  And thank you for a great panel.  I get we still have so many stories. I don't.

Start time: 7844.20
End time: 7856.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's to discourage people from doing the monthly.  Oh, yeah.  Because I think what people do is sign up for it, buy a bunch of stuff  and then dump it. Of course.  And they want you to sign up for the recurring.  And I think that's you're absolutely right.

Start time: 7857.14
End time: 7880.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, more and more when I buy stuff, I buy a year  because I don't like all those little charges every month.  Sure. It's like they always give you a break.  Yeah, I figure I'm going to use this.  Often I don't.  That's a good way to get my money, I guess.  Amazon has narrowed its HQ search down to 20 cities,  19 in the US and Toronto.

Transcript:  Yeah, I just figured I'd build a higher house.  Or you buy inland a little bit and becomes waterfront property down the road.  Sure. Is that crazy?  You just have to figure out how much ice is going to melt.  YouTube has changed its policy for monetization.  You now have to have 4000 views a month and 1000 subscribers.  I don't. I guess that's OK.  It sounds like, though, this is going to hurt a lot of new, young and up and coming  people aren't going to be able to monetize.

Start time: 7954.06
End time: 7959.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the logic, if I understood it correctly, was really weird to me.  It was like, this is how we're going to keep hate speech off.

Start time: 7960.00
End time: 7961.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that I didn't understand at all.

Start time: 7961.60
End time: 7974.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was sort of I guess the implication was that people who use YouTube  for hate related discourse are very popular.  And they just don't they don't do very well.  But how much money can you make? I don't really get it.

Start time: 7974.44
End time: 7982.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you only have 1000 subscribers or less and you have  and you have few views, you're not making any money anyway.  What is the deal? OK, I'm not.

Start time: 7982.64
End time: 7987.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure. And it does seem like it is going to do anything.  It seems like a very blunt force way to do. Oh, sorry.

Transcript:  I don't. I don't get it.  You know what? At this point, they want to they need a PR win.  So just going to throw stuff at the wall.  Bigger stuff going on at Facebook.  And this probably we could have spent a long time discussing.  We don't need to get into it.  But as you know, they they said they're going to deemphasize brands.  They're going to reemphasize friends.  And their newest thing is they're going to let you let the users decide  what's they're basically going to do. Yelp for news.  They're going to let the users decide what's high quality news.

Start time: 8026.62
End time: 8036.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. So this is so strange to me.  It's like to fight fake news.  We're going to let everybody the people who think is the people

Start time: 8036.40

Start time: 8040.73
End time: 8074.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can now decide.  So it was like they basically Zuck basically said  we thought about policing it ourselves, but we thought that that was obviously  problematic. So then we thought to going to a panel of experts, but that seems bias.  So instead, we're going to you and we're letting the general public decide  what is a trustworthy news source.  And the thing that's so upsetting about this to me is that obviously politicians  on both sides have an incentive to discredit press.  Right. And they'll just continue that gives them even more of an incentive  to discredit press so that their constituents will then essentially downvote

Start time: 8075.14
End time: 8084.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the press. They don't like good article on BuzzFeed saying crowd sourced ratings  work for toasters, but not news.  And they have the data to back it up.

Start time: 8084.60
End time: 8091.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 8092.04
End time: 8134.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at Yelp. I mean, it's almost impossible.  So the authors of this, Alan Dennis from BuzzFeed and Tino Kim and Tricia  Moravec, apparently they say that there's a research paper they did entitled  Bind the Stars, the effects of news source ratings on fake news and social media  deals exactly with this particular technique.  Research shows users don't trust other users.  So they studied 590 Facebook users in the United States and they believe that  expert ratings would be more credible than user ratings because experts are  more likely to be objective and check the facts.  Of course they are. Anyway, user ratings easily manipulated.

Start time: 8177.38
End time: 8215.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. What's the intent?  And now I can't.  Purpose.  I think that a lot of what happened with that with the actual fake news,  the sort of Russia based propaganda news,  was that it was actually used to inflame people who found it,  found the news upsetting.  So not so much like a look what this person is doing in politics.  Don't vote for them.  It was really more like  putting into people's feeds.  So if you're extremely liberal, putting something  inflammatory, conservative in your feed so that you get even more upset  and polarized. Right.  So people may have been manipulated in ways that they didn't quite understand.
