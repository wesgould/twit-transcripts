Transcript:  High society.  That's one high society, as we say in the poker biz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ten thousand, well, you know, a large would be a thousand and a high society is ten.  So right now I'm behind three high societies.  No, I'm not.  Don't worry.  My wife is listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's going, watch, we've got a child on the way.  You can't be gambling anymore, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy.  But yeah, it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great.  So we're going to do the ad for phone tag.com.  And the truth is they donated the money to benefit Charity Water and they said, you know,  we really want you to do a PSA for Charity Water.  So we'll do that too.  Which is like double mensch.  Double mensch.  Double mensch.  You spend the money and you get the PSA.  That's very nice of you.  Also here, and really I didn't plan it this way and frankly I have no way to get out of  it at this point.  Lauren Feldman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.  Who just kind of came along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just here chaperoning Mr. Calacanis.  I didn't mean to bum rush on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, you know, I'm thrilled to have you on.  As soon as I saw you I said, Lauren, you got to be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lauren is with 1938 Media.  He's actually a brilliant manipulator of the interwebs and a comic.  And we used to do a lot of stuff with him on the Gilmore Gang.  So I'm glad to have you on the show.  This is your first time on Twitter?  Yes, sir.  A guy who needs no introduction from GDGT is also here.  Ryan Block.  Good to have you, Ryan.  Hello.  Hello.  I bet you're sad you're not in the studio right now.  You're missing all the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am.  Well, it was like two, three weeks ago I was actually in studio, but you were gone.  Right.  And Tom was hosting.  Right.  So I'm going to make it up there at one point when you're there.  Maybe while Jason's there.  I don't know.  Jason's never really up.  Well, I am very proud.  Don't you have like a conference to be doing or something tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I got people who do that.  Now it's a system.  So I have lots and lots of people.  You know how it is with Engadget, you know, back in the day, like you guys who do all  the hard work, I take the credit.  Isn't that the way it works?  People come up to me and they go, oh my God, I can't tell you how much I love Engadget  and Subreddit.  And I'd say, thank you.  I did that.  I did that.  No, I would always say, you know, I basically do about 1% of the work, which is signing  the checks and dealing with all the lawsuits.  And then Peter and Ryan do all the other 99%, which is making a kick ass product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, last time you were here, Peter was on with us.  So now we get the other half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GT is killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So TechCrunch 50 is tomorrow.  This is this is tell me about the I mean, plug time.  Tell me what TechCrunch 50 is.  Very simply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three years ago, Mike Arrington, screw you, Mike Arrington, by the way.  Yeah, I like that sticker on your laptop.  That's very attractive.  This is going to be a special.  Remember kids, Uncle Leo says, screw you, Mike Arrington.  It doesn't say Mike, but you know, you could add the name of your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's for the name of your choice.  I'm going to autograph that and give it to Mike.  No hard feelings.  I'll bring it down for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically three years ago, Mike and I were having dinner.  I was telling him about the conference businesses I used to run in the Silicon Eye reporter  days.  He said, you should do a conference.  He said, what kind of conference should we do?  I said, you know, the demo conference that charges people $20,000 to for six minutes  on stage.  Why don't you let 20 people pitch their new idea for a startup?  Because I'm a startup guy, you know, and worked my way up in the industry.  I've got a lot of love for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship and startups.  Let them pitch, but don't charge them and get all the best VCs in the world.  Get the angel investors, get the press in the room.  We could do that.  We know all these people and we'll give them a great start to launching their company.  And he said, yeah, we have to have a prize.  I said, well, that's a great idea.  What if we put up like $10,000?  That's not enough.  Like I said, we can put up 25 and he said, we've got to put up 50.  And as Mike is prone to do, you know, he comes up with an idea and then it's on TechCrunch.  So basically it's like we're doing this conference, $50,000 top prize.  I'm like, okay, I guess I'm doing a conference.  But you know, this is year three, over 700 people apply, 50 amazing companies are going  to launch over the next two days.  And it's all for free.  And whoever wins gets $50,000.  How do you make money on this thing?  Well, you know, we went to the top companies in the ecosystem, which would be Google, Sequoia  Capital Founders Fund, Charles River Ventures, all these incredible big companies, AOL,  etc. Microsoft, Bing, bought two sponsorships and we charge them for a sponsorship.  You know, and a top level sponsorship is $35,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now the people who come to the conference, because I know Ray is here, you also pay to  attend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So when the conference first is announced, it's $1,000.  Then it goes to $2,000.  And then it goes to $3,000.  So if you wait, which is all the VCs, do you pay three?  And then we give away, you know, 150 student tickets.  We have 150 volunteers from Berkeley and all the local schools.  Sounds cool.  Sounds like fun.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a lot of fun.  You really, I mean, obviously love startups.  You've done several of your own.  You have a show this week in startups.  Yeah.  I mean, I just do it.  It's got to be like crack for somebody who's, for an entrepreneur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're press, there's nothing better than it because we basically go through 700 companies  to get down to about 150 really good ones.  And we put 50 good ones on stage.  And then the other 100 go into what we call the demo pit.  They basically give them a table at the event to show their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think phone tags in the demo pit.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, the demo pit is a great spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you been in the demo pit?  I have.  I come as a guest of Mr. Calacanis for the last couple of years.  And what do you do in the demo pit?  I just go and I goof with people and I make videos, make videos, make videos for the guys  there and it's really a great spot.  I mean, a lot of action happens in that demo pit.  I just love the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The idea that everyone's in the pit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's basically our way of sticking it to the other competitor in the space who charges  people, which I just found as an entrepreneur, it just rubbed me the wrong way.  I just felt it was abusive.  You mentioned...  You like you charging people to be on, you know, you like some product, you're like,  oh, they were first, right?  They were first.  I mean, they've been around for I think 20 years.  They started the whole idea.  Yeah.  What happened was it started really with Stuart Alsop, who wasn't charging.  And then it was like, well, you have to buy one ticket.  You have to buy two tickets.  You have to buy two tickets in a booth and it went from one to six to 12 to 18,500.  You got to buy a couple of extra tickets.  So basically you're spending 30, 40 grand to launch your company, which is fine if you  raised a seed round of capital, but the GDGT guys or, you know, Twitter or dig when, you  know, when Kevin Rose started to dig, he's not going to pay that money.  So the good news is we get the hot startups because they wouldn't go to, they wouldn't  waste the money on it.  You know, only like a venture backed, dopey startup would go below that kind of money.  I mean, basically what it comes down to is if you have, if you're quality, you come to  our show.  You don't have any money?  If you're quality, you come to our show because even some of them have the money.  And then if you're not quality and you have to buy you're on stage, you go to the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one.  Also, you know, at that stage with the startup, you know, it'd be a lot better for them to  take that 20, 30 G's and put it into their product rather than marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course.  I mean, I, I don't have to do this conference.  It's frankly a lot of work.  I spent the last like two weeks, three days each week in rehearsals with the startup companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You rehearse with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I spend 10, 12 hours a day for six days.  I mean, I did it all day.  Cause you want their, you want their presentation to be good.  Yeah.  I mean, it's in both of our interests.  I want to put on a good show, but most of all, I want them to have a good start.  So it's amazing how much the people who, you know, start a company, how poorly they can  represent themselves.  They, they don't, we have a very simple rule.  Show don't tell.  We try to get them to actually show their product.  Right.  And every one of them wants to do something other than that.  Like they want to play a movie clip.  They want to talk about the industry.  They want to put up a chart.  They have three circles, anything, you know, their bios, their investors, competitive metrics.  They come with this and I just rip it apart and I tape them this year.  And there are moments in it which are American Idol-esque.  Like I'm ripping them apart.  And I said, listen, I'm going to rip you apart in here.  I'm going to savage you.  So when you get in front of Mark and Treason or Sequoia Capital or Charles River, the people  with my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are people actually able to raise money here?  Oh yeah.  Oh, the, the 90 companies-  So the VCs believe that this is a good model for them to find people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I've hosted the rehearsals at Sequoia Capital, the number one venture capital firm in the  world.  And Sequoia Partners came in and watched probably half of them.  And I personally introduced my maybe 10 favorites to different partners at Sequoia.  And I personally, anybody who I put on that stage of 50, I tell them-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there still money out there?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, the VCs are independent of the whole financial crisis.  They've raised a bunch of money from-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, they need to do something with the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  They don't put it to work or else basically they don't get it.  And they don't get their, what's called a management fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, management fees, yeah.  They get a little management fee there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they are intended to do it.  So I personally tell anybody who's in their 50 and anybody who's an alumni, I'll make  any introduction at any time to anybody I know.  This is my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my way of giving back.  You've had some success stories, lots of success stories with the money, right?  Yeah, PowerSight.  Who got a bunch of money?  PowerSight got bought by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Mint did really well.  I finally started using Mint.  I was so afraid of Mint for a long time.  It's a little scary.  But boy, it's great once you get all your stuff in there after a while.  It's kind of cool.  I mean, I get alerts and your wife just spent $1,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just worried.  So many people hate me.  I just don't want to put like, what happens if the guy at Mint just doesn't like me?  I don't think the guy at Mint-  Goes into my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the guy you have to worry about.  He owns stock.  He's not going to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know, but I get nervous just like putting that kind of stuff out there.  So you haven't done that?  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see the iPhone app that shows your net worth?  Yeah, no, no, no.  That's awesome.  You can take that out to a party.  It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The ladies love it.  Oh, the ladies love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excuse me.  Can I show you my net worth on my iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Ryan, please, by the way, I know Ryan, you're kind of out in left field because you're  over Skype.  So please just jump in at any time if you have anything to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I'm enjoying listening to hear Jason pitch his conference.  Zing, pow!  So wait, wait, wait.  So Jason, though, obviously a lot of company is going on there.  What's the selection process?  How do I get in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great question.  It's an open process where anybody can apply.  And there's a website and we take applications up until the end of June.  We'll do that again this June.  And you have to make a video where you talk into the video and do like a webcast, maybe  screencast your product.  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it disadvantage people who aren't very good at presenting their ideas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because we don't grade it on presentation skills during that phase.  And basically I take it upon myself in the rehearsals to get them through that part.  We have people who have English as a second language and all kinds of other challenges  with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's exciting about this is there are still good ideas out there.  There are people doing really creative, interesting stuff.  And it's kind of great to give them a chance to expose that to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's funny though is you talk about how all these startups are, they really want  to just give a deck.  They want to talk about financials.  They want to talk about business plan.  The funny thing is that's what they've been trained to do.  That's what every VC firm wants.  They want your deck before they want your demo.  So you have to kind of untrain that.  You have to kind of teach them that, okay, the time for that is now over.  Now you've got to be product.  You've got to show your product.  You've got to be all your product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, with GDGT, I never looked at your business plan.  I didn't care about it.  We don't have a business plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If we did, I would be worried.  Do you have investors in GDGT, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Calacanis, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's easier to call a gadget.  Jason is actually, full disclosure, one of our investors.  We have a number of others.  Not including me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, I invested time into the site.  I have entered in 20 gadgets.  So that's actually a considerable amount of work, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool with that.  I mean, I like the site.  I love the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me tell them the idea.  Here's the check.  Let me know who to make it out to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been public for a month or so, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We launched it July 1.  Actually, I would have liked to have launched a TechCrunch 50, but we just had a whole bunch  of other stuff.  I begged them to.  Yeah, I know.  It would have been really fun.  I would have really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  We had a sponsor, so you have to take the cash.  I think we had a...  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What kind of thing wins at something like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the first year was Mint, and it was pretty clear Mint had a very big vision.  That was going to be a very successful business.  That's where...  There's two votes for the $50,000, because 25 comes from me and 25 comes from Mike.  We both agreed Mint hands down, the first one, and I think we were very right about  that.  They have a $200 million valuation right now and a very good service.  Second year, we really liked a thing called Good Guide, which was creating a guidebook,  a Wikipedia, if you will, or a directory of how good products are in terms of, you know,  do they cause cancer, do they have carcinogens in them, etc.  That's something I'd like to know.  It's a cancer guide.  But we thought Yammer, the business-to-business version of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I remember Yammer one.  That was a little controversial.  This was Twitter for enterprise.  I think it's a little boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little boring and derivative, but they're pretty much killing it.  Are they doing well?  They're doing very well.  And they have a lot of paid customers.  There you go.  Okay.  We picked what we think would be the most successful business, and I guess that's controversial,  because people wanted Tonechi Dot, which was doing augmented reality like the Yelp phone...  Oh, I love that.  ...a year ago before everybody else.  I thought that was really cool.  I wanted to give it to them, but I just thought...  It's too early.  I don't think this will ever become a product, and it hasn't.  It hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I love the monocle on Yelp.  It's very fun.  It's a very cool thing.  Have you played with that, Ryan?  What am I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's all still a little bit early, but people are really, really excited about  that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congratulations to our friend Felicia Day.  Emmy Award.  What?  Emmy Award.  Daytime Emmy for Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog.  Isn't that great?  Isn't that awesome?  Daytime Emmy or Internet Special Web Emmy?  Daytime Emmy.  No.  I think they combined them.  It was an outstanding special class short format live action entertainment programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Golf clap for that.  Yeah.  Is that the first Emmy for an online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the first Emmy for something that never appeared on TV.  Thank you, Lord.  Which makes you wonder what the hell is an Emmy for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you something.  There's nothing on local television that's...  Oh, it's brilliant.  ...the tech coverage that's more interesting than This Week in Tech.  Where's This Week in Tech's Emmy?  I don't want an Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got an Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If you get an Emmy, you could hold the door open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's my Emmy?  Did you steal my Emmy, Laurel?  You have a daytime Emmy?  Believe me, I would if I saw it, but I haven't seen it.  Do you really have an Emmy?  I have an Emmy somewhere back there.  I believe that.  It's sort of a joke about Emmys.  I see the golden lady with the sharp wings.  Oh yeah, I see it.  There's your Emmy.  Yeah.  A lot of good that did me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like my friendship with Jason.  Same thing.  You read me my friendship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the same thing.  Anyway, congratulations to it.  Yeah, no, that's great.  Joss Whedon.  I mean, it helps to have Joss Whedon producing and directing.  You can't get much better than that.  Nope.  Doogie Howser in the lead role.  Real talent.  Real talent.  Great actor.  You know what?  He was really good in Dr. Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw him in All My Sons, Arthur Miller.  Yeah.  He's a good actor.  He's in the 150 seat theater in Westwood.  No, he's the real deal.  Very powerful.  Real deal.  He's legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People, you know, I think because celebrity is so confounded with talent that we kind  of lose sight of the fact that there really is, in fact, a talent called acting.  And some people can do it and a lot of people who are famous cannot.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And when you see a great actor, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I go crazy about that all the time, you know?  I mean, just because the technology is here doesn't mean that somebody can be a Leo Laporte  or a Lauren Feldman.  That's a good point.  I mean, I studied.  I went to, you know, I'm in SAG.  I went to Estella Radler.  I've been on stage a hundred thousand times.  I've bombed.  I'm not bombed.  Yeah, so you know about acting.  Yeah, absolutely.  And that's why we'd always go crazy, you know, when these quote unquote amateurs, you know,  would just come in and turn on a camera would really kind of piss me off, to be honest.  Yeah.  You know, that's why I was so excited to meet you the first time.  And yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet YouTube does give people a chance to have a voice.  I mean, there's a lot to be said for that democratizing.  And if somebody has some talent.  Yeah.  But do you think you have to study or can you have the talent and just get better by  doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I think that.  Excuse me.  Do you have to go to Stella and say no, no.  I mean, I was a salesman my whole life.  That's what I did right out of high school, which is acting, which is exactly.  Yeah, you're right.  Point is that I did.  You're an actor, Jason.  You're an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I do what I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to take it seriously, though.  Yeah, you know, you have to.  It's craft.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a friend who is a Hollywood director.  He's working on right now is working on the Twilight Zone.  And he's a little upset about YouTube.  He says, I study Scottish guys.  It was a great Scottish accent.  I studied for 20 years and learned my craft and I was a focus puller or whatever it was,  worked my way up.  How can somebody with a camera and YouTube accomplish the same thing without that 20  years of studying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't take it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It drives people like him crazy.  But that's also 18 million people watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell is going on?  I have my phone bill.  Nobody watches it.  I played Hamlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not going to watch you anyway.  It doesn't matter.  Well, it helps to be a beautiful woman.  Yeah.  I mean, Lisa Nova.  I don't know if you know Lisa.  Lisa is a friend of mine.  I'm actually I know her boyfriend from a million years ago.  We were in the film business together.  That's like a perfect example because Lisa blew it out, has millions of viewers, was  on Mad TV, quit Mad TV.  She actually made it and quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She went back to the internet.  Yeah.  Because she just.  That's where the future is though.  Or she didn't like the culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think she liked the culture.  I mean, listen, if I ever got off the internet, I'd never come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I often say to new media types, don't think of this as the path to.  True success getting on CNN or getting in a movie.  Think of this as the path.  This is the future.  You don't believe that you think mainstream is the path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still do for now, at least.  I mean, listen, I'm there's more money in it.  There's more money.  I mean, I love what I do.  It's great.  I don't have to answer to a director or writers.  I can make my crazy, silly videos and all of that.  But if you really want to make money and really have juice, I still think it's mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the problem is, though, you could never create a show like this.  We can tag if you had to deal with those corporate people.  I tried.  I tried for years.  I mean, just too much interference and, you know.  Yeah, no, absolutely.  They're idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the real problem.  They don't like technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it would be impossible.  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's a mission both.  Leo's got his other show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw the mainstream show, but I don't know if I need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet you get more listeners on this than there.  Actually, no, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, to be honest, the radio show is probably two million people a week.  Oh, is it really?  Well, it's in 70 markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just still crushes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The thing is, there's still a scarcity in, quote unquote, old school media.  It's harder to break into.  At the end of the day, it's always going to have that appeal as being kind of the endgame  for a lot of people.  I don't necessarily think that.  I mean, I'm perfectly happy to do a show about gadgets that only 50 or 70,000 people or whoever  many listen to.  But for a lot of people, I think there's still something about going on TV, going on radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me testify here.  There's more money in doing what I'm doing now than there is on the radio.  There may be not a bigger audience, but it's a more involved, engaged, interesting audience  on the internet side of it.  I prefer the audience that we get on the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it depends also what point you are in your career.  I mean, when you're a younger actor, making TV or movies is like making it.  I gave up traditional Hollywood many years ago and never looked back.  So I'm very happy where I'm at now.  But listen, if I got a TV pilot, I take it and I'd be stoked about it.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a big part of Tabasso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the guy at Newsweek who did the interview on this asked the SIAA, why Klingons?  And he said, oh, I don't know.  He said, why not vampires?  You know, they're kind of hot right now.  Well, we've got to deal with Paramount.  Trying to reach people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're actually going to.  People search on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now, do you think this is effective?  No.  I cannot believe that this is maybe.  There's no talent involved.  No talent, a ton of money.  Now, this, I kind of like this.  They say instead of stealing.  Get a job doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get a job doing that.  Get a job doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of like that.  Tears came to my eyes here.  Or something.  Now, wait a minute.  Doom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week.  No, no, no, no, no.  Really.  It came out.  This didn't come out in 96?  This is brand new.  No way.  This is brand new.  Hold on a second.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It gets even better.  Now they have an actual felon.  My name is Jeremiah Mondello and I want you to know that pirating software is no joke.  I'm serving four years for selling pirated software on the web and now for the rest of  my life I'll be labeled a felon and an ex-con.  Don't make the same mistakes I did.  It's not just a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe this is aimed at 14 year olds or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that if they just played that last piece it would be quite effective.  Actually, somebody in jail would be a very effective PSA.  That piece is effective but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that you have to, what would have been effective is saying, you know, just being  honest.  We're supposed to be in this age of transparency and honesty.  I think the good approach would have been like, you know, why are you screwing artists?  Like you love music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the part in the middle that I kind of dug where it said, make your own stuff.  Exactly.  You know, make your own stuff.  Don't steal somebody else's stuff.  I'm not testing.  Pick up an instrument.  You're trying to do it.  You know?  Go ahead, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Creating content has nothing to do with stealing content.  You know, and it's just such a diversion.  You know, go make your own stuff.  Well, great.  I'm not going to be a consumer of content.  And no one makes it anyway.  And look, the fact is people who are making stuff now are going to be giving it away because  it's the expectation this generation and all future generations will be giving their  content away with the expectation that the content itself should be free and that you'll  make money in other ways.  You're a believer in that.  That's so wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God, is that wrong.  You're a believer in free.  Chris Anderson's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not necessarily saying one way is right or wrong, but that is the expectation now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know that's...  No, you're absolutely correct.  That's the expectation now and that'll be the death of art in this country.  Will it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if we can make money in other ways...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other ways?  Yeah, well that's the question.  I always hear the famous other ways.  What are these other ways?  What am I going to do?  Advertising?  Start a signature puppet line?  Yeah, there you go.  That's actually a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It drives people away.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I would actually order a puppet.  Can I get a puppet?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I get my own Dave Gunner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I could make my own Jason Puppet videos.  Exactly.  That would be unbelievable.  I want a Ryan Block and Veronica video.  But your Jason Puppet videos are going to suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't want you to make Jason Puppet videos that suck.  Is it any more than you want me to make a horrible gadget website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want the Veronica and the Ryan Puppet.  Have you seen these?  Ryan, can we go to dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm trying to level up over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a Leo Laporte crocheted figure.  It comes on the ball.  You get the headphones and the microphone.  What do you think, Jason?  You think I can make some money on that?  Screw you, Mike Harrington.  You can pull a little string in the back that says, screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm taking my ball, which I'm sitting on, and I'm leaving.  Bye bye, Mike Harrington.  Mike doesn't hate me, does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, no more than he hates me or anybody else.  Or anybody else.  Which is basically everybody.

Transcript:  I'm just in the group.  Happy Programmers Day.  Today is Russia's new official holiday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Russian programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Programmers Day.  256th day of year.  Get it?  256th day of year.  Like kilobits.  Like kilobits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like kilobits in the computer.  Yes.  I'm going to get my programmer some vodka and new keyboard.  The translation.  It's a good gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because we're making really bad stereotype jokes, I mean, what's up with Russian Programmer  Day?  The most programming that comes out of Russia are worms, viruses.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the code is clean.  Don't copy that floppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't hate.  I'm really impressed with your Russian accent.  It's bad to you.  It's really unbelievable here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so terrible at accents.  We've spent many years in military.  Military.  You study with Stella Adler.  Mandatory service in my country.  That's where we make the worms and viruses.  On the USSR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, I got one for Ryan.  I lost my Kindle on an airplane.  I didn't lose it.  I mean, I left it there.  It was stupid of me.  I'm getting off the plane.  I'm tired.  It's been a long flight.  I leave the Kindle.  Now, before I get out of the airport, I go back to the desk.  I said I left my Kindle.  It's in business class.  I left my Kindle.  They said it's gone.  Somebody means gone.  Somebody probably snagged it.  The pilot.  The pilot.  You know, they see a Kindle there.  Totally feasible.  So I immediately deactivated it, but it comes to me.  Wait a minute.  That's got a serial number.  That's serialized.  Amazon knows exactly who's got my Kindle.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoever bought a new book with the credit card.  Who's going to buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So article in New York Times this week says, don't bother asking Amazon.  They won't help you without a subpoena.  And I don't think I'm going to get a subpoena from the San Francisco Police Department to  get my Kindle back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To get one of those mobile me things set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So something that has to change.  This is not just true of Kindles.  This is true of all consumer electronics.  All consumer electronics tend to have serial numbers of some kind, something identifiable.  You take them in for repair.  There's no alert list.  There's no, this is stolen equipment list that the industry uses.  There's nothing like that.  I mean, you know, if you, if you.  Is that new mobile me service where you can track down your lost.  Yeah.  But that's actually creating a different set of problems.  That's creating a set of problems of people who are actually attempting to find robbers  and thieves.  I mean, those are not really people you want to mess around with.  And that's slightly dangerous.  It's also, it would have to be.  If you're Jason and you know Tae Kwon Do, then you're going to be all right.  But if you're me and you don't, then that's not the kind of person who I want to go running  down on the street trying to get my phone back.  You remember that blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a great blog post about the guy who lost his iPhone and he tracks him down.  It goes to the ghetto practically.  Yeah.  And he's sending messages out.  And I talked to a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they're important part of these stories too.  Yeah.  A friend of mine did the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was texting.  She had somebody text the person.  And she's, I don't know how this ended.  I have to find out.  She went to a handoff.  She said, I'll give you a hundred bucks for my phone.  And she said, they said I'd meet up.  I wouldn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it really like Amazon's responsibility?  Well, that's the question.  Is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What they should do is brick it.  They should brick it.  They should brick it.  This way there's no market for these devices.  So if you steal it, it should be brick.  That's kind of what happens to a cell phone, right?  And if you return it to any store, you get a $25 gift card.  So if you return an iPhone to a store, Apple pays on behalf of the consumer a $25 gift  card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean if you find one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It found, stolen.  We don't ask any questions.  You bring an iPhone to our desk, we'll give you a $10 gift card.  No questions asked.  Then we look at the serial number.  We offer to the person.  That person pays five of the $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Canada, Sirius Satellite Radio will deactivate a radio.  If you send them a statement, signed statement saying it was stolen, they'll say, okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll brick it.  Bottom line is all of these devices are now both connected and oftentimes registered with  the company who makes them.  The fact that you can count on connectivity for almost every device that you buy now,  even a digital camera now often has Wi-Fi.  Not always, but often.  So it's to the point now where you could actually set up a system that phones home, a system  that deactivates devices, something that helps you find your lost gadget, or at very least  turns it off and gives a thief an incentive to turn it back in.  I don't know how long it's going to take the industry to kind of wake up to this concept  that consumers lose devices or devices get stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like something he should have a section on gadgets for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  That'd be good, Lawson.  How about somebody make an iPhone application like iShokU and if you don't put a password,  if you put the wrong password in the fourth time, it actually shocks you.  Can we call it iScrewYou?  Or it explodes like the blue ink, like there's a pack of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a great idea, but I don't see the manufacturers doing it.  I see a gadget type site or somebody like that stepping up.  I can see their liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want to be responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the phone calls, just thousands and thousands.  It's the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It irks me that I know Amazon could tell me exactly who's got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, this way it should work is you have your account, you should be able to log in,  turn your device off, and put a message on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what I did, of course, immediately is deregister it, but the device still works  and anybody who wants to register it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if they register it, wouldn't they know that the serial number has been registered?  Yes, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon knows.  How would they know?  Leo could have gifted it to somebody.  I mean, that's the thing.  But that's difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't try, I have to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody needs to cut this portion of the show out and send it to DonkeyCustomersSupport.  This is the title of the YouTube post.  DonkeyCustomersSupport at Amazon.  Do the right thing.  You guys look like idiots to the entire tech community.  Why are we paying you $400 for a device?  It's obvious that if they know the serial number, they should at least brick the device.  That's a minimum.  Brick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allow you to brick your device.  Yeah, I mean, if they can deal with the 1984 thing, they can certainly brick your device.  And they did, didn't they?  Yeah, absolutely.  So what happened with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the upshot of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened was that they sold copies of 1984 before, I guess, the ink was signed on  the deal with the publisher and the publisher made them pull it.  And what they did was they bricked it from devices, didn't call the customer.  They erased it.  Just erased it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Furthermore, they've got a couple of lawsuits on their hands from school kids who said,  you took all my notes.  My notes are no longer good.  I can't do my homework.  So, but I'm saying last week, Amazon announced that they were going to do something.  They were giving them another copy of 1984 that would work, that would have the same  pagination or something.  So they made it a little bit better.  They apologized.  Yeah, weeks later.  They realized it was a mistake.  It's a new medium.  We're learning.  They made a mistake or two, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I make plenty of mistakes.  I didn't think that was such a big, terrible deal.  I mean, it was great.  Ironic that it was 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was so amazing.  Yeah, so amazing.  Yeah.  Literally, of all books.  Yeah, no, perfect.  In the entire world, it had to be 1984.  It was so amazing.  You really, you couldn't have picked a better one for them to go on out.  I don't have this problem.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I listen to audiobooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we're going to talk about that.  Why don't you want to talk about that right now?  What?

Transcript:  Audible.com.  I just was mentioning, I actually, I love audiobooks.  I was just listening on my iPhone when I was playing poker.  I lost $1,500 last night.  Did you really?  Oh.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have a gambling problem.  I lost $1,500.  I don't have a gambling problem.  I'm up for the year.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you guys always say you're up.  I'm up for the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was listening to YouTube.  I have an idea for a show, by the way.  We're going to have tech poker.  It'll be just like World Poker Tour.  We've got the little cameras and everything.  Oh, totally.  Unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  Wouldn't that be great?  That's going to be in the new studio.  iPhone plays.  Kindle plays.  It plays?  Yeah.  That means if you go all in, the Kindle is all in.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to include the Kindle in your iPhone.  Oh, you got your gadgets in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gadgets count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  High societies and all in and all this stuff, Jason's got going on.  Kindle plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I was listening to the main point was even though I was losing money, I was gaining  intelligence because I was listening to How the Mighty Have Fallen, which is a really  great business book by the guy from Good to Great.  Don't you?  While you're playing, you have an audio book on?  Oh, he's great.  Jim Collins is great.  I always listen to an audio book.  Isn't that distracting though?  No, not me.  You press the button, it pauses.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I'm in a hand, I hit the pause.  That's a tell, by the way.  If Jason hits pause, it's a big tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I know that.  So what I do is when I'm going to bluff, people who are playing, please pause the program.  Fast forward 30 seconds.  And then I count my chips and then I'm going to bluff.  I bet it makes a big bet.  And then I put the music back on and people go, and how's that working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Down 1500.  So you tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  When Jason pushes the button, he's bluffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's bluffing.  He doesn't have it.  So audible.com.  I have, you know, I have a jingle.  How they have the music back on.  I have a jingle.  I have a jingle.  I have a jingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what you were saying Jason, is when times are tough, you improve yourself.  You invest in yourself.  That's why I'm reading The Feminine Mystique.  You can get that though on Audible.  Did you know that?  Betty Friedan's highly controversial 1963 work.

These have, Audible uses the best readers, the best people in the business.  You know, because they're in Newark, they can go over the bridge and get the best Broadway  actors.  And they do in their reading.  They've been.  I didn't know that.  I just think the best voice actors were in Newark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Newark's known for their voice actors.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on the book, I guess.  Right.  Audible.com slash twit to Jason, you want to recommend this book?  What's it called?  By Jim Collins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's.  Oh my.  No, you know, I'll just look it up.  Jim Collins.  It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ryan, have you ever read Good to Great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look like you've been working out.  Does he look like he works out?  He's a cash vlogger.  Does he work out?  He works out.  I listen at the gym.  I like listening at the gym because I feel like that's time wasted standing on the Stairmaster  of the Bicycle or you know, whatever.  When I'm listening to a book, I'm both working out my brain and working out my body.  So how the mighty fail is that the one you're recommending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How the mighty fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  How the mighty fall and why some companies never give in.  Jim Collins is really smart.  He he actually did a lot of research for good to great about what makes a company get, you  know, get great as opposed to just be average and good.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And sustain greatness.  He talks about the ones that fail and he actually uses some examples from good to great  of companies that have failed.  So you get the sort of whole story arc.  You can start with this one and go backwards to the other.  Doesn't matter.  Yeah.

We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  So half of all Britons, survey says, have been injured by their biscuits on coffee break.  Just wanted to warn you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They injured their biscuits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, they've been injured by the biscuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I thought they injured their biscuits with biscuits.  Is biscuits a colloquialism for something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cookies.  No, I know that.  No, no.  That's it.  Just cookies.  I thought you meant they spelled T on their ass.  Some of them broke a tooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, biscuits mean something else.  Some of them bit their lip.  Oh, bit their lip.  They were injured by the biscuit, believe it or not.  Are they suing the biscuit industry?  No.  Related statistics?  There's really no reason to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  92% of people don't care.  Well, I think I beg to differ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I beg to differ.  An estimated 25 million adults in Great Britain have been injured while eating during a tea  or coffee break with 500 of them landing in the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think a lot of it has to probably do with the British state of teeth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They had better teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'd be eating these biscuits a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Broke a tooth in half with a biscuit.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I almost feel like this is the onion.  The Biscuit Injury Threat Evaluation Survey.  That can't be real.  It's in the telegraph.  Found that the custard cream biscuit was the worst offender to innocent drinkers.  It beat the cookie to the top of a table of 15 generic types of biscuits whose potential  dangers were calculated by this survey.  Custard creams get a risk rating of 5.63 as a pair to 1.6 for Jaffa cakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's got to be nice to live in a country where that is the most major and pertinent health  cure up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a big story.  I just want to remind the British that they had a bunch of subway bombings.  They might want to just focus their research on something other than...  Focus.  Are we going to find out the study was backed by the fruit authority who wants people to  get off?  And fruit is a much safer thing.  Oh, totally.  Nobody's been injured by a banana in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Consider a banana with your teeth.  Well, actually, weren't there two...  I think two newspapers in India republished a story from The Onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week because they thought it was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Onion's doing unbelievable work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They're so good that people believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're so good.  I love their Onion News Network.  Oh, the videos are just stupendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because they're perfect.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They look exactly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the story in question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we know what story it was?  Yeah, I'll find it for you.  I have to go back a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's just unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to let you do that, Jason.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Do we get people upset?  The story's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I'll tell you the truth.  It's...  I've always baffled me.  You can do a Russian accent because they're white.  But if you do accent of brown or yellow person, and nobody's yellow, by the way, I should  clear that up.  There's nobody actually yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's more like an offline media show.  Nobody is yellow.  You can't do any comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you do comedy about people who are not white, he's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have some experience with that.  It's definitely not good.  He's not good.  He's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I, for a long time, thought, well, you could do an Indian accent.  Of course you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I've had so many, in fact, at the famous TechCrunch 50, so many Indians dudes come up to me  and say, when the hell are you going to goof on us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a great sense of humor.  It's not derogatory, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, imitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is from TechCrunch, a fine journalistic enterprise, beloved by all.  The Onion, the Onion, America's finest news source and easily one of the best destinations  for quality satire, is wiping the floor with real journalism on Google News Spotlight,  which is pretty funny.  Two Bangladeshi newspapers that daily and new nation have been forced to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The new nation has the highest quality standards.  We only copy stories from the Onion and New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been forced to apologize after having regurgitated a news article taken from the  Onion website, which claimed the moon landings...  Oh yeah, it was fake.  ...were fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a related story, the space shuttle is made of cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Neil Armstrong has told a news conference he had been forced to reconsider every single  detail of the monumental journey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I told you I'm a...  It looked fake.  Oh, this is so bad.  Oh my God, this is so bad in so many ways.  Oh my God, this is so bad in so many ways.  I was so excited to come up with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to change the subject here.  Neil, how do you feel about Onion Video that has a lot of swears in it?  Can you blank out the swears?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the Onion Video, go ahead, tell me the video and I'll put it in.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's...  It is Onion News Network, Sony...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can't run that one.  That's the whole...  It's just one big bleep.  It is one big bleep.  And in fact, I was going to put that on my Tumblr log, because I love these Onion News,  and I thought I can't because I'm a public figure and the kids follow me on the radio  show.  I made the mistake of putting a link to porn tweeters, porn stars who tweet, and I got  so much of a tuperation from...  And I like using that word, so I use it again.  I got so much of a tuperation from radio listeners who said, I thought you were better than that.  My husband...  In fact, I got an email from a woman who says my husband is a sex addict.  I have been protecting him from these kinds of things for the last few years.  Now I can no longer let him listen to you or follow your Twitter stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I told her not to email you.  I thought you were gambling, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What's up?  Gambling's not enough?  There's an addiction I have, basically.  Let's just leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, they thought it was true.  We thought it was true, so we printed it without checking.  Associate Editor Hassan Zuman Khan told the AFP news agency, we didn't know the Onion  was not a news site.  No, that's fine.  I can understand.  That's a cultural thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next thing you tell me, Michael Jackson is not still alive.  I read that in the Onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're in a news organization.  Even if you don't know what the Onion is, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I love it though that the TechCrunch, which is a blog, gets a lot of heat from mainstream  media for not checking his stories.  So I think that they kind of have to love this.  I just had the greatest idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody wants it.  This is going to be a great like, Twit fan listener project.  Make an RSS for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we have any left, but go ahead.  Not after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get an RSS feed of the Onion, mix it with AP and Reuters, but put it all under AP and  Reuters logos on a site called newssyndicators.org or whatever.  And then just see if anybody falls for it.  It'd be hysterical.  Oh, I'm sure they would.  Breaking news syndicator or something.  It'd be hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a completely unrelated note, it's four degrees in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it nice and cold?  Well, you gotta wear pants when you come to the Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, I don't want you to.  No, no, no, no, I just want to know.  I didn't want anybody to be uncomfortable.  No, I'm not uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm freezing.  I'm freezing.  But I, but I didn't mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm wearing shorts.  I have.  Ultimately you could put your pants back on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're kind of sure.  Ryan, you're missing a real treat.  Next news.  Oh, Ryan, you're missing.  Ryan, where are you in Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm actually, I'm a little glad right now that I'm.  Yeah.  Where's in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Ryan's out here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have given you a ride.  You should have come.  I got two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the two Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm actually from Southern California.  My whole family's from Brooklyn.  Sheep's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sheep's head.  Sheep's head.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's go fishing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hey, forget about it.  I got out early though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I got more class than these other two.  When did you get out?  I got out really young and we went to Long Island.  Oh, that's an improvement.  Much different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Long Island's beautiful.  We got trees and everything.  New York Times had a little problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New York Times today put a note to readers on its website with a saying, you may have  seen a pop-up box on our New York Times site warning about a virus and directing you to  a site that claims to offer antivirus software.  We believe this was generated by an unauthorized advertisement.  We are working to prevent the problem from occurring.  If you see such a warning, don't click on it.  Instead, quit and restart your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm glad Jason's on this one because Jason and I, how many times, Jason, have we seen  this problem?  Back in the day, some crappy ad network putting some garbage ad up on a gadget or one of the  other sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why we can't get networks out.  I mean, it's not worth it to run ad networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're bad.  They're bad news.  You cannot control those ads.  You can't control them.  They will go to the lowest common denominator.  They'll do whatever they can do to get that click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what happens?  Here's what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have an ad network like blank and they say, oh, we're going to make you like a dollar  CPM or $2 CPM for the 40%, 30%, 80%, whatever you don't sell.  Why would the New York Times do this though?  They run ad networks too.  Everybody does.  Then that's when you see punch the monkey or lower my bills and this and that.  Garbage kind of adds a big teeth, the disgusting teeth ads for teeth cleaners or whatever.  And then they try to slip in things like pop-ups and bad code.  And what really any publisher should do is ban any ad network because what it does is  you make so little, 10% of your revenue, it uses 60% of your inventory and it drives away  the high quality advertisers.  So never use them.  I suggest nobody ever use an ad network to get, again, any of the ad networks who give  me a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this sounds like it was more than just click me, click me, click me.  It was malicious software.  That's a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happens is you have these advertisers who, you know, they sell to anybody.  And so maybe you have some company that wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With no vetting apparently.  So they'll just say whatever the image is, we'll serve it.  Basically.  And if they put some malware in the image, the malware is served.  Probably Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Russians.  It's the Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Programmers Day.  The winner of Programmer Day.  The winner of Programmer Day.  The winner of Programmer Day is actually the person who made this code.  It's good code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to talk.  We kind of haven't really talked about the big story of the week, which is 9909.  I know Ryan, you were there.  In fact, you helped us with our coverage of it.  Just a little bit.  We're going to talk about the new iPods.  Yeah, I got one.  You got one?  Ready to show.  Oh, cool.  And whether Steve Jobs lied to David Pogue at the New York Times when he said, oh, we  never intended to put a camera in there.  What camera?  No, that would make it too expensive.  And in fact, don't you know the iPod Touch?  It's a gaming platform.  But before we do that, I want to mention our friends, our good friends at Carbonite.com.  Now, here's a company that I've known for some time.  They do advertising on my radio show.  And I think they are a really great company for people who are looking for a way to protect  their software, protect their data, protect their hard drive.  Carbonite is online backup.  Backup done right.  You know, if you back up, and I recommend people do this to your hard drive, an external  hard drive or a DVD, that's fine.  That's fine.  But you're not protecting yourself if you're not backing up offsite.  And that's what I love about it.  You have to do offsite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to do offsite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you get robbed?  That's what happened.  Fire.  Did you know that that happened to Francis Ford Coppola?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they probably took masters.  Thinks they're irreplaceable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This guy, he lives in Argentina now.  He had a computer.  He was backing up to an external hard drive.  Thieves came in, took both.  Of course.  He says, I'll have 20 years of scripts.  I have 20 years of material gone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And for 15 cents a day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Five bucks a month.  Less than five bucks a month.  He could be backing up on Carbonite.  It's amazing.  Ridiculous.  So I want to tell you, don't, you know, it'd be great to back up locally.  It's nice to have it there, but Carbonite gives you so much more.  You're backing up online.  It's encrypted with AES encryption before it leaves your computer, then uses SSL.  So it's double encrypted as it goes through the internet.  And it's completely private.  Even the folks at Carbonite cannot open that encrypted file.  It's yours and yours alone.  Here's a nice feature of Carbonite.  You can log on to your Carbonite account from any computer and see the files and download  any files you want.  So if you're backing up your financial records, for instance, you need access to them on a  computer, another computer, you can get to them.  Only you, but you could get to them.  Back up for less than five bucks a day, unlimited emails, photos, music, financial records,  office documents.  I've had podcasts and because we had some incidents where we lost podcasts and I had  to re-record them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was terrible.  It was so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was stupid.  So now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five dollars a month unlimited?  Unlimited.  Wow.  I'm signing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only limitation is your bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why you want to try it right now.  If you're on modem, you're not going to use this, but you just know it runs all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm saying, but you just hit, you know.  It runs all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's smart.  The uploader is a Mac PC.  It watches what's going on when you're idle.  It starts uploading.  So it doesn't use up your bandwidth unnecessarily.  Admittedly, that first backup takes maybe a few days, depending on how much data you're  backing up.  But after that, it's just always backing up.  You never have to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use another service like that.  That's twice the price.  Yeah.  Fifty-five bucks a year.  No, it's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might be time to consider a switch because at five dollars a month, why wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're going to do it, I want you to use the offer code TWIT.  Would you mind doing that?  Yeah.  I'd love to.  I have the wrong one on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't do the one on the screen.  I have about a thousand videos I need to back up.  Yeah.  I use it for my podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God forbid the Jason's Place masters were lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  God forbid the high art that I make is lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Future generations are going to look at these videos and know that they're important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to play these Jason's Place.  I've got to go to an early one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the early ones when I'm in the crib or the high chair.  Oh, it's genius.  This is how these guys met.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll do it towards the end of the show.  I'll explain what that's all about.  Let's get back to tech because I've got to get so much hate mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're already getting hate mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hate mail is actually coming in now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The minute you introduce my name, probably, what's this guy on the show?  I want you to go to Carl and, what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you got rid of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to carbonite.com, enter the offer code TWIT.  Now, here's what you get.  Two free weeks.  You don't need a credit card so you can try it right away.  Just offer code TWIT.  I know.  I don't know why everybody doesn't do that.  It's so great.  And if you use my offer code after your trial and buy the service, you'll get two months  free.  So it's even less expensive.  So C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite.com offer code TWIT.  We thank them for supporting our show this week in tech.  And I apologize to them for the show.  And we're just going to do our best to make a better show next time.  Please come back.  What does that mean?  Please come back.  So you have, let me see it.  You got the Nano right there?  You got it right there?  Yeah, let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll hold up both of them so you can see the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's both of them mean?  Do you have two different ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, this is the old one in my left hand and this is the new one in my right hand.  So it's the same size.  The screen is slightly different.  And then on the back, let me see if I can get it up better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a little hole where the camera go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got the camera right there.  So let me turn that on.  And you can see I'm recording myself.  How's the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen a couple of comparisons on the net and it looks okay.  Is it comparable to the Flip Minnow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not quite, but I mean, look, this is not a device that you're going to buy for amazing  video quality.  It's not even HD.  You're buying it and you're going to use it the same reason that you have a camera on  your phone and that's you have it on you and you're going to take video with it occasionally.  You're not going to film your child's first birthday with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they say, Leo, the best camera is the one you have with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  I really agree.  Although I have one with me.  It's called my iPhone.  Nobody would replace, nobody would buy this in addition to an iPhone, right, Ryan?  Or would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It depends.  It depends.  I mean, people buy them for different reasons.  It's a really good workout device.  It's a really good on-the-go device.  There are a lot of people who have iPhones that also have one of these, which is this  is actually the new shuffle.  I'll hold it up to the old shuffle.  They look exactly the same.  The only difference being this new one is a special edition.  It's stainless steel.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want that one.  Look at that.  Mirrors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You could do your hair in that.  That's beautiful.  You could put on your lipstick with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lauren, you'd love that.  For lipstick, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put on your lipstick.  Covering my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doing your hair, it's not going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, it's the same backing as the iPod Touch, that stainless steel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's coming in as an H.264 MP4, I guess.  640x480, the video.  Yeah, 640x480.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On the Nano?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, I believe it's H.264.  It's VGA.  It's not HD.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  640x480 is fine.  I don't like HD on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  The location of the actual camera right here, the way that you hold this, normally you find  your finger just constantly getting in the way.  It would have been better if they would have put it over next to the screen.  That's usually where the lens is, because you're not normally holding the device on  the screen.  You're holding it off the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were constrained by what they could put in that small case.  It probably didn't have a lot of flexibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an unbelievably small device.  When you hold it on the side, you can barely even see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that me telling that, Ry?  149 for 8 gigs, 179 for 16.  That's great.  I think you're going to see video everywhere.  More and more people are going to have cameras.  Who this is for is a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a teenager.  A teenager who doesn't have a camera phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, great Christmas present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does the FM radio work?  That seemed to me like something that should have been in an iPod, I don't know how many  years ago.  It's supposed to be also been in Washington.  I don't even know why you would put an FM radio in there.  No, but if you have a sports game or you have a talk show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no sports on FM radio.  What kind of FM radio do you listen to?  What about AM radio?  They don't have AM radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but FM, let's say if you had a talk show you wanted to listen to or something.  There's no talk show on FM radio.  There's nothing.  It's all music.  You have no radio, period, on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know where they're going to have a problem?  Tomorrow the Zune HD comes out and it has FM radio, HD FM radio.  I ordered one of those.  That's going to be kind of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll show you the FM radio real quick.  So it's got that and it will skip between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does have something that Zune doesn't have though.  It has a buffer, right?  You can rewind.  Yeah, it has time shifting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  15 seconds, no talking minutes.  I mean, it's good for me to demo it.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Looking at myself in the camera.  But yeah, it's got a buffer, kind of like a TiVo style buffer.  It doesn't record anything, but it does use RDS so you can actually tag songs and then  find what they are in iTunes and grab them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's why they did it.  Just another way to schlep songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they did it.  To show songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I got it.  So you could say, oh, I like this song.  Can I buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And if it has that track data, which most radio stations transmit that now, and they  have the track, which iTunes more than likely should, then you can just buy it right on  iTunes.  Later, of course.  It doesn't have Wi-Fi on the device or anything.  But yeah, I mean, look, it's an incremental improvement.  I don't think anybody's been completely blown away by it.  But it's the best selling MP3 player in the world right now.  We don't want to screw up a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that's right.  Now, here's the controversy.  In fact, I'm starting to believe now it really is a controversy.  Steve Jobs and David Pogue interviewed him after the event.  Did you get to speak to Steve, by the way, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Steve does not speak to lowly tech reporters in B-Journals like myself.  No.  Yeah, he speaks to Pogue, Steven Levy from time to time, Mossberg, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you he doesn't even talk to Levy anymore now that he's at Wired, not Newsweek.  I bet you anything he doesn't even...  Levy's friends with him.  Is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've known each other for 30 years.  I played volleyball with Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't mean he's going to talk to me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  Steve has a very select...  He's very selective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He picks people who are going to be very positive.  However, I think that David got punked a little bit.  I love David.  He's a good friend, although I know you're not a big fan of his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If he was doing like applefamboy.com, I'd be fine with it, but he is the columnist for  the New York Times.  And they need to fire him immediately and make him a columnist or something.  It's just ridiculous to have the guy who is making crazy speaking gigs, writing the book  on Apple.  So he's basically getting paid 20 different ways.  And then he writes the objective piece or supposedly objective piece about Apple, but  he's such an Apple fanboy that you just feel like...  I feel like the New York Times is in on the take.  And I don't think that's the role of the New York Times.  I'd be fine if he was a columnist on a gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why can't they just have him not cover Apple?  I mean, in this day and age, isn't everything?  Apple is...  It's most important.  It really is.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what the ironic thing about this?  In the tech circles, it's been known for years that David Pogue has got more conflicts than  the Middle East.  And he's insane in terms of writing the book after reviewing the products.  I know he's a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a nice guy.  He's a good friend, but I have to say it really is a little out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And going on...  He hosts cruises.  You know, like hosting a cruise about Apple.  Well, I do those cruises, cruises too.  The Mac Mania cruises.  I think that's how I know David.  You're a radio show host.  It's different.  You're not writing for the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not writing for the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, look, it's those expectations.  And the thing with the Times is when they...  You can't erase conflicts of interest based on the standards that you've had for hundreds  of years as one of the oldest old school publications around.  You can't erase those conflicts of interest by just calling them out and saying, yeah,  they exist.  Right?  That's not enough.  You either have to revise your editorial standard or you have to get rid of the person who has  these conflicts.  That's the one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just playing devil's advocate for a second here, which is, I guess, what I'm supposed  to do.  We're always screaming at the Times and mainstream media to change and this and that.  What's the answer?  I mean, how do they evolve with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the part we want them to change.  We like the fact that they have really high ethics and really good impartiality.  And so for them to say, oh, well, we're going to just be more new age and more blogger-like  and lose our impartiality.  That's not what we want from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree that we don't want it.  I don't want it either, but it's just like Leo was goofing on me earlier.  But the New York Times isn't supposed to make money or him from all these other sources.  It's a difficult problem, but I think the Times...  People have to feed their family, et cetera, et cetera.  I got my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the guy who reviews the iPhone from the New York Times.  He does a video called I want my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that is a little bit of a problem, I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, look, I'll put it this way.  That's all great and cheeky and it's good for the traffic.  It's cheeky.  I would never have done that adding Gadget.  I would never have let one of my editors adding Gadget.  That's a good question.  So you wouldn't let anybody do that?  You know why?  Because my readers would never have let me get away with that.  And for good reason too.  I mean, that is the kind of stuff that you put it out there and it says a lot about what  you think of the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's what happens this time.  He gets exclusive interview with Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh really?  I wonder why.  He's a friend.  Yeah, maybe also because everything he writes is glowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He asked Jobs, first question to his credit.  Hey, we thought there was going to be a camera on the iPod touch.  What happened?  Jobs says, oh no, we never intended to put a camera on the iPod touch.  That would have made it too expensive.  This is a gaming platform.  Pay no attention to that.  And David goes, okay, next question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He rolled over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think he probably should have said something like, you know, there's that's an interesting  spin.  Now he's not going to say this to Jobs face because Steve will get up and leave.  Yeah.  That's one of the reasons why I don't interview Steve Jobs, even if I were offered that chance,  because you know, you can't ask him a serious question.  So Ryan, is it credible what Steve Jobs said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, and the reason why it's not credible is because a month or two ago there was a leak  of an iPod touch that had a camera in it and actually cracked open the device and they  looked at the internals and those internals with the camera match exactly the internals  of the new device without the camera.  We've seen now that I fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I fix it as torn down the new iPod touch and it's an exact match with this leaked photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they had this months ago, so it was not like, you know, there's no smoke and mirrors  here.  It was actually a device and it actually had a camera and the camera is now gone.  So what happened?  The same board design.  So the fact is, yeah, they took it out for some reason.  Maybe the camera, there was a rumor that they were having problems with the sensors, so  they had to scrap it.  Maybe they couldn't get the margin they wanted on it.  Maybe they just decided for marketing reasons that they wanted to move more nanos.  We don't know.  We'll probably never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you'll know when in two months Apple has another event or maybe they don't even  have an event and they just say, oh, by the way, we've got a camera now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the Mac sites just did a tear down like yesterday.  I fix it, yeah.  I fix it and the space is there.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  So it must have been a technical issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the rumor was that there were chip problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  That makes no sense for him not to put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guarantee you will be there eventually.  They will eventually put one in there.  There's no doubt about it, especially now that we know that they were actually toying  with that and that, you know, they basically took it out.  We know they took it out.  We don't know why.  You know, if you want to know why.  Why is less relevant, though, and more relevant is when will we get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, conspiracy theory kind of thing is maybe he didn't want to take away sales  from the three GS so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's purely a technical issue.  In fact, I feel like, Ryan, you were at the event, but it seemed to me that it seemed  like there was a hole in the event where they would have announced the iPod touch with camera.  It makes sense for the line, the entire line to be revised with cameras.  It makes no sense to leave it out of the touch.  Makes no sense to say it's a gaming platform.  We want to keep the price down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they also there the argument that they gave.  And I got the exact same answer when I was talking to the people who gave me my briefing,  which was Greg Jaws, we act and in Eddie Q.  You have the same spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they have the same spin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, my my first question was, OK, why no camera on the iPod touch?  And their answer was, well, we really wanted to get this hundred nine nine hundred ninety  nine dollar price point.  We wanted to make this the device that was the least expensive to get you to the App  Store.  People really love the games.  People really love the functionality that it has.  We're really focused on price.  And I said, well, that's fine for the one ninety nine version.  But you also sell a two ninety nine and a three ninety nine version.  These are your flagship devices.  This is the most intense iPod you can buy.  Of course, it should have a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, and put it in.  They want you to buy it twice.  Well, there's a bunch of ham fanboys are going to buy the hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's going to happen when 60 days from now it does come out with a camera?  It's a technical problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Pogel sing, I want my iPod.  And you know, it isn't David's issue.  It really is the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I agree with you.  They're they're totally encouraging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean, you can be the enabler, you can be the enabler.  There's problems on both sides.  New York Times really does need to amend their policies, though.  I mean, it's not enough to just talk about a conflict of interest.  You have to either act upon it or get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have such problems.  I don't even think they're worrying about this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The more people who enable Steve Jobs to, you know, like it's like they're  basically giving him the New York Times to as a platform, but not holding him  to the same standards of other executives.  And it's like that's my issue.  And you put Dave Pogel into the mix and it's like Dave Pogel will not ask him  hard questions or press him.  What David Pogel should say is I'm not going to interview Steve Jobs unless he  answers it and they should call him out on it in the paper and say Steve Jobs  declined to comment, declined to comment.  And he won't do an interview.  And they just Pogel will not ask him a hard question.  I don't think I don't think he would be hardcore with him.  I think everybody in the industry is so in love with him with good reason.  He makes this product.  They would just they're not the losing Steve as a contact and losing the  ratings from Steve, the Journal, the New York Times.  They don't want to lose him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same problem with Beltway journalism.  You know, if you're going to cover the White House, you need access to the  White House, the White House can say or congressman and a congressmember  can say, you know, you're not going to cover me favorably.  I'm not giving you access.  It's very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the question is, do you think the New York Times coverage is as honest  and as it could be or does the Steve Job access issue for New York Times  Journal affect the coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm never going to get access to Steve Jobs.  I don't even want to access to Steve Jobs.  Same thing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It also comes down to a reporter by reporter basis.  We remember Joe Nassera last year with the with Steve Jobs illness stories.  Right. And and and Steve called Joe Nassera, you know, this really  man, they call him a slime ball.  Yeah. Pulitzer Prize winning journalist calls him a slime ball.  Right. I mean, like it depends.  It's from person to person.  I mean, obviously, Jobs and Pogue have a much better relationship than than Jobs  and whatever reporter is trying to break some news about Jobs at that moment,  because that's not what Pogue does.  He's their product reviewer. He's their columnist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody's asking somebody saying show some examples of bias.  I'll give you an example of bias is very clear in his Snow Leopard  review, which was very positive.  He said, in fact, that, you know, you're a hater if you say it's a service pack.  Meanwhile, he is he's giving an interview to another.  And I'll find the link to another  magazine in which he admits that he installed Snow Leopard and  Photoshop, CS. Oh, sorry, David.  Not now. Photoshop CS3 crashed all the time.  His printer never worked again.  So in fact, I think that's a very clear example of him not reporting  the problems he had reporting a very glowing review of Snow Leopard,  when, in fact, to me, it was pretty obvious that Snow Leopard wasn't.  Does the Times get a lot of Apple advertising?  I don't know. That's another question.  They certainly think David is benefiting much more than the Times.  Well, there is a big campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Times is almost always on that list.  I guarantee you. I've sat in these meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And on the website, you know, when you do a full page ad, you do in the Times.  And on the website, they've done some amazing things with the switch ads  where they're talking to other ads on the New York Times website.  So, yeah, absolutely.  They get by. But I think that's going on.  I don't think there's evidence that the Times itself is influenced by that advertising.  I think that's a risky thing to say. David has an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that issue, you can if you're the largest publication  like New York Times, you're going to have all the largest advertisers.  You can't allow that to influence your editorial.  You have all the largest advertisers and you're going to have  you have to cover those largest advertisers.  It's just it's a correlation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this isn't a new equation we're dealing with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the new part of the equation.  The new part of the equation is Steve Jobs being a God that nobody wants to upset  combined with a fanboy being the cover.  Now, let me say something on the web.  Let me say so.  Crush the I'm looking at a story here where you just totally crush the BlackBerry's.  I mean, it's obvious he's an iPhone fan.  I think what they should do is they should be disclosures as to which device they use,  which device they know. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't they set up a gadget account?  Why can't he have a gadget account and let me see his list?  I'm not kidding, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You joke, but that's exactly what we made it for.  We made it to add transparency to these kinds of things.  People constantly ask me, what kind of gadgets do I use?  Well, now you know. Go to my site.  You know, you can see what I use.  You see what Jason, see what Leo uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I put I haven't put everything up there, but I'm putting it up there.  I love that feature. I think that's a really fun, great feature, social feature.  Yeah. So to change the subject a little bit,  the good news on this Apple event was Steve Jobs walks up on stage.  That was good. He's very thin, but he but he's he's clearly got the energy.  He's got the you know, he's there.  He's back. And what I really enjoyed and, Ryan, you can address this  because you were there.  In fact, I think you brought this up on on Mac Break Weekly.  Is he first thing he does is he acknowledges  the kid gave his transplant and encourages others to donate organs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very man she very. Yeah, it was pretty heavy.  I mean, look, I've been I've seen Steve Jobs get up on stage.  I don't even know how many times now, you know, many, many, many times.  And he's he's always very,  you know, he's very on message about products.  He gets up there. It's time to introduce products.  It was very unusual for him to actually talk about something personal.  I mean, clearly, this is as personal as it gets. Right.  I mean, he had a liver transplant.  It was he was he was very, very hard felt about this person  who died in a car accident and who donated their organ.  And, you know, there are some people who say that he kind of had to talk about it  because, you know, he's he's a fabulously wealthy man  who got bumped up supposedly on the waiting list or, you know, he went to Kentucky.  He went to Kentucky because the waiting list is shorter there.  And that's I mean, look,  that that is, I think, besides the point.  But but the fact is, you know, it's it's a it's a great message.  I think that people should be organ donors.  And I think that he is living proof as to to I'm sorry, Tennessee.  Not Kentucky. And anyway, you know, Steve is living proof as to,  you know, the good things that happen when when you give that  when you give that gift. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and that was very you're right.  Menchie is a good word as a classy class class move. Very.  We're going to talk about Facebook.  It enhances your intelligence while Twitter diminishes it.  I believe that.  And we'll tell you the psychologist who figured it all out  will explain what happened there.  But first, I want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.  Hmm. Yes, there's another ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What do you what do you love that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, thank you. I use it a lot.  Actually, we use it on some of our shows to do screenshots.  Ray Maxwell uses it from Vancouver.  We use it for all our meetings.  In fact, if somebody says to me, I want to use some other,  you know, technology for online meetings, I say no, no, no, no.  I use GoToMeeting. That's all I'm going to use.  That's a default. It is the default.  It's so easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been around forever. You know, it's going to work.  It's secure. It's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's ads everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason they can spend money on ads is because it works.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'll never have a problem with a company that says, OK,  try it free for 30 days. You'll be the judge.  And that's exactly what they do.  And to me, that's a company that says we stand behind our product  and we know it's good.  So if you try it for 30 days, you'll be the judge.  And you can't you can't beat that.  30 day free, unlimited trial.  You can have as many meetings as you want.  Actually, that's kind of the benefit of GoToMeeting in general  is you don't have to time your count your meetings or count  how much time you've used.  You've got unlimited meetings for forty nine dollars a month.  All the meetings you want includes voice and voice over IP conferencing.  You have your meetings from your desk.  Clients love it because it's easy.  They don't have to install anything ahead of time.  They just go to GoToMeeting.com, click a button and boom, they're seeing your  screen, your sales presentation, your product demo.  You could use it for training.  You could say, here's how you use this.  Now you try it. You can give them control.  Collaborate on documents.  There's so many ways to use it.  If you try it for 30 days, you'll get an idea of how you might use it in your business.  I want you to try it right now.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash tweet.  GoToMeeting.com slash tweet.  It is indispensable to business today.  We all use it. We use it like crazy.  I have several. I don't know how many accounts I have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was there was actually one time I really wished a company was using it.  Remember how HP had those that scandal about spying on journalists?  Yeah. A couple of years back.  Well, so I had this meeting with HP one time and they wanted to do a web meeting.  And instead of using a service like GoToMeeting, they actually had me install some software.  And it was their software, too.  It was like they wrote it, they built it, they had it on their own site.  I'd never heard of it before.  And I was really kind of freaked out, right, to do this, because, I mean, I have no idea.  Are they going to start spying on me, too? Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, use our software there.  You don't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it was one of those moments I was like, please, just please use something  that everybody knows and is familiar with and not this, you know, creepy HP spy software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not creepy HP spy software.  This is GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting.com slash Twitter.  That's a really good point. We thank you so much for their support.  That's a really good point.  You know what I did on Twitter?  I would have been a little nervous about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just thanked at Carbonite Backup, at GoToMeeting and at Audible underscore com  for sponsoring. You're very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if I had a computer, I would have tweeted my massive  Twitter following and God knows what would have happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is your Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1938 Media. I don't want you ever going and reading it, though, Leo.  You don't mention me in it.  No, never. But please don't read it, Leo.  Now I've got to read it. Now I've got to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's in there? What is it? Come on.  Now it's got to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All angry all the time.  He's got an anger management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just nonsense.  No, really, Leo, please.  I don't even know. I think I I think I unfollowed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, good, good, good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll block you, Leo. It'll work out better that way.  Ryan wants to know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does 1938 mean?  What's that come from?  When I started the company, I was 38 and my art director was 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was like old timey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I like to say, my grandfather invented web video  and I took over the family business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 1938, I'm actually going to do a video as my grandfather  doing the first web video ever.  I just haven't gotten around to it.  Like most of the other good ideas I have.  Brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you how do you make your living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I make videos for big companies that I'm not allowed to talk about.  Like corporate video.  Yeah, I make a lot of corporate videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of comics make money doing  doing industrials, corporate videos, speaking.  I do boring, very common work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to do that a lot.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't even want me to plug it because they don't want to associate it  with my name, but they like my work.  What are you saying, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Turn free video into money.  That's how there you go.  You can earn your reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's such nonsense.  But you're famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you're famous for the free video.  You give that away and then you charge for the corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But I'd much rather not do corporate and charge for the video.  You know, we can't all have what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't ever get anything I want.  So it turns out I am following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, unfollow me.  I'm going to block you as soon as I get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one of the funny things he does.  He just blocks.  He blocks people for no reason.  Really?  He puts people on tilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty.  But the best is when I'll have somebody sponsored.  I did that with Mahalo.  Like this blocks brought to you by Mahalo.com.  I would sponsor my blocks.  It's really nonsense.  I'm very uncomfortable, Mr. LePorte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sponsor blocks.  I love that.  I want to buy a block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then in the block, he's just railing on people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My next 10 blocks, I'm going to give to you for free, Leo.  It's just this block brought to you by Twitt TV.  Does it tweet when you do a block?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, how does anybody know the block is sponsored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say.  I put it in.  Oh, you say it.  I'm blocking.  I say this block sponsored by.  I'll literally type that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bizarre.  It's like everything with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was actually really good to see Steve Jobs back.  It was.  It was.  It was really great.  He's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's so you know what?  It sounds so like as a human.  I cry truthfully because Steve Jobs.  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of gay.  It's very.  I thought we're not getting into that.  Now, you know what it was?  I was working in.  You know, I was a blue collar guy.  And I knew that this computer stuff  was going to be important.  OK.  And I remember my first computer was a computer,  an Apple Performer 575 and the original iMac.  And I locked myself in a room and I taught myself that system.  And that guy, I feel, got me out of my horrible gas station  type jobs and blue collar jobs that I  was going to be stuck with.  I wasn't college educated.  Many of us can say that.  I think most of us can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Bowe can say that.  I mean, he transformed the world.  He really did.  He did.  And you can speak to this, Jason.  He's not an inventor.  Was invented the Apple II.  But Steve productizes stuff.  The personal computer wasn't new,  but Steve Jobs came along and made it happen.  The MP3 player wasn't new, but Steve Jobs came along  and made it happen.  The smartphone wasn't new, but Steve Jobs came along  and made it happen.  He has created at least three categories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about when you're not even talking  about that other tiny little company he had, Pixar?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he's a unique person in terms of, you know,  obviously a large amount of vision,  the ability to inspire a large group of people  to perform at a level of perfection in terms of design  and just, you know, the spirit of the products he makes,  whether it's Pixar movies or the iPhone.  He cares.  It's truly inspiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what I love about him is that he really cares.  And you can see it in his products that he cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, you know, when there was that sort of moment  in time that people thought, geez, he's not going to make it.  It was very sad for the industry.  And I think if he hadn't gotten the transplant  and, you know, wasn't with us, God forbid,  I think it would have been a cloud on the industry  for a decade.  Absolutely.  I completely agree.  It's so great to see him back.  He's very, so important.  I've given Apple a hard time more than anybody  about certain issues, but it's because I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, not to get crazy or sound too much  like a fan boy, but he's Edison level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he's different from Edison  because he's not, well, of course, you know, actually,  he's not, because Edison really wasn't a great inventor  necessarily, but he was.  He productized.  He productized.  Edison's underling was the real genius also.  But maybe Edison is the proper.  That may, in fact, be exactly the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's one of the most important men of the 20th century.  Oh, there's no question.  Easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it transcends business.  I mean, that's really the interesting part  is that it's not just about chips.  I mean, you look at Intel, you're like,  yeah, that's an incredible, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, how many people, you know,  Bill Gates, tremendous man, you know, whatever,  Ellison, Benny Off, whatever.  How many, you know, he, you don't look up to those guys.  You look up to Bill Gates because you want to be rich.  Okay.  You look up to Steve Jobs because he want to be great  and you want to be special.  And I think that's the great, great thing about the guy.  I mean, I literally watch his speeches and I'm a very,  I mean, I speak very well.  You know, I-  It's all different level.  It's just unbelievable.  When we were-  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In rehearsals this week, we were basically explaining people  to channel their inner Steve Jobs  in terms of how they speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have a book, my friend Carmine Gallo,  who did the Money Machine on Tech TV,  has written a book called  The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs,  where he puts a lot of this stuff.  It's actually really a great book if you're looking to,  I'll give them a little free plug if you're looking to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs.  Step one, use Keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say again?  Two, speak.  Yeah, use Keynote.  Yeah.  I actually was very grateful that they put that out.  I mean, you knew Steve was using something special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, when they first used the-  And they finally put that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Keynote is, you know, that is like,  that is the D. Steve product.  He designed that, I think, from the ground.  He didn't make it, obviously.  He designed that from the ground up.  For himself, probably.  No, exactly.  Every feature that goes into that thing  is something that he wants for his next presentation  that he gives to the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I have the-  This is the Gallo McGraw Hill Publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's a dynamic man.  But, you know, look,  the thing that makes Steve Jobs so interesting  is also the thing that makes him so difficult.  I mean, he's so prickly, right?  I mean, that's a very kind word for what he is.  I mean, he does not really, I think, relate to most-  He's not a people person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's-  You know, and I've spent some time-  I spent a long weekend with Steve  when he was still at Pixar.  We have mutual friends and I spent some time with him.  And even then, he knew he was the smartest guy in the room.  He made no bones about it.  He'd walk in a room, he'd say,  I'm the smartest guy here.  Listen to me, because you don't know  what you're talking about.  And he was great talking to him.  He had a lot of things to say that were very interesting.  He's very ambitious and, you know, almost aggressively so.  But I think that probably makes a great entrepreneur,  right, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this pretty-  Most VCs and investors in companies will tell you that-  They want to win.  They don't want a very adjusted,  well-adjusted balanced person at the helm.  It doesn't work well because you're not gonna get  a lot accomplished if you're willing to accept, you know,  a sort of balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta wanna win more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you got a certain amount of imbalance  in a personality in terms of traits.  And I think what you have to know is your own limitations.  Are these people unhappy?  That's a great question.  I think that a lot of entrepreneurs,  if they get too caught up in themselves,  they get too caught up in the pressure of it,  they can be unhappy.  I'm sure Steve Jobs had moments in his life  when he was very unhappy, especially when he left to go-  That must have killed him.  I mean, that was probably brutal,  but the man is obviously riding high right now  with a lot of joy and playing from a very pure place.  I know as an entrepreneur, I've had down moments,  but I feel like I'm playing from a very pure place now.  But yeah, it's a mixed bag.  And I'd be lying if I said I think,  majority of the time I think that entrepreneurs  are always happy.  It might be the majority of the time  that they're frustrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gotta be a bit of a roller coaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a tough-  Emotionally.  It's a tough day.  I think because you, no matter what happens-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got some entrepreneurs in the room going,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no, the analogy I tell people is,  every person you have working for you  has one or two major problems a month.  And so if you take the total number of who worked for you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I only have six employees.  That way I get a couple of days off.  Even in that case,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so then there's 12 major problems a month  and they'll probably make you aware of three or four of them.  And so you basically can address maybe three or four of them,  eight of them you don't know.  And it's really hard, but he's obviously a great leader  and they bring him the problems  and they tackle them together.  I think he's very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alex Lindsay tells a great storytelling story.  Alex worked at Apple for a little bit  and knows a lot of Apple people.  He talks about a meeting.  Steve Jobs had a bunch of developers come in the room  and one of the developers says,  "'Hey Steve, how was your weekend?'  And Jobs' response is,  "'Can we raise the conversation up a notch a little bit  and talk?'  So brutal.  It's like, you're wasting my time now.  I don't want to tell you how my weekend was.  No time for social lubrication.'

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's classic Jobs.  And the question I always ask,  all technology, all history aside,  is who'd you rather sit next to on a bus, Steve or Bill?  I'd take Bill.  I mean, Bill, I've sat down with Bill a number of times  and he is a genuinely a very nice, interested,  engaged person who I think really cares.  Steve, Steve is Steve.  He makes great products,  but he's not somebody you'd want to sit down with next to  for an hour or two hours on the bus.  Bill is something else.  He's very, very different.  And he is very much, I think, the everyman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't see Steve Jobs retiring  and starting a charity and devoting his time  to ending malaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he thinks that he's probably made  a big enough contribution.  He's done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what he's doing now.  This is his job.  Right.  Yeah.  And he might have a point there, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he does.  Yeah, that's what he's good at.  Would you want Edison to stop inventing to go  to something else?  I don't think so.  It's like Jay just said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people who operate at such a high level like that  are generally not socially fit all the time.  They're just not.  I mean, and it doesn't matter whether it's Jobs,  a Michael Jordan type.  When you're at the top of your game and you're pushing.  It's more like a Pat Riley type.  Yeah, okay, whatever.  But the point is, you get there for a reason.  You get there because of those maybe off personality traits  is what drives you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Ryan, what were you about to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nothing.  Not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ryan, can you raise the level of conversation?  I can, Facebook enhances.  I'm gonna drop a bomb on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, I mean, in a hundred years,  Steve is gonna be remembered and revered,  and they're gonna think of him, I think,  as one of the great pioneers of technology,  as well everyone should.  But in a hundred years, Bill is not only going to have that,  he's going to be remembered as the greatest philanthropist  that the world has ever known.  And I think that we all need to realize exactly  what the difference is here when we're talking about  these two men who've built these two amazing companies.  One has kind of used their company as a Trojan horse  to heal the world.  And I know it's like a really kind of cliche way  of putting it, but I mean, this is a guy who has,  the world's greatest fortune at his hands,  and he's, instead of creating the next product,  he's going out there and he's trying to cure malaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that's also admirable.  Yeah.  I almost hate to do this story, but I teased it,  so I better do it.  Facebook enhances intelligence, but Twitter diminishes it,  claims a psychologist, Dr. Allaway,  who is, Tracy Allaway,  who is at the University of Sterling in Scotland,  so gives us a chance to do the Scotland accent.  Can't do those either.  Great.  Has extensively studied work in memory  and believes it to be far more important  to success and happiness than IQ.  After, actually it's interesting.  Did you hear that?  Memory is more important than IQ to success and happiness.  Does that make sense?  I think I guess that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think IQ is, I think memory ties in with EQ,  which is more important than IQ.  Emotional quotient.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you know the funny thing is the people  who have the best memory,  who you think of as being the sharpest, you know,  are often the people who have the best memory.  They're not necessarily the people who have the greatest-  They remember more.  Yeah, it's like if you, you can fake a lot of smarts  by just remembering a whole lot of data.  That's what I do.  Yeah, tell me about it.  I don't know nothing.  You know, I'm example number one.  No, actually I don't even have a very good memory.  I have a terrible memory.  Do you?  Yeah, I have a pretty good memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I used to. I have a great memory.  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a terrible memory for names,  so actually that's not, probably,  I probably don't have a good memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it makes sense, right?  You have to remember the data to do something with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the issue.  She says on Twitter,  you receive an endless stream of information,  but you don't have to process that information.  You don't have to really remember it.  Twitter has no history.  Twitter is like washing over you like the ocean.  Right, the stream comes by so fast.  She says your attention span is being reduced  and you're not engaging your brain  in improving nerve connections.  Facebook is all about memories.  It's about keeping up with friends,  stretching the work in memory.  So instant text, instant messaging,  Twitter and YouTube, not so good for memory.  And she has a lot of results working with kids.  Yeah, I buy that story.  All right, that's all I have to say about it.  Got no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Totally makes sense.  I'm done.  Short attention span versus-  I'm done.  I mean, watching MTV is as good as watching Nova.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a entrepreneur's gone wrong story.  Just used the well-known, Mike Volpe,  who's a very well-known and beloved CEO  used ousted by the Skype guys.  Apparently because-  You had a poker problem?  No, he joined the firm Index Ventures,  which was part of the consortium to buy Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of bad blood.  So what's going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was removed from the board of directors  at his position as chairman of Juiced by shareholder vote.  The company and its board of directors  are conducting an investigation into his actions  during his tenure as CEO and chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No conflict of interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, what's going on here now is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he try to buy Juiced?  What happened was-  I mean, Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Juiced was a follow-on company,  from the guys who brought you Skype.  And it was supposed to be this better version of YouTube.  It's kind of a flop, isn't it?  Yeah, it was supposed to be Hulu.  It was a disaster.  Anyway, they executed poorly.  They were using a client to distribute them,  which nobody wants.  Yeah, right, exactly.  There was a down-on-the-client.  Anyway, so Juiced is a disaster.  There are investors in Juiced.  Index Ventures, which is a very successful firm in London,  decides they're gonna be involved  in the purchase of Skype.  Skype licenses its technology from the founders  of both Skype and Juiced.  Which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can we talk about, for just a second,  I mean, how awesome is that?  That these two guys have built this technology,  ran Kazaa, runs Skype, runs Juiced.  They built one thing,  and they just make a bunch of companies on it.  And some of those companies sold for billions and billions.  And they were so brilliant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because they sold it to eBay for 3.1 billion  and kept the technology!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's brilliant!  I think eBay could rebuild the technology.  The problem is the Skype guys wanted Skype back.  That's the backstory.  That's really what they wanted.  I mean, that's, yeah.  They were rattling the cage saying, we want it back.  Then a bunch of other people came in,  Mark Andresen, Index, and these other people,  and they bought it.  Mark Andresen's on the...  So they bought it out from under Skype?  eBay sold it to Andresen and these other guys,  a consortium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of Zennstrom and Frease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Those guys don't have the money to buy it back.  What happened to the 3.1 billion?  They didn't get it.  They got a portion of it, and they had investors.  They only got a portion of it.  These other guys want it.  eBay is keeping 25% of the stock, I believe.  So they're going to take that public,  and when it goes public,  everyone's going to make a lot of money,  except for the founders.  So I think it's sort of this,  the founders are the ones getting...  Founders feel like they're getting screwed again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again?  Poor guys.  Yeah, poor guys.  They didn't get their other billion.  How many billion did they keep, though?  I mean, that really...  I'm not too...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, part of it was,  like, wasn't one and a half billion performance-based  that they didn't get.  That's the thing that happened.  They didn't get the other half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't get it at all.  So they feel they got a raw deal.  eBay feels they got a raw deal.  Now eBay's trying to save face and get money back.  This whole thing's been a debacle for them.  They haven't grown it, but I mean,  the amazing thing is Skype is so powerful  that it hasn't lost market share.  It's grown, even though it's been...  You're an unbelievable company.  You know, yeah, it hasn't been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, nobody even cares.  They just use it.  It works. It's great.  It's amazing.  We're using it right now.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So look for a Skype IPO.  I mean, I said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's gonna happen?  That's what Index was gonna do with it?  I know that's what's gonna happen.  They're gonna go public.  Oh yeah, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how they make their money.  Yes, or I mean, they could build its value

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and sell it to Google for $10.  They're just a holding company, an interim...  Skype's 18T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to resell.  I mean, I think eBay made a huge mistake  because I think the eBay business of auctions is...  That's dying.  Yeah, it's dying or it's reached its natural size.  Therefore, they have PayPal,  which is an amazingly underutilized franchise  for financial services.  And then you have Skype,  which is an amazing communication platform.  What they could have done is said, you know what?  We've got other good businesses.  Not sell, just dive.  But maybe take eBay,  cut the cost structure of eBay way down,  make it very profitable,  don't invest that much in it anymore.  It's like, it is what it is, it's utility.  And then put that money in towards PayPal  to making banking services, checking services,  advanced services on a global basis,  and communication services.  What if every Skype had a Gmail-like address?  What if every Skype had a public...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they were hoping when they bought it  that it was gonna help their sellers  because you could call up, talk about the auction.  It was a weird mismatch from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a mismatch, but they bought something.  It was like buying a car you thought was just gonna,  you wouldn't use to transport apples.  And it turns out it's like a Model T or something.  And you're like, wow, I bought this beautiful vintage car.  I mean, Skype was an amazing purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they just never really knew what to do with it.  I don't think they even understood  how important it really was.  They didn't know enough to sell it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they got most of their money back, just a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they still own 25% of it.  And they still got 25%.  Yeah, no, they'll make a profit on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't mention when we talked about Facebook,  have you guys tried the Facebook Lite?  What do you think of that?  I have.  they're gonna use at symbols.  It hasn't rolled out yet in my mind.  Pretty clear they're going after the big T.  Oh yeah, they'll take them too.  Mark Zuckerberg is the new Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think so?  He has the same...  He's getting there.  Asperger-like quality to him.  Yeah, worse.  Singular focus.  There's nothing he could talk to you about other than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but he cares a lot about that  and he's doing it right, you think?  He's doing the right thing.  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's growing tremendously.  He'll be the first person to get to a billion signups,  I think, a billion login, which is what the big race is,  who can get to a billion people.  And...  Well, he's easily gonna win that race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nobody even close, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he realized, well, Twitter could possibly,  if they got international really quick and it caught on.  So that's why people are very hopeful for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting to watch Facebook's signup growth  because it goes in clumps.  Toronto for a while, everybody was signing up there.  And you don't get that with Twitter so much.  This network effect is really clear in Facebook.  As soon as you create a Facebook account,  your friends are there and it's...  Well, because the connection is so much clearer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and your geography and all of that stuff is tighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter feels more fragmented  and I don't think it has that same kind of  viral growth pattern.  Well, when you follow people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're not adding them as a friend,  which is the strength and the weakness.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, Twitter's like a graffiti wall.  I mean, that's how I see it.  It's getting more like that, I have to say.  That's really how I treat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So will this Facebook light make it more like Twitter  or make just one more good feature of Facebook?  What is the idea here with Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Facebook light, no,  it won't make it more like Twitter.  It is Twitter-like.  That aspect.  Well, I think the ad and fan pages  are more Twitter-like than Facebook light.  They have a problem though, don't they, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're a private-facing kind of thing  and competing with a public-facing entity,  which is Twitter.  It's hard to move from private to public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's happening is you can't be both.  You can't be both.  The strength of Facebook was that it was private  and cozy with your family sharing photos.  And then they're looking over the other side  of the fence saying, wow, this public open stream.  But how do they do both?  I don't think it's gonna be successful that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that could hurt them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that they've got a little too much Twitter envy  and they should stay focused on being Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I tend to agree.  I mean, they're Facebook.  You don't wanna rule those guys out.  I mean, they are the 800-pound gorilla right now  in the social market.  And frankly, they are now the kind of de facto  identity platform of the internet.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the key.  That's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I were Twitter, I would be a little bit  freaked out right now.  But I tend to kind of agree a little bit more  on Jason's side, which is you gotta be true  to what you're doing.  You can't be everything and everybody to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook could change it.  It's one line of CSS and their Twitter.  I mean, they just need to come up with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they could also chase 250 million people away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They already weathered the storm,  switching over to the activity stream system.  That was a huge, huge shift for them.  And it caught a lot of flak from their user base.  People were not excited to have a Twitter-like activity.  So remember, the old Facebook was not like that at all.  So they've already kind of made that first step.  And that's done okay for them.  But I don't know how much further they can go  before they actually just start coming off like Twitter  and really start to disenfranchise their user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think their user base wants to use Twitter.  No.  They want to share photos.  They want to communicate with their family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think also they wanted what they like  and what Facebook was so smart about  and which they'll keep hammering home forever  is as Ry just said, is that you know  who you're dealing with on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what Facebook wants to do,  and there's real value there,  is somehow use the social graph  that they've now built and collected.  And they certainly can use this in some way.  I look at what CNN did with the election page,  which was a CNN page, by the way,  but had Facebook widgets.  You go there, you watch the election,  and it says here's what your friends  are saying about this election.  That's hugely valuable.  If they can make widgets like that  that are on other people's pages,  I would love to have that kind of thing  on my Twitter Live page.  That's valuable, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They basically own the entire conversation  around the world. Well, they just came out  with widgets. They own the conversation.  So they don't officially own it,  but they aggregate it, so therefore they own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have to worry about people?  I mean, I got a kid on the radio show say,  11 years old, my parents won't let me use Facebook.  Is it safe?  And those parents are very conscious  of the privacy aspects.  And I can say to them, no, it's okay for an 11.  I wouldn't recommend it because you've got to be 13,  but it's okay because nobody can see your profile.  Not anymore.  Marketers, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unless you have to just know how to set it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, by default, isn't it safe by default?  I don't know.  I think it's private by default.  It's private by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to open it up.  Yeah, the trend had their cake in you, too.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a mistake.  That is difficult to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an internal distraction.  The things that are working really well for them,  photo sharing, video, the games.  They're the world's biggest photo sharing site

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  by order of magnitude.  And they're catching up to YouTube on video, even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and they'll launch a search engine.  That's what's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and look, those are things that Twitter can't do.  There are things that Twitter won't do.  And those things that, if they invest there,  they have a really, really great opportunity  in front of them.  But of course, on the other side,  all these photos, all these videos, they're not public.  They don't show up in Google.  It's not exactly benefiting them and the public web  to have all of this content under lockdown.  So it goes both ways.  But look, they have a technology base.  They have the end user content system  that Twitter doesn't have and may never actually have.  Twitter, at the end of the day,  I think they're gonna really focus on that 140 characters.  And if that's all they're gonna do,  then Facebook has a lot going for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we gotta wrap it up.  We've been going on and on and on.  It's been a very long show.  In fact, I've had to actually start breaking out  to see rations for my poor,  oh, sorry, faint and fading away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By see rations, you mean chocolate.  Ghirardelli chocolate, yeah.  That's close enough.  Oh, that's so awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll keep you going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is good, isn't it?  That's just Ghirardelli.  We got us hit up for a hot chocolate over there later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the cannolis.  Mm, cannoli.  Leave the gun, take the cannoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know that was ad libbed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  Isn't that great?  I've never seen the same show you saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I saw it on the DVD extras.  There's a really great Godfather one, two, and three,  and Coppola does the narration of Godfather one,  which is really nice, and he says,  you know, I can't remember the actor's name.  Oh, it's driving me.  Jerome Rither.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  He said, you know, he made that up on the spot.  Leave the gun, take the cannoli.  The best lines are always like that.  It's a great line.  Yeah. I love it.  Classic.  All right, we're gonna wrap this up,  but I wanna bring in Jamie,  because he paid a lot of money to be on this show,  and now he's thinking, boy, I made a big mistake.  That's okay, we're gonna,  This is, we're gonna clean it up.  We're gonna clean it up.  So Jamie is with phone tag.com.  I do wanna mention phone tag.  The way this came up is at Trestable,  which was almost a year ago,  which was all about raising money for a charity,  a wonderful charity called Charity Water.  And one of the things, I think this was your idea, Jason,  we were on Twitter at the time,  and you said, why don't we put up for sale an ad on Twit?  I'll do the ad, and we'll see how much money we can make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it was my idea or somebody emailed me.  I think somebody was sending it out.  It was a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was an inspired idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It was your idea.  It was?  Yeah.  Jamie was, I remember listening.  You were listening.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was.  So Jamie put up 10 grand.  High society.  Built, the high society, built two wells,  and that's how it works at Charity Water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all built it.  With James' money.  So tell us quickly about PhoneTag,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because what Jamie said,  and I thought this was very classy,  is don't do an ad for PhoneTag.  Let's just talk about Charity Water.  But just do, let's get a little plug for PhoneTag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'll take a little plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PhoneTag.com, what is it?  Do you use this, Jason?  You've been using this for a long time.  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very simple.  You forward your number to PhoneTag.  They transcribe the voicemail and put an MP3 on it.  You can use any phone you want.  So it's independent of your phone carrier, which I like,  because I don't want to learn their phone system.  I don't want anything to do with it.  I want all of my messages transcribed.  That's very important to me.  So they get transcribed somewhere in another country  within a minute, maybe, of the phone call going through,  and I have the MP3 file so I can listen to the original,  and if they can't hear on the phone,  like what exactly is going on in the transcript,  they say, you know, inaudible, you know, for the word,  but then I can forward it to somebody.  Or I can hit reply,  put the person who left me the voicemail as the two,  and they see the transcript of what they said,  voicemail, so it's just genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Google Voice, and it does this,  but the transcripts are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a real human being doing it.  See, I think that makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're actually accurate transcripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect, and people spell their names and the numbers,  and then the number is in my emails.  If I call them back, I have it there permanently,  and then I have a permanent record  of every phone call I get.  So I don't pick up my phone unless I know who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You basically don't, you now use your cell phone number  as almost a messaging service rather than that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's cheap, and it's like,  I have the history of my entire phone.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I can get it as an email or a text, or both, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get it as an email,  because I like to have it saved for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jamie Siminoff is with us, actually, he's in studio.  Thank you, Jamie, for your fine donation.  We appreciate it.  Well, thank you.  It's really nice.  And things are going well at PhoneTag.  They are.  I heard you just made a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A small $17 million deal with Ditech, a public company.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only 10,000, how about 20?  You donate some money to a good cause,  the karma's good, and things happen.  Things are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's great that you did this cause,  but we have to talk a little bit about  this week in tax sponsorship.  But anyway, I'll talk about that after.  PhoneTag, no, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PhoneTag.com slash twit.  Oh, is there a deal?  Yeah, sure.  They're gonna give you 30 days free,  because that's how we do it.  It says seven days on there,  but my program-  You didn't fix it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, Mark couldn't fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark.  Holy cow.  Mark's in the studio.  Mark's been on camera by,  Mark and Leah, I think,  have been on camera the whole time in this show,  because they've been right behind Lauren Feldman,  which is gonna be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They look like they've been appalled the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like, oh my God, what did we spend $10,000 on?  This is a disaster.  It's a really great cause.  Jamie made a great decision on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, really, nice job, Jamie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the deal is you get 30 days free,  and you can see how this works.  It works with anything, right?  Are there any phones that won't wear any carriers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Every carrier, landline, business line, mobile phone.  That's cool too, you can use it with multiple numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's the great part about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's the opposite of Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You forward all of your numbers to one place,  and all your voicemail goes to the same mailbox  or the same text message,  so you see everything that anybody leaves you from anywhere.  Exactly.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the killer feature,  if you give them your address book, right?  This is the killer feature.  You give them your address book.  If it sees that the caller ID is leolaport,  it puts you as the reply to.  So if I hit reply, you're the reply.  Okay, I'm signing up.  It really changed.  It's pretty dumb, pretty dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all conversation into email, yeah.  If you're a person who hates the phone  and loves email, like me.  And me.  And anybody.  This is the perfect thing,  because it takes everybody who wants to talk to me  on the phone, and I hate talking to people,  and sends them, you know I'll have to talk on the phone  or poker table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NYC listener says, give them another plug  next week when the show is better.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I'll give you a plug next week  when the show is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I get kicked off the show because of you.  We, actually, we need you to be you, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We really wanted to get the charity water plug though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do the charity water plug.  So tell me about charity water, Jamie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So for $5,000, well, I mean,  obviously you don't have to give $5,000.  No, no, no.  Every $5,000 that you give the charity water,  100% of that money goes to building a well,  and each well helps over 250 people.  And clean water is really the foundation  of fixing sort of the problems in poor places like Africa,  because with that dirty water, kids can't go to school.  You have to go, all the sort of problems and unrest  sort of come around water.  And this guy, Scott Harrison, who started charity water,  he's probably one of the great entrepreneurs out there.  And you should, more than signing up for us though,  please do, you should really donate something  to charity water today, $2, $5, 100% of it  goes to building a well,  and it really makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a neat idea that they have other donors  who cover their office expenses and his salary and stuff.  So every penny that you give to charity water  goes to building a well,  goes to helping people around the world get water.  So these kids aren't missing their whole,  there's kids who spend all day getting water,  bringing it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And the water makes them sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not even good water.  Charity, I mean, this is really important,  charitywater.org.  And they have a new thing they're doing,  because he started this on his birthday.  In fact, I'll play a video a little later on,  but he started this on his birthday.  Now they have a, they're asking other people  who are born in September to go to borninseptember.org  and have, see, he started by asking people,  instead of giving me gifts, give me some money,  and we'll build a well.  And now he's asking others to do the same.  I think that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I said give me an ad and I'll build a well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  Well, you did, you built two wells.  Thank you very much, Jamie.  I really appreciate it.  Congratulations on the success of PhoneTag.  Everybody should try it, phonetag.com slash twit.  And then you should go to charitywater.org.  And the money you're saving on your first month free,  you can just donate to charitywater.org.  How about that?  How about that?  Hey, thank you.  You can stay there, Jamie.  That's all right, we're done with Lauren.  What are we gonna do with Lauren?  We don't want anymore Lauren.

And they're like, oh yeah, this is the processor  in the original MacBook Air with the SSD is just terrible.  The new one solves it.  And I was like, oh great.  I spent three grand on a laptop that can't play video.
