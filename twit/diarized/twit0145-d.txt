This Week in  Tech is brought to you by Audible.com. For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash Twit.  And by listeners like you. Thanks for your donations.  It's time for Twit, ladies and gentlemen, in a very big shoe today. It's a Revision,  all Revision 3 show. I'm Leo Laporte. And joining us for the first time ever, I don't know how,  in 145 episodes. We've never had him on the show. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jim Louterback,  the CEO of Revision 3. It's great to be, I am, I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.  It's awesome. Oh, I, I, I, I apologize profusely for never getting you on. I don't know how,  I, I, I don't know what happened, but anyway, I think because you're a CEO,  I don't want to have a CEO on the show. I was just living vicariously through Patrick's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  experiences. Well, what's the excuse for never having me on the show then, Leo? Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a CEO. Is that Martin's, how do you get into my system? Martin's Sergeant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, was Carmine Gallo unavailable this weekend so you called me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's it. Marty is the, is one of the stars of Revision 3, Revision3.com of  Internet Superstar. Do you still do Web Drifter? Is that in hiatus? Web Drifter is on hiatus right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now. We're going to start Web Drifting again in the fall. Love everyone in, that's actually my  favorite show I've ever done. Revision3.com slash Web Drifter. Travel around the country, go behind  the website of the craziest websites out there. I guess you can't do that all the time because it  takes a lot of travel. It is. It's really intensive, but it's super fun. Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute, Carmine Gallo is on Skype here. Wait, oh no, I'm sorry. That must have been a  wrong number. I do know how to get in touch with Carmine Gallo if you'd like him on. I think we  all do. He's in my shed right now. Also here, another star from Revision3, Mr. Patrick Norton  of Tekzilla and System fame. Hey Patrick. Hey Leo. And an original twit going back to day one. By  the way, I want to correct you Marty, you have been on twit before. You know you have. I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I don't think it really counted. It counted. I showed up at the podcast expo and I said my  piece for about 20 seconds, which is probably one more time than I'll get in this conversation too.  But it was fun. We did it. It was a huge panel down at the podcast. And I came the wrong week,  remember? I showed up a week before and I'm in the parking lot and it's completely empty.  Down in Ontario? Yeah. How excited I was to be on Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You drove all the way from LA to Ontario and there's nobody there. I felt for you, Marty. I  really did. No, you know, the reason I haven't invited you per se, and I guess it's somewhat  true of Jim, is I try to kind of, it's mostly working press kind of, you know, it's tech news  stuff. And by the way, and I get lazy and you know, it's devorac, devorac, devorac. So John  couldn't make it this week. I thought, what the heck? Now in the chat room, by the way, and if  you've not watched or twit live before, we do this live now at twitlive.tv and we have two chat rooms.  We have a stick am chat room, which is full of people. It's 500 people in there. And we also  have a chat room at irc.dslextreme.com. There is room there. That chat room is pound tech live.  And you can join us there. And Exarion's in that chat room. He says, wait a minute. It's not an  all revision three show. You're not revision three, Leo. And I guess that's true. So coming over.  You will be someday. We'd like to make an announcement. No, I'm not going to make an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  announcement. You know what I was reading? Go ahead. I get a favor to ask for you and Marty.  Yes. I've gotten like 125 emails asking about quote, the feud. It worked, Marty. Now I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're on the internet superstar. It worked, Marty. It all started. There's never been a,  I'm going to tell you right now, there's never been a feud between me and Marty. In fact,  I adore Marty. I think you know that, Marty. Yes, Leo. And maybe a little, maybe a little,  too much. But the, what happened is on Twitter, I made a joke and it's a bad old joke I've made  many times about a restraining order. And I thought, God, everybody's going to know that's  a joke. Except Marty sends me an email saying, what did you do? Put seagull poop in my food at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the ramp? What did you do? I have no idea what you're talking about. All of a sudden I start  getting all these emails, all these message board posts, things about some awful incident that  happened at the ramp, which caused you to never speak with me again. I put a restraining order  on you. I didn't know what was going on. It was a joke. I took it really personally. I thought  that you and I were always BFFs. Absolutely BFFs. And now we are again, and I'm really looking  forward to our cottage that we're going to share up in Mendocino next week. And I'm glad that we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  back together. Twin beds are double. Oh, I'm sorry. Already I could see Patrick turning red.  Bear skin rug in front of the fire. By the way, guys, if you just had a bad acid flashback,  especially you, Jim, I said Tech Live. I meant pound twit live. Please. I was going to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something about that, Leo. And I was like, boy, you're taking an old name. Please do not confuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the two. If you call it Tech Live, I'm going to have to fire everybody. Tell me if this is true,  Jim. Tech Live was really the beginning of the end of Tech TV. I mean, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From my potential. So what happened is so Paul Allen bought us world's worst investor.  And Paul thinks everybody in the world is just like him. So he did that thing. Remember the Voodoo  PC, it was a little handheld PC that ran Vista that cost like $3,000. Well, he was competing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with OQO. He wanted to do an OQO. No, he wanted one for himself and rather than building three,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he built a whole company. He only sold three to himself. The same thing with ZDTV. Tech TV said,  I want 10 hours a day of tech and financial information on my TV. So I have something to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  watch during the day when I'm in the office, because obviously I had nothing else to do.  So he funded that. And then when he decided he lost interest and...  Here's the amazing thing. Greg Drebben, our vice president of programming at the time,  told me this much later. He said, of course, we spent a million dollars to get Tech Live running,  which was kind of the kiss of death. The idea was to do a nine hour news block with a staff that had  never done anything more than Sunrise Semester. And they spent, I think, was it, am I wrong? Jim,  but didn't it spend a million dollars on that set? Close to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-huh. We spent a lot of money on the set. I think I must have hired 120, 130 people.  Include Carolyn.  Greg was like, yeah, you want to run it? I'm like, yeah, okay. I've never done anything like this  before, but I'm sure going to learn a lot. Nobody had done anything like that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that if it wasn't for Tech Live, Tech TV would still be around?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what the thing about Tech Live though, as Martin, is it was a distraction. When you do  anything, there's the opportunity cost of not doing something else. The fact that we didn't do,  let's take Leo and put Leo on for eight hours, that would have been it.  Well, guess what I'm doing right now?  Isn't that the funny thing is what comes around. Anyway, I'm having dinner with Greg in New York  City. Who was the other guy? Ed Badawano. Ed Badawano.  Ed Capuano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Capuano.  Capuano.  Capuano.  Capuano.  Love it.  Who is now, by the way, working in Seattle for Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw that. That cracks me up. But he's there as a consultant, I'm sure.  No, he's an employee.  No.  And he's in the creative side, helping the whole Zoom thing grow up. Yes, and he loves it.  Well, no wonder it looks like an acid trip. So Ed Capuano and Greg Drebben and I are in New York  City at one of these Argentinian sword restaurants. What do they call them? Chairo Scuro?  Yeah.  They skewer the meat and they bring meat on a sword to your table. And we're eating there a  lot of meat, big time meat. And Drebben says, get this, one week into Tech Live,  Paul Allen calls me and says cancel it. One week in, he spent millions of dollars,  hired a hundred people, brought people out from the East Coast, promised them, you know,  lifetime jobs virtually. One week in, Paul Allen says, you know, I don't like it.  So Drebben, now, of course, remember, Greg may have been inflating his role here,  but he said, no, I talked him down. I said, please give us a few months. But that's basically all.  How long did Tech Live last?  Nine months, 10 months. Yeah.  They should have canceled it after the first week.  Maybe Paul Allen was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, it ended up being, when you looked at the financials for that year, it ended up being,  not counting the stuff that was hidden in some of the other operating and studio expenses,  about a $70 million.  You're kidding, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Was our run rate 50 to 100 million a year, something like that?  Yeah, it was. One of the things that was so expensive about Tech Live, remember,  we set up a studio in Seattle, a studio in New York.  Oh, that's right.  We had fiber lines.  We had Stacy, we had people all over the country. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had fiber lines connecting them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus all the incredible monthly expenses for the NASDAQ,  like the NASDAQ big board access and all that stuff.  You know what's so-  It was literally, Leo, when you looked at it, there was a pig in the snake around  all of the expenses. If you looked at it, if the financials across four years were a snake,  there was a giant pig in the snake that year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The irony is, here I am sitting in this studio that I put together for just a few thousand dollars,  streaming live for free over the internet, using Skype to do exactly those same kind  of satellite things. And in fact, it works just as well.  And you know, I hate to say it, but even with 5,000 people, I may have a bigger audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And probably about the same amount of revenue.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although the fiber itself is expensive, but you know what? It is very reliable.  Remember when they made, you know, they turned silicon spin into Charlie Rhodes  and John Dvorak had to interview everybody over the satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This cracked me up. Yeah, everything was satellite.  Except that, if somebody wasn't on the satellite, they put them on a stool in the corner.  It was the same studio. John could see them. They were sitting on a stool with a separate  camera and background to make it look like, and then they wouldn't show the two of them together.  They put them in a picture in picture. So it's like, yeah, via satellite from the other side of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the room. Hey, man, it's all about maintaining the magic. Don't don't be giving away those secrets.  I know. Well, there's a statute. You're going to be using those secrets in your studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You would all admit to it. In fact, you know, it'd be really fun to have a picture in picture  of a guy on a stool and then cut to the guy in the stool. Just pay up to him.  Just walk over and say, wait a minute. No, something's wrong.  I might do that. Anyway, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to turn this into a  reminiscing show, but I couldn't help it. I really couldn't help it. This is it's so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fun to get you guys on. I didn't see any of you guys at the Tech TV 10 year reunion last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, tell us about that because May 11th, 1998 was when we launched.  I think was it Dave Chung who got this thing together? Yeah, of course it was Dave Chung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course it was Dave Chung. Dave Chung really misses those Tech TV days quite a bit, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he got a lot of free tequila from me. Hey, man, it was fun. Remember the Parkside where we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  used to go? Yeah. We had it over at the Parkside. Did the Tamale Lady come by? Tamale Lady was not  there, unfortunately. But there's about 50 people there. Saw some old friends. So yeah, it was kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of nice. I'm sorry I missed that. I was doing the show. I couldn't, but... I got to say I didn't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know about it. You must not have wanted me there. You're not on the mailing list? You got to be on  the mailing list, Jim. I don't even know what the mailing list is. No one invited me to the mailing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  list. Chris Perillos. You have been on the mailing list and actually, I actually... Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll count that for the final time for the on that one. Say again? It was on my Ziff Davis email. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sorry. You're right. Yeah, I tried to get you on the show and you said I don't ever look at that email.  Oh, it's on your Ziff Davis email. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. So how long have you now been at Revision 3,  Jim? Almost a year. Really? Wow. And so your title there is CEO. That means you're the big hauncho.  Yeah, I have a board that I have to report to, but yeah. And does Kevin Rose ever come over and say,  Jim, this Tech Live thing is not going to work. I think we should fire everybody. After a week.  No, Kevin's on the board. So Kevin's pretty involved in helping us think about programming  and what we do and what we don't do. His portfolio has more dig though, right? I mean, he's... Yeah.  I mean, he and Jay, Jay Adelson, who both started Revision 3, are definitely... They're very much on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dig because you think about dig, dig something like 26, 27 million unique visitors a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's insane. That's amazing. That's out of control. Yeah. Yeah. No, obviously, they feel like  that's... They're knitting. They got to stick to that, but I think... I know Jay very much believes  in IPTV and believes the future and maybe the real future of the company is Revision 3.  I'd keep that, absolutely. Yeah. So does Jay come over and tell you what to do sometimes?  Yeah. Well, Jay is chairman of the board. So he definitely is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny. You think CEO... Oh yeah. CEO, you can do whatever you want. No, you've got this board of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  five people who beat you up every month. Plus, Jay lives in New York. Oh, really? Yeah. He kept  coming out here. He wasn't out here about once a month, Jim. Oh, I thought he was out more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's out here two weeks a month. Martin's in his shed. He doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Martin misses all the visits from the big weeks. Who else is on the board, Jim?  It's two of the guys from Greylock, David Z and James Slavitt. Greylock put $8 million of venture  funding into the company. And what are you doing with all that money? Spending it on Martin's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  salary, Patrick's, building a studio. We all went into the shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing it to expand beyond... Basically, that's a flip answer, but basically to expand  beyond Dignation and a couple of the other shows that we had when the money came in.  So Dignation is revision three and it's currently the big show on revision three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's not really true. Dignation, if you look at number of videos delivered per month,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tekzilla, Patrick's show, Patrick and Veronica has surpassed Dignation.  Congratulations. Thank you. That's awesome, Pat. I'm not surprised. That's fantastic. I'm really glad  to hear that. Where's Internet Superstar fall into that, Jim? Internet Superstar is among a  couple of shows that we've launched that are our rising stars. So what we're doing with those shows...  Rising stars. I like that. Building an audience for them. I got an MBA, so I'll do some boring  financial stuff. It's portfolio analysis. You have your shows that are really big and that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  drawing a real big audience. And then you have your shows that have great potential and you  watch them and nurture them. And at some point they either break through and become really big  or you say, well, maybe this isn't working. Let's think about reworking this or trying something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  different. I've never been able to cancel a single show. See, that's my problem. They're all my babies.  You got to eat your dead. I can't, don't I? But no, like Martin's show Web Drifter was huge. But  again, like you said, you can't do it every week. So that's why it makes a lot of sense to bring it  back in the fall for a second running. Right. Right. So let's start talking now about the big  story of the week, which is frankly about Revision 3. And it was the amazing story of the denial of  service attack. And I first became aware of this, Patrick, when you tweeted on Twitter,  help, we need a network expert. We're being DDoSed.  Is that what I said? Something like that. I'll have to go back and look at the archives. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was something like that, wasn't it? No, we were looking for somebody at a specific  DNS routing facility to see if anybody happened to have a contact there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this must have been very early on before you had any idea what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Roger Chang couldn't log into, we couldn't access a bunch of services.  And Roger emailed me about that on my personal account. So I had the home addresses for a couple  of the people and emailed them. And it went from, oh, that's weird to, oh, something seems to be weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with our DNS to, oh, my God. Right. I have it actually right here. I'll put it up for you so  you can see it. It says, Revision 3 is under a major DDoS attack. Repost for Jeff Rizzo. Anyone  knows something at UnitedLayer whose ass I can kick into helping us out. That's the exact phrase.  Yeah, I mean, so it started happening on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, which,  everybody was gone.  It always is that way. So it was a week ago. It was last Saturday.  Last Saturday.  And what was happening?  So there are a certain type of packet called a SYN packet. When one machine on the internet wants  to connect to another, they send this short little message and send SYN out. And the other machine  that you're trying to contact sends an ACK back and acknowledge back. And if that connection  happens and they open up a connection and they communicate and send bigger packets with more  information, there were a bunch of computers out there on the net that were just flooding us with  these SYN packets and we were getting about 8,000 an hour. It wasn't a huge amount of bandwidth, but  our network infrastructure just was unable to deal with 8,000 of those an hour.  That's enough. 8,000, not a minute. Now I had seen 8,000 a minute. So it was 8,000 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, a second. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A second. Yeah, okay. I was going to say 8,000 an hour. That's not too bad.  No, 8,000 a second. Sorry.  So this is a traditional SYN flood. It's exactly what brought down Yahoo five, six years ago.  Normally what you would do if it's coming from the same IP address is block it. So  obviously this was coming from a variety of IP addresses.  Yeah, there are a wide range of different IP addresses, but as it turns out,  we track them all back to a single company.  Now tell us about that.  So we tracked it back to this company, Artist Direct, and so we knew that they were coming  from there. We knew what...  All of them were coming from the same company.  Well, about 90%. So about 7,000 a second. And we knew that their ISP was. So we tried to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these guys on the phone, but it was a Memorial Day weekend and nobody called us back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You say in your article, which by the way, I highly recommend people read this. It  was on the Revision 3 blog. You say that in effect, this company not only didn't hide,  as you would normally hide it with a DDoS attack, they didn't hide the source. They  announced it. They said, hey, look at us. We're attacking you.  Well, yeah, they didn't spoof the... Usually you spoof the IP address that it comes from.  You don't want people to know. Or you have some shadowy IP address from Romania or something.  But these guys, you just looked it up and it was right there on the table and it was Artist Direct.  Well, who's behind Artist Direct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So by the time we eventually got to their ISP, we found out that the machines were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a division of Artist Direct called Media Defender. And this is where the plot thickens,  as they say, because Media Defender, their job is to... They work with large copyright holders

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like the Warner Brothers and people who do movies. And what they do is they protect their  copyrights basically on torrent-based networks by... Well, they're basically creating spoof files.  So imagine you've got the Indiana Jones movie, right? And then somebody creates a torrent of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it's out there. They'll create a thousand versions of the Indiana Jones movie and put them  and see them through the torrent network, but they're all just full of garbage.  So in effect, you're trying to get Indiana Jones, what you get is a seed that's worthless.  Right, exactly. It's kind of looking for the needle in the haystack at that point. And so  their job is to use these aggressive means to promote copyright holders. And one of the tricks  in their arsenal, as I found when I did some research, I was looking at a story from Ars  Technica, was that they also include denial of service attacks as one of the weapons in their  cache of weapons that they go after people who are violating copyrights.  They say on their webpage, we use a range of non-invasive technological countermeasures  like decoy and spoofing. They have a leak alert service. They don't mention the fact that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  might be doing DOS attacks. Yeah. I mean, that was in the Ars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Technica story. There was another group that really got mad at them at one point and tried  to shut them down or do something. And apparently they put a denial of service attack out against  them too. So these sort of SYNFLA denial of service attacks are not unknown by this company.  So here's what happened was we had a torrent tracker. A torrent tracker is basically a way  to figure out who's got copies of torrent files and how you kind of find your torrent file out  there in the ecosystem. We post all of our shows via BitTorrent. We have been since Kevin started  the company with System back in 2005. I remember that. We used to do that too.  Yeah, exactly. And we've been doing it for a long time. They apparently have been using our tracker  off and on when it's been available to put their spoofs out. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.  So they have to use people's BitTorrent trackers to do the spoofing. And you're saying they used

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yours? They don't have to. They take advantage of open tracking system. Whoa. They don't have to.  And I'm certain they host their own tracking systems to basically... Yeah, but if people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  start to say, oh, well, hey, if it comes from these IP addresses, it's Media Defender, ignore it.  Right. They need to use other open tracking systems. I can see that.  Exactly. So our tracker, and I look back into this, our real network head guy started in April of 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And from April 2006 to April 2007, our tracker server had a whitelist. Basically, it wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  respond unless you were asking for one of our shows. It had the file hash that was one of the  hashes that it knew about. But the server had been crashing all over the place. So we moved over to  another... We were using the BitTorrent server written in Python. It basically couldn't handle  whitelists over about a thousand or so shows. We got that many and more. So we moved over to  another piece of software. And to try and see if it would be stable, we left it open. So we did not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have a... So that was for about five weeks. So what that meant is that since we'd had a tracker for a  long time, the name of our tracker was out there. And as people created Torrents over time, it became

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one of the 40 or so that you can put into a Torrent file. And a lot of people used it,  even though it wasn't responding. It was on that list of Torrent trackers at one point that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  could use. So once we opened it back up again, our index started really... And unknown to us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  our index started growing and we had lots and lots of Torrents that we were tracking.  Not just from Media Defender, but from a lot of other people, I would imagine.  Lots of other people too. Yeah. And this is like a search engine. So basically we were tracking...  You didn't have bad stuff on there, but just like Pirate Bay, we would have had links to Torrents.  We were linking to things and showing where you could find it and what PCs were hosting it  and things like that. So presumably this is something if you had known about it,  you wouldn't have wanted to have one. Yeah. Yeah. It's certainly not something that we as a company

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would want to do. And it turns out a guy in our forums noticed it and put a forum message up and  said, guys, did you know that your tracker's open now? And my CTO was on vacation for two weeks in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Italy. When was that that he said that? It was sometime like two weeks ago or a week and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Recently. Okay. No, no. We opened it up the first week of April and it was probably sometime in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mid-May. So the minute that my CTO got back, the next day, which was the Saturday of Memorial Day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  weekend, we put the whitelist back in effect. Right after we put that whitelist in, we started  getting the SYN flood. And we thought it was a bunch of rogue torrent folks from some shadowy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eastern European countries. They were like, you know, something's pissed at us. Turns out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no, it was this legit business media defender that... And I think they just couldn't conceive  the fact that somebody would use BitTorrent for legitimate reasons. And the minute that we shut

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ourselves down to them, as far as I can tell, it appears they just flooded us with SYN packets.  Now they claimed that you had 296,000 illegal, what do they call them? Seeds. You weren't  holding the files, but you had the meta files for those. Well, we had that. What the tracker does  is it tracks which computers actually hold pieces of that file. So, and over time, you know, since  we've been running a torrent tracker since I'm sure 2005 or 2006, I'm sure it was open for a long  time. It doesn't take long to fill it up with that. So you don't contest that? Well, I mean,  I don't know, probably not. I mean, the thing about it is though, a torrent file. So the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  torrents work is you have a torrent file, the dot torrent contains the hash file of the hash,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the unique identifier of it. And then it contains a list of tracking servers, up to 40 tracking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  servers. When you create a torrent, you can actually put anything in there you want. Like,  I could put, you know, I could put tracker dot twit dot tv in there if I wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That's why I don't run bit torrent trackers anymore, by the way.  But you could put, you know, tracker dot white house dot gov if you wanted to.  Some of the software will actually go out and check and see if the tracker's online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both of them will include a list of ones that were known at one point. So I fully think, and you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just conjecturing at this point, because prior to April of 2006, it was basically three  guys in an apartment in LA and nobody really remembers anything. Because they were...  Exercise to the listener, but... They literally don't remember anything.  So, Martin, you were probably there once in a while too. I was there. I stopped by for a couple  of parties. Yeah. I don't remember. I might have. I don't remember. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this should happen to us like once a month. We've gotten a tremendous amount of press

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  out of it. It's been very good for us. Yeah. So media defender says, hey, these guys have illegal  torrent files on... Not again, as you said, Jim, not the file itself, but just the metadata,  the torrent dot torrent file, just like Pirate Bay. And... No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You didn't have those? You were just tracking where they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were just maintaining an index of IP addresses and other locations on the net.  Oh, so you didn't have any torrent files on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. We had no torrents. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was just... The torrents live in one place. So for example, when you want to download a  Revision 3 program on BitTorrent, you go to revision3.com, you go to Tekzilla, you see the  beautiful face of Patrick and Veronica. Over on the right is an ability for you to download the  dot torrent file. You download that off of our basically... I think it's off of our web server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're small. They're tiny files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little things. You download that, you put it into your torrent program, whether it's  Cesarius or whatever, and it says, oh, you want Tekzilla episode 134. Well, here's the unique ID,  and here's a list of trackers that I can go to. The number one, and maybe the only one when we

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  create it, I don't know exactly how we created it, is tracker.revision3.com. So it sends the hash  to tracker.revision3.com. Tracker.revision3.com says, I know about that file. I know that this  location has it, which is probably our CDN. I know that viewer A, B, C, D, D, D, D, D,  all these different viewers have it. And at that point, Asurius will go out to all those and say,  are you guys up? Are you awake? Can I have pieces of the file? Let's put it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a probably somewhat imperfect view of how it works. But we just ran the tracking server

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that would track where all these little pieces of things were stored, much like on a search engine  when you go into a search engine and search for Leo Laporte, Google cache and stuff, and Leo Laporte,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then they'll give you all those links where you can keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but what was happening with your tracker, was that any different than what Pirate Bay does?  Pirate Bay says, we don't carry any files. We just point to where the torrents live.  Well, Pirate Bay will let you download the torrents from them as well as the...  They host torrents. And you say, because you're not hosting the torrents, it's a different thing.  Well, even if you hosted the torrents, the torrents aren't the actual files.  Well, that's what Pirate Bay's defense is. It hasn't worked for them, unfortunately.  Yeah, but in our case, it...  The reason this is relevant is because this is what Media Defender is saying is,  hey, look, we weren't attacking Revision 3, but they're tracking a bunch of copyrighted movies.  So we had a tracker up for five weeks that I'm sure built up a big index of lots of different  files and stuff out there because people found out it was open and started using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of things though. First of all, if Media Defender knew that it was open,  rather than using it to inject their fake torrents into the ecosystem,  why didn't they pick up the phone call and say, hey, you guys, your tracker's open and  it's probably not a good idea because of this, this, and this. And you're tracking some copyrighted  stuff and people are paying us to protect it. Could you please lock it down or shut it down?  And we would have been, just like when somebody posted to our forum a message that said that same  thing, we would have quickly sprung into action and put our whitelist into place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they would have been doing you a favor. They said your tracker had been open for years,  though. This is according to Randy Saff, who's the CEO of Media Defender.  And this is getting back to, I think we probably had an open tracker up until April of 2006,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and nobody knows. But from April 2006 till April 2007, we had a whitelist in place. We were only

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tracking our own shows and that's why it crashed every week.  Right. Right. So Randy Saff said, we saw an open BitTorrent tracker with a lot of pirated  content on it. We'd been posting fake files to their tracker. They changed their configuration  of a Memorial Day and that triggered the SIN flood. What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shut them out. We put our white, we re-implemented our whitelist five weeks later,  which basically said, me, tracker.revision3.com will only respond when somebody sends me a hash  file, a unique identifier for a Revision 3 show that's basically on this white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did the right thing.  Right. We did the right thing and we got punished for it.  Was this an automatic thing from Media Defender? I mean, is this their servers doing some automatic?  I think so.  Autonomic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The minute we told them, when we finally got in touch with them Tuesday morning,  three days later, they were like, oh, and they basically shut it down in about an hour and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So you're going to sue them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. That's what Steve Gilmore asked me that on email and Steve's like,  you should sue them. We're a little company and when you get into a lawsuit like that,  it takes a lot of time, a lot of energy. I think our losses could probably be calculated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the tens of thousands, maybe a hundred thousand, but I might send them an invoice though.  That's not a bad idea. So what was the loss to you? Where did the losses come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it came from, so our biggest shows, Tekzilla and Dignation, launched on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Starting about midday Saturday, our viewers were unable to download them.  That's not good.  Our website wasn't available. We do about 4 million page views a month. So that's about  400,000 page views, figure 10% of the month that was down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we weren't able to serve our shows and our advertising and  the, and you know, and there's some goodwill there too, but I think we've kind of gotten over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It ruined my weekend. All I wanted to do was watch Patrick on Tekzilla all Memorial Day weekend.  And then this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shut the hell. What'd you do instead, Martin? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watched some old screensavers tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. That's almost as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jim, what's going on with the FBI involvement now? Are they past this now? Are they still  investigating? Can you talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, basically we, one of the, you know, we work with a couple of different  networking companies, you know, United Lair is our, is our ASP and somebody contacted the FBI

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on our behalf and the FBI sounded like they were interested and said, okay, here's what you do.  If you want to pursue it, you know, go here, fill out, you know, just make a claim and put it in.  So I did that. I got a call back from the FBI and they said they'd look into it.  You know, we'll see what happens.  Is it illegal?  What's that?  Is what they're doing illegal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's illegal, but it's certainly immoral. I mean, don't shoot first and ask  questions later. Give me a call. If it's a problem, tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure Leo, if I did it to say, you know, in the name of giant company here,  it would be illegal and my ass would be in jail.  There you go. There you go. Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you were the high school dropouts that took over Comcast for a couple of hours,  would you go to jail?  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think this is, they DDoS'd you.  Yes, they did.  Some debate over what we call it a DDoS attack or a DDoS attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because Media Defender runs thousands of servers or hundreds of servers.  It might as well be DDoS.  It's definitely a distributed denial of service attack because they just did across multiple  machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. If it had been from one IP address, you just would have turned it off.  Right. Exactly.  I think it's illegal. I think that that is a denial of service attack. I don't see how  you could say it's not illegal. And I think if the FBI says, hey, Mr. Lattaback, you want  to press charges?  Well, I will say yes.  Hell yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Figured out. Here's the thing. I just think that we're in the business of providing  information and entertainment. If people can't get Marty or Patrick over the Memorial Day weekend,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's not life or death, except maybe to them.  What if this was a hospital or what if it was an airport that was using BitTorch to distribute  high bandwidth versions of the approach path?  People couldn't get access to it. The entire airport or hospital was brought down because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  somebody set up a bit flip that it would do a SYN flood if something happened. That I think is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, here's a question.  Is what you were doing, is running an open BitTorrent tracker, is that illegal in any way?  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically, I mean, was it, should we have left it up like in that state for five weeks?  You know what? Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could claim that that's negligent or dumb, but it's not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not illegal. Once we were told by one of our people on the forum, we shut it down.  These guys came after us because we shut it. It was like,  well, if you won't let us play on your tracker server, we're just going to take you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the real story. The record companies in this country, the motion picture countries  this country are completely out of control, but because they give Congress so much money,  they're never going to get called on the carpet for this kind of thing. And it's appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other thing I think that the other side of it is, is this is another one of the battles

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  between new media and old media that we're seeing play out. Old media-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it's because you're new media?  Listen, hear me out. Old media can't imagine that somebody would use something like BitTorrent to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  give access to video files that they own.  You couldn't possibly have been using this legitimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Old media is all about walled gardens and controlled access and DRM and we own the  experience. We own, own, own, own you. And we're all about what the viewers of today want is they  want to control the entire experience. They want to watch it anywhere, anytime, any device,  any service. And that is completely anathema to any old media company. And these guys,  who are basically in the pocket of old media companies, can't imagine that somebody would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  use BitTorrent for a legitimate purpose. If they're using BitTorrent, they're a criminal.  Right, right. I think you're exactly right. And it's not that they don't like it that you're  new media. I mean, they don't feel threatened by new media in the least,  but it's just that they don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's the culture clash. It's two trains running into each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think about the writer's strike is an example of this. This is, I think the upcoming,  you know, there's a sag strike that may well happen by the end of June or end of July.  The Screen Actors Guild over the same things that the writer's strike.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under this battle between the old way of doing business and the new way. And we talked about  this at the beginning. I mean, Leo, right now you're running a media empire that is  bigger than tech TV ever was.  Out of my closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Out of your closet. We did with millions and millions.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which part? The closet or tech TV?  Leo's bigger than tech TV ever was.  That's very nice. I'll take it, but it's not true.  But if you think about it, I'll give you, you know what, Jim, you tell me,  cause you probably knew better than I did. We have half a million unique listeners a month.  We have four and a half million downloads a month. I mean, I don't know. You compare that.  What was the, the screensavers, Patrick, I think at our peak, and I think we were the  number one show ever was a quarter of a million people watched an episode, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, screensavers probably had more than half a million viewers. Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, isn't it true that when you and I were hosting it, we got the highest ratings ever?  Oh, don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The highest single month actually. No, well, just.  That's what you always tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Wait a minute. Oh, it's breaking up. I'm losing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was also, that was also the month where you had like  four million people watching you right at home for a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is when I was out.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, it was hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it really, was the best rating is better than when I was on the show was when you and  Marty were on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was, well, it was, it was a, it was a, partially it was the timing and partially it was,  I think that was also right before Marty and basically it was before they stole everybody  to launch Marty's shows and to March, to launch, to move Morgan over to X-Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who did they steal from my show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You stole you to start your show.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, Paul Block.  You can have him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you went from being, you know, full-time working for us to full-time doing the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, anyway, I don't, I, I, the point is that at the, at its peak,  probably tech TV, I don't know how many unique viewers a month did it have?  It probably didn't have more than half a million.  Let's be honest with you.  Yeah, I think we're in an order of magnitude of what tech TV was for about  one, one thousandth of the cost, maybe one, 100,000th of the cost.  Yeah, exactly.  But that's technology.  I mean, that's, that's not me.  It's technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's technology, it's delivery, but I mean, you are doing the same things  in your basement or your closet that we were doing at tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just that you're able to do it for far less and you're able to.  No Kenny Rogers interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wasn't Kenny Rogers.  It was the members of his band, if you recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was, that was, I think for me, the final straw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least they actually watched the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then, no, no, no, no, no, we led off a screensavers episode with, with,  with the Kenny Rogers episode interview.  I mean, a long one, a seven minute interview with Kenny Rogers, the entire tech content  of which was he owned an iPod.  And I'm not kidding.  And that's exactly when that was to me, that's when tech TV basically self-destructed.  It was like, okay, we give up.  You know, might as well bring in girls into trampoline because this, this isn't happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think that was?  Works in the Alan Thicke interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Alan Thicke interview was right up there.  Did you do that one, Marty?  I think you did that one.  You got six, you and I, but mostly you got stuck with a lot of these celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to go down.  Yeah, I was doing all the bit chat.  So I had to go down to the junkets down in Hollywood and do, boy, that was tough.  You see these movies and you have to come up with these tech angles to interview these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me, let me just put a little context in here.  One of the problems that happened, and this is an old media problem,  is that we were a cable network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when you're a cable network and you get Nielsen rated, what happens is that you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to dumb down because no longer can you sell the composition of your audience.  Exactly.  You're selling a share.  You're selling a rating point.  And the way you got more rating points was not, love you, Leo, not Leo Laporte,  but the Thunderbirds.  I completely agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Or what's your...  And from day one, I asked the question, why are we building a brick and mortar business  when the future is really on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the beauty of what you're doing and what we're doing at Revision 3,  is we can appeal to narrower audiences.  We can bring them together and they're extremely valuable.  They've, you know, our audience are, you know,  under 35 year old audiences, abandoned traditional media.  Their composition is great.  We can sell the value of that audience till the cows come home.  We don't have to worry about dumbing stuff down to appeal to 30 million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I agree.  And I think that's the real strength of it.  So Marty, to answer your question, you know, neither Revision 3 nor,  well, maybe Revision 3, but I'll say Twitter isn't as big as Tech TV was,  but it doesn't matter because our overhead is much less and there's no pressure on us to change it.  Right.  So let me raise another story, which I think is quite an interesting story.  And it's going to, it's got my hackles as upset as this media defender story.  And this is the new ACTA provisions that the United States  is attempting to get other countries to adopt.  Canada would be the first.  The premise is that when you go into Canada, bearing an iPod or a laptop,  well, right now, if you go in, bring a laptop,  they do random searches of your laptop, looking for child porn.  These new ACTA-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I brought this up two weeks ago and nobody wanted to talk about it.  Two or three weeks ago.  On Twitter?  Yeah.  What did we say?  I said, is anybody upset?  Is anybody picking up on this, the whole basically that you have to give up your password for any  encrypted data on your computer at a border check and you have no request?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now it's worse.  Now what they're proposing is that if you have an iPod, they can go through what's,  you don't need to give up your password.  They can look at what's on your iPod and that or any other device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have encrypted files on your computer-  Then they have to ask for your password.  We did do that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did this story with the guy and the courts, by the way, in the US ruled the guy did not have  to give up his password and that was, I thought, a very good ruling.  Do you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that doesn't seem to be the way it's working out at the border crossings right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the, these are the new ACTA rules.  It would, the idea is that if you have an iPod, if you have any device that can contain media,  laptop, iPod, DVD player, if you have DVDs, the border guards can look at anything that you've  got and in their own sole discretion, not at the request of a copyright holder or anything,  but just in their sole discretion, determine that what you have is pirated, confiscated,  destroy it and fine you.  So if you, if you come into the country and you've got an iPod full of music and they decide,  wait a minute, you couldn't possibly own that album.  They can take your iPod.  They can fine you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is when people are going from here into Canada or also the way around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eventually it'll go in every direction.  This is essentially what, once again, this is the Motion Picture Association and the RIAA  trying to change laws around the world to support them in their fight against, you know, piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you want to talk about something that you have as an American citizen who pays  taxes. You want to get pissed off.  The fact that we're using border patrol agents to take a look for pirated material.  That's ridiculous.  You know what?  The whole terrorist thing, I'm over that.  You know what?  Smuggling, I'm over that.  Let's be looking out for the pirated MP3s.  That's a great use of American, of border patrol.  It just pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is from the Vancouver Sun.  The federal government, they're talking about the Canadian federal government,  is secretly negotiating an agreement to revamp international copyright laws,  which would make the information on Canadian iPods, laptop computers,  or other personal electronic devices illegal and greatly increase the difficulty of traveling  with such devices.  It could also impose strict regulations on internet service providers, forcing them to  hand over customer information.  Underscore this without a court order.  It's called the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.  It's coming from the U.S.  They're trying to pressure Canada and other members of the European Union as well to  create an international coalition against copyright infringement.  You hit the nail on the head, Patrick.  Instead of worrying about terrorism, let's worry about who's stealing Prince's latest song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Fiske Of course, if I'm a major label, I probably feel that piracy is a form of...  Because I mean...  John Bell I think they've said that, actually.  Patrick Fiske If corporations, if basically, you know,  if the Supreme Court decided that a corporation has all of the legal entitlements of an individual,  ergo, a corporation suffering is as important as an individual American citizen suffering,  ergo, having their, you know, lifeline to profit being cut, isn't that...  And it's just like...  John Bell Well, forget due process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we need better lobbyists for American citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick Fiske Oh wait, congressmen...  John Bell What happens if Patrick crosses the border  and he's got an illegal copy of Pootie Tang on his laptop?  What happens to him at the border?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Fiske Well, how are you determining that it's an  illicit copy of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Bell Well, if they determine that it is somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked it and you put it on your hard drive,  that's not allowed, right?  You crack the encryption.  John Bell Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have a commercial movie...  You know, it's funny, yesterday on the radio show, guy calls up.  This was, this kind of broke my heart.  His wife is undergoing chemo.  He has 300 DVDs he's purchased legally.  He wants to put some of those movies on the iPod so she can watch while she's in the chemo chair,  which is, I think, about as noble a reason to do this and seems to me completely legitimate.  So I explained how to use handbrake to do it.  He said, but okay, I'm not violating any copyright rules when I do this, am I?  I said, yes, you are.  As a matter of fact, it's a federal offense.  And I said, but I don't think it should be, but let me point out to you, I'm duty bound to say,  yes, you're violating the DMCA by ripping these DVDs.  I'll tell you how to do it because I think it's a bad law, but it's not legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Well, and your alternative is to go try and buy them via iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Well, that's what I said.  I said, you know, the movie industry would say, but you know, you could buy them on iTunes,  except that I already bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Right, exactly.  That's the fundamental problem of it's my media, I want to watch it anywhere on anything,  any device, anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Leo, you bought a license to use that video in the DVD format in a designated DVD player.  You did not buy that movie.  You bought the rights to view that movie in that particular format.  I don't understand why you people want to watch stuff when you want to watch it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I got an interesting email from a guy who said, hey, you know,  you're going to get knocked, the FCC is going to pull you off the air because you're advocating  illegal activities.  And I said, if that's the case, so be it.  But you know, I am not going to shut up on this one.  I'm sorry.  This is wrong.  For you, Leo.  John Bell Cracked Well, I mean, I mean, I'm willing to risk that.  I've got 5000 people will watch me on video on streaming internet video.  I don't know.  I feel like I'm working in your mom's shed, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Leo Well, that would also that would be a really interesting, I mean,  do you want to talk about a wonderful opportunity to spend, you know,  chasing something up to the Supreme Court?  How does the FCC, you know, if you curse the FCC has a clear, the FCC has a clear mandate  to slap you on the wrist.  If you have a wardrobe failure on broadcast TV, if you curse on your AM radio show,  you know what I mean?  It would be interesting to watch them trying to because it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I would be advocating an illegal act, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Leo Yeah, the problem is, is you could have a really fun.  This is when you get into a really and it's already obviously been shut down in some legal  avenues. But potentially this is a, you know, is this a First Amendment versus the DMCA situation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked It's gonna be very interesting.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Leo What the DMCA basically says is you have no First Amendment rights when it comes  to violating copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Well, I'm sure they're going to subpoena this recording.  So we'll let them decide.  Will you guys come to my trial?  Marty S. Martin Oh, yeah, I'll be an expert witness.  John Bell Cracked Marty conjugal visits.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With you, I will be a fairly unexpert witness.  But I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I wasn't asking that, but that's okay.  I'll take it.  All right.  I'm just I'm giving you a hard time.  Marty S. Martin Free Leo Laporte.  I can see the free Leo Laporte.  Hey, we did it for Adrian Lamo.  John Bell Cracked Do it for me.  John Bell Cracked Supreme Court on Tuesday dashed the hopes of T-Mobile and AT&T.  I just love beginning a story that way.  John Bell Cracked They were trying to stave off a class action lawsuit saying your policies  against unlocking mobile phones are illegal.  The Supreme Court declined to review a decision by the California Supreme Court that said  that lawsuit's okay.  John Bell Cracked And millions of California customers can sue  John Bell Cracked T-Mobile and AT&T.  There are similar lawsuits against Verizon and Sprint.  In fact, Verizon and Sprint have agreed to provide unlocking codes after your contract  is over.  I think that's a huge movement forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked And that's pretty that's pretty reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not much to ask, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Because they're essentially subsidizing  the cost of the hardware so they should be able to get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Yeah, but that did tell that to T-Mobile  and AT&T who literally fought it all the way to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Well, of course, they're going to fight it  all the way to the Supreme Court.  They want you to buy more hardware, not less.  John Bell Cracked So they don't want to benefit their competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked One interesting upshot of this might be an  unlocked iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Dun dun dun.  John Bell Cracked Bum bum bum bum.  John Bell Cracked Except you won't be able to.  Can you actually use the what happens if you're using an iPhone on T-Mobile with the what happens  to the to the visual display of your voicemail message?  John Bell Cracked You lose that because that's a T-Mobile specific

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  feature.  But I was using an iPhone on T-Mobile for a while and it works except for that.  And the push email from Yahoo doesn't work the same, but you can still get it working  except for that.  John Bell Cracked Oh, YouTube, you had to do a little hack.  But I mean, basically, it's the same phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked So it's the same thing except for the cool  integrated features that really make the iPhone a magnificent product.  John Bell Cracked Not so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, visual voicemail is great, but do you use an iPhone, Patrick?  Patrick Potyondy Yes.  John Bell Cracked Do you think visual voicemail is a selling  point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy For me, it absolutely is.  John Bell Cracked The integration with Google Maps actually is  incredibly useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Yeah, but every phone does that.  My BlackBerry does that.  Patrick Potyondy And my BlackBerry will allow me to use a GPS  dongle to get even more accurate maps.  I mean, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I've actually been pleasantly surprised with  how accurate the GPS is on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Well, it can only be accurate to the distance  to the cell site, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked It triangulates across multiple cells.  I've even been in the middle of nowhere and had pretty good luck with it.  It's been more accurate than I expected it to be.  Patrick Potyondy But some cell phones actually have GPS chips

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  built in, I guess.  John Bell Cracked Nokia's do.  Patrick Potyondy Well, I know Verizon's doing it with GPS

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chips.  John Bell Cracked Yeah, I decided instead of doing that,  because there is in fact a BlackBerry...  I have the 8320, the 8310 has a GPS chip, but it used to kill my N95's battery life.  So I use just a key fob that's a very good GPS, surf three chipset GPS device,  John Bell Cracked and the BlackBerry sees it via Bluetooth.  So and Google Maps sees it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy And Bluetooth doesn't kill your battery life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked Not like GPS does.  Patrick Potyondy Good to know.  John Bell Cracked Oh, no.  Come on.  People use Bluetooth all the time on their headsets.  Patrick Potyondy No, I just...  John Bell Cracked Wi-Fi will kill it.  John Bell Cracked We'll see what Edge does when...  Or not Edge, HS EPA does when the new iPhone comes out.  There is rumor that they'll have GPS in the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Yeah, strong rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked It makes sense.  Patrick Potyondy You guys think there'll be anything besides  a new iPhone announced June 9th at WWDC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy You know he's got more stuff up his sleeve.  John Bell Cracked You know what the story is now, the big story is,  and we'll save this for Mac Break Weekly because I can tell you guys couldn't care less.  John Bell Cracked They're going to replace .Mac or rename .Mac.  John Bell Cracked Are you ready for the name?  Patrick Potyondy Have you heard this yet, Patrick?  Patrick Potyondy No, I'm afraid.  John Bell Cracked This sounds like something out of Redmond.  Mobile Me.  Patrick Potyondy Oh no.  John Bell Cracked Isn't that the worst?  Patrick Potyondy I like the Nintendo Me.  John Bell Cracked Oh, it should be. Mobile Me.  Patrick Potyondy Maybe they're teaming with Nintendo.  John Bell Cracked Maybe.  Patrick Potyondy Is it a rumor for you?  John Bell Cracked I think that the iPhone is very much like the Nintendo We-Mote, you know?  Patrick Potyondy It is actually.  John Bell Cracked Same idea, it's got the accelerators in it.  The two companies are more alike than you might think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Am I the only one here without an iPhone?  John Bell Cracked What's up?  Patrick Potyondy Am I the only one in this conversation that does not have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I don't have an iPhone, Martin.  Patrick Potyondy I can't imagine Jim every.  Jim's still using his Scion 3A, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked I can't allow myself to get a decent phone.  I have such a crippling internet addiction as it is.  I can't let myself go out of the house and be able to surf the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy That's true.  So you have a phone that has big buttons on it and big numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Bell Cracked It's like one of those old Nokia 6120s.  Patrick Potyondy Like the candy bar phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Jim, do you still use, what was that thing you used?  It was the.  Jim Hicks HP200LX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim Hicks If I could get Outlook integration on the HP200LX, I would still use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy You would, I mean that thing danced for you.  That was the first time I ever really saw somebody that actually  made a PDA do anything they wanted.  Jim Hicks I could type 40 words a minute with my thumbs.  Patrick Potyondy It was amazing.  It was completely out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jim Hicks Now I just, actually what I do is I've got EVDO built into my Dell 1330 and  I use OneNote, which actually, you know, you can, you can bitch about Microsoft.  Patrick Potyondy Oh, I love OneNote.  Jim Hicks OneNote is a great product.  Patrick Potyondy You gotta try Evernote though.  Have you tried Evernote?  Jim Hicks I have not.  Patrick Potyondy Evernote is a OneNote clone that now has migrated to the cloud,  which makes it very interesting.  Jim Hicks That's cool.  Patrick Potyondy So I use it on my Mac, on my Windows,  but it also works on my iPhone.  It works anywhere I can get to a browser.  It's very interesting.  It's not so much handwriting.  They do have handwriting on if you have a tablet, but it's less handwriting.  Jim Hicks No, my tablets suck.  I carried one for about eight months.  Patrick Potyondy So you use a keyboard.  Jim Hicks Yeah, I use a keyboard.  Patrick Potyondy Oh yeah, you'll like it if you like OneNote.  This is Evernote.  You can get a beta, invite to the beta pretty easily, I think.  You probably know some people.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim Hicks Anyway, so yeah, I'm big on keyboards.  I would like a phone that has a keyboard that's exactly the same as the 200LX.  This is what I want you to do on system, Patrick.  I have two 200LXs.  Can you take a Windows mobile device or a rim and stuff it into the 200LX so I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  still use the 200LX keyboard?  That would be an ideal hack for me.  I'm like Paul Allen.  Nobody else wants that but me.  Patrick Potyondy But that's all that matters.  It was the famous audience of One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Hicks I just want to get a Bluetooth keyboard to work with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Potyondy Bluetooth keyboard, iPhone.  They don't work?  I guess they don't, no.  We're going to take a break, come back in just a bit and talk about the teenagers,  the high school dropouts who hacked Comcast.  But first, a word from our sponsor, audible.com.  Folks, you know about, yes, you know about Audible.  It's the place to go to get your, I'm going to put my audible.com chiron up here.  A lot of second and color corrections.  Look at that lower third.  Oh, that's good.  That's beautiful.  Audible.com slash twit, the place to go to get your audible books.  Audible is frankly what saved my life driving back and forth to TechLive.  If it hadn't been for those Aubrey Matcher and Seafaring books to take my mind off the pain,  I probably would have pulled my car right off the Golden Gate Bridge.  So thank you, Audible.  Eight years of life-saving audiobooks.  It is a great way to pass the time.  We're doing a podcast with a woman named Roz Savage who's rowing across the ocean.  She rowed across the Atlantic solo by herself in a rowboat two years ago.  Isn't that crazy?  She's hardcore.  You would love this woman.  She is so hardcore.  So now she wants to be the first woman to solo row across the Pacific.  She left on Memorial Day weekend.  She's been rowing for a week.  I talked to her three times a week via sat phone.  But before she left, with Audible's permission, I gave her my iPod full of 323 Audible books.  What I didn't count on is the fact that she's rowing 15 hours a day.  Within two days, she'd read Bleak House, Dickens work that's like a thousand pages.  I'm thinking, oh my God, I should have given her more books.  She's read the entire Discworld series.  I'm not kidding you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why Bleak House?  There's all the things to read when you go across the Atlantic.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  She majored, I think, in Victorian literature at Oxford.  So she actually likes this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus it probably makes you feel better about the fact that you're duct taped to a pair of oars for 15 hours at a pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least I'm not a six-year-old in a workhouse.  I know.  It could be worse.  In 1873 or whenever that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be smoke in the air and I could be turning a wheel making wool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could be making matchsticks and the sulfur.  Eating out my lower jaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could I have some more?  So we're going to talk to Roz again next Tuesday.  I'll find out what book she's reading right now.  But she's going through.  Any of you guys, I actually sent an email out asking if any of you guys had an audible pick.  Because if you don't, I can give you, I have tons of them, but I just wanted to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have we done, is it?  Crud.  Give me a hint.  Food Country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Neil Gaiman?  Oh no, that's Stephen King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it would be William Gibson.  Actually, you know what?  I just reread.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did mention that actually.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Anansi Boys from Neil Gaiman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't Anansi Boys great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or American Gods would be.  Sure we've done that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have.  Neil Gaiman, we had him on the screensavers, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did a little drawing of the Sandman on the back wall.  Was that him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wish we had that back wall.  Whatever happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It went to the jobbers and probably was thrown into the  dumpsters with all the other smaller stuff they didn't know how to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For six years, we'd have people who came on the show  autograph the back wall of the set, including Neil Gaiman, and he drew the Sandman.  Kills me.  Anyway, yes, you can listen.  Let's not get depressed.  You can listen to Anansi Boys and many other wonderful.  In fact, you know what would be a great start is that he has a,  you can get this for free.  It's seven minutes of Neil talking about Anansi Boys and how he got the idea for it.  You can get that for free at audible.com and then you'll want to listen to the full Anansi Boys.  It is amazing.  I love Neil Gaiman.  I just.  Leo, I want to put in a plug because you mentioned the Discworld series.  If you don't know the Discworld.  You're right.  Oh my God, they are so.  This guy, Terry Pratchett, one of the most creative writers,  he could be writing in any genre and you would just want to read every single one of his like  10,000 books he's written.  I agree with you.  I love his stuff.  They have five, 41 Terry Pratchett books.  I think it's got to be every one of them, including the entire Discworld series,  which is 30 books itself.  He's a master storyteller.  So give that one a try.  One of those small gods is a good.  Let me play a little bit of this.  This is Nigel Plainer, who is.  They have the greatest British names.  This is Terry Pratchett.  This is from the Discworld series.  This is small gods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These aren't books in which the events of the past are pins like so many butterflies to a cork.  These are the books from which history is derived.  There are more than 20,000 of them.  Each one is 10 feet high, bound in lead,  and the letters are so small that they have to be read with a magnifying glass.  When people say it is written, it is written here.  There are fewer metaphors around than people think.  Every month, the abbot and two senior monks go into the cave where the books are kept.  It used to be the duty of the abbot alone,  but two other reliable monks were included after the unfortunate case of the 59th abbot,  who made a million dollars in small bets before his fellow monks caught up with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just, you know, it's full of jokes like that.  It is so much fun.  Thank you.  You're absolutely right, Jim.  I don't think we've ever recommended Terry Pratchett.  And I really would like to recommend him right now.  A great choice.  We've got lots of good books, 45,000 of them,  and any one of them could be yours free if you go to Twit.  I'm sorry, audible.com.  It should be twit.com slash audible.  We haven't worked that out yet.  Audible.com slash twit.  And we are coming up on our one-year anniversary with Audible.  And I don't want to hurt your feelings, Jim and Martin.  The regular Twits, I've been told, will all be getting free Audible accounts.  So Patrick, you will be getting a free Audible account.  If you're allowed to accept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe I am.  Jim, can you make a ruling on that?  Yeah, you can accept it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pay for mine, but I've arranged,  because you know, Dvorak kept bitching that he didn't have one.  So Audible said, well, come on, we're going to give anybody who wants,  any of the Twits, the regular Twits, will give you, so,  Patrick, you'll get an email and it'll be all set up for you.  And Jim, if you just come on, Jim and Martin,  Marty, if you just come on more often, we can get that for you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Can I share yours, Patrick, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only if you row across the Pacific.  It's also not a violation of the DMCA.  I think it probably is.  Tell you what, Leo, for you, I'm going into Canada next weekend.  Maybe I'll...  After I heard that story, I said, I am so glad I no longer do a TV show.  I used to go to Canada every month and I'm thinking, I don't want to get my stuff searched.  Not that I have anything on there, but that's a real invasion.  Anyway, Audible, we'll get to that in a little bit.  Audible.com slash Twit.  Thanks so much for their support for the past year of the Twit Network.  We really, really are so happy to be a part of the Audible team.  You're going to Canada next week?  What for, Jim?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a conference in Banff called the Next Media Conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's right before the big Banff TV festival or whatever it is.  Yes.  So I'm going up there.  They asked me to speak there and I said, yeah, I'll speak there.  Then I noticed it was over a weekend and I said, ooh, and I'm going to go with my wife and my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you stay in a great hotel.  Amber did that last year and it's one of the most fun times she's ever had.  I'm looking forward to it and my wife and my son have never been to Canada,  so I think it'll be great.  You're going to love it.  Canada is a...  Banff is the most beautiful place in the world, practically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I used to go to college right near Montreal.  I went to Montreal all the time.  You did?  Yeah, I went to Vermont.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was in Vermont though.  Yeah, but it was right next to Montreal.  Montreal was an hour away.  You're kidding.  Back then, you didn't have to take your iPod over the border.  And Martin grew up an hour from Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Well, more about three hours.  I guess across the lake, it would have been an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just across the lake, but you had to kind of drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would just get my Nicholas Nickleby and Mero across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch out for the Niagara Falls on your left.  It's a real doozy.  When I first started going to Toronto,  you gave me the recommendation for a pizza restaurant.  It was the greatest...  Oh, it's...  Wasn't that good?  What's the name of that?  Do you remember?  Oh, I can't remember the name of it.  I ended up staying down the street from it.  It's on Queen Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that hotel you stayed in.  A very cool place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing is when you used to go there,  it was a flop house.  So I was kind of surprised you knew the name.  They had renovated it.  It's funny because I said, oh, yeah, I'm staying at The Drake on Queen Street.  Right, I see.  And I was with John Donahby, the radio guy I used to do a show with in Canada,  said, The Drake?  That's like a flop house.  I said, well, I think they've renovated it since you were there last, John.  Drake is a very hip hotel now,  and it's just down the street from this Italian restaurant,  which is...  I can't think of the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's move on.  There are a couple more stories before we wrap this up.  I was going to talk about these teenagers, these high school dropouts,  who hacked Comcast, and they said, hey, man, we tried to tell them.  They took over the Comcast homepage, modified it for four hours.  I don't know, should we not be glorifying them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think what they did was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it wasn't right, but...  I don't think we should glorify.  Although I did love the quote.  There was a quote in a CNET story about the guy.  One of the guys said, you know, because they knew they were going to be arrested.  It was like, I slept in my clothes because the last time they came,  I was in my underwear with my...  hanging out.  There's also a great picture from his Facebook of him  and some sort of smoking apparatus.  I don't really recognize what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't know what that was called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't know what that is.  But I mean, it just shows you anybody can be hacked.  We got hacked a couple of weeks ago.  They deleted all the contents of our forums and the stupid hack.  I mean, it's my fault.  There's a brain dead.  But I still have the script, the hacker script.  He left it on my system.  So I think, you know, be nice to me because I know how to use it.  I have a script and I'm not afraid to use it.  It's actually what I am going to do on one of these twit live episodes.  Make sure you sleep in your clothes.  I wear a night shirt so you don't really have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the little stocking cap?  Yeah.  It's very Dickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really cute.  If you fly out of San Jose, Jim Latterback, good news.  You're going to have free Wi-Fi in the San Jose airport now.  Ad supported.  You know, that's only for you people who have Macs because I have EVDO on my computer.  Oh, you don't care.  Hey, I can use EVDO on a Mac.  Yeah, but you can't get it built in though.  I can use mobile Wii.  Can you use mobile Wii?  That sounds like something you do in the bathroom, Leo.  I love this story.  Microsoft is saying, don't use Safari.  It's not safe.  This must really make Microsoft.  This must just make them feel so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just surprised that Microsoft found a flaw in a browser without somebody else telling them first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good point.  Well, they didn't actually.  The truth is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also hate Safari.  Let me come out on any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use Firefox and Flock, but Safari is fine.  I kind of resented Apple's pushing it on us on the Windows side.  But apparently there's a flaw that might-  By the way, Apple does not acknowledge this as a flaw.  This is another one of those, it's a feature things.  Or they say if you want to turn that off, you have to make a feature request.  Security researchers found out that Safari could be  prompted to automatically download resources from a webpage, as many as the webpage wanted.  They call it a carpet bombing attack because all of a sudden your desktop or your downloads  folder will be filled with hundreds of little tiny files.  Executable files, I might add.  Just in case you were worried about it.  Apple says we know about it.  We're not going to make a feature request.  It might take us a little time to fix it.  So Microsoft's response is, the Microsoft security team says,  stop using Safari and pending an investigation.  This must have really made Microsoft so happy.  We're going to investigate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to deflect attention from Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do you stand on that?  I know you're a big Windows user, Jim.  Where do you stand on?  Are you using Vista or are you still with XP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got Vista on.  I've got two machines in front of me.  Vista's running on both of it.  And I've thought about going back to XP,  but there are some features about Vista that I really do like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're learning that Vista's actually safer, very safe.  In fact, I just read that the UAC, the user access control in Vista,  prevents a lot of rootkit infections.  So it's pretty effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, some security analysts would debate that with you.  I got to say the Service Pack 1 made Vista so much more functional.  Really? You noticed a difference?  It seemed so at first, but over time,  it started to really kind of clean up a lot of my issues with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I disagree.  Service Pack 1 did nothing for me.  My problems with my machine's not going to sleep,  my problems with kind of eventually they sort of,  here's the thing about Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got EVTO in your notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get it exactly the way you want.  Create a ghost copy or some copy of it  so that after about six months, you just go back to it  and all of a sudden your machine's running faster and you're happy again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a lot like Windows XP, Windows 98, and Windows XP, which I personally refuse to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more pronounced in Vista, Patrick.  And so Microsoft and the next version of Vista or whatever needs a big button.  It needs the big go back six months button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do have, I have to say, one of the things I like most about Vista  is that revert to previous version of document button,  which I think is quite a good thing.  That's something I'd love to have on a Mac.  I mean, you can use Time Machine, but it's a little bit of a bigger gun  to solve the same problem.  I really like that.  I think Vista's great.  I'm using Vista on two out of my three machines in front of me.  And I think it's fine.  I'm very happy with it.  It puzzles me that there's been so much criticism of it.  I guess, you know, even Bill Gates at the D conference said,  hey, we make mistakes.  What do you say?  He had a very nice phrase.  Vista gave us.  He said, we have a corporate culture that we fix mistakes.  You know, we find them and we fix them.  And Vista gave us an unusual opportunity to exercise that corporate culture.  That's awesome.  Bill's getting a little loose now that he's got one month left.  He's relaxing a little bit.  Did you go to D, Jim Lutterback?  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't invited and actually, you know, didn't even think about it until it was too late anyway.

Transcript:  Yeah.  It was in LA, right?  It was out here.  It's in Carlsbad or something like that.  Like some weird place.  Yeah.  You didn't go, did you?  No, I don't.  I finally found the way not to go to conferences doing this 25 hours of programming a week.  You know why?  Because now I find somebody who's going to the conference  and we just have them call us on Skype and it's just like being there.  I'm going to be the Anderson Cooper of tech.  I'm just going to sit my butt in this chair all day  and let you guys all go out and do the work.  You don't like traveling, do you, Leo?  I love traveling for travel's sake.  I hate business travel.  Don't you?  I still like business travel.  I mean, if I were going to Banff, okay.  But I'm going to New York.  I'm going to Iowa in two weeks.  No, I see.  Sorry.  What are you going to Iowa for?  Iowa.  GoDaddy.  GoDaddy's in Iowa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're in Arizona and Iowa and apparently the people were meeting here in Iowa.  I went to Iowa once for Chris Perula's conference and I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were at that conference together.  I was excited to be in Des Moines.  Nome Decks.  That was a fun...  That was actually a fun event.  It was fun.  But now he has it in Seattle or wherever he lives.  I think it's Seattle.  Yeah.  So here's one for you, Marty.  I picked stories for you.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, good.  What do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NYU student invents virtual girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So...  Yeah, I read about this kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a graduate student, Drew Barrows.  Doesn't have a girlfriend right now.  Hasn't had one in some time apparently.  So he built a mattress that has a virtual movie of a girl.  She lies there quietly until you sit or lie down.  Then she responds to your every move.  Lie on your back.  She snuggles up right next to you in a long position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's like 2D.  It's like snuggling with a magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not even a magazine.  You can't even feel her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The kid's whole excuse for not having a girlfriend is he has no time to have a girlfriend.  But he's got enough time to build a virtual woman in his dorm room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Especially, I mean, talk about, you know, at the risk of sounding like a pig.  NYU is a target rich environment.  There are a lot of beautiful, smart, ugly, fat, round...  I mean, anything you're interested in.  NYU is a huge campus.  It's the middle of Manhattan.  They basically own the village from the west side to the east side.  I mean, get out, dude.  Talk to people.  Start dating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe he was threatened.  Maybe it's a little scary for him.  Maybe he'd like to stay home and kind of get used to it.  It's okay.  Maybe it's not so bad.  It's not so bad having a 2D girlfriend.  You've got to see the picture.  It's the perfect use of Microsoft Surface.  It looks like Surface.  I wonder if she responds to touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's probably machine washing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Suddenly I feel dirty.  Spread your fingers and she grows.  All right.  Here's another story for you, Marty.  There's a pinch in her face.  The guy who designed the Pringles can passed away recently.  He's 89 years old.  He worked at Procter & Gamble.  Dr. Frederick J. Bauer.  He did many, many things.  He was a food technician.  In fact, we could thank him for freeze dried ice cream.  We can thank him for frying oils.  But his proudest accomplishment, according to his daughter,  the invention of the Pringles can.  He received a patent for the package in 1970.  I know you and Patrick have built antennas with the Pringles can.  Dr. Frederick J. Bauer was buried last week in a Pringles can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pringles can saved me there.  It didn't really save me, but I have a lot of crime in my neighborhood.  There's always people breaking into my car.  What I did was I took a Pringles can and I left all the top of the Pringles up there.  But then I put some dog dew in the bottom because I knew that the guy was going to go  in there again.  They always steal all my stuff.  So I knew that he reached down and when he got down to the bottom of the Pringles,  he was going to find my little treat for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you really do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  I want to thank Dr. Frederick J. Bauer for that.  You really did that?  I did that, Leo, and I'll do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just in case anybody finds any Pringles lying around.  Wait a minute.  You didn't do that at the ramp, did you?  No.  I thought that last Pringle was a little weird.  He was obviously cremated or you couldn't bury him in a Pringles can.  It wasn't like a giant six-foot Pringles can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, part of him was buried in a Pringles can, the rest in another container.  Oh, thank you for that correction, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lest anybody think he was a weirdo or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, if this guy invented a reconstitutable freeze-dried ice cream,  the whole point of that freeze-dried ice cream he invented  so that you would add milk and put it in the freezer and create ice,  like basically create...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it wasn't astronaut ice cream?  No.  Because I love that stuff.  No, no, that's good.  You don't like astronaut ice cream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I told Roz, because she has to carry a lot of freeze-dried food in her road boat.  You can't bring bananas or anything.  And she'd never heard of freeze-dried ice cream,  and I think she ran out and got some for the trip.  Quick to REI.  You think I made a mistake?  She's going to be upset at me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, if I'm in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, I'm thinking freeze-dried,  or the Pacific for that matter, freeze-dried ice cream is going to be great.  If I've got a Safeway quarter mile from my house, I'm probably not going for the freeze-dried ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She didn't have the choice, really, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That stuff's disgusting.  That's probably why the bathroom in the space station went out last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They brought a new pooper up, though.  A Russian pooper.  Well, the Russian pooper failed.  Now they have a Japanese one, right?  Well, the problem is there's a fan.  OK, so the deal is, I don't know if I should get into this.  Is anybody eating lunch right now?  There's a fan.  You know the problem with having a live video feed with a number on it?  You can watch that number go down.  It doesn't just go up, ladies and gentlemen.  It's the people eating lunch.  So there's no gravity on this international space station.  So in order to keep things in their place, there's a fan on the toilet that's drawing,  that sucks down into the toilet.  The Russian fan crapped out, so to speak.  And I mean, imagine this, there were floating turds in the space station.  They had to use nets to catch them.  So they very much need this space shuttle launch.  This is an important launch.  This is vital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's tragic.  They had a Soyuz module that they had to use that, and then they filled that one up.  And now they're having to use these Apollo-era bags with sticky tape on them.  Oh, it's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, they're up there for like six months.  This is non-trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get those guys out of space embarrassing themselves.  What are we doing up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got another story.  When you bring back Internet Drifter, Web Drifter, I got another story for you.  I want you to go see Don Bowman of Columbus, Ohio.  Don is retired now, 57 years old, was an auto liquidator.  He's made a business out of buying domain names that he thinks are going to become big.  You know, possibly, you know, big political or cultural events.  He watches TV, thinks of a domain name, and he probably goes to GoDaddyJim  and registers it using the GoDaddy code.  What is the GoDaddy code, Jim?  Star one.  Star one.  Tekzilla one.  No, star one.  You guys fight it out.  G brief.  Star one.  I don't have a GoDaddy coder.  I'd get in this fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the guy who registered, was it HillaryObama.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obama Hillary.  Not Obama Clinton, by the way.  He couldn't get Obama Clinton, I guess.  He got Obama Hillary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's up on eBay right now.  The auction went live today.  No bids yet, but $5,000 is the starting price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No wonder no bids.  Would you buy it?  Obama Hillary?  I think it should be Obama Clinton.  Obama Hillary.  What about Barack Hillary?  He also owns such great sites as RenoForGovernor.com,  Bob GrahamForPresident.com,  Joe LiebermanForPresident.com,  and oh, here's a big one, BloombergPowell.com.  This guy does not have very good political sense.  He's hoping to make millions on obamahillary.com.  I don't think so.  So there's no bids yet, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing how much money domain squatters make or domain.  I don't know what the polite term for domain squatters is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the name, domain squatters.  That's what they are.  What?  The one just sold recently for a lot of money.  What was it?  I'm trying to think.  Sex.com was famous for getting a million dollars,  but there was another one just recently sold.  Got a big box.  CNET was so stupid.  They bought a bunch of these ones like news.com and download.com.  TV.com.  And then they realized these are too generic.  They're not worth anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just worth 1.8 billion 40% stock price.  Yeah, I don't know how smart that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was pretty smart.  Was that a smart deal for CBS or no?  Oh, for CBS, no.  Stupid.  Good deal for CNET.  Awesome for that.  What was wrong with that from CBS's point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think there's no overlap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's got some really narrow on technology.  And they said, oh, yeah, it's got chow.com and all these other.  How many people go to chow.com?  Chow?  C-H-O-W?  Yeah.  Oh, that's valuable.  Do you?  Do you go there?  No, I never even heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your name?  Chow or chow hound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chow hound, sorry.  Big deal.  Even TV.com, which seems like a good idea,  and it actually is a beautiful site.  I don't think anybody knows about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they do.  Maybe they will after they run a few interstitials on various.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thrilled.  I own 100 shares of CNET stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sold mine after the, because we owned some, right?  Because of Ziff Davis or something.  I got rid of it when it was like $4.  Yeah, you did better than I did Leo.  Which I wrote it all the way down.  I was the third employee at CNET, and I was supposed to get equity,  but Halsey kind of, he got tired of me.  He fired my ass.  It's a long, strange trip.  That's when I went to a Ziff Davis.  And look at me now.  The commander of your own media empire.  My own closet.  All right, I'm going to get out of the closet.  I want to thank Jim Latterback for being, for his,  popping his cherry on Twitter here.  Really appreciate your coming in, Jim.  Another pleasure.  Let me know anytime.  Did we ever break 5,000?  We didn't.  We did?  We got over 5,000 viewers.  All right, it's a new record for Twitter Live.  And thanks to you, I'm sure it's because  of you, Jim.  Or could it be because of you, Martin Sargent?  I believe so.  Jim Latterback is the CEO of Revision3, Revision3.com.  Of course, Martin Sargent, one of the stars there with Internet  Superstar and the soon to return Web Drifter as soon as the injunction is lifted.  See, that's a joke.  See, and I say that, it's a joke.  I laughed.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am so glad that we're good friends, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgive you the Pringles thing.  I didn't expect that.  I have to say, I was really surprised when I got to the bottom of that.  Jeez.  I thought it was chocolate.  I didn't know.  I thought it was a little extra gift.  What did I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I never even got to plug my Twitter.  Twitter.com slash Martin Sargent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  S-A-R-G-E-N-T.  He doesn't spell it like the Frenchies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm Twitter.com slash JLowderB, J-L-O-U-D-E-R-B, which is the...  You remember back at the 8.3 Character Days, Leo?  Yes.  So my email was always first letter of first name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or seven letters of last name.  So it's just been that forever.  It's funny because it resonated with me.  I was trying to remember your Twitter name.  Actually, I was trying to remember something else, but I won't say what it is.  I was trying to remember your Twitter name.  And then it kind of came out of me naturally.  And I remember that.  That's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, just during this show, I went over 3,000.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can get you.  Look, I got Dvorak from zero to 10,000 in literally a week or two.  We'll get you up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do mine?  Yes.  Twitter.com slash Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick Norton.  And we're not going to even mention Dvorak's ha ha ha.  Watch Tekzilla, now the number one show on Revision 3.  I'm so proud of you and Veronica Patrick.  I could just die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  That's Tekzilla.com.  T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.  Sorry, I'm having a Dvorak moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For our Canadian listeners, that's T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.  I have to translate for the Canadians.  And I thank you all for being here.  Another tweet is in the can.

Transcript:  This is amazing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, I could actually what I could do if I had four T1s or four DSLs, I could have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  four computers, one attached to each, and then each computer could have its own Skype.  And then I could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I need is four T1 lines, three craze, and a small sack of MIT graduates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have the hell of a time.  Blue screens, like forget it.  I'm killing you.
