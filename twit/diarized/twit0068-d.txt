Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiT This Week in Tech, episode 68 for September 10th, 2006.  Shavvy.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Visa.  Safer, better money.  Life takes Visa.  And by Dell.  Check out Leo's picks at twit.tv slash Dell.  It's time to twit and that means time once again to join together in Holy Matrimony,  the highest level geeks in the industry.  Starting with Patrick Norton who's back from DLTV and Places Unknown.  Patrick, it's good to talk to you again.  We missed you.  It's good to be back.  Yeah.  Things have changed.  We're officially a twit podcast network.  Wow.  It's official now.  I don't know.  What does that mean?  It means we've got ads, we've got banner ads, we've got a couple new podcasts coming this  week.  We've got a Law podcast and we're going to get Paul Thurotte to do a Windows podcast.  So it's kind of now really a network.  I think my idea was until you have a dozen podcasts, you don't really have a network.  Now people can listen all day, all night.  Also here from the Great Britain, the Great Britain from the UK, from Oxford.  It's Will Harris of bit-tech.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great Will Harris from Great Britain.  Great Will Harris, aka Nick.  Yeah, thanks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are mad at me because I don't call you Nick anymore.  Honestly, some people sent me emails saying, call him Nick, call him Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody asked me the other day why my name was Will with one L and I had to give my geeky  answer.  Which is?  Well, when you're a kid and you're playing arcade games, there's only ever three letters  for your high score, right?  That is a geeky answer.  Unfortunately, she wasn't very impressed with the answer.  I didn't get very far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My real name is Leopold and I just shortened it to three letters for the same very reason.  Corey Doctorow has the same problem.  We'll call him Cor, Corey Doctorow from Boing Boing and he's now a fellow.  Hey, Corey, it's good to talk to you.  A fellow, where again you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  USC, I'm actually the Fulbright Chair at USC, the inaugural Canada-US Fulbright Chair Annenberg  Center for Public Diplomacy.  Thank you very much.  And having an eight-letter surname, I had a built-in UNIX login.  Oh, you did, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very easy.  I did.  Very easy.  I'm just shy a letter, unfortunately.  Corey's actually joining us on an emergency basis because WIPO is about to do something  semi-evil and they're doing it tomorrow.  So we thought we'd get him on today to talk about it.  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How's this different from every other week with WIPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  You know, WIPO is, it's really interesting because WIPO is attempting to regulate broadcasting  on the internet or multimedia on the internet and they have meetings sort of every six months  and that six-month interval is enough for the technology to be completely reinvented  between each meeting and so all the rules they've been planning for the last one become  even more nonsensical in respect to the next one.  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So let's just say a little background.  WIPO is the World Intellectual Property Organization.  UN chartered, originally the idea was for the nations to get together and kind of make  a, which makes sense, a global policy for copyright and trademark and patent and all  of that because after all it's a global economy.  Unfortunately...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, hang on, hang on.  That's not why they were put together.  They had been an industry association whose job it was to promote that and what happened  was they went to the UN and they said, you know, knowledge goods, copyrights and patents  and trademarks, they're really important to humanitarian efforts.  What you need is a humanitarian agency to do humanitarian work in respect of knowledge  goods.  So of course they got a UN charter and threw out any kind of notion of being humanitarian  agency and just worked on making more and more exclusive rights for the corporate members  that had started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really a Trojan horse to get them a UN charter.  Totally.  Absolutely.  For WIPO.  And who is, now it's changed a little bit, I know through your efforts and efforts of  other NGOs, but initially who were the WIPO members?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the WIPO members are the countries, of course, and then there's a bunch of non-governmental  organizations.  And in WIPO's context, that usually meant organizations like the National Association  of Broadcasters, the RIAA, the MPAA, the British Phonographic Industry, IFPI, and so on.  Basically, it was a bunch of groups that worked for organizations that made a lot of money  by having monopolies granted to them by government who would get together and talk about whether  or not more monopolies would be good.  And unsurprisingly, the answer was always yes.  They have a really healthy emotional relationship with their regulatory monopolies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's the latest in the WIPO dance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the latest in the WIPO dance is something called the Broadcasting Treaty.  And under the Broadcasting Treaty, we would get a new set of rights that would go to people  who aren't creators.  It would go to people who are disseminators of creations, so broadcasters.  So normally if you found something on a broadcast program and you wanted to reuse it, you'd  have to go to the copyright holder.  Or in the event that it was in the public domain, you would just reuse it.  Or if you had a fair use right to it, you could reuse it.  Or if it was Creative Commons licensed, you could just reuse it.  And under this regime, even if you have the copyright right to use the work, you still  have to go to the broadcaster and get the broadcast right to do it.  So the broadcaster gets a 50-year monopoly on what you do with the stuff the broadcaster  sends to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm confused.  Let's say some broadcaster in the sense essentially being a middleman between the creator of the  content and the auditor, the listener of the content.  Just by transmitting the broadcaster now is getting some rights to the original creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  So say there was a public domain movie, an old 1920s movie, and Fox put it on the air.  Well normally that just doesn't belong to anyone because it's in the public domain.  Or say they took some footage off of C-SPAN, which is in the public domain because everything  the government makes in the US is in the public domain.  And so theoretically you could just record it and do what you liked with it.  Under the broadcast right, actually Fox would get 50 years worth of monopoly over how you  use that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what if I taped it from another source?  They don't insert a right to that.  It's only if I got it from Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only if you got it from Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would they have to prove that that's how I got it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although in the case of Fox, they're sitting on the 20th century Fox vaults.  So in fact they might have copies, the only public domain copies of works.  But you know there are other examples.  Fox is probably a good thing to stick with here because you know there's just this movie  OutFox, this documentary about Fox.  And this guy using Fair Use, he made all these recordings off of Fox and put them together  in a documentary to show how Fox transmitted information.  Couldn't do that anymore.  Well you might be able to, but it would have totally different Fair Use.  So you would have to go to a lawyer and say, well okay, tell me first of all, is this a  Fair Use under copyright?  And secondarily, does this also happen to fall into Fair Use under broadcast right?  So it's really complicated.  But you know what?  At the end of the day, it's TV.  And I'm not a TV guy.  And much as I think this would be dreadful for TV, it's not the thing I worry about.  What I worry about is the internet.  And that's where it gets really sticky because there's an attempt that's been put forward  by Microsoft and Yahoo, they've got an industry association there, to extend this to the web  under something called the webcasting right.  And the idea here is that if you host audio visual material or audio material, that you  would get a 50 year monopoly over what people who downloaded the material from you did.  So AOL hosts the content in Twitter.  Twitter might be Creative Commons licensed or copying a bit of Twitter might be a Fair  Use or you might put some public domain stuff in Twitter.  That doesn't matter because AOL would get to tell people who received copies of the  twitcast what they could and couldn't do with it.  And the internet is full of Creative Commons licensed podcasts and podcasts that take from  each other and make new stuff.  So that's where it starts to get really dangerous.  Now these guys, they're trying to like make this only apply to simulcasts from TV and  stuff.  They keep shaving the definition of what a webcast is to try and just fit it into the  TV box.  The problem is that as I said between every meeting the whole world is reinvented.  Every six months we get a whole new kind of podcasting.  Ben Hammersley came up with the word podcasting what 20, 21 months ago.  This was basically invented yesterday.  These guys have been at the treaty for seven years.  By the time it's ratified it'll be five years down the road and they're going to freeze  and amber tomorrow what the definition is of a broadcast, what the definition is of  a podcast.  And podcasts will then get a ceiling.  The podcast will have to be what they are today and can never evolve into something  new tomorrow because these guys will have set the limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it would behoove I would imagine podcasters like us to make sure there are other ways  to get our podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that would be more than having them downloaded through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I mean if you get it through AOL or we offer it through AOL if we offer it through  another channel you could always say well I got it through the other channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah but you know that's great until you want to design something like you know the guys  who scrape podcasts and index them.  At that point you've got something analogous to Google right.  They scrape web pages and index them except the difference is that Google doesn't have  to send a lawyer letter to every website it wants to make a copy of before it makes an  index.  Well in fact we do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're using Podzinger now.  This is something we're launching also this week to index all of the audio on the whole  network.  So they would now they would have to say oh jeez we have permission from not just from  me as the podcaster but from AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for everyone for everyone every podcast they grab.  So you can see that this wouldn't scale right.  Like the rate at which podcasts are created is a lot faster than the rate at which you  know free lawyer hours emerge in the universe right.  It's just not there's just not enough lawyer hours remaining between now and the heap death  of the universe.  What do you think of a feasible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this just an error or is there actually kind of a nefarious goal here.  Are they really just trying to protect television and accidentally impinging on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well what these guys want.  What these guys are saying is that they are the legitimate content distributors on the  internet and that that's what legitimate content looks like on the internet.  And if you don't protect them you don't protect content on the internet and they require this  in order to go forward.  Now I don't think they do require to go forward.  Mark Cuban who actually founded broadcast dot com which is how Yahoo got into this stuff  says that they don't need it right.  You know lots of people say they don't need it.  Basically you've got these two companies that want to make sure that there isn't a third  company that comes along and offers the same service that they do.  They want to lock out the competition.  And when it comes to podcasts they just don't care is what it is.  They don't care if they if in creating these exclusive rights they ended up clobbering  these other people.  It's like all the other copyright fights where for example we say well we'll extend copyright  by another 20 years or 70 years.  And there's this tiny little minority of stuff that anyone wants to buy 70 years after its  creator dies and the rest of it just disappears down the memory hole because no archivist  can make it available if we extend copyrights.  The Supreme Court found 98 percent of the works in copyright aren't available for sale.  They don't have any commercial fortunes and to get at that 2 percent and preserve it we  clobber the other 98 percent.  And that's what's going on here.  These guys make this infinitesimal fraction of the content on the internet but they want  the whole internet redesigned to make it safe for what they think they need to make their  business run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is WIPO deciding this tomorrow?  Well no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So WIPO is continuing their negotiation of it tomorrow.  Now the good news about this webcasting stuff is everyone else in the world thinks it's  a dumb idea.  But the U.S. has got a lot of pull at WIPO and they've been arm twisting people and basically  at every meeting it gets knocked out of the treaty and by the next meeting it's back in  again.  They found some way to get it back in and we've got them on the ropes now.  So it started when we brought this letter signed by Mark Cuban and 20 other webcasters  and other technology organizations opposed to it.  And that put such a fear into them that we actually had copies of the letter stolen off  the literature tables and show up later in the toilets and behind the planters and stuff.  Really just and it knocked it out.  Now we've got a triple barreled return volley for them.  The first barrel is that Creative Commons International Organization, the iCommons organization,  has adopted a resolution opposing this.  So obviously this makes Creative Commons licenses invalid, right?  It doesn't matter that the copyright is cleared for you to reuse it because Creative Commons  doesn't cover the broadcast right.  So Creative Commons is opposed to this and so they've sent this letter on behalf of the  people who created the 160 million Creative Commons licensed works that have emerged since  2003 saying we don't want this.  We're rights holders.  We don't want this.  At the same time, last week a group of some of the largest corporations, libraries, network  providers and public interest groups in America signed a joint letter.  It had like AT&T and EFF and Verizon and all the library associations and everyone to the  USPTO saying you guys keep showing up in Geneva and saying America wants this.  America doesn't want this.  We're America.  We don't want this.  I mean, you know, EFF is presently suing AT&T for a sum of money greater than its entire  cash on hand and net worth, right?  You still are together in this.  And we're still together on this one.  And then the third barrel here is podcasters.  And there is an open letter for podcasters and podcasting organizations like the Twitter  Network to sign on to opposing this.  And you know, the first volley is going to be tomorrow but the letter will remain open  until the next meeting in six months or so.  So you can send an email to Gwen Hins who's the EFF attorney who's just gotten off a plane  in Geneva a couple hours ago.  It's Gwen, G-W-E-N at EFF.org and send her your name, the name of your podcaster podcasting  organization and what country you're in.  And she'll bring that because that's going to be a multinational effort.  She'll bring that to Geneva.  So that's kind of that's my that's my call to action for today.  Send an email to Gwen signing on to this letter and we're going to drive three more nails  into the coffin of this thing.  We might have to, you know, cut its head off, fill its mouth with garlic and sew its lips  shut, bury it at the crossroads at midnight for it to stay dead.  But we're going to knock it down for a while, you know.  Anybody got a wooden stake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silver?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, of course, Twitter will sign that and and I encourage any podcasters listening to  do the same.  So it's Gwen at EFF.org.  G.  Correct.  Yeah.  And you know, it's the kind of things that this would impinge on is what Google announced  this week, which I think is kind of neat.  They're going to their Google news search will go now back 200 years.  And that's the kind of thing you would lose, right, is the ability to kind of just scrape  this ancient stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, here you got stuff that's I don't think that would qualify as an audio  visual work, but no, it's, you know, it's the yeah, it's the right thing.  I mean, basically, it means Google's successor who says, well, we're going to go back through  the histories of broadcasts in the days of Windchill or, you know, they could never do  it.  And, you know, the irony here is that no one's ever shown that there's a problem.  No one's shown that there's like widespread piracy of broadcast signals when they're  retransmitted over the Internet in a way that discourages people from making broadcasts.  Right, right.  Right.  The only example they can point to is this thing called iCRAVE TV.  Do you remember this Canadian outfit about five years ago?  Who in Canada, you could watch American broadcast shows.  And they said, well, you know, we were the broadcasters and we couldn't sue them, except  the broadcasters in this case were ABC.  ABC does make a lot of copyrighted works like the news.  And they were able to, in fact, go and sue them.  Absolutely.  With their with their copyright, just not with their broadcaster hat on.  You know, it's completely specious.  Anyway, I've talked to you often enough about this.  Do you want to stick around for the rest of the show?  Oh, yeah, I'm in for a penny and for a pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. I appreciate it.  So let's let's talk about the big story of the week, which is the Hewlett Packard  Board of Directors basically self-destructing upon finding out that their chairman of the  board, chairwoman of the board, was snooping on them.  There was a leak. The press was talking about stuff that only the H.P.  board would know. The chairwoman, who, by the way, said, I'll quit if they want me to,  but they don't want me to quit.  It's done, isn't it?  Done. Missed done.  Yeah, Missed done.  Is done.  She's not done, apparently.  No, she's not, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dan Gilmour said it called for the resignation of the entire board.  Well, so there's a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns out that the leak apparently is a board member.  But in order to find this board member, Patricia Dunn, who's the chairwoman of H.P.,  hired H.P. investigators, and they used something called pretexting.  In fact, the California state attorney general is now investigating it and is now  investigating it and perhaps will file criminal charges.  Pretexting involves an investigator pretending to be somebody to get their phone records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's not an investigator.  It's just basically me calling up and saying, I'm Bob Parvo from Amalgamated Technologies.  And we're trying to track down, you know, insert whatever it is.  No, no, no, no, no. It's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's worse than that. He said, I am, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Patrick Norton.  This is Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me my phone bill.  Yeah, I like my phone bill.  And they say, well, we need your social.  And they said, oh, yeah, fine.  It's the X, Y, Z.  And they say, OK, fine, we'll send you out your phone bill.  I mean, it's actually pretending to be the other person.  OK, it's impersonating the other person.  The inquiry convinced them that one of the members of the board,  George Keyworth, the second, had in fact been leaking.  Keyworth was a friend and nominee of another board member,  Tom Perkins of the Kleiner Perkins Venture Firm.  Perkins was one of the people investigated.  Perkins was so incensed.  He's resigned from the board.  And so this I mean, and the board is, of course, in turmoil.  Dunn says, well, maybe the maybe maybe I did something wrong,  but unless the board of directors wants me to quit, I'm not going to quit.  And she says they believe in me and they're backing me all the way.  Although Bill Lockyer, Bill Lockyer, the attorney general,  said may may end up prosecuting.  We'll see what happens.  Interestingly enough, nine journalists were also investigated  using this pretexting, including John Markoff of The New York Times,  a couple of reporters from CNET and a couple of reporters from The Wall Street Journal.  Yeah, I think it was crazy.  I mean, that's Watergate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is basically doing pen traces on your political opponents.  Well, and the amazing and the amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As an American citizen, I think Watergate's a little more serious.  It is. It is private.  Snaking around, trying to figure out which of its board members is private enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not. But I can see if you're if you're Perkins.  Wow. I'd be an or Markoff. I'd be furious.  I mean, absolutely.  The investigator called AT&T and impersonated Perkins say  I'd like a record of phone calls.  And they had an email to a web based email account, a free web account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course, Dunn has said that she was, quote,  appalled to hear that the investigators she had hired had lied to get the  the the cause.  But of course, she wasn't appalled enough to actually out it two years ago  when the whole thing happened. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't I didn't fire the gun.  I only loaded it and aimed at and put my finger on the trigger  and waited and gave it to somebody else. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're having a meeting of the board today.  I mean, I have to credit a value ag with this.  The H.P. board will meet on Sunday.  The company declined to say if this is an emergency meeting of directors  to discuss the fallout of the probe is like, yeah, they're just meeting on Sunday  for no particular reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting to be a fly on the wall in that one.  We all wanted to catch up.  Well, you know, they got a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got a leak. Well, that was going to happen.  So that meeting got a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The meeting's already ended and they're actually reconvening again on Monday  because they haven't made a decision yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man, I just imagine the voices being raised in there.  And and you've got to think this comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is a lot.  There's a lot of corporations, you know, in the U.S.  and I love capitalism.  It's a great system.  But you know what I mean?  If if if, you know, with all due respect, whether or not H.P.,  you know, got overzealous and broke in and then the overzealous broke laws.  And it's the journalists involved, I think, have more of a right to be pissed off.  I mean, really, you know, you're better, you bet.  But, you know, compared to, you know, say, you know, the Anaconda Copper mine  leaving a few acres of, you know, sure, a few hundred acres and a few hundred  thousand pounds of toxic substances to leak into the ground in Montana.  It's it's a really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is this week in tech.  We've got to have something to get upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chevron hiring death squads in Nigeria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I bet. Yeah, there we go.  It's not even on the same level as Watergate, really.  I mean, come on, this isn't a public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, but in the sense of in the sense of you have the president  who's hired some investigators to essentially wiretap her political opponents, right?  Or anyone she thinks might be a political opponent.  She's like it in that respect.  It's not it's not that she bugged them.  She did a pen trace on them, which, you know, people who are into  into crypto and security know that signals intelligence is is yet another  important critical way that you can you can frustrate wrong foot your opponents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So predictions here, what's going to happen?  Is done done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  H.P. Gilmore noted that H.P.  stock didn't budge.  So apparently the market doesn't care.  They don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think you've got to see you've got somebody's head's going to roll  and it's got to be done and I'll be a scapegoat somewhere.  I don't think Parkins Perkins is coming back, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to make a prediction that John Mark Ruff will no longer cover  H.P. for the New York Times.  That's a good prediction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if I were Mark Ruff, I would do it.  We did invite John to be on the show.  We couldn't get a hold of him.  But maybe maybe he'll come back and join us at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, you know, maybe he will.  Maybe he'll say, like, look, I can rise above this.  I'll report on the story.  I'm part of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably, you know, par for the course.  I imagine it's not the first time people have tried to investigate him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, New York Times, when they call you, their phone number  shows up as one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they don't want they totally don't want people calling up.  And apparently some of the reporters in the newsroom and the New York Times  have private phones, private, unlisted phones for calling sources  and for sources to call them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. That's that's pretty that's pretty standard stuff.  There's a lot of companies where you're outbound.  Phone number is basically the central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in the case of the New York Times, it's a it's a number  that doesn't ring anywhere.  So that if someone star sixty nine is like a whistleblower,  they don't get to find out who that who is just calling a total spoof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually pretty interesting.  So that's that's that's what if they had to have those alterations  like custom done to their to their PBX PBX system?  I'm sure they did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it was before before Asterix. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before that became trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now it's just a line of code.  Other stories, Amazon made a big announcement on Thursday.  Unbox their new video store.  It will sell videos.  They say DVD quality, although I don't know who would want to download  a DVD quality video. I mean, that's going to be huge.  From over 30 movie and TV studios, everybody pretty much except Disney.  And they will.  Interesting, because Disney, of course, is the number one shareholder.  Steve Jobs, who is expected to make something similar  sort of announcement on Tuesday.  It's interesting. Unbox uses, of course, and Corey will like this,  the lovely Windows DRM copy, copy restriction, as Corey calls it.  When you download a movie or show, Unbox sends a second download file  quote optimized for window media compatible portable devices.  So you'll get in effect to two copies of it.  It keeps track of them.  And of course, before you can play them, you've got to check in and say,  do I actually own this?  Won't play on iPods.  They're charging between 799 and 1499 for this and rentals for 399.  I don't suppose any of you have tried this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't tried this, but I've used similar services.  I mean, essentially, this is this is the same thing that Cinema  Now and MovieLinq have been on for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was not impressed with Cinema Now.  Well, what's the last time you looked at?  Well, they added more movies because that's one of the problems was they had,  you know, only awful movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll have you. I'd say in over a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And then you get bad quality, right?  I mean, the quality is not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quality is actually pretty good.  It's outstanding for NTSC.  And they actually started offering.  They actually off  movie like actually started offering  a while back, actually HD,  quality, widescreen versions, HD stretching it.  But there are worse things.  I don't think you can actually ask me.  MovieLinq's MovieLinq actually isn't pretty much got put out of business  by Cinema Now, but Cinema Now actually has some pretty good quality stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get the 79 episodes of the original Star Trek, which, by the way,  celebrated its 40th anniversary on Friday.  Happy anniversary, Star Trek.  None of us were old enough probably to really pay much attention.  I'm the oldest and I was only nine when it came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you were around.  We're still psychos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't remember.  You know, it's funny, I do not remember watching Star Trek.  It was only on for three years in prime time.  And I don't remember watching it till much later when it came back.  I don't know who watched it.  Apparently nobody. They canceled it.  Inside Man, the Spike Lee movie will be available.  Failure to launch Walk the Line, V for Vendetta, Ben Hur, Poseidon Adventure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Office Base is up there for 13 bucks.  You know, it's you know, don't lose it.  Don't lose the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my big problem with it.  I mean, it's just, you know, you're really limited to what you can.  Can you burn it? I don't think you can even burn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The last memory serves that those rights are restricted  to the copyright holder to determine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could somebody could theoretically offer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're like, you know, Three Kings, South Park, Matrix, Firefly.  Right. Pretty interesting selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So as we're talking about copyright, did you see that?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir, I kind of feel like I'm about to channel Dvorak here with Gunnar.  That's terrible.  But it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, so like I wouldn't want it, but I don't.  Well, it's it's toxic waste, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, so you can you can sit you're sitting there in your living room  and you're like, well, I want to do the honest thing.  I don't want to.  I don't want to download the torrent of this, which you can do in a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hours of almost all those hours or a couple of days, depending on what it is.  If it doesn't have to be if it doesn't have to be a popular torrent  that's hosted by a lot of people who have decent bandwidth, it can take days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But all of Star Wars, all of Star Trek, rather.  I mean, that's pretty straightforward to get off of.  And you know what?  You can certainly get it as fast as you can get a Netflix movie.  So, you know, that's got to be that should be like the floor, right?  The floor should be this should be at least as useful to me  as the thing I can get for free, dishonestly.  And then and then it should go up from there, right?  They should say, well, if we're going to charge you 13 bucks,  we should give you more than the warm glow of.  Well, you're not you're not breaking the law.  It should be like we're giving you something that's better than the torrent.  So everything you can do with the torrent, you should be able to do with a downloaded  file, like put it on your PVR or stick it on your iPod or back it up to your hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think torrents are the big threat.  I think the DVD is the big threat for this.  Roughly the same price.  You get a higher quality movie with extras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's that, too.  And you know, for the for the studios, this is what really freaks me out,  is that the studios are this dumb because talk about cutting your own throat.  Right.  In 10 or 20 years, when when you've got everyone who's a movie  watcher suddenly has to be a Microsoft customer in order to watch their movies.  How are the studios going to negotiate with Microsoft?  Right. What are they going to say to them?  Like, well, you know, we decided we want you to do the following things with your  DRM that open it up the way that the record industry is trying to do with Apple.  Right now, the movie studios are going to know that Microsoft can laugh at them.  Right. It's like, well, what are you going to do?  You're going to stop distributing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think they'll send so on Tuesday?  Do you think Apple will announce a similar deal and then giving the movie  companies at least two different DRM solutions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  The every rumor that's in the itch again, it's rumor.  We're not going to know until Tuesday, but everything I've heard says that  Steve was not able to get purchase rights, but was only able to get download rights.  What's the difference?  I understand what's in rental.  Well, basically, there's like rental, basically rental versus versus ownership rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I download it and I can only watch it so many times.  Self-destruct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, you know, there's there's there's basically there's there's  there's purchasing and there's there's rental.  So, you know, you get a license to watch it for X number of days after you first,  you know, start watching it or hours, depending on what the title is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate that, too.  I mean, that's that's really a case where Corey, where people are  just going to go to the BitTorrents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if it's well, yeah, but if it's if it's if you're sitting there, right,  and you're you've been you've been terrified by the whole idea that that,  you know, if I download stuff and I and I Corey, you'll probably identify  the use of the filthy, nasty BitTorrents.  If I use the filthy, nasty BitTorrents, name the comic book artist  that was referring to it as that lovingly, I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's Warren Ellis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  You know, I use the filthy, nasty BitTorrents to download a movie.  There's a lot of people who are scared of that either because of the,  you know, extraordinary and almost comical number of lies in the lawsuits  that have been filed by the RAA and, you know, the smaller number  that have been filed by the MPAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also a small fraction of the overall users.  I mean, only the the Uber geeks are I mean, let's face it.  I mean, we can all do that.  But really, that's a narrow, slim slice of the overall population.  I think that's exactly Torrents.  Or I think you're grossly mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen panels where I've seen a half dozen teenagers  basically flat out state they don't buy music anymore.  They don't really understand why they should buy music.  And and had like a teenager basically saying, yeah, I get all my music  off of insert name of peer to peer site here,  but they're spending 200 bucks a month on ringtones and cell phone service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's true.  I think.  But but I think that these these kind of services really catered  to different kinds of people.  I mean, for example, you know, my girlfriend would never, you know,  it doesn't even know what BitTorrent is, but she knows she wants like the latest  episodes of like CSI Miami, so she can just go to iTunes and get them.  And the fact that they're slightly lower quality,  it doesn't really bother her.  The fact that she can't do anything with them doesn't really matter to her  because she's not doing anything with them anyway,  apart from just watching them on her computer.  Yeah. And so and so it's like it's really easy for her.  Just go pay a couple of bucks, get those.  That's all great. Rather than having to like I mean, it's like immediate  gratification rather than having to go fish around a torrent site,  install a torrent client, go and download it.  It might take a couple of hours as opposed to just just having it there  and having it really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a fair point to that.  But, you know, when when you do get these things that are slightly milder,  although, you know, still have restrictions downstream,  that's actually in some ways more problematic because you get people  who end up sinking a lot of money into a platform,  not realizing how locked in they're getting.  So, you know, like iTunes, right?  You know, maybe maybe it costs you maybe it costs you 100 bucks  to switch to a creative device.  And who's to say that the iPod is going to be the best one forever?  I mean, you know, anyone remember the Quadras or the performers?  You know, Apple, like Apple has a spotty record here.  So you switch to a creative device in five years.  Maybe the device is 100 bucks.  But if you spent 200 bucks on music, you've tripled the cost.  The device because you can't take your Apple stuff with you.  You know, I was I was foolish enough to buy a lot of audio books  through the iTunes Music Store because I'm I really love audio books.  And I'm fundamentally a pretty honest guy.  So now that I'm in the middle of this migration to Ubuntu,  I've dedicated a whole machine to just ripping my audio books using audio hijack.  It's going to take 40 days. Oh, my. Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in the same boat.  I have a ton of audio books in the audible format.  They're copy protected books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, it's it's it's, you know, in some ways, your girlfriend  will has it even worse, right, because she's going to end up buying all this stuff.  And then and then, you know, later on, she's not going to be able  to get the best deal that's going.  She's not going to be able to switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think what you mean, Corey, is that I've got the worst deal  because I'm going to be the mother of the converted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no different than somebody who bought a hundred eight track tapes  and who now can't use the eight track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you could tape your eight tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Assuming you could find an eight track player.  But that's that's a matter of audio hijack your books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not that different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is. Arguably, I think it is because it's illegal  to make devices that are specifically about ripping iTunes,  that the the equivalent of the phonograph player that has the cassette  deck built into it or the dubbing deck is unlawful when you got DRM involved.  You can't you can't start a business based on helping people  get unlocked from a lock in anymore.  I think that's pretty different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, maybe maybe it's closer to being a problem than we think, according.  You might have seen this article, Will, in The Guardian, the Sunday paper,  or actually the Observer.  The iPod may be on on the way out, losing its cool iPod sales have dropped  pretty dramatically over the last three quarters.  Research study by the Zandy group in New York said that consumers  are starting to think it's not cool.  Everybody has an iPod. It's not so cool anymore.  It's kind of mom and dad's MP3 player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's really a valid point, isn't it?  I mean, I remember when I first got an iPod, like back when it was,  you know, the first five gig ones, it was the coolest thing on the planet.  And everyone you showed it to was like, Oh, my word, what the heck is that?  But now you've got every every, you know,  everybody in the world has got an iPod.  So is there really any cache in it anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are a bit chavvy.  That's probably a good term for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is chavvy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chavvy is a it's like a UK term for  sort of it doesn't really have an equivalent in the States.  There is no there is.  It's like it's like trailer park.  Trailer park in the States is chav in England.  A little. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. We've got a new word and a very useful word, I think.  So it's kind of funny because I was like, crikey, it's a chav.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was on a panel.  How now?  There's a word I haven't heard in a long time.  Say again, Patrick, you want a panel?  The boffins say that's naff.  Oh, God.  Bad, bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, how do you spell chavvy?  C-H-A-V-E-Y.  VVY. Double VY.  C-H-A-V-V-Y.  All right, because it's got a noun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Burberry stopped making plaid baseball caps because they were too chavvy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use this word in a sentence.  Corey just has.  So baseball hats pretty chavvy.  I think baseball hats will be back soon.  Right. Right along with the plaid iPod.  So you were on a panel, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on a brief, like pundit argument thing on a television show.  And there were two people there who are, you know, valid industry experts, you know,  those kind of people who, like, apparently never meet each other face to face.  But they they find out about each other's children every time they show up on another  television show to argue things via satellite feed.  Yeah. And and they were like, oh, preposterous.  The Zune could never take market share away from from Apple.  And I'm sitting there going, man, Microsoft's a three point company, you know,  all it takes is the right combinations of, you know,  just cheap price, market change, you know, things becoming chavvy.  Is that the right use of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the Zune is chavvy out of the box, isn't it?  I mean, I don't think the Zune is cooler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First of all, don't don't use that word.  I think it's chavvy.  Yeah, that's that's pretty much it.  And two, it's like, you know, the funny thing is, is, you know,  Internet Explorer was a mess, right.  But version three point oh and people like Netscape who?  Oh, they're the ones that copy dig, right.  And nobody even remembers that they were the browser, you know, for,  you know, years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a huge burden on Steve Jobs at this point on Tuesday,  not only to counter what's going on with Amazon, but also to prove that the iPod  isn't that word, but in fact has a future.  And I think it'll be very interesting to see what he comes out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to see if they finally do subscriptions for iTunes.  I think it's the one thing that I think it's the one thing that that the,  you know, the 14 or 17 different WMV based competitors to iTunes really have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People do those music subscriptions.  Do you know anybody who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually I actually tried one out.  I tried when I was testing out urge when I was doing a review of that.  And I got to say, you know, I still have the subscription,  Leo, because you know, it's for 15 bucks a month.  I have a pretty, you know, I have a decent, you know, reasonable quality music.  And I was downloading stuff that I would never, I mean, I have somebody who owns  what 700 CDs, so it's not like I'm afraid of going out and buying the stuff.  I've, you know, I never really got into iTunes paid downloads because I thought  being locked in the AAC was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now you're locked in the Windows DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what?  If it's like it's two in the morning and I want to go screw around and listen to a  bunch of music, I can do it without having to, you know, without knowing the band  and being able to sample it.  It's kind of a nice environment.  More importantly, I can do it legally, which is an issue given, you know, I just  I just believe in artists being paid for their music.  And I can also sit down and I can just search around and for 15 bucks a month,  you know, at one point I downloaded like, you know, something like 400 gigabytes of  music off this, you know, then wipe the hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, so Mr. Ubuntu, what do you do for your music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I I'm kind of at the limit of all the music I can absorb at this point.  I, you know, I ripped all my CDs and I had any music subscription for a while until  they started capping downloads.  And every now and again, I'll buy a CD or, you know, someone will put me to a web  page where there's a sample of something.  But I think that one of the amazing things about iTunes and MP3 and digital  music is how deep it's let us get into our own collections.  Like, you know, at this point I got all my music rated and sorted out and I've got  literally if I listen to music for like five or six hours a day, I've got 40 or  50 days worth of music and having my playlist loop every 50 days, just not a  big deal for me.  So I don't, I don't, I think that, you know, we, the RAA spent a lot of time  worrying about what would happen when people get pirate new releases and kind of  miss that once we could just delve into our own collections and, you know, when  our buddy gives us a song every now and again, that kind of thing, that's always  been within the scope of legality.  And we just never lose any of that, that that makes a whole new kind of problem  for them that they've never really had to consider before.  Kind of like the music or the newspaper people worrying about whether bloggers  are or aren't journalists, but, and missing the fact that like the really important  thing is that Google does a better job with classified ads than the New York  Times does.  And when all the classified ads go to Google, then they can't afford to sell a  newspaper for 50 cents anymore.  I mean, Craigslist.  Craigslist, Google and eBay, right?  Between the three of them, who needs a, who needs a newspaper?  You know?  And so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying people are going to stop buying music, period.  Will Harris, do you, you're a young bloke.  How do you, how do you, how do you top off your music collection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, it kind of varies.  I am big on, um, sort of having my friends recommend stuff to me because mostly,  uh, my friends are far more hip than me.  And so they can usually recommend stuff that that's, that's pretty good.  And they'll lend me CDs and you rip those or whatever.  I'm wondering why people don't pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People like you and maybe Corey and Patrick just don't listen to  something like Pandora and who needs music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.  I don't mind Pandora, but, um, I tend to find, I mean, I have a, like the  specific bands that I follow.  Um, and so as soon as like the new release for that comes out, I'm straight  on to buy it and chances are I probably buy it on iTunes because you remember,  I mean, there's an example a couple of weeks ago, there was a new album out by  one of my favorite bands and I'd forgotten that it had come out and I was just  about to go and take a trip.  There was like a four hour drive.  And so I was like, uh, rather than mess around, I'm just going to go  and get it off iTunes.  I think that's one of the reasons online music, I went and grabbed it.  I've got it straight away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's point of access.  You get it when you want it right away.  You don't have to make a trip out.  Now, how did you get the new dropkick movie Murphy's a CD?  Did you go to the store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yes, actually just check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an interesting question though for, for Will and for Patrick, if there  were no DRM, would you spend less money at these stores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  High quality, not just 128 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause if they were, I mean, if, if you got exactly the same files, except  you could copy them more, I mean, DRM is supposed to stop people from, from  stealing, but it really only affects people who buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the cool things about, uh, if you take a look at something  I've been playing around with again recently is E music, which is something  I was around when it first started up.  Cause it's, it's reasonable quality.  It's it's copy protection free and they have the entire epitaph catalog.  So, you know, there's got albums I wanted to ducked in there and, and, uh,  so I think the answer is yes, Corey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly how that's, that's absolutely right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, the, the problem is the rights holders do not currently feel  comfortable with signing over, you know, epitaph does it, but Hey, they're, you  know, they're punk rock, right.  Or they were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, they say that they're worried about people stealing from them.  But when you say, but hold on a second, DRM only affects the people who buy from  you, they go, well, you know, what we really want to be able to do is segment  the market and all these, these new ways where we can say, you know, well, this  is music you can only listen to on Wednesdays and it's 25% off.  You know, the best example I heard of this was this, this guy from the MPA once  said, well, I want to design this television standards so that we can charge  you a different amount of money for a show that you can receive in one room  while you're sitting in another room.  So like, you know, being able to like move it from your receiver to in your  basement to your bedroom.  And he said, you know, cause that has value and if it has value, we should be  able to charge for it.  And he called this the next generation business model.  My joke is I call that a urinary tract infection, right?  It used to get, used to sit down in your living room.  This stuff would all just flow free and easy.  And now every time you press the button, it's a little painful drip, you know,  two cents to watch it in another room.  15 cents if you don't want it to be rentware, 18 cents to burn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Consumers do not want this.  This is completely upstream against what consumers want.  Yeah.  I think they're like, what do consumers want then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, because obviously consumers don't want that.  They don't want to relinquish control and they don't want to, they don't want  micro payments every time they listen to a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free flow.  Do you use Corey's metaphor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, sure.  They basically want, you know, they want the freedom to move their content from  their CDs to wherever they want to listen to them.  They don't want to have to pay additional for it, which I think would be wonderful.  But at what point do the, does the recording industry, you know, what point  is the recording industry is there suddenly the sound of angels and the heavenly light  and the, you know, the Buddha's rays shine down and an executive goes, we have  to give the music away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, well, you know, I actually, the, it's funny  because a lot of the musicians are getting there, even if the recording  companies aren't a lot of the musicians are saying stuff like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, a lot of them signed contracts where they're not going to have these rights.  So it's just a matter of a few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you think, do you think musicians will eventually just completely  bypass the record companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, or they're going to, or they're going to get the ones that have cloud,  the ones that have cloud are going to make the record companies do what they want.  You know, in Canada, they just had all of the record labels that aren't owned by  American companies walk out of the Canadian recording industry, uh, Canadian  recording and industry association and found their own association that basically  says, we don't sue fans.  We don't do DRM.  We don't think that the internet should be broken.  Um, and, uh, that's, that's kind of their three founding principles led by the guy  from bare naked ladies, Steve page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause Korea is really, is really just a, a client state of the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although they claim to be Canadian, right?  They show up in parliament and they go, we're here on behalf of Canadian  companies like universal and time Warner and Sony, right?  And all the Canadian companies are like, wait a second.  Those guys are Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very interesting.  This is always, but this has always been the game.  I mean, you know, think about, I mean, you know, that's the pathetic thing about  politics is, you know, we did something at border on the political on DLTV of a  few weeks ago and got some really fascinating, you should never talk about  politics, it's technology.  And it's like, Hey dude, um, you know, technology gets regulated by politicians.  Wake up.  You know, this is, you know, the DMCA is a pathetic evil document.  The fact that nothing's going to, you know, nothing's probably ever going to  enter in a public domain, you know, in my lifetime or my children's lifetime, you  know, thanks to some clever lawyers and some, you know, people who know who to  back and what, you know, who to pay money to and who to take to dinner and who to  make promises to.  And as the result, you know, as end users, we have fewer and fewer rights.  I mean, think about it at some point, it's going to be impossible to add  modern, you know, more modern literature.  It's like the whole idea of like the North anthology of literature basically  stops.  Um, at what point Corey, 1928.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think 20, so, you know, here's a actually perfect example.  So two of my favorite albums of all times are Sergeant Pepper's Lonely  Hearts Club Band and the Beach Boys Pet Sounds.  And, uh, and both of those albums are made out of like all this found sound  and cut up music and they have lots of, what's what we would think of today is  like noise music or noise rock built in.  You know, you think about the, for the benefit of Mr.  Kite or that huge crashing court at the end of day in the life.  So this, these guys, they made an album called the Beachills, Sergeant,  uh, Sergeant Pet Sounds, uh, which was just a noise rock remix of, of  Sergeant Pepper's and Pet Sounds.  Is this the Clayton Counts?  Uh, the Clayton Counts.  Clayton Counts.  And EMI is, is suing Clayton Counts, who's the producer.  He didn't even do it.  Totally non-commercial.  This guy doesn't have any money.  He's, he's, you know, just moved to Texas to take care of a sick relative.  I said, like, when can I phone you?  And he's like, uh, I don't have a phone anymore.  Um, and, and so they're suing him and they want him to turn over the  IP addresses of everyone who downloaded it so they can go after us.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As if he would have that by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, maybe his webmaster does, who knows, right?  But, but, you know, when you, when you, when you think about it, here you have  these companies that got rich reselling the product of the Beatles and the Beach  Boys who were able to make noise rock out of found sound and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those were sounds they went out and recorded themselves, Corey.  It wasn't like they went out and said, yeah, but even, I mean, what's the larger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  issue is, does it, does it cost you any sales?  I mean, they did the same thing with DJ danger mouse with the gray album and did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it and with DJ BC with the beat, with the beastles, but it doesn't cost you any  sales actually, you know, the Beatles took music, they took tape and they cut it up  and cut it back together again for Mr.  Kite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they were, they were like, and you can't tell me that if they didn't  have see samplers and sequencers that they wouldn't have been doing exactly  what danger mouse and the rest of those guys are doing now or the entire rap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  industry. But you know, what's interesting is, is again, you know, what happens to  the Beatles take the Beatles, take them from 1968 looking at, you know, four track  recorders as being this Ampex four track recorders, right?  They pushed them harder than anybody else in the planet.  Right.  And basically it was like Brian Wilson and the Beatles sitting in dark rooms in a  strange competition with each other, using the available technology and pushing it  out to the fullest.  Right.  What would have happened to them today?  Would they be rap artists?  Would they be, you know, doing remixes?  Would they be doing mashups?  And within the context of the studio, would they even be studio artists as we  know them now?  Right.  That might even be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A better question.  The EMA, EMI is certainly within its rights.  It's legal rights to do this.  I mean, it just, just shows you though, how stupid they are about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've taken leave of their senses.  I mean, it's just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't.  It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, this is the, it's basically.  I'm just offering a contract.  Well, yeah, no kidding.  Sell the record.  It's funny because I actually had this fight with EMI once at a European  presidency event in London where I talked about Danger Mouse and she said,  Oh, but that story's got a happy ending.  We hired Danger Mouse to produce an album for us.  And like, well, you know, we always hear how copyright is great because it ended  patronage, right?  Where only you could only make art if the Pope said you could.  So now we've got it.  So you can only make art if EMI says you can't, you know, I don't see that as a  huge improvement, you know, you get the occasional nice ceiling when the Pope says  you, when the Pope's in charge of art, you get the occasional, you know, Beatles  album when, when EMI is in charge of art.  Wouldn't it be better to have less people in charge of art, more decentralized  decision making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He produced the Gnarls, Gnarls Barkley.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, before that he did a mashup album for them.  No, he is half of Gnarls Barkley.  Danger Mouse.  So it's, I mean, it's, I feel like I'm Mr.  Bad Vibes today, but, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unhappy mood.  You're taking the Dvorak's place.  It's fine.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, I'm the designated Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody always is.  I'll tell you something that'll really get you upset.  Don't take your Ubuntu laptop on an airplane because even though it's Ubuntu, if  it's a, if it's a power book, both Qantas, Korean airlines, and now I hear from  Alex Lindsay, Virgin are not allowing Dell or Apple laptops on their planes.  You can put them in the check luggage.  Virgin too.  Oh no.  That's what Alex said.  He said that he was about to get on a Virgin flight and they said, sorry, if  you have a Macintosh or a Dell laptop.  Now, now this is what's really crazy.  Put it in your checked luggage.  Let it blow up in the hole.  Much safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Qantas is actually my preferred airline.  That really, well, luckily I just switched to a stink pad, but man, that sucks.  It's just insane.  It says, you know, I think that air travel, I think for air travel, what they  should do is strip us naked, shoot us with tranquilizer darts, chain, actually,  I got a better idea.  Ninja airlines, right?  In the middle of the night, a ninja sneaks into your room and blow darts you.  Saran wraps you, sticks a routing tag onto you, packs your suitcase for you,  ships you to the other side, takes you to your hotel, slips you into the covers,  unpacks your suitcase, stands in the window of your hotel, blow darts you with  the antidote, slips silently out the window while you stretch your arms, yawn  and go, I've woken up in Hong Kong.  That, that would be a perfectly safe airline.  I see people who had blow dart allergies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see a new Cory Doctorow show story.  Any minute now.  Fantastic idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it would soak up all that excess ninja capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We certainly have quite a bit of that.  Uh, just don't fly, I guess, Qantas, Virgin or a career airlines.  Uh, it's just kind of hard to believe they could be that goofy.  Uh, Tuesday we'll have another, uh, Microsoft, uh, patch Tuesday.  No major critical flaws, although there is a critical flaw in word 2000, a zero  day exploit, just to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.  That's just like critical flaw in word.  It's just like, what a bizarre concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, you know, what could, what could, anyway, I don't know exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Spell check is broken!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Well, and here comes Mr.  Bad vibes again.  One of the reasons there's nothing big in this one is they managed to  rush, uh, you know, the fastest patch in the history of Windows had last week,  which was their DRM patch, right?  Like if you've got a zero day Windows exploit, wait till Tuesday, but if the  DRM gets broken, it's coming down the pipe today!  That's a good point, isn't it?  They don't make, they don't waste any time on that, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually they, they, they, it's not even, it's not even that they had to  create a patch, you just know they've, they've basically have known their flaws  in that much better than the operating system upgrades available, you know, I  mean, it's, it's just, it's just, it's a matter of actually, and it's, it's some  of their partners have and some of their partner haven't, I've been told, uh,  implemented the patch for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the, uh, just for what it's worth the day after the, uh, Windows DRM patch  came out, I'm told that Windows, that, that it was cracked too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't take long anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, uh, you know, the world has this efficiency of Norwegian, board Norwegian  teenagers that no DRM will ever stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's hope they never get together with the ninjas or we're in deep, deep trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we could have very secure, overnight mythical, air dart.  They're not going to bother suing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're just going to kill you in your bed.  In your bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, if you're a second life user, you might want to log on.  Your password has been changed for your protection.  Uh, somebody hacked into second life last week and stole a database  containing every single name and address of every single second life member.  And apparently the passwords too, although they're encrypted just in case second life  is, uh, is reassigning your passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got, sorry, well we're on the topic.  There was, um, did you see the guys that got arrested for illegal arms  dealing online in game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could sell game arms.  What game was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was, uh, in a game called legends of Mia, which is fairly sort of mainstream,  especially in the East.  And one of the, uh, one of the guys that actually worked on the game, uh, basically  manufactured, um, you know, through the programming tools, all these high end  weapons in a spare time, sold them to two of his mates who then sold them for,  uh, for currency on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have an escalation going on in Mia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And so there's all these guys, you know, racing to get the best weapons being  produced by, by this guy on the development team who eventually got caught  and, uh, and holed up in front of the lead.  The metaverse is not far off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really isn't.  I think in a lot of ways, these online worlds are getting closer  and closer to the real, real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've been collecting these stories cause I'm doing the keynote at  state of play this year with, with Neil Stevenson, we're going to be talking  about the metaverse and in Singapore.  And this stuff is just, just coming every day.  There's more and more of these things, you know, people getting murdered over  having their sword stolen and those kinds of, those kinds of, of, um, weapons  where they, they're limited supply, especially the ones that are created  early in the game and then they, the people who run the game go, you know what?  They're really bad for gameplay.  They're way too powerful and they get taken out of circulation, but you know,  there's, there's two or three that we're still, you know, people  managed to score before then.  There's all kinds of weird stories that happen with that.  They, the, the stuff that shakes out when you add scarcity to video games is so  bizarre and cool and, and such amazing.  It is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, uh, Stevenson really kind of invented all this with snow crash  and the metaverse.  And how does he feel about this?  Does he, does he feel like he was a prophet or, uh, is he surprised?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He certainly articulated it and took it to a, you know, a really nice place where  it was all about amusing yourself rather than, you know, commerce or trader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know how he feels about it.  I'm looking forward to it.  He doesn't do a lot of public speaking.  He's, he's, um, for someone who is as eloquent as he is when he writes, um,  he, he's a little hesitant when he speaks.  He, um, although the last time I saw him speak, he was, he was much better,  but the first time when he won his Hugo award, he might've just been overwhelmed,  but he was really, uh, he was really tongue tied, which I was very surprised  by it's like, uh, William Gibson or, or, or Bruce Sterling or both really,  really articulate when they write or also super articulate when they talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bruce is a heck of a talker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think we ever were able to get Neil.  We tried really hard to get him on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't, he basically doesn't do television.  I've been told.  Yeah.  I mean, have you ever seen his webpage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  It was a blog.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  His webpage, which is just, it's just, it's a page on the well.  It's all like just ASCII flowing down the page and it's basically 22  paragraphs of why he doesn't want you to send an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I went, I was at the science fiction museum in Seattle,  Paul Allen's a science fiction museum a couple of weeks ago and they have,  uh, I didn't realize this, but Kryptonomica, the quick silver trilogy was hand  written within pencil on, on yellow pads.  And they have some of the yellow pads there.  It's kind of mind blowing to see that size of a, not pencil quill pen.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  They have the quill pen and they have the nibs.  I don't know.  I think it's fountain pen now.  Cause he had, he had also a way of cartridges of fountain pen cartridges.  It's kind of a mind blowing to think that you could write  something like that by hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something, there's something cool about that.  For centuries that way, Leo.  But there's something cool about the physicality of, of writing that way.  You know, uh, Linda Berry, the cartoonist, she's, she started writing these  novels and they were really well received and she got this huge advance  for a novel that eventually became, it was called cruddy.  It's an amazing book and she was totally blocked on it.  And she, um, she took out her cartoon in his paint brush and she painted the  novel, uh, five words to a page and big swoopy letters and had a manuscript  like seven feet tall, but that was how she got out of her writer's blog.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot, you know, a lot of writers say they like that physical creation.  You, you, you use a word processor though, right?  Cory, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh hell yeah.  No, I, uh, I learned to type before I learned to write cursively.  I've never written anything longer than a shopping list with a pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's physically painful for me to actually use a pen and paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say I'm, I'm, I'm Amish for QWERTY.  You know, it's just, it's like, it's, you know, they'll, they'll replace it  with phones and they'll replace it with, you know, text, speech to tax and all  kinds of other stuff.  And I'm just like, I've got so much muscle memory in my hands for, for  composing that I'll never be able to switch away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50 years from now in the science fiction museum, the Cory Doctor exhibit  is saying he used this keyboard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He couldn't even switch it to Vortac.  He was actually typing QWERTY.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a hundred years from now it'll be, and he used these hands cryogenically  preserved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excellent.  Hey, before we go on, let me, uh, let's pause for a commercial break.  Shall we?  I never thought I'd be saying that on Twitter.  We're so glad finally to get to Dell on the air on, uh, the  Twitter podcast network.  Dell has been a part of our lives, uh, for many, many years.  I know Patrick, you remember we use Dell computers, uh, on the  set of the screensavers.  We used it, uh, Dell computers from day one.  In fact, even going farther back to other TV shows, Dell reliability, Dell  service and support really made the difference for us.  And that's why I'm really glad to have them on the show.  I want to remind you about the Dell.  We have a number of Dell picks on our Dell page.  It's twit.tv slash Dell, uh, among others, the Dell XPS four 10.  I'm really, I'm really liking this system, a good looking system  that is very flexible.  It's one of the reasons I picked this for the show for our, for our launch.  Uh, here's something you can start with a very reasonable cost with a penny MD,  but you can all go all the way up to a core two, a duo at 2.66 gigahertz.  Depending on your needs and what you want.  And of course, Dell has always made the best monitors and peripherals.  So you've got a great package.  I encourage you to check out the Dell specials, our twit picks of the week,  every week, and I'll add some more, uh, as the week goes by to twit.tv slash.  Dell.  And there's some, uh, actually some good little specials in there, little,  little things we've, we've dug up for you.  Twit.tv slash Dell.  And thanks still for your support of the twit podcasting network.  We of course also want to welcome visa.  They've been here for a couple of weeks now.  Uh, I love this.  Uh, and I, and I, I owe a kind of a nod and a thanks to Paul  Colligan and his blog, uh, paulcolligan.com Paul in which Paul examines  the reality of profitable podcasting.  And, uh, he noted that we started where our visa ads last week on, uh,  this week in tech and I love it.  He said, um, advertising has entered twit and guess what?  The show is still great.  The growth, the groove is still there.  Nobody looks at Leo and company sellouts.  In fact, he says he, uh, he went out and bought lunch using his visa card that day.  So thank you.  I appreciate it.  Paul visas on really to remind you that they are, are, uh, working very hard to  protect you when you buy online with visa, you are absolutely protected and in more  ways than you might realize, of course, you know, that, uh, they back up all  purchases online, but they also use a very sophisticated fraud prevention  technologies to make sure that your purchases online or off are, are, are  protected, that you're not being defrauded, that you're not being ripped off.  They call this, uh, continuous monitoring.  They use some very sophisticated software to keep an eye on your patterns.  And if there are sudden changes, they call you and say, Hey, did you do that?  Did you buy this?  And it's happened to me and I, and I really appreciate it.  It's a great early warning system.  These are, remind you to sign your visa card on the signature panel.  Choose a pin that's unique and secret.  Don't write it on the card.  Memorize it.  And do check your statements online or via paper.  I use online statements.  It's a little easier, uh, regularly, uh, to make sure that your account is  being used the way you intended.  Visa better, safer money.  Life takes visa.  So I do really want to thank everybody for joining us and remind, uh, people  that, uh, uh, right at the beginning, we talked about emailing gwen at EFF.org.  That's true for podcasters.  What if you're not a podcaster, Corey?  What, how should people get involved in the WIPO battle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you're not, if you're not a podcaster, the best way to get involved  is to get in touch with, uh, your trade representative, if you're not an American  and tell them how you feel about it or your government.  Um, the other thing to get to do in general is to get involved with EFF and  like-minded groups all around the world in the UK.  Well, I'm sure you know, uh, org, the open rights group and in Canada, the, uh,  org is the, the Canadian one online rights, Canada.  Uh, and, uh, and you know, there's, there's, um, bits of freedom in, in, uh,  in Netherlands and there's groups like this all over the world.  And of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there should be a directory for this because we have listeners all over the  world. I'd love to send people to one spot where they could find their local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great project.  You know, maybe I'll find an intern to put something like that together for me  this year.  And you know, there's the other thing is there's every campus now can have its  own chapter of free culture.org.  And we're just starting the first one up at USC on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's free culture.org.  That's a neat idea.  Sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a campus organization.  It came out of the Swarthmore kids who got sued by Debold for publishing that  whistleblower memo where, where, you know, they, they Debold, a whistleblower,  Debold basically said they were committing this electoral fraud and Debold said,  well, yeah, it's true, but the memo was a copyrighted work.  You can't circulate it and sued these Swarthmore kids.  And when they won, they founded this group called free culture.  And the free culture kids on different campuses have done everything from like  organized art galleries and live shows or creative commons, licensed music,  to street demonstrations, to the free culture.  And while you guys have been trying to do, our kids have been trying to do a  thing where they're going to get 10,000 world of warcraft players to switch to  the Chinese server and then paste in web pages that are blocked by the great  firewall of China when people ask them to just all kinds of really creative,  amazing stuff.  They're really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.  I see there's one in Toronto too.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you in LA now, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  Yeah.  I'm in Angelino.  I'm looking for some unnecessary cosmetic surgery just to cement my  relationship with the city.

Transcript:  It's a really disturbing image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to do eyelids, breasts, but what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can, I was actually, I was thinking about Smappo.  It's kind of like Botox, right?  Except it's, it's instead of getting Brazilian wax, you get, you get smallpox  or Smappo and, and you never grow hair anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's do it.  Are there any unpleasant side effects, sausage fingers, flatulence,  anything I should worry about?  Dying.  Dying.  Well, you never do have hair again.  That's the good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have sterility, dying plagues, horrible sores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did spend a bunch of time in England and have you been reading the Quicksilver books?  Steve, I started rereading Quicksilver yesterday, the Stevenson book.  So, yeah, they're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I couldn't, I couldn't get through it.  I tried, I, you know, I'm a huge fan.  I just, for some reason, I couldn't get through it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  They're like a curry.  They're, they, they start off really mild and, and, and you might, might even  find them bland in places and then they rebound on you.  You know, your mouth is getting uncomfortably hot.  The more you read it's, they're really good.  They're really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Folks, thanks for joining us.  Will Harris is at bit-tech.net.  If you want to read his reviews, a great place to go to find out about PCs.  And it's a real enthusiast site.  Of course, we love Patrick's dl.tv and Cranky Geeks and you can catch that at dl.tv.  I see PC Magazine's giving you a nice big plug now on the front page.  That's a good thing.  Exciting stuff.  That's a good thing.  Corey Doctorow, uh, EFF.org if you're in the U S anywhere else you'd like people to  go, I guess, craphounds.com.
