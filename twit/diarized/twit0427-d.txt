No. And so I don't  know well I guess what they decided to do is they were gonna turn the style  network into the Esquire network and as far as I know G4 is reruns of Cops and  Star Trek and stuff like that right now with no original programming at all.

Windows 8.1 comes out next week on the  18th along with the same day new versions of Microsoft's... I'm trying to  think of a good word. Benighted? I don't know. What's a good word? Jerry's the  writer here. So are you. Actually I'm surrounded by writers. Surface tablet.  Benighted's a wonderful word. I think benighted might be the right word. I don't know.

Start time: 414.74
End time: 424.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 433.72
End time: 452.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Windows on ARM. Well the Surface Pro is... I've had one played with it for a while.  I don't have one now but I'm thinking of getting one. It is as close to what the  original idea of a tablet was supposed to be as anything that's out there now.

Start time: 453.60
End time: 465.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah but the original ideas for a tablet which Bill Gates is you know  kind of embraced ten years more than ten years ago. Oh yeah. Were flops until  Apple comes along and says no this is what a tablet should be. They were flops because the

Start time: 466.10
End time: 506.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  technology wasn't there. Do you remember the Compaq T1000 or 100? I have one.  I have one. I loved it. That was my favorite computer of all time. It was running  Windows XP. It was and the only problem was the processor just got too hot  when it ran too fast and too slow to begin with anyway. The technology wasn't there but  if they had just waited until just taken that machine... I'm gonna go get mine.  I'm gonna show you what it's... Okay I've got one around here too. I love it. It was my favorite computer of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a really old iPhone in my briefcase. Jerry you were probably there too. I was  at Comdex when Bill Gates announced the original tablet PC and as I  remember it was very stylus dependent I believe at the time. The touch screens  were not very good and it was kind of a kludge. Windows really it really wasn't  optimized and there was really essentially no software that took advantage of touch.

Start time: 532.22
End time: 538.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was stylus dependent I don't mind. The problem was that... You know why?

Start time: 538.58
End time: 542.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it was designed to work with Jerry's handwriting. Well it was that.

Start time: 544.42
End time: 552.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yours is the only handwriting it works with Jerry. That's not the only. It was easier for me to do it than it was for you.

Start time: 552.62
End time: 566.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah yeah so this is a convertible. You see how it's so it tilts around and  you were talking about the stylus. It's hidden in here somewhere. I press this  button and it pops out I think. Where is it? It's on the side. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  research device you'll ever see. I have to admit one of the reasons I own this  is because I sat next to some guy on a plane who was a salesman I think. He was  showing me how great it was to do PowerPoint presentations for his clients  and pull out the thing and annotate it and do it and I thought wow that's  great. Yeah. And then I bought it. The processor just wasn't very good.  That's the problem right? And Jerry you had an OS that wasn't designed

Start time: 605.06
End time: 621.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exactly to do this. Another generation yeah but even with the OS it wasn't exactly  designed for it. If it had just gone to the next generation of chips I think  that would have been a very popular thing. It didn't have a camera built in

Start time: 621.66
End time: 636.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of course. Oh god this was long before then. I mean this has a PC card slot.  It does have USB. Yes. It has Wi-Fi built in so I guess I don't know what year was  this you think 2004? I want to say it was like feels like about 10 years ago.

Start time: 636.72
End time: 667.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe a little earlier than that. I remember that I took one to a major  COMDEX. It was the only machine I took that year and I managed to file my  daily reports and get my column done and get everything done on it. The keyboard  wasn't optimum and I would have preferred an external keyboard connected  to it but it was good enough for that even then with that hard software. Now of  course it certainly it recognized my handwriting and maybe not other people.

Start time: 668.32
End time: 683.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry's told the story before but that's actually... Should I tell it again? Go ahead. Well I was in  Moscow and... Any story that begins I was in Moscow is okay by me. Well it towards the end of

I... a good friend of became a good friend was  Pinovich who was the head of paragraph which was doing the handwriting  recognition software for Microsoft and he had a good friend who was that  Carpa who was at that time the world's chess champion.

Transcript:  than crazy conservative anyway but that's something else again. But I was  sitting in his office he said my biggest problem is I don't have enough  technical handwriting and I said oh well maybe I can fix that and I got my  logbook out you know and I said you know it looks like this and the guy and he  said yeah that would be wonderful can you so I let him essentially copy all  those pages. Wow. And that's the technical handwriting that was the  standard for so if it's gonna recognize anybody it's gonna recognize mine. How is  your handwriting Jerry? Are you like a... It's god-awful. Okay great. It's really terrible and I figured if  he can read that it'll read anything and it did and of course he's held it to  Microsoft and that engine has been in every edition of a Microsoft handwriting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  recognition program since 1990 so. I'm just baffled that I have to say OneNote  is a great product and I really have always liked it but it's just and I  guess there are people who are crazy about it but the tablet never really  took off until Apple came along and it was multi-touch I think made a difference  but it did not have to have a stylus I think that was a big selling point. I

Start time: 806.66
End time: 813.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think it was also the fact they were all acclimated to the iPhone it gave the  iPad obviously a huge leg up we were we were used to the OS we're used to sort

Start time: 820.62
End time: 890.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have enough money to make the bet worthwhile but I would bet that if  somebody were to build a copy of that device you have right there on your  desk but use it with a modern multi processor CPU and modern Intel chipset.  Well isn't that the surface? Well no the surface is not that that's the problem  it comes close but they didn't do all the things that it did. That machine has  it it has a keyboard as you notice it's there I don't have to carry a separate  keyboard and one Bluetooth. I took I had for instance I forget when that that  that machine was around 2000 or so. Nevin and I were doing some major books and I  could sit on an airplane with that when and those are the days when they scrunch  you up so that if you tried to open a real laptop it was in your lap and it  was right up into your face you could hardly see anything. I could put a novel  up and use the stylus and do editing with just standard proofreaders.

Start time: 891.66
End time: 915.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do this on a Lenovo the Yoga. I have a Yoga 13. It feels like a yoga.  It's kind of interesting. The difference is the was a yoga the and I can go bring  that and later the the screen bends backwards it doesn't it doesn't come off  but it does give you if you don't mind carrying the extra weight of the keyboard  with you all the time it gives you the same benefit and I like that's one of  the few Windows 8 laptops I really enjoy using. We'll find out it's a it's the

Start time: 915.80
End time: 950.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  18th 8.1 comes out I think in many ways 8.1 answers a lot of the problems people  had with Windows 8 to date and the new surface will come out and presumably you  know faster has well we'll give it better battery life that kind of thing.  We'll see if it's enough. Microsoft has 10 this just the difference between  Microsoft and Apple so fascinating because for so long Apple was a week  second to Microsoft. Microsoft's gonna open 10 count them 10 stores in the US  at midnight to sell the surface to. That's the best they can do.

Start time: 950.38
End time: 954.44

Start time: 1079.34
End time: 1094.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. That wasn't the flavor I was tasting. How about a shout out for Clippy while we're at it. I miss Clippy. Surfing the internet which was not in those days very common.  I see you would like to surf the internet. Can I make a list for you? Yeah.

End time: 1116.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's not the only announcement this week. There's more to come. We're going to talk about that in a second. We've got a fun panel here. Jerry Pornell, Larry Maggett and of course Rob Reed.  Rob I didn't know this. You just whispered in my ear that year zero is a 99 cent deal right now on Amazon.

Start time: 1117.18
End time: 1134.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been several days. So Random House has and I think it's awesome that they're experimenting with pricing because that's how you learn how to survive a digital transition.  Random House is pricing the ebook at 99 cents for I think most of the coming week. Maybe even all of it. Well worth picking up. The hardcover was $22.50.

Start time: 1135.24
End time: 1183.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, grab it while you can. Let me offer my observation. I make quite a lot of money out of electronic books of my back list now.  And we have found that between $3.99 and $5.99 it's practically price insensitive. Interesting. Yep. So you charge $5.99 for everything?  We've experimented with it. We have taken books and put them up at lower prices and then at higher and you know and shuffled it around and compared this stuff with some statistical techniques.  And it's really pretty well priced incentives in that range. Once it gets over about $6.00, people start thinking about whether they want it or not.  But up to that if they decide they want it, they just get it. It's easy click click and there it is.

Start time: 1183.52
End time: 1196.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, 99 cents is definitely the impulse purchase. Oh, 99 cents is free. But I don't know that...  Do you think he's leaving money on the table? He's leaving five bucks on the table? I think he's leaving several dollars on the table.

Start time: 1196.54
End time: 1259.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, there's no doubt. I think it's interesting because I'm a first time novelist. So very few people have heard of Rob Reed, the science fiction novelist.  Yeah, from my standpoint, I just think it's great that I mean the book has done reasonably well. It was in two hardcover printings and it's sold in the tens of thousands, which is good for a first novel.  But I'm just excited that this should, I think, expand the audience a lot, at least for a week.  But, you know, if it gets out there and more people read it, I think that Random House is thinking here is in getting the ebook out there very inexpensively.  Maybe people will discover it in advance of the holidays and give it to their geeky friends or something like that. The paperback's recently out. So that's probably part of the thinking.  What's the press run on the paperback? I'm sorry, what's the press run? I actually don't know. I'm not really good at knowing these things.  I think the first hardcover, I think they told me was 14,000 and then they printed another run and I don't know how much that was.  I never wanted to know. Yeah, because you know the numbers are depressingly low, right? Yeah. It's like, really? Okay. I don't want to know that.

Start time: 1260.55
End time: 1270.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not in the league of Jerry Pornell. Yeah, well, yeah.  Year zero, a novel. Not year one, which was your first book. Yes, and unrelated to this book. Unrelated.

Start time: 1271.64
End time: 1279.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very confusingly unrelated to this book. That was a kind of a memoir of life in business school. And this is about our music-addled aliens.

Start time: 1279.42
End time: 1287.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that premise. Isn't it a great idea? You know what, Jerry, you got, I didn't know you hadn't read it. You got to read it. I'm sure Rob will send you a copy.

Start time: 1287.28
End time: 1296.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure I will. For 99 cents, who cares? I'll just, hell, I'll get it right now. You just made a buck. This is how you expand. No, I think I just made a cent.

Start time: 1296.62
End time: 1302.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they change, they change, your royalty rates are percentage? Yeah. Oh, I think. So you're not making much of this. Maybe a couple cents of purchase.

Start time: 1302.22
End time: 1324.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My royalty rate on 99 cents is 30% at 399 and above at 70%. Exactly. Oh, interesting. I think even my publisher is getting 30 cents at 99 cents.  And then I get a sliver of that. My agent gets her 15. I think I get about a penny a book. So, you know, but you know, you don't write comedic science fiction strictly to get rich. It's a bad way to get rich.

Start time: 1324.22
End time: 1330.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to say though, if you're willing to spend a little more, get the audible edition because John Hodgman. John Hodgman reads it magnificently. That kind of brings it to life.

The post office is closed.  Yes, but Stamps.com is open. This is the time to strike Stamps.com. It's always open 24 7. You print your own postage with your, it's not Leo post.  Actually, you can print it with your picture on it, by the way. I bought a bunch of Leo stamps, but it's still official US postage.  You can, you don't need a special ink or a postage meter. In fact, you know, the other day I was reading the cost of the ink on a postage meter is something like a hundred times more than inkjet ink,  which is already outrageous. Wow. It's just a scale. You don't need a postage meter. You just need Stamps.com, your own printer, your own computer.  And you can save money on international mail. You could save money on priority mail. It'll do everything you need. You'll never have to go to the post office again.  Even even did is mail delivery. The mail carrier still coming to the door. I think so. I think so. Quasi independent. Oh, that's right. They're not a federal.

Transcript:  That's right. They're they're they're doing their own thing. If they weren't doing it, then this would be a bad time to promote Stamps.com because you could buy this delivery.  But there would be no subsequent delivery. No, there is. We have delivery. Delivery is on, I believe. Stamps.com customers printed over a billion, one billion with a B dollars in postage just last year alone.

Transcript:  It is fabulous. We use it all the time here in the office and we want to give you a chance to try it out. Small business, big business. It doesn't matter.  Stamps.com is better than the way you're doing it. I guarantee you don't. Now you're going to go to the front page. You see the eighty dollar no risk trial.  Do that. Do me a favor. Click the the microphone says here heard us on a radio or podcast. Click the microphone and enter in the offer code.  And your offer will be a hundred ten dollar bonus value because they up the free postage 50 dollar five dollar up to fifty five dollars in postage coupons to be used over the first few months of your account.  You also get that USP scale, which means you never over or under pay for postage. You get a five dollar supply kit and of course, a four week trial of stamps.com.  Really a great company and a great solution. I want you to try it. And yes, it works even during federal shutdown stamps dot com.  We're talking about that before the show began. There's a beautiful tourist destination in San Francisco called the Cliff House, which is out a beautiful and ocean beach and just gorgeous.  It's of course shut down because they're a concessionaire of the federal government. It's a private company, but it's on federal land and park land.

But it's kind of like a small place and it's still open even though they're also they're a lesee instead of a concessionaire.  And so they're allowed to run, but not. It's very confusing. They're both on park land. It's very strange.

Start time: 1601.68
End time: 1630.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're under 299. And Jerry, correct me if I'm wrong. My understanding is if you charge less than 299, they take 70 percent. If you charge between 299 and 999, it's a strong nudge to use that price range. You get 70 percent.  So they inverted. But my guess is Random House has their own deal. Why would Amazon not want 99 cent books? Because the sales are essentially price indifferent above that.

Transcript:  They made the same observation. They made the same observation that we did. Now, my books are some of my put up myself just to make sure I knew how to do it.  Most of them are put up by my agent, who was the agent for the book in the hardbound editions in the first place. We get 70 percent. She takes 15 percent off the 70 percent and sends the rest to me.  And Amazon, unlike most publishers, Amazon pays monthly, not just on credible threat of lawsuit. And they don't accumulate six months worth and pay it to you. They pay it monthly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are basically self-published. You've got to remember, Lucifer's Hammer was written in 1974. Nobody bought electronic rights in 1974. They didn't know what they were. And I never sold them when they began to exist.  I always crossed anything like that out of my contracts, unlike a lot of my friends who didn't take my advice. And some of them are now having to split their money with the publishers.  I presume the publisher gives you half of what it gets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. With electronic, I think it's the same royalty rate. Maybe it's 20 percent, which I think is a little higher than physical books.  I wrote a syndicated call on that.  So we assume that's right.

Transcript:  So the next... I mentioned that Windows 8.1 comes out this week. We don't know, but we think the Nexus 5 is going to be out. The new Google phone.  This is a video that appeared on smartphones.sfr.fr of something that absolutely looks like a Nexus 5.  This was posted to Android Police. It is built by LG. We do think we know that.  It is running the new version KitKat, although it says, if you look closely, KeyLinePi.  Wow.  That seems wrong.

Start time: 1768.26
End time: 1773.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right letter with a K. Maybe that was before Nestle came in with a big KitKat branding campaign.

Start time: 1774.32
End time: 1777.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what's weird about this, because it was going to be KeyLinePi, we thought.

Start time: 1777.18
End time: 1780.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense. That's consistent with their typical...  It puzzles me whether the validity of this perhaps...

Start time: 1784.04
End time: 1795.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the article it says that it's just running an older version of the software.  But the hardware seems to be a prototype, because if you look on the back, there isn't even Nexus branding. It's a clear back.  So somebody got this in a bar somewhere.

Start time: 1797.24
End time: 1844.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we do know that this is coming, because it got through FCC certification right up to the point where the government shut down.  That's something, by the way, I didn't really thought of, but that could slow down the release of new phones, because FCC certification is held up now.  I guess it would be.  So we thought that there were rumors that we'd expect this on Monday, perhaps. I don't know. We'll be interested.  The Nexus phones are very... people are very interested in those Nexus phones for several reasons.  One, it's a pure Google experience. It's somewhat guaranteed to have the latest version.  In fact, this would be the first phone with Android 4.4 available.  But also because Google at least has been very cheap. The Nexus 4 was like $230.

Start time: 1845.93
End time: 1880.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this one's on the ground at $199.  The pure Google experience thing should not be underestimated, because unlike Samsung and HTC and all the other vendors, Google doesn't put extra stuff on top of the operating system, force you to use a user interface that you don't want.  Google engineers actually understand something about UI. They keep it simple. It's going to be on the same hardware. It's going to be faster.  And people actually pay extra, for example, for a Samsung Galaxy 4 that doesn't have the Samsung stuff on.  The hardware is fine. It's the operating system.  How's the camera?  It's great. It's adequate. It's fine.

Start time: 1880.72
End time: 1888.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know on the Nexus 5. The Nexus 4 camera wasn't great, but it was okay.  One thing that keeps...  You mean the camera software or the camera hardware?

Start time: 1889.74
End time: 1897.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Both. One thing that keeps me with Apple is that I don't have to carry an extra camera, because the iPhone is just a good enough camera.

Start time: 1898.76
End time: 1920.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, especially with the new iPhone. There's no question this is still the best camera out there.  The new flash is fabulous.  I do think the Galaxy S...  The new flash is fabulous.  Yeah. Okay. So the Galaxy S4, and by the way, I have a Galaxy Note 3, which has the same camera, at 13 megapixels is a very good camera.  But something about Apple and what they do, I don't know if it's the software, but they consistently still, I think, produce the most accurate...  I feel like I got a better sensor in there.

Start time: 1920.30
End time: 1933.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did an A-B test. I took an iPhone 5S and an iPhone 5 and held them next to each other, took identical pictures in the same lighting.  In every single case, the 5S was dramatically better than the 5.  Wow.  I never knew the 5 was bad. I loved my 5.

Start time: 1934.18
End time: 1951.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I mean, that's improving on what was the best camera out there.  So this is an F2 aperture, so it's a little bit better in low light.  It's the same number of lenses, but maybe they've done something with the coatings or something.  But you were mentioning, Rob, the flash.

Start time: 1951.42
End time: 1980.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The dual light. Yeah, I think the fact that they can do automatic white balance, and I think they have a thousand different settings or something that they pivot between is probably what is going to make those really, really visible impact  on any image that actually uses the flash.  I think that's a facet. I don't have one yet, so I'm just parroting what I've read.  But that feels like a major, major step forward, whereas there's not a lot else it doesn't seem in the lens array or in the sensor that's radically different.  No, in fact, I think they're buying so many sensors.

Start time: 1981.18
End time: 2005.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing would be, of course, the software.  And I think something about what Apple... Let me see. I don't know if a flash would go off here.  No, I wish I could. I got to get the flash to go off. Maybe I'll shoot.  You can shoot it from auto to...  Shoot yourself.  You can shoot it from auto to on.  A little selfie.  It's Andrew Wiener's selfie.  Andrew Wiener's style.  I'll just turn it on. How about that?  Let's see. Shoot under the table.

Start time: 2005.58
End time: 2010.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo Wiener.  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you. Thank you very much.

Start time: 2011.30
End time: 2049.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is... Yeah, you know, that looks good for a shot under the table.  That looks pretty good.  Yeah, John, I got to talk to you about your wiring.  I don't... You can't really see that on camera, but it's actually quite a nice, accurate shot.  So what they've done is there's a warm and there's a cool LED, and they will mix the two depending.  So it apparently takes two pictures.  As soon as it assesses the white balance, it will then balance these little flashes to make that work.  You know, somebody's saying, well, what about the Lumia 1020? Everybody agrees that's a better camera.  I don't know. I think this is still a better camera.  Larry, have you tried both the 1020 and the...

Start time: 2049.52
End time: 2092.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have. And I think that, you know, the Lumia 1020, the big deal, of course, is it, what, 44 megapixels?  41 megapixels.  40 megapixels. So you can crop or take of them.  But for the kind of pictures that I use my smartphone for, look, it's not an SLR.  I don't use it when I'm going off to Africa to a safari and I want to get the best possible picture of that elephant, you know, 50 feet away.  It's the picture. It's the camera you use when you're out to dinner, when you're going about your business.  And the iPhone is much more than adequate for the kind of snapshots that I use it for.  And, you know, it's a little bit better. You can argue it is based on that cropping.  But then you have to take into consideration the simplicity of the software, the entire user interface.  And at the end of the day, I'm sticking with the iPhone.

Start time: 2092.96
End time: 2096.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just seems more, to me, more satisfying pictures.  It's ineffable.

Start time: 2097.28
End time: 2144.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The best camera is the one that you have with you.  Well, that's true. I'll bet you that.  And then also, you know, the one that you're going to use the most.  And so I think, you know, in complete agreement with what Larry said, it's if it's friction free and it's easy to use and it's in your pocket, that's the best possible camera.  However many megapixels. I mean, there's just not enough lens in these things to really take full advantage of a 21 megapixel shot.  I would rather than have another dozen megapixels. And I'm sure we won't see this for a while.  I personally would rather have a camera that shoots in RAW because you can do a lot with a RAW file if you have software like Lightroom and so forth.  So rather than get bazillion more megapixels or pixels, I would rather shoot in RAW and have some fun with the image that I couldn't necessarily have with the JPEG.  But that's an extreme edge case.

Start time: 2144.78
End time: 2157.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's probably also have an SLR or other cameras.  I do. Yeah, I've got the Sony RX100, which is a pocket sized camera.  Amazing camera. I had that too. It's breathtaking.  That's what I carry these days. I don't even carry my SLR ever.

Start time: 2157.54
End time: 2182.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just went on Safari. So I carried my SLR for the first time in a really long time because the RX100 is a mind blowingly good camera.  Six hundred bucks. Yep. It's a point and shoot.  It's a point and shoot that shoots in RAW. It has a Carl Zeiss lens. It's got ample megapixels. It's 20 something I think.  20.2. Plenty. And it's got incredible low noise performance. I took it to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny. They won't let you. They measure the lens. Yes.  They'll actually measure and you can have a three inch or less lens.

Start time: 2199.28
End time: 2226.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had this little box. They're not going to stop you.  So no, they didn't. I mean, the pictures that I got, obviously I'm an easy judge of my own pictures, but I thought they were phenomenal.  So the low light performance is incredible and the strange color performance and all those things you have in a concert.  But the key was it does shoot in RAW. And so if you do, once you get the image, if you're pretty good in Lightroom or another RAW processing program, you can do amazing things with the beautiful images that the RX100 gets.

Transcript:  Can you see this guy? Can you see this guy? Show it. What is that?  That's the iPhone next to the RX100. It's smaller than the iPhone. It's thicker, but it's thicker.  And I've got the lens full out. But it does fit easily into a pant pocket.

They think it might be Atlantis.  Atlantis, that's of course, was the spirit on Marinados is the guy. I spent a week with him.  He was the one who came up with that hypothesis in 1939. And I was going to write a novel about it.  But the problem was that the civilization was so damn attractive that I really had trouble writing a novel about a disaster that wiped it out.  I just literally had emotional problems.  Yeah. Yeah. I don't blame you.  But I loved Santorini. I spent a week there.

But what's great about Bali is it has a lot of really magnificent temples and things that you see in lots of countries.  But what's cool about Bali is it's a very living religion.  Like all those temples, grand and ancient as they are, are used every day.  It's very vibrant. It's really vibrant. It's an interesting place.  And make sure you go to Ubud.

But it's also kind of an unusual branch of the Hindu religion.  It's not as Hindu as is typically practiced in India.  But that's where my knowledge runs out.  But it's predominantly Hindu, which is very unusual in Indonesia.

Transcript:  Getting back to the Google phone.  Yes, indeed.  The Google experience. I have to underscore what you're saying, Larry, although that's only recent.  The first Google phones, the first versions of Android Cupcake and Donut and Eclair were godawful.  And at the time, I think, and I actually spoke to the guy who designed Motorola Blur.  And he said at the time we had to not merely for carrier differentiation or manufacturer differentiation,  but because Google really hadn't nailed it yet.  But I think certainly since Ice Cream Sandwich, the OS finally has a good UI.  And these carrier or manufacturer extensions really aren't any good.  I have a Note 3 here, which I love the hardware of.  But God, the TouchWiz, it's just non-standard.  And so it just seems to get in the way, right?  It's got weird, you know, it's got four pages of settings, which makes it very difficult to figure out what's going on.  Of course, it's got all the Galaxy cruft.  And that takes up a lot of space on these things.

Transcript:  Oh, I think you're being hard on me.  Well, not too hard.  I still prefer Android for a number of reasons.  But there but I don't say you shouldn't have an iPhone.  I think for a lot of people, the iPhone is absolutely the right choice.  But here's an example.  You know, it's very clear, as you said, it's Apple's way or the highway.  Apple has a way of doing it.  You can't do it any other way.  But if you like the way Apple does it, stick with it.  The advantage, of course, of Android is you can anything you want.  But here's a good example.  This is Samsung's camera app, which is so loaded with bizarre junk that you don't need a frankly I don't need a golf mode.

The couple of weeks later, it came out while I was gone.  I was able to get one.  The fingerprint scanner.  Is this making a difference?  But to go with the note three, I've got the Galaxy Gear watch.  We could talk a little bit about that.  Some big changes in privacy settings on Google and Facebook.  There's a lot to talk about, including Nick Bilton's new book.  We're to try to get Nick soon on one of our shows.  We love Nick, a New York Times writer.  His new book is a very interesting.  I thought at least the excerpts I read.  Twitter was mind blowing.  Wasn't that amazing?  Oh, gosh.  All right.  Lots to talk about.  And Comic-Con hijacking its users' Twitter.  That's another good one.  But first, let's talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix  and a product that you probably have used.  If not, you ought to use it called GoToMeeting.  It's been around for, I think, 10 years now  and has become, by far, the dominant online meeting software for good reason.  They just make it better all the time.  GoToMeeting allows you to share screens.  Of course, it's done that for years.  And now you can see each other face to face with HD faces, crystal clear video.  So now you're on the same page with your team.  Nobody likes meetings.  But if you've got a meeting, and you do have to meet, I think,  it's the only way to really cut through the clutter.  In fact, Lisa has a great rule.  If five emails go back and forth on a topic, that's it.  We're meeting.  The only way to cut through this, otherwise it just goes on endlessly.  But if you're going to have a meeting, you want to make it efficient,  you want to make it effective, and GoToMeeting really does.  You can share the screen, be on the same page, see each other.  It's great for team building, for solving problems, for making it work.  You get a built-in, of course, bridge, phone bridge,  but you can also use the built-in audio and video on your computer, your laptop, or your iPad.  You know, you could present from your iPad, which is a lot of fun.  If you're out in your backyard enjoying life and you want to have a meeting, you still can.  We want you to try it free, 30 days free.  If you visit GoToMeeting.com and use the promo code TWIT, T-W-I-T, 30 days free,  go to meeting, a very impactful way to do something nobody wants to do, but everybody has to do.

Transcript:  It's basically a 5.  So what's of interest, I guess, with the new iPhone is the fingerprint scanner.  Really. It is a faster processor.  It is otherwise identical form factor.  You can now get it in gold as well as space gray and white.  But and we mentioned the flash and the camera, but the fingerprint reader is the big thing.  It does work well.  I mean, it's here. I'll show you.  So when I turn on, I turn on my phone and I just put my fingerprint on.  You can, of course, slide to unlock and enter in a passcode.  But if you put your fingerprint on there, it unlocks it.  You can do that to buy apps on the app store or buy music on iTunes.  And it works quite well.  I'm waiting to see how long before Apple releases an API for third parties to do this.  Absolutely.  Because that could make it very interesting, right?  Very, very.  We don't know how reliable it is.  Apple is apparently I talked to a security expert when I was in Turkey, Jamal,  and he said Apple uses nine points of similarity.  So what that means is it's very quick to register a fingerprint and it's very reliable.  But it also means there are more collisions.  So there's false positives or false negatives?

Start time: 3089.42
End time: 3092.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about that?  That is exactly right.  But it would be very cunning thief to like look at your fingers.  They're stealing your iPhone.  Oh, yeah, there's a guy in my gang. He's got that world.  It seems unlikely.  It seems really unlikely.  Seems unlikely.  What I want them to do is to take the fingerprint of the guy who stole my phone  as he's trying to turn it on and zap that off.  They can't do that.

Start time: 3116.26
End time: 3138.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty clever.  And in fact, the reason they don't do that is because people were a little bit concerned  privacy wise that Apple might be storing fingerprints.  They don't.  They take it locally.  They take not even the fingerprint, not an image, but a hash.  So they take they look at the fingerprint.  You do it a few times to register the fingerprint.  They hash that.  And that way, when you do it again, it will generate a similar hash.  If it's close enough, they say, OK, that's a match.

Transcript:  John Petchkowski on All Things Digital,  who seems to have pretty good connections with Apple,  has said, and most people agree, that it will be the 22nd.  It was the 23rd last year.  I think we can pretty safely say it will be new iPads.  There is some question about whether they'll do a new Mini,  and if they do, whether there will be a new Retina Mini.  Presumably.  Well, apparently it's technically difficult.  Oh, okay. Well, not presumably.  Well, that's the question.  The issue is battery life.  You put a lot of pixels on that screen,  it gets hard to get you the 10 hours that Apple wants.  Well, it'll have an A7 chip, presumably, the new line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Without the fingerprint scanner,  it's hard to think of what they could add to an iPad on October 22nd or 23rd.  That would really be that revolutionary.  Well, that's a good point.  I mean, if you have a fourth-generation iPad,

Start time: 3272.20
End time: 3281.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a better camera maybe?  Maybe more memory.  I don't think anybody's going to...  Apple doesn't even talk about the memory.  You mean more storage?

Start time: 3281.24
End time: 3309.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  More storage, I'm sorry. Yeah, more storage.  I mean, the thing about...  Here's a little thing that bugs me a little bit.  It has to be 128 gigs.  Well, 128 is the top, top end now.  Maybe they go to 256.  It goes to come 64, 128, 256 or something like that.  I can't see that.  Yeah.  But without the fingerprint authentication,  it's hard to think of anything that they could do with a new line of iPads  that would have people stampeding.  Now, they could do...  The thing that intrigues me about the 5C...  By the way, that's a problem Apple has in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you make it better?  Well, this is exactly what they did.  You remember the iPod Mini, 2004.  They'd kind of done everything you'd think they could do with an iPod.  This was before the Touch, which did revolutionize everything.  That was kind of an iPhone.  They came out with them in different colors.  That was it.  The iPod Mini came out, I think, in blue and silver and pink as well,  like the 5C.  And just the mere profusion, the existence of colors,  really excited the market.  And from what we've been seeing this week,  there was a survey that was done that said not only is the 5S  outselling every other phone with all of the carriers,  so is the 5C.  I didn't think anybody was buying the 5C,  but apparently it's moving.  And people like their colors.  So maybe the iPad will come out in lots of cool colors.  Okay.  I mean, that wouldn't get me stampeding the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with Jerry.  I could care less for somebody to put a case on in any way.  But for reasons that don't make a lot of sense for me,  people love colors.  But when you think about cars, people spend extra money  or go way out of their way to order a car in the color they love.  So why not a phone?  Yeah.

Start time: 3382.87
End time: 3407.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think to answer your question, Jerry,  the one to look at and see what happens if it's October 22,  the one to watch is the iPad Mini.  I think for most people,  that's actually better than the 9.7-inch,  especially the only thing lacking on the Mini last year  was the Retina display.  If they could put a Retina display on a Mini,  I think that's the sweet spot.  And I think sales figures have shown that that's the one people want.  You know, I have an iPad Mini, and I've got the new iPad,

Start time: 3408.22
End time: 3417.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I've got tablets with super high res.  And I don't recall ever looking at my iPad Mini and thinking,  oh, gee, I wish the display were better.  I did. Oh, I did. No, no, no.

Start time: 3428.48
End time: 3456.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not painful, but it's definitely less than optimal.  I think that's the thing for them to do next.  I mean, look, they don't have a lot of room to grow.  I like the Nexus 7.  Of course, the Nexus 7 is Retina.  It's very high resolution,  but it's 25% less screen real estate than an iPad Mini would be.  So that's the issue is, are you going to kill battery life  and give yourself a Retina, or have they solved this?

Start time: 3458.64
End time: 3466.12

But of course, I have to have a real computer.  So there's no way I'm going to travel without a Mac  or a Windows computer.  But for around the house or for people who don't need to run office  or other apps,  hey, it gets the job done and it does it very well.  I used to be kind of anti-Chromebook.

Transcript:  This guy, I got the MacBook 11, the 13-inch.  Twelve hours.  Oh, it goes on for days.  It has changed.  This is going to sound really weird because I'm not an Apple fanboy.  But it has changed my life  more than any technology I've purchased  in probably ten years because I can go to a conference now  and I can sit there all day  and not worry about having to find a place to plug in.  I can get on an airplane and fly all the way to Bali  if I want to  and not have to plug in.  And that has really had an impact.  And that's the only reason I bought it.  It cost me, what, $1400?

Transcript:  There's got to be a middle ground somewhere.  I don't know what it is.  Let's talk about privacy.  Google has changed their...  Well, you know what?  This is a tale of two privacy policies.  On the one hand,  Facebook has decided,  since you could pretty much  find anybody with our social graph search anyway,  we're going to turn off that feature that lets you say,  no one can search for me  by name.  In fact, if you have that box checked on your  Facebook account that says, you can't search for me by name,  you will get an announcement the next time you go to  Facebook that says, hey, by the way, we're turning that off.  Point there being that, well,  you could still search for somebody by every  other parameter and probably still find them.  Nevertheless,  I hate to see this...  I just feel like Facebook doesn't really care about privacy at all.  They don't seem to because I think

Start time: 3931.18
End time: 3948.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the vast majority of the users  don't particularly care.  I mean, we get all up in arms about certain  changes in privacy policies  and so forth, but when they see less than  a ninth of one percent of their users  resigning over change,  over change, actually change why, they're just  not going to worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I guess, and that's Facebook's point of view,  is you're not...  it's an illusion that you're hiding anything by  saying, checking that box.  But I'll give you an example. When I was traveling,  my mom said, well, how can I see your pictures?  I said, well, they're all on Facebook. And she said,  well, I don't want a Facebook account because I don't want  old high school sweethearts to be looking me up.  And it's  really hard. I tried to create a Facebook account  for her where she could be anonymous,  but it's very hard to do that.  And so there's the scenario  where somebody says, well, all of my grandkids  and kids are on Facebook, and I want to  see those pictures, but I don't want to have a  presence on Facebook. It's very hard to do that.  So what I did is I just made my profile  100% public. And mom  just go to Leo Chilipport and you can see  everything. All the fake news. Leo, I think the issue

Start time: 4017.22
End time: 4061.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is people really need to know that they can control  who can see what they post.  And the key to any  privacy at all on Facebook  is to know that when you post something right below  the update box, the little icon,  in my case, it's almost all public because I want  to post in the, I mean, I want people to read my stuff.  But if I want to share it with a limited audience,  I can do that. And you got to learn to do  that if it matters. Because I think  Facebook is right that they can have search or no  search. There are a million ways to find you,  including your friends linking to you, including  your friends sharing what you post.  And so it was a false sense of security.  Now, I'm not saying they should have gotten away, should have  deleted it, but I really don't think  it's a big deal. Also, as they point  out, they've already actually already had deleted  it for a lot of users anyway who weren't using it.  They just told us about it now.

Start time: 4061.18
End time: 4070.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, you make  an excellent point. And I think that that is  Facebook's answer, which is, well, you could do it post  by post, and so you should just do that.  But that's a lot of work.

Start time: 4071.20
End time: 4098.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's more work. And what I don't like  about that feature, frankly, is so I  like to post publicly 90% of the time.  But once in a while I post privately, and then  the next time I post, it's automatically set  to private. And I have to remember to go public.  It's a little fiddly. And the real danger  is if you want to be private and you say, OK, I'm going to post this public because I want to.  And then you go back and you think you're  posting privately, but you're posting publicly.  So you really have to watch it.  It's sticky. Every time you change it,  it stays in that position until you change it again.  Now, there is one privacy setting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't ever click like  on any product or anything  for precisely that reason.  Anytime you like something.  It drives me away from the activity  that they're trying to encourage, I assume,  because their sponsors are going to like it,  of ever clicking like on a brand that I'm interested in  because I'm going to suddenly be shilling it  to all of my friends, or even worse,  my Facebook friends, include people that I don't know that well.  Here's what Facebook says.  Everyone wants to know what their friends like.

Start time: 4155.20
End time: 4183.24

Transcript:  That's why we pair  ads and friends.  An easy way to find products and services you're interested in  based on what your friends share.  Now, when I try to edit  this,  I say pair my social actions  with ads for no one.  But I've been told, and I've seen  written, that that doesn't change  your presence in sponsored  stories. So I'm not sure  if that does anything or not.  Anyway, just a point. You should do that.  Leo,

Start time: 4209.44
End time: 4237.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it actually could be, I could theoretically  lose my job. So for example, I had strong opinions  on a California proposition  a few years ago, and I shared it with my friends. But if I  had publicly endorsed  one side or the other, I'm violating  one of the rules of CBS  News, is that I cannot take a public position  on a political campaign. And  that doesn't mean I can't vote or talk to my friends  about it, but suddenly liking  something means that I'm endorsing it. And  that's theoretically could  get me fired. Well, Google obviously

Start time: 4237.30
End time: 4253.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has been looking at the revenue Facebook's making  on this and said, hey, we'd like some of that money  too. So Google has now  Google's done it a little differently. I kind of like this. First  of all, unlike Facebook, they've announced  it before they've made the change. They've actually  pre-announced it so that you have a chance  to read about it, hear about it on this show, whatever.

Start time: 4253.62
End time: 4263.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they did pop-ups when you hit the Google  site, too. I had a little pop-up  windows at the very, very top that  made it very plain that they're making this change. They  were communicating it, which I think is good. And

Start time: 4263.26
End time: 4299.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's an opt-out. Yep.  So the idea is, just  like Facebook, Google will  soon be able to show users names,  photos, ratings, and  comments in ads,  not just on Google. Now, this is one thing that's a little  different, but across the web. But this is  beacony. Yeah. Beacon-ish.  That's what Facebook got in trouble for doing, Beacon.  So these ads, you know, the Facebook  stuff shows up on Facebook when  your friends go to some page.  It's all internal. But these ads  would show up in Google ads everywhere,  which is a real concern. Now, you can't  opt-out, at least for now.  You have to opt-out.

Start time: 4299.40
End time: 4313.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, if you go to LarryTheWorld.com  or SafeKids.com, there's an article,  actually it's the second article now, which  links to where you can opt-out.  And you can, and you should,  if you don't want to be shilling advertisements.  And people under the age

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  by the way. Well, now, this really sounds  like a matter for concern  for organizations like  the Authors Guild and the  Science Fiction Writers of America.  Because if it  can make it look like you're  endorsing a product when all you  did was say, yeah, I like that, it's all  right, or I've used it, or  that is actually interfering  with a commercial right you have.  Authors get paid  money to endorse products  for God's sakes. Now, I  have not done it myself, because  when I was  writing for Byte, obviously  that would have been an inappropriate  thing to do. But  many authors are paid money  to endorse a product. Back in the  cigarette days, lots of them were.

Apple and Microsoft were also  well, what this comes from  the Google kind  of sneaky thing they did on the iPhone  where they went around Safari's  policy for third party  cookies. There was a class  action suit.  The judge said companies  had circumvented, that  the companies had circumvented browser settings  allowing browser  users personal information to be sold to  ad companies.

By the way, don't most of you  like me just periodically  erase all  unprotected cookies?  Sure. Nah.

Transcript:  We've had a series of moral  panics, right? First it was predators  and it's privacy  and it's security. And yeah, there are  issues. I think that we have a right to privacy.  But there is this notion out there  that everything that monetizes  information about people is somehow  violating our personal privacy.  And while I don't want my name  associated with where I surf on the web  or what I buy, and yeah, I get  creeped out sometimes when I have to look at an ad based  on my surfing habits, I also  recognize the fact that billions of dollars  are spent every year on these  services. And I don't want to have to pay a dollar per Google  search. I don't want to have to pay for  Gmail like I used to pay for MCI  or Gmail. And I'm willing to make that trade  off as long as, and this is the big  question, as long as there are reasonable  privacy procedures in place, as long as  the government isn't necessarily  dipping into those databases, which in fact they  are. But the reality  is that this is the world we live in  and I do think we have to analyze  whether there's risk and whether there's harm.  And just because it's possible that  our privacy is being violated  doesn't necessarily mean that it  is. But again, we're getting a lot of  benefit out of these services. And I'm not a Google  stockholder, but I do have  some concern about this  sort of overreaction to what I call privacy

But the problem is  Postini takes care of an awful  lot of it at the server level.  But there still gets through  a good bit of it. Now it gets taken  off into the junk mail  folder. I never see it.  But it takes a long time  for it to come in if I'm on a slow  connection.

Transcript:  I gotta say I really like  the new Gmail.  First of all, Gmail eliminates spam pretty effectively.  Pretty effectively. Yeah, I get very little.  And Gmail, and then there's some real  debate over this, but Gmail's added these new  inbox automatic  filtering  with primary, they have up to  I think five different folders. Primary,  social, you can turn them on and off.  Promotions, updates, and forms.  And then there's automatically  server level.  And they automatically  do this, and you can correct it. You can drag  if something goes into social and should be in primary  you drag it over or vice versa.  And I found it to be surprisingly  accurate right out of the box.  And stuff that ends up in primary  is pretty much from real people that I want to

I was just sending them in.  Until  PC World  went from  monthly to bi-weekly.  And Peter Norton  was writing their  column, and he didn't want to write  two columns a month. So he said, why don't  we alternate? So I told Byte,  how would you like it if I  wrote column for you and also  one for your biggest rival?  And they said, we'd hate that.  And I said, but they're paying me more  than you are. And they said,  we'll fix that. And they doubled what  they were paying me. So everything went

Transcript:  and we love having you on  and it's great to see you again. We're going to take  a break. Come back with more.  We think there's a new iPad  coming. Now would be a great time to get a quote  on your old iPad at Gazelle.com.  And I'll tell you why. The minute they announce  the new iPad, your current iPad  value just plummets.  But it hasn't happened yet.  And the beauty of this is you can go  to Gazelle.com, get a quote  for your iPad, and  it's good for 30 days. So  here's you know, you're going to get a quote. And even  if the value of your iPad  doesn't, you know, goes down  over after the new one's announced, you still can  say, hey, no, no, you promised me  in this case $335  for my fourth generation  Apple iPad. What happens now?  Get this quote now, add this to your  cart, get a quote on every  piece of, you know, old technology  you got lying around. They'll buy iPhones,  cell phones from Samsung,  Apple, Blackberry,  HTC, LG, Motorola,  even old Nokia phones.  They'll buy tablets from Apple, Amazon,  Asus. You know what? This is a good time to get  a quote on your old Surface. If you're  going to get the new Surface, get a quote on  the Surface Pro. See what you can get  in return for that. Get an offer  on my 64. That's what I have, a 64 gig  in good condition.  Power supply, touch  cover, yes, yes.  And the value of that, 300.  Hey, that's good. That's going to get me a good  way toward my new Surface. So  what you do is you get these quotes. Then  when you want to pull the trigger, and it can be like a month  from now, 29 days later,  you say, OK, and they'll send you the box  with the mailing. They pay the mailing  on anything over worth more than a  buck. And then they'll send you a check.  You can get a PayPal coupon or,  and a little pro tip here, if you get  the Amazon gift card, they'll bump it up  another 5%. They buy  old Macs, Macbooks.  They buy Apple TVs,  old cinema displays.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com  is the best way to recycle. Put some cash in your pocket.  Sell it to somebody who wants your old stuff.  Gazelle.com  Just out of curiosity, I asked  them, they said, we've paid a hundred million dollars  to over 600,000 customers  in the last couple of years.  No wonder. Gazelle.com  Really great  people with a great product.  Moving along,  we were talking about this Twitter story.  I cannot wait to read  Milton's book about the history  of Twitter. It was excerpted in  the New York Times.  Now, you're an entrepreneur.  You've been through this probably a few times.  Were you surprised, Rob, read  by anything that you read in here?

Start time: 5509.44
End time: 5647.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Yeah. Well, for instance, Jack Dorsey,  who was one of the people who came up with  Twitter along with  Noah Glass, both of them were at  Odeo, which was Evan Williams' podcast  company. And I remember  Odeo very well because we were in podcasting  at the time. And Odeo was  one of the way this distributed. But much like  Rhapsody, iTunes came along.  End of the line for Odeo.  To his credit, Ev gave back the money  to the investors. I liked that. And started, but  before even that happened, he started casting around  for a new product. Jack  and Noah said, hey, we got this idea  for a text messaging service.  Noah was the one who came up with  the name Twitter. And apparently, and as the story is  told in this book, he went through the  dictionary. Yeah. Looking  for a... T-words. T-words.  Yeah. And  the reason he came up with Twitter  is because... Frenetic  or something like that. Yeah. Yeah.  He was... Initially, well,  initially... Okay, so  William said, we'll call it Friend Stalker.  Which is a good  name, but probably... A fun name, but probably not.  Yeah, a little creepy. Yeah. Yeah.  So Glass, according to Nick Bilton, writes,  Glass became obsessive, flipping through a physical  dictionary, almost word by word  looking for the right name. One late afternoon  alone in his apartment, he reached  over to his cell phone and turned  it to silent. And then as usual,  it started to vibrate. He quickly  considered the name Vibrate. Nick's that.  Tried Twitch.  Hmm, not right. So  well, we're in the T.W.'s.  Let's try Twist.  Twit. God, I'm  glad he didn't pick Twit. Now,  by the way, I want to point out that this is a guy  running a podcast company perfectly well knew  that there was probably his number  one podcast was called Twit.  I wish he'd kept going past Twitter,  but he stopped... Twine?  Twitch, Twitter, Twitchy,  and Twiny. He read the  definition, light chirping  sound made by certain birds he thought  agitation or excitement, flutter,  Twitter.  And in fact, that was the name, although  originally spelled without vowels.  T.W. T.T.R.  I guess because they couldn't get Twitter.com.  What's interesting, though, is  the revisionist  history, particularly from Jack Dorsey, who  basically stopped talking about Noah.  Yeah. Just wrote his name  out of the history. His style, according to this article

Start time: 5647.32
End time: 5747.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  anyway, just sort of erased him  from the close-up shots.  So. Yeah. Isn't that weird?  It is weird. Now, here's the thing that's  interesting to me. So, I  don't know Jack. I don't know Jack.  I don't know Jack Dorsey.  But reading this as somebody  who doesn't know anything about him, you  cannot like this person that  is depicted in this particular excerpt  as depicted there. You  can't feel very good about them being the executive  chairman of a company that you  may or may not invest in when it goes public  in a few short days. Well, that's an interesting thing on  timing, isn't it? The IPO's coming up.  So, when you get Nick in here,  you know, Nick covered Twitter  as part of his beat for the New York Times.  And he's written this  story, which there's two sides to  every story. We get one of them here.  And Nick is an outstanding journalist. He tells the story  very well. But Jack  won't be able to respond, nor will Twitter,  because they're in a quiet period. They're in a quiet period.  Oh my God. And so it feels like a pretty,  you know, that's a  haymaker punch. And they cannot  respond. And so the company is  seeking, will be seeking to go public  ten days after this book comes out.  There is a series of  things in here which would lead anybody,  I think, to question the character  and the sincerity and perhaps  even the honesty of the executive  chairman of this company that wants to go public  on November 15th. And they're muzzled.  And I wonder if  this was a business move on  Nick's part to, you know, pump up sales?  I mean, not to attack  Twitter, but to, you know, expedite  the sale of his book, because of course there's going to be a lot of  attention to Twitter in the zone of the IPO.  I mean, I don't know. It's  crazy, though. And I'm sure that they're  freaking out at Twitter. Now, exactly in whose

Google bottom put them out  of their misery. Every, I think of all  the companies that ran at Twitter and  boom. All hit a wall.  Like Gallipoli. They just fell by the wayside.

It's more that this book  comes out and  they are muzzled. And so it's just an interesting  and certainly as a very sophisticated  and very good tech writer,  Nick must have been aware of this  dynamic.  Maybe not. I don't know, Nicky.

But, yeah, he was kind of  bitching about the state of journalism and Robert  said, hey, it's his fault.  He has no right.  Anyway,  I can't wait. The book will be out, I think,  next month from Penguin. It's called Hatching  Twitter. A true story of money,  power, friendship, and betrayal.  With betrayal underscored.

But according to that, it sounds like he was not only  came up with the idea, but  was then squeezed out of the company  and essentially dispossessed  of almost all of his shares. That would be sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  its market share in the sense that  every journalist, every television  show, every celebrity  is on it, talks about it constantly,  and it really has,  as you say, it's become sort of part  of our public vernacular.  But that doesn't mean it's something that people are going to absolutely depend on.  And right now,  it's doing well, but it's  really hard for me to know.

Start time: 5995.32
End time: 6001.04

Transcript:  I meant it's doing well in terms of the number  of people who use it, what, 200 monthly active  200 million users. That's not a bad  number. It's not as good as Facebook, but still  not a bad number. But again,  how much time are they spending on it?  What are they doing with it?  These are questions. And more important,  what will be the state of the art  three, four, five years from now?  That's it. That's what I want to know.

You could put  messages up that were a lot more than 140  characters and a lot better than  text only many, many years before  Twitter came along. And so they've kind of  made a virtue of this, this sort of  lo-fi. It's not going to work for people.

End time: 6078.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that could make it. One of the problems with Twitter  is it clicks through right. So if you tweet, and  even if you have a lot of followers, the  percentage of those followers who are going to click through  on any link you put in there are not as high  as I think a lot of marketing people would like.  I don't know if that's going to be a problem.

Yeah, because it gets  inhaled, right? Right. Yeah. Twitter  growth is slowing. Last year,  78% increase in growth.  This year, 44%.  That's a big slowdown, although  still growing. Yeah. And from a much

Start time: 6111.20

End time: 6123.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6127.38
End time: 6185.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with it. Well, in sponsored posts,  right? They're doing that. Yeah.  But the problem is, in order to make  that work, and this, as you can see, is Twitter's strategy  change over the years because of  this, you have to go to the Twitter.com.  Right. And that's why they don't want...  Nobody does that. Yeah. Nobody goes there.  And so Twitter has started  to kill the third party apps so that they at least  can force you to use a Twitter  app. Right. Which is why  they bought TweetDeck. Right. Right.  I think it's a challenge. I'm not  sure it's an automatic...  When Nielsen announced this week that they're going to have  TV ratings through Twitter...  What does that even mean?  I don't know. It'll measure the number of people...  Okay, so Nielsen will give  a TV show, a number  of people watching, what share of the  total audience, what share of the available  audience. Now they'll also  give you a rating that says how many people tweeted  about your program. TweetShare.  And how many people viewed  those messages.  Now luckily... Can you hire people in India to tweet

Start time: 6217.26
End time: 6223.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. No, look, these days...  I don't know if there's only 1200 people  and it's impossible to keep  them... keep secret who they are.  I would think that's kind of  gameable too. Yeah, maybe.

Start time: 6237.18
End time: 6246.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. If people are watching television  on the internet, if they're watching on a TiVo or  a PVR, aren't there ways to actually  know exactly how many people are watching it?  Yeah, TiVo knows. Not only...

Start time: 6247.20
End time: 6249.16

Start time: 6249.30
End time: 6253.14

Start time: 6253.28
End time: 6285.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  television. TiVo sells this information  to TV shows. When we were doing the screensavers,  I saw graphs that showed not only  how many people watched the show, but when they tuned in,  when they tuned out, when they  rewound the TiVo, you'd see spikes  at certain points in time. Everybody  rewound that one. What happened? Oh, it was Morgan.  Okay. And so, you can really  see...  It was Rob.  You can really see  in a granular way, not merely how popular  the show is, but how popular a segment is.  That was useful information.  It's fascinating to me. It feels like the entire

Start time: 6285.48
End time: 6294.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  world is still catching up with where TiVo  was nine years ago.  Thanks to the networks.  DVRs are just so primitive compared  to what I had on my TiVo the first...

Start time: 6295.18
End time: 6298.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6299.18
End time: 6302.70

Start time: 6303.38
End time: 6307.02

Start time: 6323.18
End time: 6336.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a big issue in the early days of Nielsen.  One of the things that really hurt the screensavers,  they did not count DVRed episodes.  And our audience was more sophisticated  than the average BPR.  We had three or four times higher TiVo usership  than any other network.

Start time: 6337.18
End time: 6341.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would have been the only network that had any  measurable TiVo usage.

Start time: 6341.18
End time: 6352.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now, of course, the standard way of watching  a TV show is to set it  to record and then  watch something already recorded  while that's playing so that you can go to that  and skip past the end.

Start time: 6353.26
End time: 6355.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6355.28

Start time: 6403.30
End time: 6406.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then you also have to wait a week  between each episode.

Start time: 6407.18
End time: 6425.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Breaking Bad's season finale, by the way,  had 20...  I'm sorry, 1.24 million tweets.  Wow.  Peaking at 20,000 tweets per minute.  The hashtag,  goodbye, Breaking Bad, half a million times,  was used.  And that's all from Social Guide, the new Nielsen ratings.  Okay, that's interesting.

Start time: 6427.18
End time: 6442.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is genuinely interesting stuff, but those statistics  were gathered before the world knew  that Nielsen was going to count them,  report them, and excite advertisers with them.  So I think the mere fact...  The mere fact that people know Nielsen is watching  is going to queer those statistics very, very quickly.  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Start time: 6443.32
End time: 6467.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  And in fact, we've seen that because in movie stars  actually over the last few years  have been able to increase the amount of money  they ask for in a movie based on the number of Twitter followers.  Which of course is purchaseable.  Immediately created a market for phony Twitter followers.  So the Twitter follower number is now useless.  Yeah, it's meaningless.  Because I would say at least half of the accounts on Twitter  are phony.  Oh, I know a lot of my 1,100 followers.  Probably.

Start time: 6469.44
End time: 6478.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 6479.18
End time: 6501.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where you can say...  Yeah, it's...  It's a statuspeople.com  does a check on how many of your followers are fake.  You're kidding.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Whether they have a profile picture,  whether they've tweeted, things like this.  Let me just authorize that app  and see how many of my followers...  You can go in there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pornelli. Let me say something for the  record right now. Any of you people  who are contemplating being writers,  be dang careful about your  electronic rights. I think  the ebook rights are now worth more  than the print rights, which means  that if somebody wants to offer you  the kind of advance that is  normal in print, but they want half  your electronic rights forever  as a consequence of it, I'd  think very hard about taking that offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the first place with electronic  rights, first rights is eternal,  isn't it?  Once the guy puts it up there, there's  nothing causing him to take it down.  And if you've sold him all rights,  you've sold him a  non-exclusive right forever,  then he keeps it up there forever.  And you never get another nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have been trying to get this across  to my fellow writers and  science fiction writers of America,  that an electronic book contract  that doesn't provide for further royalties  after the initial  publication of an anthology  on thing, the fact that it's non-exclusive  isn't going to mean anything.  He's got it forever.  He's basically  done you as a work for hire,  you didn't know that.  So make it enough, you better ask  for enough than it is.  It is worth it.

Transcript:  It was tough because we were first.  We were the first company to get full  catalog licenses from all of the major  labels. In fact, we were about a year and a half before  iTunes. And so there wasn't  any precedent, there wasn't any template.  And we were also  asking for something really exotic, which was  an unlimited streaming service. Right.  You know, which is commonplace today.  But back then. Could you say it's like radio  but it's on the internet? It's more like it's like a jukebox.  Because like radio implies it's  not interactive. A jukebox implies  interactivity. So there's existing royalty  rates for jukeboxes. Yeah. And so we  started gearing off of that. But the funny  thing was, despite the fact that these five major  labels, there were five back in those days, now  there's three in falling. But the five major  labels, although they were all allegedly  bitter competitors,  they all proposed the same  rather exotic structure. Hey, Jerry,

For me  as a first time novelist  I mean third book but first time novelist  having a big publisher like  Random House line up behind the book was  essential to get my name out there.  But as one gets more and more established  or if somebody has just got like unbelievable  social media energy  it's entirely possible to  go direct. And to sell particularly  with electronic books. And keep  the very big piece of the revenue.  You know.  But for nobody like me  definitely a publisher is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their job. I think it'll move. I think agents  I think literary agents that are very  modern and have relatively large  operations will start branching  into that. The trick they're going to have  is that they could enrage the publishers  of course who are very very important  partners of theirs. Always the problem.  But I think you're going to see the really  smart forward agents  starting to do that kind of thing. Interesting.

I always thought it was just an interim  thing you know until this all is all  over the internet. In the meanwhile  while they're still broadcast television  It's a clever work around. It's very clever.  It seems like a joke. They created dime size antennas  they put them in a massive array in  major cities and then you rent  the antenna which gives you access  to broadcast over the air television in that  area. New York had it first.  Aereo just and of course  the networks are livid. Of course.

Channel 5  petition said injunction. This is from  Hearst is the broadcast in this case.  Stop Aereo!  And the judge said Aereo  does not violate copyright.

Start time: 7679.69
End time: 7693.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Apparently their legal team is not as slick.  So that seems to be  and nobody knows the  right stuff. They're rebroadcasting

I remember that they were putting  ads in. They're violating  our license agreement for sure.  But there's nothing. What am I going  to sue them? There's nothing I can do about it.  I'll let CBS handle this.

Start time: 7812.07
End time: 7829.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I understand from Mike is that  the broadcasters believe that Film On  is a similar enough service to  Aereo that if they get precedent with  Film On that doesn't have  the platinum minted legal team  that Aereo has, they're going to have a  better shot at winning. Something like  that. So here's Channel 9 in San

Start time: 7865.26
End time: 7881.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is that Aereo, I believe, is not  inserting their own ads into other people's  programs. Right. They get their money  via subscription fee.  So on one level, the networks  are getting more viewers, which is good for their advertisers.  But they're getting  less of their ads. They're not getting the retransmission

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to justify because from  I think a lot of people's point of view, and possibly  even these judges, they're saying, well wait a minute, you're  free in that city anyway.  You're monetizing with advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're damaged if people are  stopping to pay transmission fees, which of course  people will if they can find  more and more excuses to get rid of their  cable company. And that's the point, which is

Start time: 7911.89
End time: 7927.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the point, which is  most people don't watch over the year.  Most people watch on cable. So they're in effect  double-dipping. They're showing you the ads and they're getting  the retransmission fees from the cable  company. And they've decided  they kind of like that. That's their business model.  That's a good model for them.

Transcript:  So the model on Film On  those sons of bitches  is free on standard  definition with ads  or I can pay for it in high  definition and not have any  ads. And by the way, notice this is  Channel 9, a broadcast  public broadcasting  not for profit. And they've got a Film On  bug even  over it. They do.  Wow. I mean, this is  anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 8102.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  okay.  I can't understand the meaning of a wave.  Wave it off.  This is not the fire  you're looking for.  But Larry's right.  It's all about the false positives.  And that's what drives people crazy about smoke alarms.  I mean, you've charred some bacon in the kitchen  and the thing's screeching.  And I think that's the problem they're solving.  And if people rip out the cables,  they rip out the batteries, and they don't have a smoke alarm anymore.  So it could solve for that.

Start time: 8103.18
End time: 8114.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Apple should do one and they could use Siri.  You know, you could talk to your smoke detector.  She could say, did you say you're  having dinner?  No, she'd get it wrong.  That's okay. Your house will burn down.
