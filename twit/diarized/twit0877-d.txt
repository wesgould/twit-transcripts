Transcript:  Also here from Consumer Reports he's their technology reporter the great Nicholas de Leon good to see you Nicholas  Hey Leo. Thank you for having me. Thanks for joining us really good to have you my pleasure  I  Guess we have to start with Seth Green's bored ape  This is the story of the week  Seth Green bought a has a fair apparently a fairly large NFT collection and  He has created a TV show based on his collection  called White Horse Tavern  The show according to BuzzFeed is based on the question  What if your friendly neighborhood bartender was bored ape yacht club number?  and by the way  even though it is an NFT I'm going to display a  picture of  bored ape  93-98 you do not own this just you're just seeing it do not get confused  He is a sad looking blue-eyed ape  Smoking a reefer it looks like but it's one way, but there's a filter tip  So it must be is to crumpled up cigarette  He has a halo and he has a skeleton t-shirt and in fact if you look  That is his properties purple bone tea sad brown halo bored unshaven  So why is this important? Oh notice at the top reported for suspicious activity  apparently Seth Green got fished and  I'm not sure but I'm gonna guess this has to do with a common problem people have with  NFTs you have a public key  Which you can give out you have a private key  Which you should never ever under any circumstances reveal  apparently some scammers got his private key and stole  Stole I tells you bored ape yacht club number 30 83 98  We found out we found this out by the way at the big V con conference Gary V's  NFT shilling conference last weekend in Minnesota  So  He says and I think he it's the law is unclear that  Because his ape was stolen he no longer has the copyright and the whole show is up in the air  It was purchased by somebody who then sold it on for  $200,000 to a doctor in Australia who goes by the handle dark wing 84  He bought it for put it in a vault called GBE vault where it sits today  Seth has been trying to get a hold of the guy the guy says I'm not giving it to you

End time: 498.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some say that if Seth makes the show he'll be sued by dark wing 84  Some say Seth could go after dark wing 84  All that's happened so far is that open sea has put a little thing on it so he can't sell it forward  reported for suspicious activity I

Start time: 501.20
End time: 519.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would have never heard about the show anything if not for his NFT being stolen  Like this is the best thing for the show because I wouldn't have heard of it. I wouldn't have wanted to watch it  Yeah, I think it's probably worth the $200,000 just  Could be for all we know I mean I think there is a lot of people who are like

Start time: 520.06
End time: 538.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For all we know I mean I think there is a speculation a lot of NFTs are sold  Kind of by the owner to the owner  Anonymously just to pump up the value of it  Interesting by the way, I should I'll stop calling him 83 98 his real name is Fred Simeon

Start time: 540.38
End time: 647.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go, yeah, it's  It's not not exactly a bond villain sort of thing  But  But how many how many of the problems of NFTs does this point out that if if we're talking I've I've  When after NFTs first became a thing I was very intrigued by it because there's all kinds of digital art that  Can't really enter the art market the way that anything that's actually not simply made out of electrons can can can manage and  If you ever gone to like a really good city  city  Art Museum you can see there's some rooms where no this is the it's this isn't the TV screen  Isn't the and the projector isn't the artwork?  It's the video that was created for this artwork and the interaction between the persons and these and these  And these sensors is part of the artwork and really it's intriguing to see how far this can go  But it's not going to go that far if these artists can't have this can't plug into the same phony baloney hyper inflated  Non-transparent payment and an investment platform that traditional art is put in so that's a great thing  But how how can you can you imagine if if an Andy Warhol fan if the if the Warhol that sold for?  For 12 million dollars last week it got stolen and then sold to somebody else and then sold to somebody else who now has it  And they were able to establish the chain of who bought it from whom and where it is now  And then the person who got it who originally got it stolen from say well, that's great  So get the guy no wait a minute. What you know, we found out where it went and  Kim can we go over the first guy who's to bought stolen property? No  Because there's no present for this. We didn't plan for anything. No one knows what we do  Yeah, I'll be planned. All we planned on here is how we can charge people money

Start time: 647.34
End time: 659.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't give him the information right like kind of like he gave him the money  so  You know, he said please give me the money  He said I know your mom your mom wants the money but like

Start time: 662.96
End time: 690.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A bank is not liable if you if you you know, give money somebody on the street or give them their pin  They're not liable because they didn't you know, it wasn't fraudulent  I don't there's a lot of questions. It's still fishing  The good news is the NFT you made an excellent point any which is  unlike say a stolen Andy Warhol the Providence the chain of  Possession is public everybody knows who had it who has it now  Yeah

Start time: 691.09
End time: 758.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and  the other component is that the idea that this is one of those rare NFTs or one of those alternative NFTs where you're not only getting  the you're not only getting the electrons, but you're also getting commercial rights to the thing and  Now we have to figure out. Okay. Does that actually transfer with the theft or did the contract?  Stay with Seth Green even though the item itself has been stolen from him  So could could he go forward with this and with a person who has it in his possession who knows?  He's got stolen property would they have the absolute?  Guts to sue Seth Green for for doing for making a TV show out of a character  Whose property was he stole and he has stolen property?  And no no no judge  Judges judges didn't go to law school 80 years ago and sit in the Supreme Court for 40 years to decide stuff like this  they were they wanted to sign freedom and liberty and rights and and  This is not what Justice Brandeis spend his time deliberating. I don't think this is high on their interest rate  Do you own any NFTs Nicholas?

Start time: 759.94
End time: 767.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I own any NFTs?  I think I oh I bought one as like an experiment just to do it just to go through the process of doing it

Transcript:  It's one of those  Loot ones where it's just a text of like the you know, oh a sword a bag of coins  So and it's just that text but it cost me like $200  I did want to add that we did a story a few months ago at Consumer Reports on  Crypto wallets and I only bring that up just to say because you know  I don't know what what this Seth Green or what the details are  But just to highlight that this stuff is still kind of hard to use pretty unscrutable  and if you're like the average person out there like I you know, I don't know that I feel bad for Seth Green but like  There's so much spam. There's so much phishing. This whole scene is so like  So shady, it's just so user unfriendly  You know, it's no wonder that we're 10 plus years into Bitcoin and it's still kind of this like  Experimental  Thing, you know where it's not a mainstream

Start time: 825.46
End time: 842.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tech yet. I have to say more and more I become kind of hostile to crypto and  Especially to NFTs because it really just seems like mostly it's people  Getting suckered  You know, some people are making a lot of money. But if you're making a lot of money  It's because somebody else gave you a lot of money

Start time: 843.84

Transcript:  Yeah, this is like playing the stock market in 1918  Playing the stock market in 1918 before okay everything crashed everybody's destitute  We're gonna start to have some rules because trusting people to do the right thing and not overinflate things to do to justify their own share  That isn't working out for the world economy.

Start time: 872.60
End time: 931.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well, that's that's the other interesting point of that because  Some NFTs are being created by the artists who are making the art  It's a way of kind of supporting the artist and you're not you know with a digital print what you know  You can't you can't say I own the the one copy of it. It's digital  So maybe that makes sense in that context, but this like a lot of them like the original  zombies  Like Kevin Rose's owls they contracted with some poor  artist who drew a thousand bored apes  Got paid whatever he got paid and that was that yeah, and now really all of the money  It's not it has nothing to do with the person who designed it  So I kind of feel bad for the guy who did Fred Simeon who drew it because he's thinking  Yeah, Fred Green's gonna do like a national TV show based on my creation. I'm not gonna see a penny of it  So this is really all kind of the aftermarket not the artist the artist is you know work for hire in this

Start time: 932.68
End time: 944.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say that to also all the writers and artists who've been writing Marvel Comics for the past 20 30 years  Well, that's got paid like $800 for a story that became the basis of a 1.8 billion dollar movie. Yeah, that's a really good point

Start time: 945.28
End time: 946.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Hey, guess guess what who's getting two tickets to the premiere you are  I  Just signed it just signed the sign this thing on the back of the ticket in order to use it that says that you  Make you will not actually so it's in any time for any reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, they say okay boomer  You know Larry David on the Super Bowl remember did that ad where he did?  it's never going anywhere and  They they I guess I'm that guy but I am very skeptical about this whole thing  And I no longer see a real value to any of it including Bitcoin by the way

Start time: 985.28
End time: 1078.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well again, well again that was just like NFTs when it was first put forward the reasons for having  Having cryptocurrency were so well founded the idea of having a having a currency that is not tied down to any  nationality or any actual bank the ability one of the one of the use cases for it was  Relief organizations trying to get relief funds to  people who absolutely who are basically in  poverty's excuse me parts of the nation where  Parts of the world where poverty's random food is food is scarce  Where if you send actual relief checks in through the national banks  Well guess who owns the National Bank the same person who is who has been putting these people into poverty putting these people into  Into hunger whereas if you basically say we're gonna create an economy inside the sec the section that is based on this  This United Nations cryptocurrency  basic and what if you were in a nation where that is in a state of  Constant collapse where you feel as though at any moment now your currency is your savings. It's going to be nationalized  That's all this these are all reasons and to say nothing of people in this world who don't have access to banking  I mean this we take that for granted even in the United States. They're people who are living and working and  Contributing to our economy who don't have access to banking who would be able to make transfers from person to person  Without having to pay exorbitant fees through well as farger or whatever  So but but again suddenly do you turn this into this bro investor opportunity and now you've basically ruined it. It's terrible

Start time: 1079.30
End time: 1152.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a that's a very good point. I hadn't really thought about that. Yeah  Well, we just it may be one of those things this happens all the time in technology where the early years are very weird and  unpredictable and there's no  Nobody understand what's going on and then at some point it settles down and regulations are conceived and it starts to  Become more orderly. It's possible at this point. I would not buy an NFT if I were you  Let's talk a little bit about the New California bill  This is the new thing. Of course, Texas started this way saying individuals could sue abortion  Providers or even somebody who drove somebody to get an abortion a new California bill could allow parents to sue  social media companies for up to  $25,000 if  Their children become addicted to the platforms  Now it's not a law yet  But in this day and age I could easily see this  Becoming a law in California  I'm sure you talk about do you ever talk about internet addiction Georgia or  What do you think of that notion that people could get addicted to social media?

Start time: 1153.24
End time: 1181.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are addicted to social media  I don't even have my teens like even they won't tell their parents this but even my teens will say that they are 100%  addicted and use way too much time on the internet there  It's it's that's what it's made for right?  Like they try to get you hooked up to be able to this is what makes you feel good and your value is  Dependent upon how many people liked the latest thing that you did  So I think that it's it comes with a huge cost. So should there be a law that lets people sue

Start time: 1183.00
End time: 1190.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For addiction like should I be able to sue Twitter or actually wouldn't be Twitter the Instagram, right?  Or a snapchat that my kid just can't put the phone down

Start time: 1190.80
End time: 1256.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or you know even something like tick-tock like just even oh, yeah that people are using  But I don't think that you should be able to I don't think that you should sue them  I don't think that it's the same thing as like, you know being like government being able to well in like Canada being able to  Sue tobacco because of the amount of Medicare costs that it costs the government. That's different to be able to cover  It's a different thing  It's a much more direct line of kind of attack and they already knew the cost to that versus social media  You know, it's it's one of those things that I think that kids shouldn't be on it is like you want to wait as long  As possible to have your children on social media because it does create the same kind of addiction as a gambling machine does that on and off  reward makes our brain just go wild and  It's really hard for people to get off of it  Like there are so many like like, you know 70 80 year olds that are the same thing  Like once they're on they can't get off again even  Politicians and people that we know and billionaires they're on Twitter and they can't stop tweeting and you're like just put down  Put stop someone take away the phone

Transcript:  Is it ultimately the fault of these companies that design these algorithms to be so sticky? I

Start time: 1263.92
End time: 1309.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think that yes, they they they spend they hire people like me to be able to make their  systems as you know, like like  Thanks, like they're doing it on purpose because you're all like our amount of attention is finite and we can only be on one  Social platform at a time and so because of that they're trying to fight to make it as addictive and a salient and  Having people on there as much as possible because that's really how they make money being able to see what we do and what we click  And what we don't click it's not really about using the device  But it's about finding out where we go from what device right like Facebook makes most of its money  Not from us being on Facebook, but on being able to track where we go and why we're going there  So it's no different than the line than Purdue Pharma

Start time: 1310.54
End time: 1324.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Selling Oxycontin and encouraging physicians to over prescribe Oxycontin knowing people will get addicted  Are is yeah is like Instagram and snap and tick-tock. Are they are they the Purdue Pharma's of social? I

Start time: 1326.00
End time: 1390.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually do believe so like I don't think that they I think that they come with some like a lot of good and you  Can send out information and you have direct access to people and it gives a lot of people a lot of power  So I don't think that it is just a negative but just like you know using Oxycontin or something else if you are an extreme  Pain it can also be very beneficial  I don't think that it should just be we can't just throw out the baby with the bathwater  but I think that us not knowing that it comes with a severe cost and that  Like even people that work in these large companies  They will themselves say that they know that they are causing social damage as well as great benefits  But we can't just say that it's only good and we can't just say that it's only bad  So I think that it should be you know looked into I think that it should be legislated  I think that if they're tracking us we should know what they're tracking and why  You know, who are they sending all of this information to how is it being used? How are we being manipulated? It's kind of the  Shadiness for me is more about us not knowing there is no transparency  And if you take a look at their you know, try to read through all of the legal ease of all of their privacy policies  It's really difficult to be able to navigate even if you have a law degree

Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is stuff we discussed internally like, you know, let's say we're reviewing the new iPhone  Like are we by giving the iPhone a good score when the camera's great excellent that are we contributing to?  You know just kids just endlessly scrolling through Instagram or just spending all day in discord  Like should we should we take that stuff into account when we evaluate, you know, the the the pixel the pixel six or whatever?  I don't know but it is stuff that we're we're thinking about like to what degree  Didn't Tim Cook say a few months ago that he doesn't want to encourage like mindless scrolling on your phone and just think about like how  Many people are just mindless.

Transcript:  Go ahead Nicholas. Oh, I was gonna say it's it's like yeah, it's is it is it my role to say?  Oh, this iPhone is awesome, but don't use it because Facebook is bad or don't use it because Instagram is addictive  I don't know what my actual role  In that sort of transaction, but we are we are we're not ignoring it  We are thinking like what role do we play here? Should we should we tweak should we not so we just leave it as is  You know, I'm not announcing anything today  But like we're thinking about all these things that you see that you don't necessarily think of consumer reports like  necessarily weighing in on but we're we're thinking about it, I guess you you made a good point Georgia because

And I think that that is what should be taught in schools  Like there's certain subjects like our school system our education system hasn't changed much in like hundreds of years like the subjects that we're teaching  Which are important but like we need to learn about like becoming media savvy about  You know, how is media used to be able to manipulate us how easily we are manipulated  What are the good and bad? How do you know if you're addicted?  like there's a lot of information that we need to be taught at a much younger age and when people watch shows like this and  Read articles about media. They're learning about the good and the bad of that which I think is really important  Because I don't think that most people know and I think that when you're young, they don't really know how addictive that is how it's actually  Changing the wiring of your brain and that's like once you start working through addiction centers really quick at a very young age  They become really strong and some people have addictive personalities where they're already inclined to be able to be addicted to that dopamine center  Which makes us feel motivated and excited  it's all those bells and whistles that happen in our head when you you know win a jackpot or  You know open up some tasty treat on your video game and get the best card that you're supposed to have  So if we knew about that I think that we would make better decisions, I mean I'm addicted to spaghetti that doesn't mean

Transcript:  The landmark decision against the tobacco companies points the way towards  Every sort of law about this about addiction. It wasn't so much that they were selling an addictive substance  It was that they knew how addictive it was. They were  intentionally  Adapting the product to make it more addictive and they were actively denying and disproving that it was addictive to their to their customers  So that that really put the responsibility right in their lap. Do you think the social networks do the same thing?  I definitely I definitely think they I definitely think they know why  why I  Think that they buy slot machines in 2022 based on digital technology work much differently and much more  Efficiently than the ones built in 1953 they understand when to disrupt our  Rational centers, obviously Jordan will talk better about this than I can so I'm but nonetheless, I'm concerned about laws like this  I'm not so concerned about this one  Rather I wasn't as much as I was I was after I read the law itself because it does appear to  What it what it does is that it doesn't simply say we are gonna punish you if you  If you're a service and you meet some extremely vaguely defined way of mishandling  Your your your child customers and making them addicted to stuff  It basically puts some guideposts into what qualifies for for this sort of relief  But most importantly, I think is the section that basically says that by the way you get a you get a complete get out of jail  Free card if you just do the two thing these two things if you do quarterly audits of how your practices  Could be addicting children and then if you whatever you find that can be that seems to be addictive if you remedy this within 30 days  Again, you get you get a get out of jail free card  So I think that was from my reading of this  He said not being a lawyer  It does seem as though the thrust of this is not to open up the gates to all kinds of lawsuits  But to basically say look we are it's not enough for us to simply put into the law that you are required to do  Quarterly audits and remedy things within 30 days  We're gonna put this rule in place as a way for you to get the escape clause from a whole bunch of hurt that  That is good  Yeah

I mean we hear about it all the time. There needs to be some liability. I do yeah, I do think  As long as you do it carefully and don't basically torch an entire platform  Because it's in addition to causing harm to kids social media and give in  Allowing very isolated kids who think that they're the only person who are like this  They're the only people who are suffering these problems to find their tribe to find their people out there  Who can they talk they can talk to when they don't feel as though they can talk to any of the adults that are in  Their lives we can't there's no number to there's no numerical index to how much that has helped children over the past  Ten or however many years we've had social media and we don't want to disrupt that right Georgia

So it because of that it has its own effect that you don't really have to worry to it  I think that you know social media targeting kids is different than being able to be used by kids  I think that it's like the camel cigarettes where they had this little cartoon character and they realized that you know  If you don't start smoking by the age of 18, you're probably never gonna smoke and so they were like, oh  Let's make sure that we grab kids when they're young  So they start smoking so we can make our money and then the government's kind of went down on it and having cool packaging  It works so well for us  Like we all think that we're not gonna be able to like get attracted to being able to use something that's flashy and snazzy  Looking and that all of our you know people that we looked up up to are using but we are all very easily  Manipulated by these things.

Transcript:  Yes. Since whenever.  When was it? How old is it? I wonder. What's the first?  Something. All right. Now I'm going to go on a quest somewhere.  eBay will have it somewhere. I want to find the first Consumer Reports magazine.  I think that'd be fascinating. Fascinating stuff.  Our show today brought to you by Zapier. I am a happy, happy Zapier user.  Have been for years.  Zapier automates the boring stuff so you don't have to do it over and over again.  Streamline your routine operations tasks that E up your time.  Things like lead management, employee onboarding, customer support.  With Zapier, it makes it easy to connect all your apps, automate routine tasks, streamline your processes, freeing up your time to prioritize customer and client needs.  The power of automation made possible for everyone.  I use Zapier. Well, for instance, this whole show is produced with a Zapier script.  Whenever I go to my news reader or I bookmark something on pin board.  Here's my Zapier script that takes it from pin board, posts it on Twitter, then puts it in a Google Sheet.  A document which then the my producer, Jason, can take and paste into our rundowns.  I have zaps for all sorts of things. You will too.  It's a great way to automate.  Now, let me show you with Zapier the cool thing about workflows because you can connect almost any app to almost any other app.  It's really kind of amazing.  They come with a bunch of sample zaps, stuff that you might want to use, but it's very powerful.  I don't think there's anybody who has more connections to more apps and tools and so forth than Zapier.  You connect your apps, you can move data, you can copy data, you can process data.  It is just an amazing tool.  And what I love about them is they've been very good about helping people get started.  So they've got videos, they've got samples.  There are more than 4,000 different apps that you can connect with if-then statements.  So if something happens on Instagram, I can automatically save it to Dropbox or move it to and on and on and on and on.  I mean, there's just no limit of what you can do with Zapier.  I want you to give Zapier a try.  Go to Zapier, Z-A-P-I-E-R dot com slash twit.  Whether it's business automation, personal automation, no coding is required.  Anybody can do it.  4,000 of the most popular apps businesses use every day.  Google Sheets, that's what we use.  QuickBooks, Facebook, Google Ads.  That's really the only hard thing about doing this ad is thinking up how you might want to use it.  So start to think about what would you do?  For instance, a new client comes in, you make sure you add them to QuickBooks, you add them to your CRM.  They have thousands of easy to use templates.  You can get them started right away.  On average, and I love this, the other thing I get an email from Zapier saying how much time I've saved every week.  On average, the average user saves $10,000 in recovered time every year.  1.8 million people and businesses use Zapier to streamline their work.  Find out, find some more time to do the stuff that you really care about.  Let Zapier automate the boring stuff.  See for yourself why teams at Airtable and Dropbox and HubSpot and Zendesk and thousands of other companies use Zapier every day to automate their businesses.  It's the best tool ever.  I almost want to just take you and say, look, look what you can do.  But maybe the best thing to do is try it for free.  Zapier.com slash twit, Z-A-P-I-E-R, Zapier.com slash twit.  You'll find a way to use it.  You'll find a hundred ways to use it.  For home automation, you know, the sun goes down, my lights come up, things like that.  It's just incredible.  Zapier.com slash twit.  Let's see. Back to the show.  There is, speaking of bad laws, both Texas and Florida have social media censorship laws.  Florida is very famously exempted Disney until the governor of Florida decided, I don't like Disney.  They're a woke company and they took it out.  They actually took them out of the law.  The Ninth Circuit Court has, I'm happy to say, blocked the Florida law.  Of course, the Fifth Circuit unblocked the Texas law.  So it's not clear what the courts are going to do.  The Eleventh Circuit came to a response to a lawsuit brought by NetChoice and CCIA.  These are the same people who sued in Texas.  The court found that Florida's argument that social media giants are not intended to,  entitled to First Amendment rights does not hold up.  The court wrote, not in their wildest dreams could anyone in the founding generation have imagined  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or TikTok.  We were just talking about that.  But whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever advancing technology,  the basic principles of freedom of speech in the press, like the First Amendment's command,  do not vary when a new and different medium for communication appears.  We're going to have a little bit of a collision because the Fifth Circuit lifted the injunction on Texas's law.  The Supreme Court has not issued a decision, but Justice Alioto upheld the Fifth Circuit.  Oh no, wait a minute, that hasn't happened yet.  The Fifth Circuit lifted it. We haven't heard from Alioto yet.  I mean Alioto. Alioto is a mayor of San Francisco, sorry. Alioto, former mayor.  And I think it's Justice Clarence Thomas who is the justice for the Eleventh Circuit.  So he might also be expected to weigh in if they appeal.  Andy, you sound like you have something to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know if they even really explained their decision basically saying that it was okay for this to go forward.  So basically they didn't make it easy for this to resist further injunction in the future.  Again, not being a lawyer. I've never had so many people in my Rolodex who are lawyers and Washington wonks to advise me on how this stuff works.  They've had it in the past five or six or seven years.  But it's not over yet, but it's very, very dangerous.  I mean, God help anybody who lives in a state whose governor wants to be president in two years because they're going to be doing some wacky, wacky stuff in your state.  And that's exactly what's happening in Florida.  And nutty.  I mean, there really is the opinions of the people I was talking to about this was that the governor knew and the legislature knew damn well this has very, very little chance of standing up to any scrutiny whatsoever.  And it was just basically there so that they can get that notch on their belt and they can campaign on it in the midterms and in a presidential election.  I think that's true of the Texas bill as well.

Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there's stuff.  There are laws very, very high on the pyramid that have always explicitly maintained and upheld the idea that you can't treat YouTube as a corporate entity as somebody who's shouting stuff into the streets and has to be held responsible for the stuff that they shout in the street.  That is so well established that you're going to have to come up with a brand new trick in order to assault that in any way, shape or form.  This is why oftentimes five out of seven really, really scary legislative text stories that you see coming through, you can basically dismiss because all you have to do is check paragraph one, paragraph two to say, okay, it's been proposed, but has it made out of a committee?  Has it moved forward at all?  There's so many of these nutty laws that senators and congress people, they just want to hear themselves talk.  They just want to be able to put something in a newsletter or on a mailing card and they know this isn't going to go forward.  Sometimes, though, these things do go forward.  That's why they have to be publicized.  They have to be talked about and combated because this would be super, super dangerous.  I was saying that the California law about suing companies for social addiction of kids was, okay, when you look at the law, it doesn't look so bad.  This law is just bad.  This is basically saying that every company that allows an individual citizen or entity to speak on the internet has to serve the needs of the state, whatever the state just deems those needs to be.  And if it doesn't cow-town to those needs, that they can basically be shut down.  This is not something that amendment number one on a constitution is equipped to permit.

Transcript:  The Texas law says the First Amendment should treat social media companies less like a newspaper and more like a railroad, a common carrier, which is a railroad or a bus or an airline or a transportation company that offers their services to the general public.  The problem is, of course, you remember a few years ago, that was the argument for blocking net neutrality laws, which is that ISPs were not common carriers.  So it's a very complicated landscape we live in.  I think you make the point, Andy, exactly right.  It's more about political notches on the belt than it is about actual sensible legislation.  We'll see.  Any of these could become a law at any time.  It's just unknown.  There was a law I was kind of excited about, Senator A.B.  Klobuchar's bill, she and Chuck Grassley pushing the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which I interpreted as kind of a data portability act.  A new version of that bill was released this week, which does only a couple of things.  Really make sure that the bill doesn't apply to telcos and on financial companies, who of course are big donors to the Senators campaign.

But when you say, that's great.  I'm so glad you're on our side on this because there are communities where you're not allowed to have competition in selection of broadband providers or phone providers.

DuckDuckGo has promoted itself as a privacy first search engine.  But they have also released browsers.  And it turns out that the DuckDuckGo browser on mobile, according to security researcher Zach Edwards, while it does block trackers from Google and Facebook, allows Microsoft trackers to continue running.  Here's Zach's tweet.  And then DuckDuckGo admits it, saying, yeah, well, that was part of our deal with Bing.  DuckDuckGo CEO and founder Gabriel Weinberger confirmed their browser intentionally allows Microsoft trackers third party sites due to a search syndication agreement with Redmond.  But we're working hard.  Gabriel says, we've been continually pushing.

It's when you find out they didn't share this information upfront somewhere in their hidden in their privacy policy, somewhere where we could read about it.  And then you're like, because then, you know, it's one of those things that once you trust something and you give something your trust, then you find out that you shouldn't have.  Then you question everything else about it.  And then people are like, oh, well, you know, might as well just use Google because at least we know that they sell everything.

It's still better than most.  True.  Just be forthright.  If you're going to say we're a privacy forward company, then when you when you aren't doing it, you need to tell people.

Like did Microsoft put like restrictions on what they could say?  Oh, maybe.  No. Yeah.  But yeah, I do think that in this case, if they have just said it, even if they just buried it in, like you said, in just a privacy policy somewhere to have it come out this way with the security researcher who then put you on board.  And then it looks like your tweet, your tweeted statement is kind of like, well, actually, you kind of come across a little bit defensive and it doesn't look great.  Even even if you're what you're saying is true is like, hey, look, our hands are tied.  Like I get that I'm an adult. You can tell me that.  But they do come across a little defensive.  And like I said, I know some folks there and they are they are pushing hard in this space in terms of like user rights and privacy.  They're there.  I think a force for good in the Internet privacy conversation.  But in this particular instance, yeah, they come across a little a little weird.

I think they are now saying something about it.  They updated their description of the browser in the App Store and the Google Play Store.  It originally said Tracker Radar automatically blocks hidden third party trackers.  The new description.  Well, it doesn't say except for Microsoft.  It now says automatically blocks most hidden third party tracking scripts.  See notes and link below for more information.  So they're at least they're kind of admitting it.  It's still in the fine print.  Give them some credit for doing something, I guess.  Absolutely. I mean, Firefox blocks everything, including Microsoft stuff, right?  I use Firefox. I turn on all the blockers.  I put on other stuff, additional stuff.  I am more concerned.  I used to, and I've mentioned this before, be a little more sanguine.  I don't mind if my information is shared with advertisers.  That seems not so dangerous.

You're going to have to absolutely get everything correct.  But once the right files have been filed, they have to hand this stuff over,  which is why I think there was last week was a 30 Democratic congresspeople basically signed a letter saying,  Google, you need to do something to protect this abuse of the, this abuse of geofence,  particularly to protect people who are seeking abortions or at least pursuing abortion.

What's bad and what these apps are actually looking at, what data they're collecting, the whole nine yards.  So if you just Google Consumer Reports period tracking apps, it's again, I had I had nothing to do with the story.  It was written by a colleague called Katherine Roberts, published May 25th.

Flow got in trouble as I remember, right, for selling information on period calendar,  period tracker and Fertility Friend.  Ah, yes.

She was incensed.  She was like, that's ridiculous.  So go ahead and unionize, John.  How many if there's only one employee, do half of you have to vote yes?  And the other half, it's OK.  I don't know how that works.  Our show today brought to you by UserWay.  I am a big fan of UserWay.org.  It's the world's number one accessibility solution.  We use it on our website.  If you go to twit.tv and you go down to the bottom, you will see the UserWay icon,  you know, the Vitruvian man with his arms or her arms straight out.  You click that and you'll see all sorts of things you can do to make our website more accessible.  UserWay's incredible AI powered solution tirelessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG guidelines.  That's the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  In a matter of seconds, UserWay's AI can achieve more than an entire team of developers could do in months.  In fact, if you've, you know, once you learn that you have a requirement,  because all websites are public entities, so you have a requirement under the ADA in the United States  and in other countries, they have laws, similar laws, to make your site accessible,  then you may, as I did, go, oh no, what does this mean?  Is this going to be expensive? It's overwhelming.  Once you find UserWay, you can breathe a sigh of relief.  UserWay solutions make it simple, easy, cost effective.  In fact, you can go right now to UserWay.org slash twit and use their free scanning.  You will see if your website is already ADA compliant.  Even if it is, I really love this, because ours was, ours was pretty good.  I'm proud of our engineers. But adding this little button at the bottom makes such a difference.  You can change the font to a dyslexic friendly font,  and you can change the colors and the contrast to make it easier for people with vision issues  or color blindness to see what you're doing. It's just fantastic.  And if you have an enterprise level website, huge website, thousands of pages,  UserWay even has a managed solution. Their team can handle everything for you.

And these user usability tools, these accessibility tools,  are now available to small and medium businesses too.  But of course, they can scale with you as you grow.  In fact, UserWay is the leading accessibility solution in the market today.  61% market share. It's the biggest in the world.  Motley Fool, good example, big site.  They had 1911 pages on their website, 20 million page views a month.  They had done the right thing, as many of us do. You structured it for accessibility.  But they spent a lot of time keeping the site updated, because you got new pages all the time.  And the standards are changing all the time.  So, Motley Fool went to UserWay. They added an extra layer of accessibility  to make sure their browsing experience was accessible to everybody.  It's the right thing to do.  UserWay automatically fixes violations at the code level.  They auto-generate image alt tags, writing the descriptions for you using their image recognition.  You can add to them, you can modify it, but you got a great start right out of the box.  They can fix those complex nav menus that stymie all users.  Everybody has trouble with them.  They ensure all pop-ups are accessible, fix vague link violations, fix broken links,  make sure your site uses accessible colors, but staying true to your brand.  And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations fixed on your website.  It works anywhere. It's a single line of JavaScript. That's all we had to add to our website.

Or maybe she's digging it.  Watching companies like Starbucks, Amazon fight unions and still get unionized,  it's sending a shiver down the spine of Apple, I'm thinking.  They don't want to be unionized. They've actually hired a well-known anti-union law firm to come in  to support them, to help them in preventing this.  There are already dates and union drives at three of Apple's retail stores, New York, Maryland, and Georgia.  Maryland and Georgia have set dates to hold elections.  June 2nd, workers in the Cumberland Mall Apple store will vote.  Apple's Towson Center store in Maryland do that on June 15th.  So a video has been sent, and this is what companies do, they have mandatory meetings, not illegal.  All the employees come in kind of like in all hands in the store, and they play this video from Deidre O'Brien,  in which she says, Apple moves incredibly fast.  It's one thing I love about our work in retail.  It means we need to be able to move fast too.  And I worry, I worry, because the union will bring its own legally mandated rules  that will determine how we work through issues that could make it harder for us to act swiftly to address the things you raise.  I'm committed to and proud of our ability to act fast and support our teams to support you.  But I don't know if we could have moved as quickly under a collective bargaining agreement.  It could limit our ability to make widespread changes to improve your experience.  And I think that's what's at stake here.  Apple also put their money where their mouth is, raising the minimum wage from $20 to $22 an hour.  So it's pretty good pay.  Yeah.

Start time: 4151.75
End time: 4298.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gosh, I guess I guess they're playing to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, but this is why it's important that employees at least try to unionize.  Because guess what?  It turns out that Apple could afford to give everybody a minimum $2 raise all along.  But I guess they were planning to do that anyway.  And just serendipitously, this was a since I've got your ear anyway and telling you not to join a union, this is no.  Exactly. It was the pressure that this came that they was put upon them.  And oddly enough, it's this kind of response that kind of represents why unions are very, very important.  Because otherwise, a corporation can basically take a paternal attitude towards their workers.  We know what's best.  We don't want we don't want we don't want you to do something foolish that will just ruin your life.  We're looking out for you.  We like the system where you ask us for things and based on our own whims, we either say no or we say we think about it.  And this is and this is I don't I don't blame Apple for doing this.  They are again, a two trillion dollar company that does that's whenever I say that a lot,  but only because a lot of people have this idea of two hippies in a garage who just want to change the world.  And that was actually it was just one of the one of those people were actual hippies as we find out.  But a two trillion dollar company is probably always going to react to unionization of their hourly wage employees with trying to slap that down as hard as they can without actually hiring Pinkerton men to store them each store.  So but so as you say, this week, I think on the second, the Maryland store is voting.  And then on the middle of June is when the Georgia store is voting.  They have to file with the NLRB so you can actually track that sort of stuff and see what's going on.  I mean, remember that this was the same company that basically was telling all their employees, by the way, after you clock out, you're going to have to hang around for a half hour while our store security examines your backpack and examines your bag to make sure you're not shoplifting for a month.  And by the way, you're not being paid for that for the time you're waiting for that security sweep to come over.  Again, you need to have you need to be able to return the fire against your employers or else you have absolutely no ability to resist when they do stupid things.

Start time: 4301.28
End time: 4449.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's one of these things where, you know, these are huge companies that you really can't go against.  But when people unionize, you become this huge company that's able to deal with it.  Let's just say it like $22 an hour doesn't even hit inflation.  That would be $25 an hour plus.  And so Apple knows that if there's you like, unfortunately, the US is so far behind with leave sick days, maternity, paternity sets, like being able to take days off, being able to have your own legal representative to be able to deal with these companies.  HR works for the company.  They don't work for you.  You have no recourse.  And they, you know, especially huge companies that make all of these profits and want to keep their shareholders happy.  They don't want people to be able to have the power to unionize.  And it seems ridiculous that anyone would not say yes to this.  And companies try to say, oh, they're going to take your money.  And you can even hear by Apple's approaches that will be faster.  They don't say that this will be better for you, but they really say that, oh, we'll be faster.  Yeah, it'll be definitely quicker for them to be able to say no to everything that you ask.  And to not have to raise things.  But it's not going to be better for you.  And yeah, it takes more time.  If you get a legal representative every time you get to go see management, they're going to be much more careful because HR works for the company to make sure that the company is protected.  Their legal team is making sure that the company is protected.  You don't have any protections at all.  And the laws and regulations that are in state are just so very archaic.  It's really sad to see, you know, out of all developed nations, to see where the U.S.  right now is in being able to protect just the regular middle class worker.  And the protections are just so very sad, like that people can't even spend time with their newborn baby or premature.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Whereas most parts of the world that are developed countries have a year plus six months to most places have a year to two years plus that you can stay home with your baby, you know, which companies are able to swallow and governments are being able to protect.  So I really hope that they end up unionizing.  And I hope that most people that are working there are going to be able to fight for their own rights so that people can eat and stay home and be able to take care of yourself.  Because let's just say it.  The companies are not going to be there to be able to take care of you if you're sick.  They really they don't care.  You're not any company that says that you are family that just says that we are going to be abusing.

Transcript:  And a very quick statement.  This isn't a vague sort of notion being a member of the union.  In the United States, if you are a member of the union, you have real and authoritative protections if you decide to take action against your employer.  If they have a store decided to if they're unionized and they went by the numbers and staged a walkout, Apple cannot just simply say, great, you're all fired.  We're going to be moving new people in there.  Have fun wherever you're going to go.  No, there's procedures that have to be formed.  They are now work this dispute now forums under the under the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board that actually has a lot of authority and a lot of power to inflict a lot of pain.  So maybe Apple will not will want to make people happy and address their concerns in a very meaningful way before everybody walks out on the day after Thanksgiving.

Transcript:  We should also point out that Apple has moved every job they possibly could move to low paying countries like China.  But they can't do that with retail.  You have to be in the US to work in a retail store.  So it's just like Amazon, Starbucks.  These are people who have to work in the US.  And so Apple's trying to be as cheap as they can with these people and any job that they could move overseas.  They did.  And they and they didn't move it to high paying Canada.  They moved it to China and Vietnam and other places where they pay a lot less.  So, yeah, I think I'm a little disappointed.  I mean, Apple kind of plays very much on this notion that they are altruistic and and and I don't know if hippies is the right word.  But, you know, people focused.  But they went out and hired anti-union lawyers from Littler Mendelsohn, who are currently working at Starbucks and have worked in the past for McDonald's to prevent unionization.  You know, they're a company and it's OK to unionize.  It's OK.

So they're not like, you know, they didn't reach becoming a trillion dollar company by being altruistic and kind to their workers and wanting to pay people the most.

Transcript:  I just wanted to jump in and say I was at advice media from 2015 to 2017 when we unionized.  That's right.  You were one of the early ones to guess.  Yes.  I remember my first day at work was August 2015 as I was day one day to my managing editor asked if I was interested in joining a union.  I was like, I've literally never thought about that.  But sure, why not?  It was kind of interesting.  And I don't know how folks how many folks know how this process works.  But we had to meet after work off site in like the back of like a pizzeria in Brooklyn somewhere.  We all sat in a circle.  We all kind of like, so do we want to join union?  Do we want to do this?  You know, I had a serious discussion about it and it was like 99 percent of people said, yeah, let's do it.  So that was that was it was just kind of scary.  Like, oh, we're signing union cards.  This is such a weird and like this country just like telegraphs like, oh, a union.  What is scary?  What a what a hostile thing to do to your employer.  And it was like, whatever.  But we signed the cards and about negotiations of the first contract to take about a year, as I recall.  But after the contract was ratified, like we immediately all got raises.  We all got back pay.  We all got better leave.  Like there was no negative outcome for any of the people who unionized.  I don't recall vice giving us those those scary videos of the go.  This will slow down the company.  I don't recall them doing that.  To be fair, I wasn't part of the negotiating committee, so I wasn't necessarily privy to all the management stuff.  But just as a rank and file employee, there was there was literally zero downside to unionizing.  So, yeah, I it's funny.  I see those comments on my credit.  People to unions.  They're this. They're that.  They you know, there's there's like weird opinions in the U.S.  about like what unions do it like they're good for workers.  I don't think that's how to say.

So I'm not going to make any waves for them because what I'm going to do is pull myself up and become that person.  And so it's part of the mythology.  And so we actually revere these companies, these bosses, these billionaires like they're somehow, you know, special gods that we could someday aspire to be.  And we don't want to do anything.  We don't want to tax them.  We don't want to give them any trouble.  It's OK.  And I think that's starting to crack.  But it's for a long time.  It's been part of our mythology.  And I think it's unique to America, that idea that anybody can make it here.  And as a result, you know, you know, I don't want to pay taxes when I do.  So I better make sure it's OK right now for the billionaires.

I remember doing back in the 80s voting at a radio station to bring in the union.  I've been a member ever since.  And yeah, it costs you money.  You pay union dues, but you also get health benefits.  You also get collect.  The most important thing is collective bargaining.  Just as you said, Georgia, your bargaining is a unit as a group of people instead of an individual against a big company.  They got lawyers.  They got all sorts of people, you know, and it's just you saying, can I have a raise, please?  It's much better to bargain collectively.  I think 13 percent more pay for union represented workers in the U.S. than non-union right there.

Transcript:  I got to cite Studs Terkel here who was had loved.  He wrote this wonderful book on working.  And he has this this this it's a company, a group put together a video compilation of the story he used to tell all a lot during his speaking appearances about about waiting for the bus in Chicago and same same people like every single day with someone in a Brooks Brothers suit.  And he finally likes and he finally says, oh, my birthday is coming up and talks about any starts talking about unions and the guy in the Brooks Brothers suits.  Oh, I hate unions.  And he said, OK, did you work 18 hours today or did you work eight hours?  Work eight hours. Did you work on Saturday and Sunday or did you have the weekend off?  Well, I had the weekend off. OK, did you start working at eight or 18?  Like at 18. OK, guess what?  There were let me tell you about the Haymarket affair in Chicago 100 years ago where four labor organizers were hanged for trying to form a union because they and your other other people who were with your great great grandparents fought for fought for your rights.  That's why you're going home at five o'clock. That's why you've got the weekend off.  That's why you got to go to school.  So don't don't don't don't don't don't don't shade labor unions because they are we forget all the all the victories that they won through.  Again, I was I'm not joking about Pinkerton.  Men there would companies would just simply hire people with with guns to simply go in and shoot at people who are protesting people who are blocking the gates and with the with the perfect permission and cadence of the law enforcement.  In the community. So this is this is why I'm very, very much pro union.  And although I'm sure that there are going to be there are stories about how a union was interfering with progress in some way, shape or form, nothing is ever perfect.  If without unions, a worker stands alone and has no power against against a huge force that has absolutely no interest in giving them anything other than the bare minimum that they're legally required to give them.

And the Ford brought in the Pinkerton's to fight them, literally fight them off.  All right. Well, we sound like a bunch of commies here.  Let me let me move on.  There's one of those.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny how they've managed to demonize any idea like that.  So I am also going to question Apple's commitment to their self-repair program.  And this comes from personal experience.  We thought it'd be fun for Micah Sargent.  He has an iPhone 12 to fix his own battery.  So Micah went to the Apple site, ordered 79 pounds of repair equipment in these two Pelican cases.  Apple shipped them out promptly.  They're not going to they're going to charge us a small amount to rent them.  But what they neglected to ship was the battery.  Apparently, this 1.1 ounce battery was shipped under by separate cover from different places.  Didn't arrive at first.  We called Apple.  They said, well, no, there's nothing we can do.  Well, wait a minute, because you only have seven days to return these cases.  Seven days have come and we don't have the battery.  Sorry, you still have to return the 76 pounds worth of gear and you'll get your money back in your credit card.  I think fortunately, the battery did arrive at the last minute and Micah was able to get it.  But I really question Apple's commitment.  I mean, I think some of this is really about making you nuts.  This is the big battery press you have to get.  And there's a heating thing that you put the phone in to loosen the size of this.

Transcript:  Well, they probably they really should have figured out that they can't they can't ship lithium batteries by air.  It has to go by ground.  So it's not going to arrive at the same time.  That's right. I guess that's what happened.  And when you compare it to what what Samsung and Google do with their phones, with iFixit, it's like, no, yes, it would be great if you had this really important.  If you had this really impressive like heating element pad vice device.  But we actually think if you just chuck this thing in the microwave and let's warm it up and put it on top, it'll actually get the job done and you can actually own it.  I will say, though, that it's it's it's I'm not being joking when I say it's better than nothing, because for a lot of people, they just don't have access to an Apple Store.  It's like a three or four or five hour drive away.  Right. So it's it's a benefit.  It's definitely a benefit for those people.  I wonder if the momentum or the requirement to answer this question caught them flat footed.  And this was the best they could put together is just simply say, OK, we can rent out our actual repair tools to make sure this is done carefully and correctly.  And maybe next year they will find they will.  It'll take them a year to put together a program so that you can actually get stuff through iFixit that are just cheap, like eight dollar tools that could be mailed in a simple box.  But yeah, this does again.  This doesn't make Apple look good.

I think probably should have been wearing a hazmat.  I know. Michael's conclusion was, yeah, you can do it, but you probably shouldn't.  It's probably something. Here comes the battery.  The next day it finally came. Burke, run it down the hall.  Yeah. And I think you're right, Andy.  I didn't even think of this because it's lithium ion.  And so it has to be. Oh, but meanwhile, Mike is bringing the he has to ship those back because the deadline lapsed.  So I don't know. Did he get to do it or not, John? I don't know.

There's even some debate about whether we're going to hear about it a week from tomorrow,  because that's Apple's WWDC keynote, June 6th.  I just saw, I think it was Gurman saying, probably MacBook Airs in color based on the M2 chip,  but maybe not anything about VR AR.  But I think they have to at their developers conference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think this is going to follow the same path as the Apple Watch, as the iPad, as the iPhone,  where there's going to be a point at which they have to file a lot of really, really explicit paperwork  with the FCC and others to explain exactly, here's exactly what it looks like,  here's exactly what hardware is inside here or in terms of the radios.  And so there's going to be a launch event where they're going to show it,  but it's not going to be available for months after that.  And that's going to be because this is the, it's going to go public in January through government filings anyway.  So you may as well give people the full demo.  And then if you announce it in January and launch it in, make it actually available in June,  you get to see developers now that this thing is completely public,  you get to see selective developers with early hardware and early development tools  so that when you actually do start making pre-orders available,  there's actually live demos of actual functional practical things that Apple didn't have to do in-house.  So I'd be really, really surprised if Apple showed off anything that was explicitly pointing to the AR or VR headset at WWDC.  I would be more inclined to think that we're going to, there's going to be a lot of beard stroking.  You think people examine minutely what the invites to Apple events look like,  say, ooh, there's sort of a ripple in that section of the Apple logo.  I think it's because the new iPhone is actually going to be not just water resistant, but fully waterproof.  I think that people are going to look at, wait a minute, there's a new 3D object that they're adding to this established API.  And there is this new course track about how to gain telemetry from live cameras  that is not that they're using existing iPhones and iPads as examples for capturing this data and creating AR objects out of it.  But this could be very, very well applied to an upcoming AR headset.  So that they will be laying the groundwork without actually saying that they're laying the groundwork for this.  Again, I really do feel as though I don't see a reason why they would even announce anything this year if they're not going to launch anything this year.  And I don't think they're going to launch anything this year.  I do think it's going to be like, again, January-ish announcement, like mid to late winter announcement, late spring, early summer pre-orders and actual full bells and whistles demo.

None of these things were like, oh my God, we had no idea.  What a wonderful surprise.  It's like the year before the iPhone, everybody knew Apple was close to shipping an iPhone.  The year before the iPad, everybody was everybody knew Apple was close to shipping some sort of a tablet to the point where the week before or the month before that January event, everybody was speculating as to OK,  it can't be cheaper than nine hundred ninety nine dollars.  It will probably run a slimmed down version of Mac OS or will run an enhanced version of iOS.  So I really think that this is tracking very, very closely.  We're we're getting a lot of anxious people who are now basically saying that we're ready for you to release the thing, whatever the thing is.  We've got the three thousand dollars on an envelope under the mattress.  And please give it to us before we find something else to spend this three thousand.

Is there a lot of consumer demand for this type of content?  I've done stories here and there, and they haven't done super well.  So I don't know if that means anything.  But I am I am very like my personal thing is if anyone can sort of like figure this out, I guess it's Apple.  Three thousand dollars. I mean, to me, I mean, that seems expensive.  But what do I know?  But as far as like a mass market consumer device, that that feels kind of pricey.  But again, I'm I'm happy to be convinced.  Again, if any, if anyone can sort of figure this out, I guess it's Apple.  But yeah, we we we do a little bit here and there.  It's just not quite a huge consumer demand for this type of stuff yet.  And I guess we'll see.

Transcript:  they're, you know, like like soccer moms and people that are not at all techies love it.  Like they absolutely love it. Eat it up. Want to come over every time they come over.  They want to try it out. Try the new experience. Go to this museum.  Visit this Mayan temple like they enjoy all of the different experiences with it.  It is this arduous amount of like set up and computers putting up the wires like that.  That barrier to entry is just so big that I wonder if Apple can do it so that it's more quest like.  Like it's really just kind of plug and play. You can use it and not have to worry if that would make a difference.  So that and a little bit of the vertigo is still happening. I don't know.  You know, that's that's still a big deal. I still have some people that get quite ill,  even though we kind of understand lots of the mechanisms that are at play to create that feeling of like vertigo and nausea that you can get afterwards.  So I'm wondering if Apple could do it in a way that, you know,  just like the iPhone is so much easier was so much easier to use when it came out versus, you know, the desire of people's trios.

Start time: 6179.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me ask you this. Is the quest, which doesn't have all that set up, is it not as good as a result?  No. So you really use. Oh, no, no. So you really want to buy or a rift.  You really don't want you need to have cameras on the. Yeah.

Start time: 6199.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on what you're using it for. If you are using this to game and you want to play a very immersive game with a lot of frame rate, having the extra cameras, it's a huge it's a deal changer.  You get the two controllers, you get the different cameras, you can play a higher frame rate. You need that system.  It's still a very intensive system. If you're just going to be using the experience to, you know,  do a little fishing game or watching movies or, you know, tend to concert or do an experience where you're, you know, going to Louvre and going to museum or IKEA, then it's not that big of a deal.

Start time: 6235.88
End time: 6269.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think that it's also how you use it. So maybe the trick for Apple and any company that wants to succeed in this is getting the quality of a rift or a vibe onto something as easy to set up as a quest.  If you could do that, then you might really have a product and even better if you could keep it from making people throw up.  Even better. Right. Even better. Yeah. I'm convinced, by the way, that it's about, I think the Air Force said 11% of the population, but there's some intractable percentage of the population that will never be able to use these without becoming nauseated.

Transcript:  I will say when the PlayStation VR came out a few years ago, I tried that at a trade show in New York City. I could not sleep that night.  I was so nauseous from, you know, I was using it at 6 p.m. in the evening, messed around with a bunch of games. I did not sleep that evening.  That's not to pick on Sony or whatever, but I couldn't. I was so affected by that. You know, that hasn't happened since.  I had since played Resident Evil 7 in PlayStation VR and it was pretty much fine. I played Half-Life in VR. Fine. So I don't really know.

Transcript:  But for sure I had one very bad experience. There are still some games that will make me queasy. I was playing No Man's Sky the other day and it made me queasy, whereas I played Valheim for literally a thousand hours and never once got queasy.  So then that's not with a headset. That's just in front of a big screen. So there's head bob or something that's causing that.  But I think that there is a disconnect between the focal length of the object you're looking at and the convergence distance of the object because your eyes are converging on a nearby object, but the object seems to be at a greater distance.  And I believe that that's your brain saying you ate bad mushrooms. You better throw those up. And I don't know if you can fix that. That is true. I don't know if you can fix that.

Transcript:  You are accurate with that, but it's often where the horizon is and the feedback in your head versus the feedback that's happening on the horizon of what you're looking at.  And also for people that often like I usually do the point and click movement versus the real time movement because that decreases the chance of getting ill.  So games where you're spinning and you're getting different information like flying games or zooming have a much greater chance of getting queasy just thinking about it.  But you're absolutely right. It is us saying that you're not feeling well. Maybe you ate something because why would the ground be moving when you're not actually moving?

Transcript:  But the Air Force after much study of simulator sickness and things like that has concluded about 10 or 11 percent of everybody is to the point where some people shouldn't drive a car for 24 hours after being in a simulator.  In one study, Stanny and Kennedy found that about 10 percent of simulator users reported vision related symptoms like a headache.  Another seven and a half percent reported nausea. Five percent suffered from disorientation while using a virtual reality helmet.  Now, this is 20 years ago. 25 percent experienced nausea, 30 percent disorientation.  The industry says, oh, it's frame rate, it's resolution, we can fix this.  You know, they're going to have to figure out before they make this a mass market product.

Start time: 6457.14
End time: 6606.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's another question. Are they going to make it a mass market product?  There are a few companies that are actually having pretty good success with these kinds of wearables. Call them augmented reality, call them virtual reality.  Most of them have to do either these really, really cheap headsets that are good for entertainment that are mass market.  But most of them are for the military use, medical use, industrial use, verticals.  Basically situations in which the one that makes the most sense to me that keeps coming up in these explanations are all of the when people are repairing aircraft, all the checklists that they have to go through,  all the paperwork that they have to manage to make sure that when they check and fix a brake system on an airplane, they can certify that, yes, this was done in the proper order.  I'm going to photograph what needs to be photographed. I'm going to record what readings that were taken.  I'm going to basically affirm each step of this process. And also I'm going to have this checklist in front of me so I remember what has to be done in order to do this job safely.  And the ability to simply take all that all those binders and all that paperwork and all those even those slates out of the way and basically have a wearable that keeps that documentation safe.  And you're somewhere in your line of sight while you're doing it and being able to actually create these records while you go.  That saves a hell of a lot of money. And there are companies that are happily going to spend $3,000 for people who are going to be wearing these for maybe a half hour at a time or 20 minutes at a time.  They're not going to be wearing them full time. So that's not really an issue.  I mean, I keep trying to figure out what Apple could do to make this really palatable to somebody who has these Buck Rogers attitudes about what they expect a virtual reality or augmented reality goggles system to go.  And I keep I don't have that much imagination. I keep thinking of it as something like a Mac Pro where we're shocked at that when you look at the configurator.  Oh my God, there are people it's possible to configure this will cost $16,000.  But then you remember but that but then you remember that there are people that will say great.  I know what two clients I'm going to build this to and I'll be because I'm making so it's so important for this these jobs that I'm doing.  And I know that I will it will make its money back.  Those are the people I think that are most eager to be able to create content for $3,000 headset that especially if it's something that hey, yes, we finished the addition to this park that this museum.  Building put on these goggles and we'll walk you through it.  Again, I don't know. I don't know how they're going to fix the the nausea issue if they're going to say that we're going to create a new work top environment that you're going to want to spend three or four hours and that's going to be a hard sell.

He used to wear Google Glass like all the time because when I went on my daily, I really enjoyed because it was just this little screen that was on the side.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that Apple has been playing with the idea of having something like an Apple watch where it's not designed to be an immersive environment.  It's just designed to put the just the data than just the tools that you need at a place where it's more convenient than taking a phone out of your pocket.  And that those are also the only display technologies that I have come across, even experimentally that can convincingly be built inside a pair of glasses, but usually usually a pair of buddy Holly glasses.  But at least you won't be like tackle to the ground and frisked when you're walking through an area wearing these damn things.  So all things are on the table.  I there are times where I have to be understand that there is almost nothing that I know for sure about this thing.  And I have to be have my mind open to almost anything could be released almost at any time.  Again, I still don't think it until 2023, but I will not be surprised by anything that Apple comes up with because I think that a lot of things are on the table.

Transcript:  One thing Apple is doing right.  And I can tell because Microsoft is responding is it's Apple Silicon.  It's M1 chips.  Microsoft had its developer conference this week, build and announced they're going to make a developer box project Volterra.  They're calling it that has I know it's a comic book name.  OK, good for them.  It has an arm based version of Visual Studio 2022.  Their programming environment and a little arm based Windows PC running Windows for arm.  Now the video.

They did not say how much it would be.  They did not say what chip it would run.  They did not say anything.  But I think this is very much I mean look at it.  It's a Mac Mini built for Windows developers to use Windows on arm.  One of the things they did mention, which is kind of interesting, is it has a you know, it's a three kind of unit.  Oh, by the way, made from beautiful recycled ocean plastic.

Transcript:  One of the things they keep showing is stacked.  So it's stackable, although no developer I know wants two of these things.  But I do think that they're pushing it as an AI device.  And they're mentioning the fact that it has its own neural processor unit and that will connect with Azure, some sort of Azure support.  So some sort of kind of offloading to the cloud capability.  Microsoft's Panos Panay said we want you to build cloud native AI applications with native arm 64 Visual Studio dot net support.  Project Volterra is coming later this year.  New tools to help you take the first step on this journey.  Honestly, I really think they rushed this announcement because they're so nervous about M1 and now M2.  And Apple's really getting an awful lot of attention for that.  Intel also responding.  Their 12th generation processors now have efficiency cores kind of like the arm processors.  I feel like Apple did really kind of surprise the PC world and they're trying to respond as quickly as they can.

It's got a TPU in there.  Yeah.  I mean, after getting after 10 years of the iPhone, manufacturers are getting the idea that you can't just simply rely on Intel or Qualcomm to deliver the chip that you absolutely need at the time when you actually need it.  If you want to control your own destiny and make the products that will help you live, thrive and survive, you're going to have to basically own the whole widget.

Transcript:  All right. Let's take a little break.  Final thoughts, final stories coming up in just a little bit.  But our show today brought to you by something I want you all to know about.  I use religiously.  It's my privacy cards from privacy.com.  Privacy lets you create real credit cards that you can use online.  There are two different kinds.  There's burner cards that can only be used once.  So there's never any risk of being, you know, them being stolen and used anywhere else.  And there's merchant locked cards.  At the minute you use it with a merchant can only be used by that merchant, all of which makes your life much more secure, makes you feel better about using credit cards online.  They have plugins for Firefox and Chrome.  And when you use this credit card, as I do with every online purchase, you can put any address, any name you want.  Privacy will approve it because they know it's you.  So it masks your real bank information.  You never have to worry about giving it out to strangers online.  It's a great tool for subscriptions.  If you're about to sign up for something that's going to have a recurring payment, use your privacy.com card because you'll never be overcharged.  You could set a limit per charge per month, per week, per year.  But you can also pause a card so that they can't overcharge you.  I've had this happen before where I signed up for a gym membership.  I didn't realize that the trainer sessions were separate.  When I canceled the gym membership, they kept charging me for the trainer for months.  When I finally figured it out, the credit card company said, well, it's been more than three months.  Nothing we can do for you.  Never will have that problem again.  I use privacy everywhere.  Just press pause.  Privacy blocks the charges.  They'll notify if they try to charge over the allotted amount.  You'll see all that every time the card is declined.  So you'll know immediately if somebody's trying to steal it or use it inappropriately.  It's also great for card sharing.  So I often create cards for my mom, for instance.  She cooked for me her whole life.  She's 88 now.  She's kind of tired of cooking.  I said, Mom, let me buy you dinner.  She's out your way, Andy, in Rhode Island.  So I sent her a privacy card.  And I said, use this.  Just know that when you use it for a restaurant or a meal delivery, they're the only ones that can use it ever again.  So keep using it for that service.  And a nice C whenever she uses it.  It's kind of a nice feeling.  But I didn't have to text her a card number or any information.  I just used privacy.com card sharing.  Went to the website, created the card, gave them her email address.  They took care of the rest.  She doesn't have to have a privacy account.  It's a secure way to make sharing a credit card number very, very easy.  You'll get complete account summaries.  You can tag purchases now.  So it really gives you a lot of control over how you're viewing it, how you're sorting it.  I love privacy.com.  Check it out.  Protect your financial identity online using virtual cards.  I've literally created hundreds of them.  Privacy.com slash twit.  You'll get five dollars for a new account, five dollars to spend on your first purchase.  This is a nice way of saying welcome.  Privacy.com slash twit.  Sign up right now.  New customers get five dollars to spend on their first purchase automatically.  I just think this is such a great idea.  Companies used to do this.  I remember, I think a couple of my credit card companies used to do it, and they stopped.  They stopped.  Now I just do it with privacy all the time.  A really good way of protecting yourself online.  Privacy.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting twit.  We had a fun week this week on twit, and we've got a little mini movie.  To show you all the good stuff.

I wanted to give people an idea of what it's like to actually go through Apple's self-service repair program.  And only two of the three shipments that were supposed to be coming actually arrived.  As soon as you get the tools, your seven-day rental period begins.  But I can't do the repair.  I can't use the tools until I get the battery.

Somebody posted in a response to Elon the original cartoon with the Chinese artist's name clearly visible.  Exactly.  Look at Elon's post.  He erased it.  He erased it and then posted it.

He got a board seat when he was one of the very first people to support Twitter.  I think it was a half million dollar investment that turned into billions for Peter Thiel.  I'm not sure why he's leaving the board.  I don't know if it'll make a difference.  If I were on the board of any social media company, I would think this might be a great time to take the money and run.  Mark is being personally sued, Mark Zuckerberg, by the District of Columbia Attorney General over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  That was five years ago.  But he says Mark ought to know personally.  So he's being personally sued, saying Zuckerberg was directly responsible for creating the lax privacy rules that allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data about Facebook users back in 2015 and 2016.  Twitter has to pay $150 million over privacy violations.  Facebook did this first.  Twitter did it too.  You know how they ask for a phone number for authentication, you know, a backup, a recovery number?  Turns out Facebook and Twitter both used that then for advertising purposes.  The company was sued by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.  They've settled for a mere $150 million.

I won't do it because I don't want to talk to take us down.  But she says, basically, I have a song that I love that I want to release ASAP.  But my record label won't let me.  I've been in this industry for eight years, says Halsey.  I've sold over one hundred sixty five million records.  But my record company says I can't release this song unless they can fake a viral moment on TikTok.  Everything is marketing and they're doing this basically to every artist these days.  I just want to release music, man, and I deserve better, to be honest.  I'm tired.  Eight million views in 24 hours for that video.  So I guess the record company is going to release the song.

I mean, I think I think there are a lot of people there are a lot of artists that said you can either we can either give you the chance of being as big as the Foo Fighters.  But you'll have to deal with record labels and all that kind of management.  Or you could make an extremely good living off of your music for the rest of your life, limited to not being a kajillionaire.
