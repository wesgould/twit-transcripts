Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just the way my books look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick Norton of Tekzilla.com.  Hey, Patrick.  How's it going?  Did you recover from CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As much as I'm going to.  Came back from CES to a teething child, and it's been very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No sleep for the weary.  And speaking of no sleep, Tom Merritt, with whom I spent a long evening last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was fun.  Went to the Jonathan Colton concert. Good times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was a long, late show.  It was a lengthy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And never make Jonathan Colton humor on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was Jonathan Colton humor?  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick made the mistake of saying who is Jonathan Colton on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's this Jonathan Colton guys?  You here to play for David Prager's birthday?  I got some really hysterical emails as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what you really see at a Colton concert is that there is a cult.  Yeah.  Kind of a geek cult.  Most definitely.  They are humorless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're OCD.  No, they're very humorful as long as you're not making fun of their guy.  Yeah, they love Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's really, it's fun.  And they sing everything perfectly and they know every song, I would say perfectly by heart.  It's a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jonathan said to say hello.  It's like a show with pocket protectors and well-groomed hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, well, they are well-groomed.  There was a, I talked to a guy who works at Apple,  a woman who works at FARC.com.  It was, you know, it was the tech glitterati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You interviewed Jonathan this afternoon, didn't you?  Yeah, we had him on East Meets West.  Just earlier he said to say hello and Paul and Storm said they would like to be on Twitter someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I love Paul and Storm.  Were Paul and Storm there too?  Yeah, they tagged along.  It was great.  You can't go anywhere without them now.  Oh, good.  I'll call Paul and Storm.  I think they're hysterical.  Yeah, they're funny guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They met on the internet.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was sort of, they saw Hodgman on The Daily Show and followed the trail until they found Jonathan  and then showed up at, you know, or started emailing him or something.  I think he was doing a thing a week back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is there any news this week?  Yeah, there's a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought, you know, it's funny after CES and Comdex, it's going to be quiet.  And it turns out this is possibly the biggest tech news week of the year, even bigger than last week.  First of all, Steve Jobs lets the other shoe drop, sends a letter out saying,  yeah, it turns out I am pretty sick.  I'm going to take six months off and Tim Cook's going to run the company.  And really kind of a shock to everybody.  I don't want to speculate on his health because now we know it's serious enough he's taking the time off.  So we wish him well.  I mean, this guy is key to the technology industry.  He was a huge pioneer, still is very important and we wish him the best.  However, it sure is a kerfuffle in the tech community.  Gizmodo howls at Jim Goldman of CNBC.  Remember, Jim Goldman published a blog post saying, leave off Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My sources say he's fine.  And Gizmodo is full of it for saying he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turns out he wasn't so fine.  Fake Steve Jobs, Dan Lyons comes on CNBC and says, admit you were wrong, Goldman.  You were punked.  Your sources as Apple PR, they fooled you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Goldman says, no, I was right.  I was right.  I'm not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Brian Lamb at Gizmodo writes a post that looks like he's a Looney Tunes.  Did you see the Gizmodo post about all this?  It was just like he'd lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think he was just feeling very emotional about it.  It was a very emotional post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we stop for a second and review your imitation of Jim Goldman?  Now we all worked with Jim Goldman.  Jim is through.  I saw that bit between him and Lyons and it's floating around the web.  And Goldman was pretty calm and collected.  And his comment I think was pretty straightforward when he says, look,  what am I supposed to do?  I've got no information to the contrary.  I'm just reporting what I'm reporting.  This is all speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Goldman slammed everybody for speculating about Job's health,  saying my sources say he's fine.  Turns out he has no, his sources are Apple PR as far as I'm concerned.  He was punked.  You don't know.  So he believed something that was not so.  And he yelled at people for saying your sources are crap.  My sources are good.  You got it wrong.  And then any normal guy would come back and say, okay, well, you're right.  I was lied to by my sources.  Obviously he's not healthy.  But no, he continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see a lot of journalists would never ever own up to actually getting a story.  I mean, you never see retractions on national news.  They bury him in newspapers.  They're under the bottom of the editorial, the mail page in magazines.  And he was probably pissed off at having fake Steve Jobs corner him on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he was.  Initially, Dan Lyons says I've now been banned from CNBC.  Later, a CNBC spokesman said he wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another publicity stunt by Dan Lyons.  The guy's a master.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hasn't what Rosniak said lately sort of given Jim Goldman a little bit of an out when he's like,  look, I'm taking Steve on face value.  If he says that this has been the way it's been all along and it hasn't been any different,  then I'm going to believe him.  Obviously, there's a different relationship there.  But Goldman can say, like, that's all I was doing.  If they told me he's fine, I had to believe he was fine.  Well, maybe he shouldn't have castigated other journalists who have different sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm expecting that monkey in the closet, a family guy, to come out and point the finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's really it.  The more interesting story is what's going to happen to Apple over the next six months,  whether Jim Goldman and Gizmodo have a fight or not.  Well, I don't know if that's more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did a column in Market Watch that discusses what I think, which I think it's a  foregone conclusion that Apple's got about two years left.  Of course, everybody, oh, DeVorek, that's all you ever say.  Because they have stuff in the pipeline and they should be able to do just fine for a while.  But at some point, Steve Jobs, if you don't want to believe it or not, when he came into the company,  what was in 96, it was like the turnaround was obvious.  The company was floundering and he cut down the skews and came up with some good products  and pushed the company in the right direction and kept it on course and came up with new ideas and  all started a new platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is, do they need Steve at the helm to continue making intelligent decisions?  No doubt that Steve came in, took names and kicked ass and straightened a lot of messy stuff out,  especially competing skews across retail and commercial and educational.  The seven different models of the same computer with three different namesets and four different  numbering methodologies.  It's amazing what he came in and did in 98.  It's phenomenal what he'd done by 98.  But do they really need Steve to continue to make great products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's probably been smarter about it now that he's been through one collapse of his company  as far as making sure that he's breeding people that do things the way he thinks they need to be  done.  The big question that none of us can answer is with him not around to correct them, even if it's  slightly or subtly or just by his presence make them think a different way, are they going to be  able to carry out that same way of doing business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the big difference, John, between this time and last time.  Last time, Jobs was forced out by John Scully, who didn't know niddly-doo.  And so he was dumb enough to force Jobs out.  That just shows you how stupid he was.  And this time Jobs exactly has prepared this transition since he first got cancer.  I think he's got a team in place that he put there as opposed to the team in place that threw him  out.  That's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He put everybody there too beforehand.  But that's beside the point.  Let's take a vote.  How many people think two years from now Apple is going to be better than it is today,  a better company solid on firm footing, and how many think it's not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a middle where it's like the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I'll give you a choice of three.  I don't think it's going to go downhill.  Okay, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all, you're assuming that Steve's not coming back, right?  Yeah.  Okay, so maybe the first question is, is Steve coming back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Steve comes back is a different story, but we're assuming he's not coming back in this  argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I ask a related kind of question before we vote on this, John?  Are we all convinced that, I mean, above and beyond the ass kicking in the early days and  getting the company online, are we all convinced that Steve was responsible for green lighting  every decent product that they've come up with, you know, in the last decade?  Has he been personally responsible for making that happen?  That's a scuttlebutt, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he green lights personally responsible for making them happen.  Maybe, maybe not.  But I think from what I've heard, he sits in on everything and says yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically, the myth is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't know.  You don't.  Do you know?  No, I'm just asking.  So I'm guessing there's a 67% chance that the myth is true.  The people not 68.  No, the people calling it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people I know who work at Apple and who have worked at Apple all agree.  Steve Jobs is the final arbiter of everything from the brand of t-shirt in the company store  to the product that's coming out next year.  So I think it's true that you pull Steve Jobs out of the mix.  It's a different company.  The only question is, can anybody else be as good as Steve Jobs and can, as Steve  put in place a team that can match his performance?  And I think so.  I think so.  I think Apple will be as good or better.  You're changing it.  No, I'm not changing.  That's my vote.  You didn't vote.  Oh, you didn't vote.  I said, what are the choices?  My vote is as good, greater than or equal to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in two years, they'll probably be doing okay.  I think they'll be still on solid footing.  But I think that what Steve Jobs is good at is not just the leadership issue,  but sort of the inspired decision of when to stop something, when to go into a product line,  when to get rid of buttons, or whatever his little OCD behaviors are.  They tend to be inspired.  And that's going to fade.  I think it's going to fade over a longer period than two years.  And maybe I call it five, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, Daniel, what you don't know is, is another person going to come along with that vision or  not? So two years is a reasonable time frame because that's the Jobs halo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've got products in development set for two years out probably already, I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less somebody with that vision than somebody who can actually  execute on that vision and is in a position to make those calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five years from now, everything changes.  And who knows?  It's very hard to predict what's going to happen in five years.  Steve Jobs leaving the company is a bigger deal than Bill Gates leaving  Microsoft. I'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure about that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think Microsoft's taking a turn for the better without Bill Gates.  That's been a boon for Microsoft.  I'm not seeing it.  I think the Vista fiasco can be laid squarely on Gates' shoulder.  And now that he's gone, Windows 7 is a complete turnaround.  We'll see.  I think people are overhyping the Windows 7 turnaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what you're going to say, Patrick?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, I think Windows 7...  First of all, if Windows 7 hasn't shipped yet.  Second of all, I think Windows 7 is a complete reaction to what essentially...  Vista may not have failed as an operating system, but it has absolutely failed as a brand.  It has not gained...  Unless something's changed, maybe John, you can address this.  Unless something's changed in enterprise, it has not gained traction in enterprise,  which is where a huge amount of the licenses are.  So I think Microsoft just saying, screw it, let's go to the next one.  Let's clean up as much as we can.  And 7 addresses...  And let's get a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's why I'm bullish because 7 addresses all of those issues.  It is the next Windows 2000.  It's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Windows 2000 was the last...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is Gates to blame instead of Alchin for not saying, look,  we need another three years for the operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now, and I'm basing this on what Robert Scoble told me from his time at Microsoft.  It was his impression that...  It was Alchin, absolutely.  And Gates, who really created the Vista fiasco with WinFS  and all of the plans for what Vista was going to be.  Longhorn.  And they had to pull back, they had to tear down.  That's why it took five years.  They had to release Vista before it was done.  There's no question about that.  It's taken two years to get Vista to the point where it should have been released in the first place.  All of that stuff's being redesigned, rejiggered.  It's...  If you play with 7 now, I want to start a campaign to release 7 now.  Beta is very clean, very strong.  And to me, it's exactly what business is looking for.  A clean, reliable Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to admit, it is pretty zippy, but I still haven't put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you put it through its paces installing software and running heavy software yet, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  I mean, I've got it installed on two virtual machines and one laptop.  It's running very well.  I put the stuff that I use day to day on it and it runs very well.  I haven't had any problems with it.  I haven't put Office on it yet.  I haven't used it.  I'm not using it as a production machine yet, because mostly on Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of the next thing I want to do.  I, like you, have been very impressed with it so far.  Just how zippy it is.  They've basically taken Vista and polished it up and cleaned it up and made it work a little better.  But I still want to see if it can handle the heavier use that I would put up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it runs nicely on a netbook.  I'm going to put it on a netbook and see.  But it seems to run very nicely on a netbook, which is a very low-end platform.  One gigabyte of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, did Microsoft just...  Did the reach exceed their grasp with Vista that you just try to change too much at too fundamental level all at once?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it flopped.  Then they had to go backwards and start over again.  And they shipped late because of the pressure to ship.  They shipped unfinished.  Vista, yeah, I think Vista was just from start to finish.  Microsoft screwed up.  They also screwed up on the messaging.  In every way, they screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They set expectations so high with Vista and then just kept pulling features out right and left.  And it was almost set up to be a disappointment right from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best you could say is Vista is okay now.  But that's two years down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's so funny because so much of what they got hammered on in Vista is stuff that would have been enormously difficult for the end user to notice in real life, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  I know a lot of end users, a lot of end users who hate Vista, who hate...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  I don't mean Vista didn't have problems.  I mean, like, you know, the WinFS, some of the other...  Oh, yeah, nobody would have known.  You're right.  ...nuances.  I don't know if anybody ever would have really appreciated those without being told that they were there or told that they were not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, that's my point is that I think in some ways, Bill Gates wasn't...  Look, he didn't get the internet.  He seems to have screwed up with Vista.  I think Microsoft will have...  I would predict have a better direction without him.  And so that's my point is that jobs leaving Apple is a much bigger deal than Gates leaving Microsoft.  But I think Apple can still survive it.  I don't think that...  For one thing, we're in an evolutionary stage.  Apple may not be a revolutionary company ever again.  You could give jobs credit for three major revolutions.  Without him, you don't have a personal computer revolution.  I mean, it's one thing to invent it.  He's the guy who marketed it and made a business out of it.  Without him, the music industry wouldn't have changed so dramatically because of the iPod and iTunes.  I mean, that's incredible.  And I think you're seeing a complete transformation in portable computing with the iPhone now.  And I think all three of those credit to the guy who makes the business out of it, makes the market out of it.  They weren't the first portable...  They weren't the first smartphone.  They weren't the first MP3 player.  They weren't the first personal computer.  But they were the ones who made it happen.  And I think that's Steve Jobs right there.  That's what we'll miss.  Did you just go through all that?  Was that mentioning the iPod?  I did mention the iPod.  That's the second one.  That's the revolution in the music industry.  So no, I think...  He didn't mention the cube.  I did not mention the cube.  Was the cube Jobs or Skull?  That was Jobs, wasn't it?  Because he wanted to make a next cube.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cube was wonderful.  It just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It cracked.  That was really what was wrong.  They couldn't make it without cracks in it.  Anyway, so okay, there you go.  John, what's your vote?  You say Apple will be worse in two years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'd say that's the beginning of the end.  The beginning of the end for Apple.  Oh, and here we go.  Here come the emails.  Never mind.  Sell your Apple stock.  You don't have to sell.  Now, it could still go up.  I mean, it might be a bargain basement time, is it?  Because everyone...  Especially something bad happens to Steve.  The stock will probably take a nice fall and bounce right back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It only went down like 7%.  I thought it was going to go down a lot more with that limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there still look...  It's pretty far down considering...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it was already in the price.  People kind of expected this is what was going on.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Apple dropped more in the last six months with the rest of the economy than it did.  If you look at what happened between June and December versus what happened in the last week,  the last week is imperceptible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if Steve Jobs does come back, John?  All bets are off.  What if he comes back?  Yeah.  I mean, do you think Apple becomes stronger from him having time away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think it'll just be the same...  Just the continuation.  I don't think he's going to...  He's not like a football player that's been sidelining and he gets a second wind.  I mean, I can't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the real question.  Has Jobs really put into place a transition team or...  I mean, this sometimes happens with a guy who's so invested in so much the leader of a company.  When he leaves, nobody in the company has any initiative and it can't succeed because it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a symptom of a command and control sort of personality, which is what he is reputed to have.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But he's also a smart guy and I think that they saw the writing on the wall.  It's been what?  Four years since the cancer first happened.  I think at that point, they brought in Tim Cook, they kind of groom him, they groom Schiller.  Anyway, it's sad.  I hope Steve gets better and he doesn't look good and it's very scary and very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where's Spindler?  Maybe we should dig him up and...  Spindler.  Whatever happened to him?  I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Herr Spindler.  He's probably working for Schiemens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's still under the desk.  Doesn't he have a lift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Schindler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spindler's List.  Now that would be a funny movie.  Tom, do you think Apple will be better or worse in the two years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think about the same.  I think they might be worse in five, but I think in two, they'll be drifting,  they'll be with inertia doing about the same.  And I guess you can interpret that as worse in Wall Street terms because Wall Street will  be wanting them to grow by leaps and bounds and then might be treading water a little bit.  How about you, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm always...  I'm still amazed.  I lived on Apple between 90 and 95.  By 98, I was accepting that they were going away.  At this point, it's been so extraordinary to watch the last 10 years.  How does any company maintain that level of excellence for so long?  And in some ways, there's been a bunch of stuff that Apple does that I haven't been  real pleased with and I haven't really seen as a sign of excellence.  So, you know, the question is, can any company keep delivering CE products that kind of  redefine a genre or, you know, take over?  By the way, if you hear some munching, Seamus just woke up and started chewing on an apple.  What does Seamus think for two years down there?  Seamus, where do you think they're going to be in two years?  You don't know?  That was a no.  Yeah, that was a no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was like, come see, come saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the other thing to consider is that as long as he's on a leave of absence,  let's say it lasts past six months, but gets extended.  If he doesn't actually step down, a lot is going to stay in stasis.  He's going to have to actually leave the company before someone really takes the reins and  there's a chance for a new visionary to step in, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you know, Patrick, you might have swayed me.  It's not the Steve Jobs issue.  It's the how many times can you how many times in a row can you hit it out of the park?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you also remember like Steve Jobs.  I mean, remember when Steve Jobs got involved with some weird little company that was doing,  you know, rendering software, which became Pixar, which became, you know, I mean, like Steve just  Steve's had some extraordinary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think that Steve and Pixar, if you read the books and the stories of this,  Steve didn't have much to do with Pixar success.  Steve bought the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't think much of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't have anything to do with it.  It took off with Toy Story.  Then he says, yeah, I did that and took the money and ran.  But I don't think anybody thinks that Steve Jobs had much to do with Pixar success.  That was more luck than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It may have been luck, but when you look at the number of people who have bought production  studios of one kind of another in Hollywood, you know what I mean?  True, true.  He may not have discovered the silver mine, but he sure as heck bought into it at the right time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be luck.  It could just been brilliant insight.  But yeah, you guys a meditator.  A meditator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I went to India, some mystic thing going on with that guy in some way.  And I think that's how they pick something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's why he could be better when he comes back.  He's meditating right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's meditating.  He's meditating on how can I get these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How can I get these guys off the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get this.  Well, by the way, as long as we're talking Apple, 15,000 applications in the iPhone app store,  500 million downloads.  There is just no question that, yes, another home run out of the park for Apple, this iPhone  and the six month old app store, a huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You notice they're not publishing A, how many of those applications have been downloaded  more than five times and B, how many of the installed apps have been or have been uninstalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  But you know what?  That's fine.  I buy apps and uninstall them all the time.  I mean, the fact that there's that variety there.  I mean, it's, I'll tell you at the Colton concert, when Colton Rick rolled everybody,  about 800 iPhones come out.  That was pretty interesting.  Nothing but iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No doubt.  It's been insanely successful.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the app store, you know, as excited as I am about the Palm pre and as excited as I was  about Android and the G1, that app store and the music store and the tie in and the elegance of  interface and integration is really key.  It's impressive.  It's impressive as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the thing.  You got to know where it comes from.  And that will determine whether Apple continues to do well, better or worse, I think.  That has always been their key.  They don't get into new businesses.  They come up with elegant ways of executing on businesses.  Right.  Exactly.  My point exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And onward.  Get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The security researchers at F-Secure, a very well-known, very respected good company out of  Finland, today said that nearly nine million computers have been infected by the downed up  worm in the last two weeks.  Six and a half million of them in the last four days.  The downed duck?  Downed up worm, by the way, also known as this is a problem with viruses, also known as,  oh, I can't find this, the aka, oh yeah, ConFicker.  Oh, right.  Good old ConFicker.  Oh, ConFicker.  Why didn't you say that in the first place?  ConFicker, I hardly knew her.  But listen, nine million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't believe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I'm talking about your gag.  I wasn't saying listen to my gag.  I was saying listen to the statistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do believe it.  It's very possible.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the worst, they say, that they've seen since the days of Melissa and Sasser.  In the wild old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the back end Trojan horse spam bot thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes.  And the reason we haven't seen such infections like this in the past is because the firewall  is now on by default in Windows and most people have antiviruses and there's been some education.  But here's the deal.  This one takes advantage of a hole in Microsoft Windows 2000 XP Vista Server 2003 and Server 2008.  It was fixed with an out of cycle update in late October.  But about a third of all PCs don't bother updating.  So they're completely vulnerable.  You know, it doesn't matter what you do.  You have your firewall turned on.  You have your antivirus.  Doesn't matter.  You're going to get infected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be right back, guys.  I just had a major diaper emergency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that you or Seamus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a firewall problem.  Yeah.  What that was.  You were Seamus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you know why I have Patrick on the show.  He's the only Twitter change's diapers during this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how does this get to 9 million so fast?  Because earlier this week we had the note out that the storm worm was broken  and that there was a quiet period and then this blasted right after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a real worm though.  Doesn't it just go around poking at the ports and just going in and infecting machines,  whether people like it or not?  The reason?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's the same old thing is what you're saying.  It's the same old problem.  No, it's not the same old thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The typical thing, especially the back end stuff that becomes spam bots,  you have to actually execute something to make them infect your machine.  You got to do something stupid.  You got to close the box.  You got to say you want to install Flash.  This is just basically a real worm which just kind of just goes right into your machine,  whether you like it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It takes no action on the user's part.  It only takes the inaction of not installing updates.  But this is the problem.  This is a major flaw in Windows.  Now, Microsoft in January in the last update, which was on the 13th, it was this week,  put out the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool, MSRT,  which the new update does remove downed up configure.  So we'll get some stats from Microsoft probably in the next month.  They usually tell us how many they found.  But the problem is it's going to go on machines that are updating.  And we'll never know how many machines are out there that haven't updated.  And that's the real problem with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the real problem is pep gag.  The real problem is people just going and operating stuff in a way that is unsafe.  And one of those manners in which they operate things unsafely is not  updating and patching their computers.  But in a certain sense, at a certain level of user, we've marketed computers.  We haven't, but computers have been marketed in a way that says,  hey, yeah, you just take this thing home and plug it in.  And then you got the whole worldwide web at your fingertips.  And you're going to be doing word processing and publishing videos of your family.  And it's marketed as an appliance.  And you don't have the same level of training necessary in a blender  or a microwave oven that you do with a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're giving normal people this tool and then saying you have to be a security expert to use it.  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  We should ban them.  Ban them.  Ban them all.  I think we should license them.  That's what you should do.  You have to get a license.  To use a computer.  Just like driver's license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what the solution is, but it's kind of an issue when you have 9 million computers  out there in a giant botnet.  We all suffer from that.  I don't know.  What do you force people to do?  Updates?  How do you solve this?  Microsoft's never been willing to do that.  They have broached the idea, though.  In fact, there was some thought that they might do that in Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you have to really limit the functionality of a machine to make it more idiot proof.  You're never going to make it entirely idiot proof.  Nobody wants to take that risk because then some other company is going to say,  hey, our machine does more.  We aren't trying to tell you what to do.  We trust you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wiser is saying in our chat room, you just need shock therapy.  Just zap them a little bit.  Didn't update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of what happens anyway.  Yeah, actually, they do get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's the real problem is that these people, I guarantee you, of the 6 million,  very few, probably only a few percentage points actually know they're infected.  That's the whole problem.  You don't know.  You can't tell.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then there's those devious little malwares out there that pretend to be security software  and pop up and say, we need to check for a virus.  Click OK.  I don't know.  I've had a few friends fall for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get this.  Get this one.  So I had a call on the radio show.  Guy's a photographer, Joseph Orsillo.  He says, my site is hosted on iPower, which is a pretty big shared serving host.  He says, when you go to my site, orsillophotography.com,  fine, normally you see the site there.  If you go through a Google or Yahoo search, you will get, instead of my site,  you'll get a warning that says your system is infected with spyware.  It'll take you to a website where it does a faux scan, because I did it on the Mac,  and it still found all these Windows viruses, and says you need to download Antivirus 2009.  No matter what you click, it starts to download Antivirus 2009.  And EXE, which is, of course, actually spyware or a virus.  It's very well known.  A lot of people would be fooled like that, but this is even worse.  This poor guy, you go to his site, and it turns out his site,  or probably iPower, a flaw in iPower's setup, but again, security flaw,  allowed somebody to get onto the site, change an access file, the HT access file,  and anytime a referrer is Google or Yahoo, boom, you don't go to his site, you go to their site.  I mean, this is nasty.  And that's somebody who kind of knows what they're doing.  I mean.  Oh yeah.  And apparently, I looked, I went out on a search, this has been going on,  I found, this happened to iPower in July.  So this stuff's been going on for months.  I don't know if it's just iPower.  I suspect what happens is, you know, these guys are searching for vulnerabilities on web servers.  As soon as they find one, it could either be that the photographer had a silly password,  or that there's something, more likely in my mind, there's something wrong with the server.  There's a flaw, an exploit, known exploit in the server software.  And these guys just probably infect thousands of sites at a time.  Sure.  And you're absolutely right, Tom.  I mean, it's tempting.  You look at it, it seems very believable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they had that one about the flash upgrade, and that's really believable.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if they make it look like some sort of plugin for a browser, it gets hard to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you put the Adobe logo on it, for example.  I mean, you don't have to, you know, you don't have to abide by copyrights.  You know, you might as well put the Microsoft logo up on one of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost like a sixth sense to know when a pop-up, you're like, wait a minute,  I didn't do anything that should have triggered that.  And you have to have a lot of experience with a computer to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is, again, this is the problem, is that a lot of people have computers  who don't have, you know, why should you have to be a security expert?  But you do.  And they're just, you know, you're right, you don't need it with a toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What else at your local Walmart requires any kind of level of expertise close to that?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, these are, I mean, the same people buying these who can't program VCRs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess automobile parts probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, I'm looking in the chat room as of today, and this guy called me yesterday,  I said immediately call your web hosting company and tell them this.  As of today, it's still doing it.  And I can imagine if this is the tip of the iceberg, there's probably thousands.  Moving along, Circuit City closes its stores.  A sad story.  30,000 people laid off.  567 stores closed.  The fate of outstanding warranties, the Fire Dog Repair Service,  and the Canadian stores still unknown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about those extended warranties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good question.  Don't they usually buy a third party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the whole thing's a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're gone now.  It was in talks for sales with two, quote, highly interested parties.  Talks broke down.  And that's what it sounds like in Circuit City tonight.  Actually, it's probably going crazy because aren't they having liquidation sales right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I got reported on my blog somebody had posted.  In fact, CNET, one of your CNET writers.  Yeah, Brooke.  Yeah, he got, or is Brooke a guy or girl?  Guy.  He went apparently to one of these places and all, you know,  it was one step away from a riot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was following Alex from Miami Beach on Twitter, Alex Sheck  from the FairWear blog down in South America.  And he was in Florida talking about how there's huge, huge lines to get into Circuit City.  And then sometimes the discounts were only 10%.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to our chatters, once again, the Circuit City has announced that the third party  company that is ensuring the warranties, extended warranties,  is going to continue to honor those warranties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, where are you going to take them though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, oh, that's a good question.  I guess you'd call the third party.  Yeah, what are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's a place in Chicago still doing repairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The few times I bought an extended warranty, you get something in the mail that says,  you know, call us.  Don't call them, call us.  I don't buy those.  Don't buy them.  There's an-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's got the cricket?  There's a cricket in here.  Put a cricket in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instant crickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this- Now here's the question.  Yeah, instantcrickets.com.  Very good, Tom.  You're good.  Like that, man.  Here's the question.  Is this going to happen all down the line?  Is it next Best Buy next?  Or do Best Buy and Walmart survive?  Is this a shake- In other words-  A Best Buy put these guys out of business.  Well, that's the question.  Is this a shakeout because a better guy came along or is it a shakeout because the internet  is taking all the business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's, I think it's a combination of two things.  In other words, we don't have enough room in the retail space anymore for more than  one or two companies to stay alive.  The fact of the matter is I still like to go buy stuff here and there.  Now, that said, I just got my little cards to get my down converter for analog TV for digital.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  You have an analog TV and rabbit ears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have rabbit ears.  Free TV.  But I have a couple of old TVs around and I figured I might as well pick up a couple  of these converters just in case.  And I also have some straight up and up monitors.  Did you get the coupon?  That don't have tuners at all and I can't obviously use my VCR for a tuner so I can  use one of these if I want to look at something inside the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a tuner, those converters?  They're actually a tuner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a full blown tuner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it would just convert it somehow and then your TV tuner would take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, you just leave it-  Channel guides and everything in it.  Yeah, you leave your channel on analog three or whatever just like you do with a VCR and  then it's, yeah, it's got, some of them are really nifty.  Some of them, they started selling one with a DVR in it too I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're pretty cool.  But anyway, so the point, besides the point that I have an analog TV,  the, what I was saying, by the way, these cards are really weird because they're expensive  plastic credit cards embossed with holograms on them and all you need is the number.  You don't want that number to get faked.  What is it?  It's, and you know, most of the people are going to buy online because your best  tuners are online and so you just type in the number.  So what is the point of this dollar and a half card or whatever they cost to punch these things  out? It's got a beautiful hologram. It's a beautiful card actually.  Your tax dollars at work. Save it. It'll be a-  Believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope Patrick comes back before we finish this because he was on Twitter pointing out that  there are a lot of electronics departments left. You look at Sears, JC Penney, Walmart, Target.  There's a lot of folks out there selling electronics. It's the specialty stores  that are the ones that seem to be going away, the ones that specialize in just electronics.  That may be part of the reason Best Buy is weathering this a little better  is they also still do the refrigerators and the washer garters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, circuit city did a bunch of weird too, but anyway, the point is that I did some research on  which of these tuners to get and the one I decided on finally was the Channel Master.  Nobody carries it. You have to buy it online because Best Buy has- There's about 25 of these  tuners out there that you can get from different companies. Best Buy has a model that they had.  I think it was the GE or something, which wasn't even considered one of the better ones.  Circuit City, they weren't listed, but they may have one. Target has one.  Walmart has one. Everybody has one, but there's no selection. I think this is the real problem  that we're running into, which is the lack of selection. If you go to Best Buy to buy a DVD  player, the selection there is pretty minor. It's just a few different units. It's almost like  Costco has got more selection in a lot of these places. I think there may be something to the  idea that the online vendors are really having an impact, mainly because these other guys do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a crappy job. I would say my feeling is that the reason you see technology companies as the first  to go out of business here and record stores is because the people who buy that stuff are the most  able and most likely to buy online. It's just the canary in the mine. These are going to go down  first, but as more and more people go to Amazon to buy more and more stuff, it's going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to everybody, all these retailers. Here's the question that comes to mind. I'm going to try to  make it clearer this time. I'm running at Best Buy and I have a selection of 25 of these tuners  that I can sell. Why do I sell a second or third rate tuner when I can sell one of the two or three  best tuners? Well, there's an interesting psychology. That's what I'm not getting with these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  retailers. In fact, I'll tell you why. Psychology. Have you read Predictably Irrational? Fascinating  book. Highly recommended. And that's our segue. I know it could be audible.com, but it will be in a  second. But the point, in fact it was, it was a great audible book. But the point is, it's very  interesting. Predictably, what's the title again? Predictably Irrational. He talks about a Wall Street  Journal offer that he saw where you could buy the paper alone, the internet alone, or buy both.  And the pricing was such that the internet alone was a bad deal. It was like, why would you do that?  Oh, for 25 bucks more, you can get both. His point was that middle price is not there. They don't  expect to sell it. It's there to condition you to, oh, 25 bucks more. What a better deal so that  you'll buy up. You need, I think you need to have choices. Customers don't want to walk in a store  and see just one item. They want some items they're not going to buy. They may never tend to sell these  crappier items, but it sets you up for, oh, well, 10 bucks more. Look how much more you get. It makes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a sales technique. I think they don't want to carry more than a couple models because they  they don't want to have to train their staff into explaining them all. And they don't want to  overwhelm the folks who don't do the research online, who come in and say, I just need a converter  box. And they walk up, they see two, maybe three. They can easily come up with some way in their own  head of deciding between those three. But if you put 20 of them up there, they're going to  forget about it and leave. In fact, that's why you have two or three as opposed to one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is because if you just have one, people are resistant. You have two. Well, the fact is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  most of these guys only have one when it comes to this converter box. That's not the point I'm  trying to make here. The point I'm trying to make is that if you're the store, why do the one or  why does the one or the three not, we'll skip it. Yeah, you're right. 20 is no good, but let's take  the one or the three. Why do they have to be mediocre? Well, they should have one very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one that they want you to buy. That's about $20 over a clearly inferior one. Do you think there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  some foul play going on where somebody's giving them an extra deal? Like, you know, you will  increase the profit margin if you carry our crappy one. Yeah, but don't carry our competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All these stores and that's why these guys are getting killed. This is, by the way, reminds me  of what we have. We run into it, you know, the deli that we have up in Washington. You know,  my wife has made it has taken just a drawn a line in the sand. We're not carrying any sodas  that have high fructose corn syrup in a period. You want to get a Coca-Cola, you get the Mexican  Coke. That's what we have. And all the other sodas that we have are essentially made with sugar.  And so, or, you know, and are you plugging your deli soda selection?  You know, I've just been using this as an example because here's what the follow up is.  These distributors come barreling in with, oh, why are you doing that? We'll give you a better deal  and you can make a lot more money doing this and a lot more money doing that. And you can bring in  this crap and you will, if you sell the crap, you'll be, you'll double your profits and all  this other stuff. And she just refuses to do it. But I can see that these distributors, these  middlemen, these sales guys that are running, they're taking and ruining retail in this country  by pushing garbage when the, when quality is out there. And so, so people go online and buy  the quality. I'm telling you the one, I want to get the channel master. I have to order it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a really good article actually similar to that, but they talked about a lawnmower company  who decided not to go into Walmart because Walmart would have pressured their price so low.  They would have had to change the way they manufacture the lawnmowers. So they, they were  one of the few people to back out and say, no, you know what? We don't want to be sold in Walmart.  We'll continue to go through small operators because we want to continue to make quality  lawnmowers. And, and yeah, I mean, it all ties back into you've, you've got to be able to provide  a selection that's good to people, but you've got to be able to make, you got to be able to  make a living. And so that, I think that's why you see the crappy selection that you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you go, and I think you're right, John, you don't, you don't get away with this anymore  because of the, the option to go online. So if you're going to succeed, if you're going to succeed  in brick and mortar, you've got to be superior. You've got to offer better service. You know,  Circuit City cut back on their intelligent, you know, as they're in financial trouble,  they hire cheap, you know, minimum wage workers. You see these cutbacks, you see Walmart putting  pressure on that just, it's the death spiral. The only way you succeed is brick and mortar.  I look at my bookstore, my local bookstore. I keep telling them it's you got to, you're not  going to succeed because you have a better price. You're not going to succeed because you have a  better selection. It's all about service. That's how you're going to succeed. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's instant gratification for me with electronics. The only reason I ever buy  at a store instead of buying online is because I just decide, you know what? Yeah, I'll pay a  little more, but I want it right now. I want to be able to take it home, plug it in tonight  and start using it right away. And so you got to cater to that mindset, that convenience.  And selection is part of that. Service is part of that. You've got to say like, we're the specialty  store where it's okay to come in and walk around and look at the stuff you're going to buy online.  And then once we get you in the doors, we're going to try to convince you that, hey, you know what,  there's an advantage to taking it home right now. That's I like that. Yeah. Instant gratification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, while we're on the subject of this kind of thing and stores closing and opening and  some having good selections and some not, let's take a look at another store, which is an interesting  model, Guitar Center. If you go into a Guitar Center, it has the most amazing selection of products  that is, I mean, if you want to get like, you know, a mic, I mean, you're going to be looking  at 50 mics, you know, for some podcasting or if you want to get some, you want to buy a saxophone  or a guitar, some strings or some picks or whatever, it's, they don't, and all the people  working there are all nuts. They're all like musicians who love to talk about this stuff.  So they have like, they're naturally good salesmen. Now that may be a sector though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you cannot duplicate online or don't you have to? Well, no, is it musician's friend,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the online version of Guitar Center? Oh, because I think it is. Would you buy a guitar online?  I haven't bought a guitar online, but I bought a ton of mics and mixers. Mics I buy online. I go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  broadcast supply west. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's interesting. I mean, that would support your  argument because it's, they got it. I'm willing to pay $129 for an $80 mic because I can have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right now. You know, I don't notice that their prices are over or so much higher. I mean,  I don't think you'd be paying $129 for an $89 mic. I think you'd be paying $89.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In California, you also could be paying a significant sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Well, and maybe I'm missing something and maybe I'm naive here, but isn't there a way to  have your storefront operate as the warehouse for your online sales? Best Buy does that. You order

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  online at Best Buy and you could pick it up at a Best Buy this afternoon. Circuit City did that too.  Circuit City did it before Best Buy. Oh, interesting. Didn't work for them. Didn't save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting. I think Circuit City had some other issues. You know, this business of,  the Circuit City, before I guess the Good Guys was another one. And remember, if you want to go  back far enough, in the Bay Area in particular, they had Pacific Stereo and then Matthews,  Top of the Hill Daily City. Oh yeah. And these guys were always set up. I mean,  Matthews was the worst case scenario. This was a hard sell operation that had car salesmen,  essentially, in there. What do we have to do to get you to take home these speakers right now?  What do we have to do for you? And well, let me go talk to my manager and we'll get you a price,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a better price than this. Do you remember Tom Campbell, Matthews, Top of the Hill Daily City,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we're blowing it out to the bare walls. Right. And so, and then the other one was, you know-  No, I remember Tipton Appliances in St. Louis. These are the same kinds of things. Anyway,  Pacific Stereo, which was another chain that went out of business completely,  used to do, pull some weird stunts, not in terms of hard sell, but in terms of like selling,  crappy or branded products. And then along came the good guys in Circuit City. And these guys are  supposed to clean up everybody's act. But my experience in Circuit City, the good guys,  I went in and out a couple of times and it was always, I didn't like either one of these stores.  And I particularly didn't like Circuit City. I always thought it was dingy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And supposedly giving you full service, but not really. I always preferred to go  to a place that didn't have the sales people where you could just walk up,  grab something off the shelf and go up front and buy it. Well, that's the whole convenience factor  I'm talking about. When you have to wait on a salesperson and, well, let's check and see if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this model's in stock. That's ridiculous. Listen to this. It's going to happen any minute now.  What is it? Only at Matthews can you get a fully assembled 18 speed mountain bike or touring bike  included with hundreds of audio video items. Get a Sony stereo receiver, just get a bike. Remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that? Get a Fisher big screen color TV. Like I want a bike because I'm buying a TV, especially a Fisher  big screen 40 inch color TV, $1,500. All right. Dems was the days. Dems was the days. Coming up  in just a bit. It's the end of the world as we know it, Google with layoffs and killing products.  And a British porn sensor filters 13 years of net history, right disappears right off the face of  the earth.

For instance, why does the that was that this is the one where that incredible 50 times better,  50 times better. That's right. Incredible Wall Street Journal example. Really, man, this is an  eye opener. And if you read Freakonomics, this is in the same kind of spirit of inquiry of using  really rational analysis, econometrics, and so forth to really figure out why our behavior is  the way it is. By the way, since you get two books, I'm gonna recommend both predictably irrational,  the hidden forces that shape our decisions by Dan Ariely. And if you've not read Freakonomics,  have you guys read Freakonomics? I have not. Oh, come on. You'd love this. Yeah.  You know, there's they have a column in the New York Times soon to be defunct New York Times.  And but it's but the whole idea is they use econometrics to really understand human behavior.  That's Stephen Levitt and Stephen Dubner. Two great books. If you want to understand why we act the  way we do economic man behaves the way he and she does, he or she does Freakonomics by Stephen  Levitt unabridged. That's credit number one.

I love them. Yeah, we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  had a few people say they're going to do an audio version of the David Eddings book that we're reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now. Oh, good. You know, that's one thing audible is doing. I'm really proud of them. You know,  a lot of sci fi books are not recorded because you know, the publishers aren't big bucks publishers,  a lot of the books, you know, don't have huge audiences. It's not like the big random houses  of the world. So audible has taken on themselves to record many of the great classics of science  fiction, many 1000s of titles now in there. They've built nine studios in their headquarters  and they're recording like crazy. They said there are a lot of audible exclusives in sci fi  and a lot of other areas 51,000 titles, you know, you're sure to find something you're interested  in. I download two books a month and I still want more audible.com slash twit to we thank  them so much for their support of this week in tech. So this is why I love filters so much.  In Great Britain, I guess they're, you know, like Australia, I don't understand this,  this idea in the first place. They're, they created a porn, a child porn blacklist,  and they're encouraging internet service providers to use it. Many are among other things, this child  porn blacklist blocks, the internet archives way back machine. I don't know where their child porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is on there. And well, it's the way back machine. It did die had archives everything. Maybe there  is. It's probably got that scorpions cover. They were so worried about earlier somewhere in there.  Yeah, you're probably right. Blind. I don't know. I don't think they archive everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because there's all these kinds of stuff missing from you know, they do. This is I found out about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this. You know, it's Brewster Cale's project, the internet archive, they do, they try to,  they do terabytes a day, but they don't put it all online for various reasons. So, so while they are  attempting to archive everything and they have sites in Alexandria, Egypt at the library there  is one of their sites. They're archiving this stuff all the time, but only some of it makes it  to the way back machine. Yeah, because they don't have all my old pages. I had stuff that used to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be available in the way back machine that is no longer. Oh, interesting. Because it was a  subdirectory of an ISP, you know, one of those kind of homepages. And for a while it would show  up. And then they, I think they said, you know, that level down, forget it. They have crl.com  slash tilde report. Wow. They don't have concentric.net slash tilde ace detect anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that? Everything was slash tilde. You were ace detect even back then. Oh yeah. That's how  it started. Oh, that's on concentric network. Yeah. And they are A C E D T E C T. Oh, I get it. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  only gave you eight letters. Yeah. Listen to the end of East meets West. If you want to find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the story behind that name. And on last one, I was on buzz out loud this weekend, you gave out  a website. What was the name of that website? It says it's sub brilliant. So brilliant.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that your old website that you designed. Oh yeah. So brilliant.com slash bad dot html.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the Tom merits old website. Really lovely. No, that's fine. That's my blog,  twirling pumpkins, the rota, the cats in the igloo, the rotating, tell a friend about this  site. But my favorite, of course, and it's a classic, the mailbox with a letter going in,  mail me and tell me how much you like my site. That's the kind of stuff you find on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way back machines. That one probably is on the way back machine, but it's also just on the regular

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  internet. Yeah. He did that for, we should say we did that for call for help for the web workshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think the date of the episode is still listed on that page somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have 16,000 visitors since June 29th, 2000. I'm so it's up 2000 since Wednesday. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think. See, that's the power of buzz out loud. Oh, it's gonna skyrocket now. A couple of weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ago when Jason Calacanis was on the show, he says, you know, we've hit bottom on the great  depression of 2009. When Google starts firing people. Well, Google is firing people. These  aren't contractors. These are actual wage slaves at Google, only 100, mostly in HR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's not, that's a benefit. I was going to say this like Shakespeare. First, we kill the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lawyers. First, we fire HR. But then they've also killed a few things, which probably they should  have killed a long time ago, like dodgeball, which was essentially dead. That was their, their  version of location service. Right? So it's kind of a bright kite thing way back before even Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bought it. Yeah. And they just kind of let it, you know, they also, they also killed the catalog  search, which nobody used, but I did. Unfortunately, they didn't really maintain it very well. But when  they first put it up, I thought it was one of the more fascinating things on the internet. I'm not  sure if you're familiar with it, but it was essentially was a scan, a full text scan with  pictures from each page of every catalog in the country. Those things that, you know, typically  your wife gets from LL Bean and you know, Oh, I loved that. They killed that. Yes. I hadn't used  it in years though. Yeah. See, this is the problem. But the thing is my experience, they even had the  K and L wine store newsletter. And so instead of get, you know, you could just actually look at the  scan of it. They had a full scan and you could, but it was weird. You could cut and paste from it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  search on it and do all kinds of, you click to buy from it. Probably not. I don't think you could,  as I remember, you could not. I remember when they launched that, I thought that was so cool.  But you know, do they really need it? You can just go to the LL Bean site now. I wonder if it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  different than the catalog. The catalog is presented, you know, it's a catalog. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right there. We scan it in. Yeah. You know, it's right. But I wonder what the person who was scanning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all those in is doing now. Well, they say it was a demo of their OCR technology. Yeah, I guess. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was all about showing, Oh, look how, you know, we can take this page and make it live just by

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  using our OCR. Now Google says that they're also hiring just as much as they're letting go.  I think in an attempt to kind of stave off any panic around their stock, but it could be a  reasonable explanation to say, look, we're not going to be growing as fast. We're cutting back  on HR because we're not going to be doing as much recruiting, but it doesn't mean we're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hiring at all. Right. I mean, and people get fired from companies all the time. You always are,  if it's that big, whether how many tens of thousands of employees they have, if it's that big,  there's always, you know, some movement I would think. Okay. A hundred people, no big deal. When  we hear thousands, that's when you start to say, okay, something's going on. They also killed Jaiku,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which well, now the Jaiku person says, no, we're not killed. We're just reforming because they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  open sourcing it, which I love. So the Jaiku was the service that I retreated from Twitter to.  I thought it was better than Twitter. Nobody agreed with me. So it was kind of lonesome in  there. The great Twitter migration. Yeah, right. Four people, but Jaiku really, it had location  based stuff before anyone else did. It had threaded conversations. It was, I thought it was many ways  better than Twitter. In fact, it still is. And in a way I'm glad they've open sourced it because now  there was always Lekonica, which we use to run the twit army army.twit.tv. That's our local Twitter  kind of thing. And now there's Jaiku. I think it's good to have another open source alternative to  Twitter, especially for companies that want to do private Twitters and that kind of thing,  or groups. And it'll run on App Engine, right? So that means you don't even have to host it.  Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah. So in a way Jaiku is better because it's being  ported to App Engine and will be released as open source. They bought them in October 2007. And then  Yuri and Petri, the guys who wrote it, who were really nice Finnish lads, actually found they  moved to Mountain View. They have good jobs at Google. So they're staying busy. They're not  getting laid off. Now what I'm really scared about, Grand Central. I love Grand Central.  And I'll be very sad if Google kills that. Are they going to kill it? Well, they haven't offered,  they killed the invitations a long time ago. And Grand Central is an amazing free service where  you get a number. It has answering machines, it has redirection. It's great. We were using it on  our show Jumping Monkeys, which we killed. But we were using it on that show for a listener calls.  And it was awesome. In fact, I should repurpose it for Twitter. It was really, really a neat service.  So I hope they don't kill that. But there's other services that do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For money. Yeah. It's just that Grand Central was free. And then so it went out of business.  Yeah. Gee, what a surprise. Or not out of business, but it's being revised. They took it down. They took

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it down because there was a public service, but now they've decided to screw the public. They can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  afford public services anymore. Well, it's still up now. I don't want to start any rumors, but you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can't, if you don't have a sign in, you can't use it. I'm glad I got a sign in. I never really used  it though. It's pretty cool. Now you will. Yeah. Now I'll start using it. Yeah. Then they'll kill

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it. They'll kill it. Then they'll kill it. They'll say, oh, now that we finally got married, let's kill  it. What else? Noel? Is that Noel or Knol? I don't even know what it is. It's their Mahalo. In fact,  I remember Jason was a little pissed because it's essentially the same idea of human powered search  where they have- Look smart. Yeah. You know what it is? It's kind of like look smart, authoritative  human written articles about a specific topic. Maybe more like Wikipedia than Mahalo, but I think  it's really kind of the same idea. But that's not dead yet either. We're just, I'm just, we're just  speculating here. This is based on the Crave article. I'm sorry, I've seen it, Webware article,  Rafe Needleman. Oh, that guy, him. Oh, him. Oh, Rafe. I told you, my wife used to live with him.  That's right. But he says, other blogs, TechCrunch and Center Networks are calling Grand Central and  Knol is the next projects to join Google's scrap bin. He said that I'd add Google base  to the list of likely casualties. He points out, and I think he might be right, that given  what Google's doing with Android, Grand Central might actually have a role to play at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope that's the case. Well, and that's always Google's plan, right? Is to take a lot of these  things and see where else, how else they can incorporate them into their other products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I thought that's what they're going to do with Jaiku. I mean, Jaiku was very Nokia cell phone  based. If you had a Nokia cell phone, there was a Jaiku client. It was really, it was so slick.  Man, I miss Jaiku. Also Google notebook, which I never used, but I gathered from the howling on  the web when they killed it. What is it? It's a notebook program. It's kind of, well, you know,  it's kind of like part of Google Docs. So it's an online cloud based shared notebook.  What do you need that for if you got Google Docs? Yeah, really. It says you can collect recipes,  gift ideas and interesting articles from the web. Oh, right. So are you taking clips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a clipping. Isn't this like that note taking program that's so popular now?  Like Evernote. I love it. I think that's what killed it probably. Yeah. It's a web based

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Evernote. Of course, Evernote is a web based Evernote. So there you go. There you have it.  You know, Evernote on the Mac is so much nicer. I put it on my Windows 7 machine and I was a  little disappointed. I liked it so much on the Mac. Why? On Evernote, they, and I remember this  now from when I first used it, because it was a Windows program at first. The metaphor is one of  those tape, you know, grocery, like a grocery list tape. So you're all your notes are kind of on this  long tape. And I don't like the metaphor so much. It's more of a page based metaphor on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just makes more sense. Well, it goes back and this isn't even an Apple product, but the Apple  is good with the interface, with the metaphor, with the way it looks, with the appearances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Because this was a Windows product that they late ported the app to Mac. And then, but  because the, you know, the, it's like huge on the iPhone, it's easily the number one, you know,  notebook application out there. The iPhone made it a Mac, a popular Mac app. So I think probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  more Mac people use it now. Windows is pretty on the inside. Actually, it's not even pretty on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inside. It's like me. Don't judge me. So is Patrick ever coming back from the diaper change? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he may be, may be covered with it by now. He's, he's still online. He's still on the, on the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really glad we don't have a net cam now. Yeah, it could have been worse. Let's take a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  let's take a little tiny break and see if we can get Patrick back from the,  from duty call. We will, we will talk about in a second, the Hulu frou-frou, and actually Hulu  handled it very well over It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And Ashton Kutcher and Kevin  Rose together at last, the true story. But first I want to mention the good folks at GoToMeeting.  Love the GoToMeeting. Got to love the GoToMeeting. Ever use GoToMeeting? Man, this is great. GoToMeeting  is so cool. It allows you to eliminate travel, to meet online, to take a conference call, and to  turn it into something actually productive and useful. Here's, it's from the folks at Citrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one of your chat room members pointed out that if the 25th person is a conjoined twin,  you have 26. What? What are you talking about? I don't know, but I don't get it. It's a way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get extra people in your conference. I don't understand. You can actually have many hundreds  of people in your conference. That's the bizarre thing I ever heard. I don't know what that means  even. Never read the chat room. I should have warned you. It's like they're on shrooms or  something. It's just weird. If the 25th person is a conjoined twin, you get 26. Well, that's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for up to 25 people. So. Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. Oh, so you know more than I do.  No, I'm just reading it out of the chat room. But once you sign, once you actually have an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  account, I think it's, I've had meetings with many hundreds of people because I've given speeches  that way. It's really cool. All right, let's move on. I guess I see that Patrick dropped off  completely. So I think our theory that maybe he is covered head to toe is true. Yeah. Hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can I mention something by the way? Yes. One of the reasons I was five minutes late today, I went  Bert Monroy rolled out his art exhibit at the St. Mary's, at the St. Mary's Art Museum,  the Hearst Gallery, I think it's called. Oh, I love Bert. And, but he's got, he did all,  he's got his best pieces printed on these huge canvases and then stretched. And anyone who's a  Bert Monroy fan and you think you've seen his stuff, you haven't seen, and he has Damon, the  whole, the big version. This gallery exhibit, some of this art is astonishing. Oh, I'd love to see  that. You definitely should go take a run. I think it's going to be running for the next two months,  but it's the, these are huge pieces that really, I mean, they look good small, but they look  unbelievable. And they're actually are brighter. There's something about this, these new Epson  printers, these big flat printers that have, that just, I don't know what it is, the ink or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something. The things are just stunning anyway. Yeah, no, they're probably using a 3800. Those are,  they can print on canvas. They can print on, I mean, I mean, it's amazing. So Bert is the guy,  those of you who used to watch the screensavers, who would come on and do Photoshop tips. And then  now he has a show on revision three called Pixel Perfect, which by the way, there was some concern  that might've been canceled with the other shows and it has not. So Bert's still doing that show.  Thank goodness. And he does amazing Photoshop art. He's, you know, I always thought of Photoshop as  a retouching tool, but he's a fine artist. Did they have the one with the train station platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, it's not the 3800 by any means. We're talking about 60 inch carriage. Oh, okay.  Nevermind. Wow. These are monsters. Wow. Where does he go to get that done? We're talking five,  he's got one that's 15 feet long. I mean, Epson and him are partners in some way. The Epson's  doing a lot of these prints. That's amazing. Well, so you saw the one with the train station. He showed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  me the detail. I mean, literally he takes a year or two to paint these. The train station one is at  the exhibit full size. Unbelievable. I can't wait to see it. You can see people in the windows of  the building, you know, and if you, and that's why if you look at it on the computer, there's just like  a blob, but he's, but he's zooming in and painting it. So that's all there. Talk about hyper realism.  So it's super retouching, it sounds like. No, cause it's not a photo. It's painted from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It starts with a white canvas. Super touching. Super touching. There's a re involved. There's no re.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. That's impressive. Yeah. It's actually hyper, hyper, he calls it super realism,  but I think hyper realism, which I thought about myself is a better term because,  but you don't know. I mean, I've seen his stuff, cause he's a neighbor of mine actually. He's up  the street. I didn't know that. And I see his stuff all the time and you know, I go up there and use  his printer and he's got, he's got one of those, he doesn't have the one that they printed these  with, but he's got a big one, a big monster, bigger than a 3,800. Anyway, Pringles antenna,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do that wirelessly. Just show up, Hey, I printed something. So, well, he had to put the, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if it were that easy. Anyway, so, so I've seen all this stuff over the years and I have a number of  pieces myself, but until you see them this big, you don't realize how unbelievable and how beautiful  they are. I mean, these are huge, gorgeous pieces. This is, I can't wait to see. So where,  where is the show? This is at the St. University, St. Mary's College University, whatever it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  over there in the Moraga at the Hearst museum. B E R T M O N R O Y.com. And they're actually right  in the front is Damon, the train station painting. Right. You have to see that thing there. I can't  wait to see that. He, I remember he's, you know, he was, I think he was working on it when he was  on the screen. Certainly what he was on call for help. Yeah. I think that one took him two years

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or something. The one he's working on now is going to take him, I think four years and he works on it.  I think, I think six to eight hours a day. It's crazy. I think the Michelangelo Photoshop,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not Michelangelo. Who's the pointillist. It's like, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, even better. More like Sarah  one billion dabs. How many paintings did Sarah do? He only did like a handful, right? No, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he did quite a few. There's another pointillist besides him. There's two of them that were well  known. I saw an exhibit of the other guy at the museum of modern art and, uh, or no, I saw it.  It was at the, uh, Met in New York, which I get for some reason I can't think of his name. He did  a lot too. And they had most of them there. Uh, yeah, they, you know, he had pretty good that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that, that, that, that, you know, he took a long time also to do his stuff. I mean, he's just amazing.  That reminds me in some ways, although hardly photorealistic. Yeah. Well, and it wasn't taking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to do a pointillist picture. That wasn't taking the guy four years or, you know, or two years. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was, you know, a month maybe. Oh, really? Yeah. I got to go on those tours. You go on, I always get  the wrong information. Oh, it took 400 years to make a painting and he only did two in his lifetime

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and you're looking at them both. There's a couple of, uh, artists that didn't do a lot of work,  but that's, they just lost interest more in it than a time consuming thing. Anyway, I've done 178

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  twits. They can never say I lost interest. Damn them. So, uh, I haven't been watching Kevin Rose's  at Sundance with Ashton Kutcher, uh, doing a web-based live game show at Sundance that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to stream over quick. I think they did it yesterday. If I'm over, am I right? Yeah. Yeah.  Then, and then he's already flown back from, are you kidding? Really? Yeah. At least if, if, if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is true. Well, Twitter's wouldn't lie. 24 hours of Sundance. Uh, but an interesting idea.  I don't know how they got Ashton, how they got Ashton Kutcher involved in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't really know. I think they're hanging out together. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Kevin's basically  brushed us all off and he's going up, upscale. He's a superstar. He's a superstar. He's got, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Megan Asha from Venture Beat, Matt Marshall from Console Kings, uh, CJ Peters from Geek Inter,  or I'm sorry. Uh, I'm getting those backwards. TMI Weekly is Megan and then Venture Beat is Matt.  CJ Peters from Console Kings and then, uh, Irina Slutsky from Geek Entertainment. Irina,  I wonder how she did. They were, they were the contestants. Irina, that's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're calling it, dude, where's my Sundance? No. Anyway, I wonder how that went. It's an,  they're calling it an experiment, but quick QIK broadcasted. But I just thought as an experiment,  I pulled out my camera and a broadcast that Jonathan Colton showed just to see if I could  get numbers anywhere near Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Rose.
