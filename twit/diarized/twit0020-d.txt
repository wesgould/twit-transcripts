Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 20 for August 28, 2005.  This is our cast of characters it looks like, and a mighty fine cast of characters it is.  On Skype, again, Steve Gibson. This is our, by the way, the last Skype TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because next week we're using Google Talk, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve and I use Google Talk for Security Now, and it sounded much better.  You can't conference with that now, can you? I mean, multiple, yeah.  You can't conference. So Steve is on Skype, as well as Robert Heron.  Hello, hello.  Who couldn't get to work today, thank goodness, so he's able to TWIT with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's telecommuting, right? Telecommuting to TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sent the emails off, I'm on VPN, I've been there all day.  It looks like you're there. It looks like you're there.  People were asking me to go out to lunch, and I'm like, I'm not in the building.  Oh, you shouldn't say that. You just say, oh, I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have so much work to do, I better stay in my cubicle right now.  Patrick Norton, who is not at work today, did I say that? Yes.  David Craker is in studio with us producing...  Are you? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In official capacity with, and kind of half producing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David and Kevin are here today, along with Keith, who they're doing a little system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we are. We wanted to...  There's been so many people out there that want to know how podcasting works.  And I have to say, when it comes to the most complex setup you could possibly have for podcasting,  it has to be Mr. Leo Laporte with TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no stupider setup, but it's all gonna change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  None of the listeners, though, realize what you go through before you start recording the show every week, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes I'm gonna accidentally put out the pre-show instead of the show.  You'd have to bleep a lot, though.  Yeah, they'll hear me going, ra-da-ra.  It's all because of Skype. It's all because everybody's coming in different ways, and it's a complicated thing.  It's gonna be so much easier. Next week we are gonna be live from the Apple Store, downtown San Francisco, 1 Stockton.  We'll start setting up at 3, and we'll do the show at 4.  And then everybody will have a microphone.  Everybody will have headphones. You'll be able to see each other.  It's gonna be a much better, I think a much better TWIT.  Although Dvorak, who's not with us today, he's afraid it's gonna...  He says it's gonna look like a CES panel and be just about as exciting.  I don't think that's the case.  Well, we'll find out.  I think there'll be plenty of interaction still.  I don't think we're gonna start saying the future of the Internet.  Because it's everyone's personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it gonna be more of a roundtable, or everyone sitting at a table facing out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it'll be more of a roundtable. We're not gonna...  No concessions to the audience.  Half of us will have our backs to the audience.  Excellent.  And we'll all be fighting for that.  I want my back to the audience.  Stories today. Hot news.  Anybody... Robert, you had some interesting LCD stuff you wanted to talk about.  Tell us a little bit about what you've been up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, NEC just announced at SIGGRAPH earlier this month a new display that they're coming up with  that uses LED backlighting instead of compact fluorescents,  which are typically used in an LCD display.  And the advantages of basically taking a red, a blue, and a green LED to generate that white light  is a few things, a few great benefits.  One, it stabilizes the display quicker.  So when you turn it on, they claim within a minute you'll be able to have that in its working condition  rather than, say, the 20 to 30 minutes for a regular display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  It takes 20 or 30 minutes for a regular display to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For the normal color balance to finally settle in and stabilize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean you shouldn't be watching your LCD TV for 30 minutes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, most people aren't going to wait.  I mean, for televisions, you know, it's not as critical, but if you were going to, say,  pay somebody to professionally calibrate that display for you in your home,  you would definitely want to let it warm up for a half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that true of computer displays, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, CRTs is really where you really have to wait a while for them to warm up before they...  And remember, they're worse than LCDs?  Sure, sure. The phosphors take time to warm up or at least, quote-unquote, stabilize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're saying 30 minutes, not 30 seconds, 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and it could take literally up to two hours,  depending on the environmental conditions in the room as well,  depending on how cold the room is.  If it's a lot colder, it takes longer, right?  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I'm a graphic professional and trying to get really accurate color results,  I shouldn't be letting my monitor turn off at all. I should just leave it on all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, or at least have it maybe on a timer of some kind.  Or more in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although then you have the reverse problem,  which is that the fluorescent tubes are the things in the LCD panels  that do ultimately have a short lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally. That's one of the first things to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these LEDs will warm up faster, they won't burn out as fast.  How about the color accuracy? Is it pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, with traditional backlighting for an LCD, you're talking roughly...  If you compare it to how the NTSC color standard for television production,  you can get about 70%, maybe 75% of the color gamut that is used in NTSC.  Now with LEDs, they're claiming that they can, and everyone's pretty much in agreement on this,  that they can surpass 100% of the color and actually produce a greater color range  than even that is used in TV right now, which is terrific.  If you're an editor for that kind of thing, or even more important,  this particular display that NEC is bringing out also carries a pretty steep resolution  of 3200 by 1200, which I believe they're aiming this more toward medical imaging,  where a doctor would really... It's more important for grayscale,  especially if you're looking at something like an x-ray picture,  but if you are getting into any kind of color representation for medical technology,  you definitely want accurate color to make either A, a proper diagnosis,  or just to make sure what you're seeing is what you're supposed to be seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3200 by 1200, you'd be able to do 1080p really easy.  Oh, definitely, which is only 1920 by 1080.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My God, how much is that going to cost?  And I wonder if they care at all about power consumption.  Is it going to be a lot less because it's LED?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's a $6500 display, so it doesn't really matter how much power it consumes.  Actually, it should be more efficient in terms of,  you know what, compact fluorescents have come a long way.  It's a very mature technology. They are very efficient as far as light goes.  And odds are, depending on how many LEDs are used in the backlighting system,  it could actually consume more energy.  But it's more about, A, you're able to recreate...  The thing about it is, for different white points,  the color of white has to be a standard as well,  depending on if you work, say, in photography or television or PC displays,  they all have different white point temperatures.  And with this display, you actually have variable temperature.  You can pretty much set it anywhere you want or prefer it to be on the fly even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they white LEDs in the background or is it red, green, and blue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Odds are they're using an RGB system, where they use a red, a blue, and a green.  And that way, they can either cycle through all three of them at once,  or individually tweak one or the other in real time to match whatever standard you're trying to go for.  And other technologies, too, would be like 10-bit internal color processing,  which is important to eliminate rounding errors when you're trying to, say, resolve an image  that's even greater resolution than what the display is physically capable of.  Sometimes you run into dithering errors when it's trying to map that,  a large image onto a relatively small resolution.  But in this case, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think we see LED TVs in the near future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? They're supposed to be out already.  I think it seems to be the biggest problem was getting LEDs of the similar brightness  and being able to dial in an array of them to similar brightness,  so you have even luminance behind the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Totally.  I know they've worked on chips recently to where they can then simply put each LED in front of a little photo measuring device  and just dial in each one to a specific setting and lock it there.  Yeah. How about LED projectors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about LED projectors?  Because weren't they talking about LED PowerPoint projectors in the near future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Already. A couple weeks ago, I was at a Texas Instrument toy tour, they called it,  and Mitsubishi was there with their Pocket Projector, which is a very interesting new device.  It's literally the size of a jewel case, a senior jewel case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're giving away at the next broadcast.  Yeah, Pocket Projectors.  Pocket Projectors.  I ordered them, by the way, I'm a little worried because I ordered them.  I don't know if they'll get there in time, but we'll have them at least for the September 18th,  if not by September 4th, but it's one of those things where it takes, you know, they have to print it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are going to be collector's items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it just has the little twit guy in it that says twit, it doesn't say a date or anything like that.  Well, I would put a date, but then I thought...  If we have extras, I want to get them out.  I don't want to...  We can handwrite dates on them.  We'll sign them. There's lots of room for autographs.  Vive, VIIV, it's the new Intel processor.  We kind of knew they were going to do that because they trademarked VIIV a while ago,  but everybody was speculating what was VIIV.  Is it, you know, the Roman numeral 64 for 64-bit computing?  Well, it's the new Intel, and they say it rhymes with Strive.  They announced it at the Intel Developers Forum.  Anybody, Patrick, did you read up on this? Any thoughts about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The general reaction was this is the least, or the best leaked secret in computing.  Yeah, that was the first reaction I heard from a lot of people,  and nobody expected them to not release it until the end of 2006.  So it's going to be a long time before it shows up, these next generation processors.  They're saying now first quarter, 2006. That's what Intel said.  Then they changed their message since everybody did their briefings three days ago.  They were saying end of 2006, second half of 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, we'll have to check that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Either that or they gave bad information to the guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see where I read that. I thought I read it in one of the articles about that.  I'm quoting that. So it won't be for another year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Basically, you're looking as far out as the end of 2006, but second half of 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're dual core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  65 nanometer. They're working on dual core. They're pretty heavy.  They're in full Borg mode. It's all about processing power per watt as a...  That was an interesting sound. As a new metric for it,  which is pretty much in lockstep with the presentation Steve Jobs did at the Worldwide Developers Conference  when they announced that they were leaving IBM and moving into Intel's processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's maybe the source of the confusion.  Vive will be launching in the first quarter of 2006.  Maybe the chips won't be...  It's just the brand is launching.  Because the CNET says, quoting Don McDonald of Intel Digital Home Group,  Vive launches in the first quarter of 2006.  One feature of Vive, this sounds kind of interesting, is automatic transcoding,  ensuring that audio or video encoded in one format will be automatically transcoded  without user intervention. So you'll get a DivX and it'll automatically transcode it to AVI. I don't know.  Why would you want to do that?  Well, because it's confusing for consumers. They download video and they can't watch it until they have the proper codec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but transcoding? I don't know.  It doesn't sound like a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't remember... Intel had so much success with the Centrino, which was not the processor.  It wasn't a chip. Right.  Yeah, it was a tie-in. Basically, you got to tie into a ginormous, huge advertising campaign  if you used an Intel processor and an Intel chipset and an Intel...  And this is the important one, the Intel 802. Basically, it's the trifecta for Intel.  They make a ton of money and then the notebook vendors got to tie into the after-times campaign.  The marketing co-op.  Yeah, the Vive technology... this is basically Intel finally deciding to embrace on a high-profile level  the idea of a consumer entertainment PC. That's the whole point of Vive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the dual-core processor. You get a chipset, a network controller as opposed to the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is more stuff like Vive is more like, hey, there's going to be a remote control.  It's going to have cutting-edge technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says it requires Windows Media Center. So, I mean, obvious.  Instance shutdown and startup. That's cool.  So that's...  It's all stuff you do on the regular platform.  I was confusing that then with an actual product.  Right.  So the marketing term rolls out sooner than these new processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The marketing term Centrino worked on me and I knew exactly what it was, but I still...  if I see a notebook that says Centrino, at least a light goes on in my head  because at least I know that it's got a penny mm and it got wireless.  And still to this day, you see that logo and you're like, oh, it's got to be better than half the other...  a lot of the other stuff that you see anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That means you've been well-trained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and probably foolishly, I and I know we all spend a lot of time trying to explain to people,  oh, no, it's just marketing. But you know what? It does make it easier for somebody to buy.  And gosh, it's hard when you go into the store to say, well, I need this laundry list of things.  You look for one brand, you say, oh, Centrino, oh, Vive, that's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the problem is in a lot of cases, there's a lot of successful marketing campaigns  that are pointing at awful products that you shouldn't spend your own money on.  Well, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have they started talking yet about the naming convention they're going to use for these chips?  I mean, I want a standard. There's got to be a standard. It's driving me crazy.  Yeah.  Did they say anything like the 8057A or?  No.  It's just right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't remember anything very clear. And that actually would be an interesting story to follow up on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they announced, I'll give you an example, there's a new video display processor.  They're calling the O plus MN301. That fits right in the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People who are buying those are people who are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, integrators. So there's Yona, which is a laptop single core processor.  That comes out in the first half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That actually is really interesting. That's the new notebook processor.  Is that the code name or is that the actual code name?  That's the code name.  That's the code name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's out of Israel, so they're using... it's Yona is the book of Jonah.  Yeah, well...  So tell us about that. What's interesting about that, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not too much. I mean, part of what was interesting about that is that for the next generation of the desktop chipsets,  a lot of it's coming out of the Pentium M, which is coming out of the Israeli design teams  that have been doing the low power, high efficiency stuff.  Less so than it's going to be then, plus a dash of the 64-bit stuff that's going on here in the States.  And what's interesting is they keep saying that NetBurst architecture is definitely in there,  but nobody seems to know where and at what level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you noticed, too, that as they talk about power per watt or performance per watt,  that it almost quietly slips in that these chips, not only do they offer shorter pipelines,  but as far as processing through the processor itself, but it won't allow it to scale up as high as far as gigahertz go.  That's right. And that's how they keep it cool, right?  And so effectively, these could turn out to be slower parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's not...  For high-end situations, say like gaming.  But that's why... why do you think they'd go dual core? What's the point of dual core?  Well, that's how Apple handled it. When you get lower megahertz, you put two more.  Yeah, but you're also talking about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For specialized applications. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't get any benefit in word processing. I agree.  So then there's the successor to Yona is...  Well, you could in gaming, Robert, if somebody would write threaded games, but nobody's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I take Carmack's take on that back at QuakeCon where he said basically for gaming in particular,  it's better to have a good out of order processor than to try to cram everything into being multi-threaded dual core.  It works better for a gaming situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, you are multi-threaded already because you have a graphics unit which is taking some of the load off  and you have a CPU which is doing the calculations. You really are dual threaded for all of that.  Without a doubt, graphics is the best case scenario for massive parallel processing.  That's exactly right. It's parallel processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But for everything else, I can't think of anything that would benefit from it in terms of the gaming world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's the word that's coming out from a lot of people who design regular applications.  You look at the cell processor and it's a great concept, but isn't this the same thing that everybody from the NSA  to who knows who all else massively multiple parallel processing?  Well, it's not exactly massively multiple parallel processing on the cell processor,  but single thread applications pretty much rule the desktop. How fast does Word need to run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next generation after Yona is SosaMan. I don't know what SosaMan means.  It adds memory protection and dual processor because Yona is single core.  And that's really a server chip. And then after that, you've got the Xeons, which are DP and MP,  which are obviously dual or four or more processors, respectively.  The Dempsey is a dual core Xeon. I'm just running through the roadmap here.  Just stop me if anybody wants to talk about any of these.  There's a platform called Bensley. You can see why you need a naming convention. This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is the way they've done. You're talking about the stuff.  The stuff we're looking at is all the code names. And the only people who look at that are people like us, who are tweakers.  We're all sitting here planning when we're going to buy our next notebook and waiting to find out  whether or not Yona is going to be a gaming notebook part or whether it's going to be a standard notebook part  and whether or not the multi-threading of Windows XP will give us any decent kind of performance out of it  so we can finally run a Skype phone call at the same time. We have 42 windows open in Mozilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me if this scares you. This is a quote from Paul Gelsinger, general manager of the Digital Enterprise Group.  They're touting something called active management technology.  Quote, we want to embed just a little bit of the IT manager directly into each piece of silicon we ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That actually sounds a lot more awful than it actually is.  No, that actually, what they're trying to do is bring more manageability into the chipset.  There's some really good reasons for that in terms of how you handle and how you start foiling everything  from spyware to doing secure transactions. They've got a long way to go between hither and yon,  but a lot of that's more like making life easier for people who are administering 50,000 desktops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Sony and IBM releasing more information about the cell processor.  Obviously, time to coincide with these Intel announcements.  I read them, but it didn't seem like anything particularly new. It's a multimedia processor. We knew that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It's interesting to look at what Intel did with the new chip design.  They've upped the bandwidth between the L1 and the L2 cache. The multi-core versions are going to share the L2 cache.  Along with the power processing, they also did a bunch of stuff where they shortened the pipeline.  They took chunks of BANUS and again, unspecified portion of the pending for the NetBurst architecture.  It's going to support 64 bits of 14-stage pipeline, which should make branch prediction less,  basically means bad branch prediction should be less brutal on the performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They made a mistake with the pipelines. They went too long on the pipelines and they were having real trouble with that.  I can understand why they're backing off that, although that lowers performance in theory, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they also played around. It depends on how you look at it.  If every time you have a bad decision, you have to throw out everything that's in the pipeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It requires optimizing compilers and recompiling your code so that the branch prediction is more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently, they're doing a bunch of work on the prefetch and the branch prediction to make that one better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick, do you know if the L2 caches are being made larger still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure that they talked too much about the size of the L2 cache.  I think they said it was scalable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what they want because then they get cheap chips with no cache or low cache.  But I would predict that they don't want to have too much L2 cache because it does speed up the processor,  but it also adds considerably to the power and heat issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm worried if the cores are sharing a single L2, then you really start to see more like a hyper-threading  lack of performance than true separate core performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been saying that for a while, Steve, that the L2 cache is so important.  That's really the thing that makes a difference in a processor more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it all turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because external motherboard dynamic memory is so much slower than the on-chip cache.  You just don't want to go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've got to remember, they're fighting a trench battle with AMD for the high end of the market,  especially with the gamers and the power users, which means they can't afford to give up a lot of performance at that end.  So I can't imagine they're going to shrink the L2 cache that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This podcast, by the way, being recorded on an AMD FX64.  I just thought I'd throw that in.  A non-centrino machine.  And by the way, I'm not getting paid by AMD or Intel, which apparently is a big mistake.  Somebody was telling me that somebody who's intimately acquainted with not only this show,  but how much is kind of the going rate out there for these kinds of things,  we could be making thousands of dollars a show if we accepted advertising.  Many thousands.  Might want to change the model.  Nope.  Just got to remind people that your contributions keep this show alive.  And when we're going live, we're going to have some extra costs.  But that's all part of the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, we're not paying for the booze bill for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm sure you're right, Leo.  I'm sure you're right, Leo.  You just don't want to start having ads.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cuts Down 13. Have you followed this story?  No.  Oh my God.  This is complicated.  These are high school students.  They were given iBooks as part of the, you know, you go to the high school, you get an iBook.  A lot of schools are doing that now.  In fact, they were locked down.  They were locked down.  They had protection on them.  They were using, I think, Apple's firmware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You mean like you'd need an admin password to install stuff type of thing?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kids said, wait a minute, we want to install iChat.  What good is a laptop without iChat?  So they hacked it and put iChat on there.  They were charged with felonies.  Yeah.  Felonies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, okay, okay.  Let's slow down a little bit here.  There's a lot of really, we actually got a letter from a student at the school.  And the student at the school, and this was a while back, the student at the school pointed out that there's pretty much every new agency that's covering this is having a different slant.  Most of them don't, most of them have very different interpretations of the reality going on.  I think one of the things that's interesting is one of the parents or maybe it's the uncle of one of the kids was decided that, and this sounds like a pretty legitimate chunk of it, was that the school went directly from some internal discipline to try to get the kids to stop.  Because what they were doing is they're not just, they're basically they were taking all of the browsing controls off of it.  They were installing extra software.  Supposedly there was also some messing around with other people's computers and some hacking of information.  That's where it starts to get fuzzy.  They told the kids to not do it because they didn't want them using things like chat in the classrooms and stuff.  The kids basically kept doing it.  And then rather than going to the parents, and this is the stuff where I'd really like to hear a good local well-informed reporter on this, is instead of going to the parents, they called up the cops.  And the cops basically, what they had to work with was a felony charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at the Associated Press article that according to the AP, and again, I don't, that's all I know.  So you might be right.  This is completely wrong.  They were charged with computer trespassing, computer theft after the school district said we tried detentions, we tried suspensions, we tried other punishments.  They continued to do it.  But computer theft and computer trespass are felonies.  Well, the good news is they have dropped the charges.  They've offered them a deal, I guess, in which they'll drop the charges in exchange for 15 hours of community service, a letter of apology, a class on personal responsibility, and a few months of probation.  That's true.  They got their attention.  Well, they did, although according to the attorney for one of the students, a few are thinking about refusing the deal because, quote, they don't feel they've broken any laws.  But I tell you what, if you're facing a felony charge, which will ruin your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're under 18, though, so they-  I guess it would get expunged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you would know about this.  So it would get expunged after you hit 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you know about this, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a couple little nicks here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know anything.  Well, I would hope they would take the deal, although you know how it is when you're 15 years old.  Yeah, you do all kinds of crazy stuff.  Heck, I'm not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you get somebody from Computer Trespass for simply installing an application?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that they weren't just simply installing it.  That was passed on to us from at least one or more of the students that were at Kutztown.  This is the obtained passwords.  They were probably pushing their luck.  Well, the obtaining password part was really funny.  They were pushing their luck, but the thing that was really funny is the original IT passwords to lock down the notebooks were apparently written on a label that was put on each notebook.  So there was some pathetic security that was being employed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like the security of my own high school's network way back in the day, which is nonexistent.  You know what?  I think maybe they should consider if you're going to hand out notebooks to students that are arguably modern and can be used in such a way, have the back end network secure before you go doing this.  Just agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's too tempting.  It also sounds like the school didn't have lots of IT savvy in order to sort of just rest control back away from the kids after they knew this was a problem.  Instead, they were using traditional approaches.  Detention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a totally reactive system.  It's like the Breakfast Club.  I got you next week.  I got you the week after that.  I own you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, according to this AP reporter, there must have been someone who decided they wanted to be tech savvy because they said they had a remote monitoring function on some of these computers.  That's right.  They turned that off because they were watching.  But they said that the kids turned it off and then, I don't know how they said they were going to do this, and used it to view the administrator's own computer screen instead.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple Remote Desktop is actually very cool.  It's expensive.  It's an expensive program.  But if you have the administrator version, you can see every screen.  What it will do is put 16 screens on your screen.  You can see every screen on your screen and watch what they're doing.  And it rotates through them.  So that's what they turned off.  So you can watch the teacher surf porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what?  I would turn it off.  They give you an iBook.  You're 15 years old.  You have the skills to do it.  The password's written on the label on the bottom.  Wouldn't you turn it off?  Of course.  First thing I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this a little stupid?  Because if you turn it off, the teacher's obviously going to know that you're the one person in the room of 29.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin would start feeding it somebody else's computer.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would create a separate profile on how that would be active when they're viewing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just feed it a sound of music video.  Yeah, right.  I'm watching Maria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you feel?  What's wrong with installing chat programs?  I mean, it's their computer, right?  Well, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a classroom, they're supposed to be involved in the educational process.  They could be trading notes back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every school is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I almost said it.  One of the kids I know who goes to a high school here, she was downloading music onto the computer.  Every year, they turn in the computer and they get a new computer for the next year.  It's not new, but they get a different computer.  Yeah, because the hard disk fills up.  Right.  Well, that's the thing.  She said, I lost all my music.  So she asked the minister, can you give me my music back?  He said no.  What about this?  The voice over internet providers.  I don't know if you use Vonage and Packet 8.  Or the FCC.  Yeah, I've got urgent notes from both Vonage and Packet 8.  Please, please go online and sign this 9-11 thing because next week, if you have voice over internet and you haven't signed this document saying, I know the 9-11 sucks.  If you haven't done that, they'll turn off your service.  The FCC is forcing them to turn off the VoIP service to all customers who haven't signed this informational notice.  Now, fortunately, you can do it online.  You just check a box, which I've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Leo, even though it's sort of old news for us now since Wednesday, we really ought to talk about Google Talk a little bit just to make sure people know they can go to Google.com slash talk.  It's great.  And get the new client for online chat and voice connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steven, I used this for Security Now episode 2 and I thought it sounded better than Skype, don't you, Steve?  No, you're talking PC to PC communication, though, right?  No conferencing PC to PC only.  Do you also think it sounded...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The FCC deal over 9-11 is dealing with potentially where it can actually connect to an actual landline or a cell phone or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's Vonage or VoIP, Vonage or Packet Aid or CallVantage.  Leo and I did.  But that's different.  That's a separate...  What's happened here, Steve, has brought up, is bifurcated.  He's brought up a whole other story.  Let's finish the 9-11 story, Steve, and then we'll talk a little bit about Google Talk.  But I do want to warn people who are using Vonage or another voice over internet provider like that that provides a phone to phone connection.  You may lose your service if you haven't signed that 9-11 thing next week.  They're trying to get the FCC to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the FCC actually extended the deadline.  It's September 28.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, because that's the last thing I saw was they were trying to get them to do that.  So you have a little more time.  But isn't that an interesting attitude?  You know what happened is there was a pretty famous case where a woman was killed or something bad happened because they got 9-11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and she tried to use 9-11 and had no access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  The problem is you can have access.  I signed up for 9-11 on both systems, but you tell it what address you're going to be on.  And because these things are portable, I can throw it in my suitcase and I can be in Canada.  If I call 9-11, they're coming to my house in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and there's no power failsafe, right?  That's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what it says on the disclaimer, the information notice you have to sign.  Yes, if my broadband goes out, no 9-11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the FCC has really strict regulations on, I guess, being able to get emergency services.  So even a cell phone with no service provider, if you, well, even a cell phone where you haven't paid any kind of bills or anything like that, if you type 9-11 on it, you're getting through.  As it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's also because most cell phones you buy nowadays have GPS receivers in them, and they can actually figure out where you are or even use the cell tracker.  They give a rough tracking on the GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the other thing, most people actually use wired, or they use wireless handsets inside of their homes, right?  I got trapped in an elevator in San Francisco.  The first seven numbers I called, nobody could pick up because the power was down.  Which is one of the reasons why when I have a landline in my house, I always have a 70s era Western electric phone in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly right, because those are powered by the phone company, not by your, you don't have to plug them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't there a day when Patrick Norton came in late to work at TechTV because he was stuck in an elevator?  Is this that time?  This is that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the way, and what's really, I mean, you want to talk about scary.  San Francisco law, for all those little tiny elevators they put in the smaller apartment buildings, they're required by, there's no manual, unlike a big building elevator where you can slide the door back and undo the internal latch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is the only, only Patrick would try this, but I'll go ahead, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I grew, well, I grew up in New York.  I lived in Jersey in an apartment building for a while.  Look, the first time you get stuck in an elevator and somebody shows you how to open that door, you know, compared to spending two and a half hours sitting in an elevator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not recommending this, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're, yeah, we're not recommending this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most elevators just drift to the bottom floor.  Wait for security personnel to come and rescue you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem with those, with those little elevators in the small apartment buildings in San Francisco is they're required, they're required by law to lock down the emergency access on the top of the elevator.  I've never understood that.  And the doors can't be opened from outside.  The only way you can get out is if you have a screwdriver to basically take the locking latch off the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you have to be, you have to have a screwdriver in the elevator with you?  Well, I happen to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what if you didn't?  But if you didn't, you're in there until somebody figures out a way to get you out.  With the jaws of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He would have been really late for tech TV that day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was actually, it was actually really, it was pretty spooky because the internal light was barely functioning because the battery was weak.  And there's, you know, there's a little tiny four inch portal.  It was actually the last time I used the elevator in that building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you guys hear about those elevator hacks that came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's cool.  I haven't been, I've been trying to use it, but here it doesn't even work so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have the Otis, is it Otis Elevators?  If you push, take a look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's supposed to be Otis and three or four others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're on a floor and you want to bypass everyone else that's requesting an elevator, you push the floor number that you want to go to and the close door button at the exact same time.  And it'll bypass, it'll just go, take you all the way down.  And that works in Otis Elevators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And now everybody knows.  Oh, that is the best hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the best hack I've ever heard.  Yes. I saw it on digg.com.  Was it linking to Engadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I thought without Dvorak we wouldn't have any of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to make up for his hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is awesome. What a great hack.  It is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hasn't anybody actually tried it?  Because they had a similar hack posted on there for crossing, cross signals where you can actually push the button a certain way for the cross signal to have it change over to a wire.  Over to a walk symbol.  So you could just cross the street immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I saw that as well. Did you try that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried it half a dozen times and a couple of times I thought it might have worked, but I think it was just the timing with the car sitting on the sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that the urban dream to have control of all of these annoying things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because supposedly they made it a felony now to use one of those MIRT devices for changing signals.  And rightly so.  I mean, if I'm in that ambulance, I don't want to be celled up trying to get to the hospital.  It's impossible.  And I totally understand that.  I do too.  Just not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love those kind of real world hacks though.  Hacking the real world is much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you been to lifehacker.com? That's kind of a cool site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are a couple of good sites for that.  What is it? 43 things or 40?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  43 something.  43 folders.  Folders. Has a lot of stuff like that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they got good stuff.  So now let's talk about Google Talk.  Because Steve and I used it for the first time.  Well, it came out Wednesday.  We used it on Thursday to do Security Now.  I was pretty impressed.  Were you impressed with it, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was extremely impressed.  And when I listen to the MP3 that you produced, I don't hear any difference between the way you sound and the way I sound.  And we're 500 miles apart and over the internet.  What I've learned about it since is that it does dynamically change the compression.  And it can get scared if there's an interruption in the connection into lowering the data rate so that it increases compression, lowers the data rate.  And then you start having that underwater sound.  It didn't happen to you and me, Leo.  We've got a great connection between our two networks.  It's 28 milliseconds round trip.  But it does actually start out optimistically and then lower the bit rate and increase compression if necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really good quality, I have to say.  I mean, it's really remarkable.  It does have some disadvantages.  I mean, of course, you can't have more than one person.  It's only right now Gmail to Gmail.  Point to point.  Lack of encryption.  Although apparently they plan to do encryption on it.  I'm not impressed, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The client sucks.  Well, who really needs it?  I mean, there's a million checkpoints.  The technology they're using for the voice, the VoIP stuff is not even their own technology.  It's done by a company called Global IP Sound.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So why are they doing it?  They're just trying to rule the world, I guess.  I mean, I hope eventually they'll add a lot more features that will make it different.  But right now it's just a standard IM client.  I mean, it's not even that.  You can't send files.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not holding a candle to my trillion.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, who do you want to own the world?  MSN, AOL, Yahoo, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But one good thing, though, is using the Jabra backend for the client.  It is using Jabra.  Right.  Which is cool.  That is based upon an open source effort, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hopefully.  It's a non-standard Jabra in the sense that you can't do Jabra to Jabra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it works with the trillion.  I can log in.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's why it works with IBM.  You have to have Trillion Pro or Trillion Plus to do the Jabra client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it works with other third-party clients, but you can't do direct Jabra.  Jabra is supposed to do some server-to-server point-to-point thing that it can't do.  I don't know.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  The reason it first bothered me is I wanted to be online with Google Talk, except I use  multiple Gmail accounts.  So if I wanted to log out of one Gmail account and switch over to the other, then it screws  with the Google Talk.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was weird how it automatically added friends to your list for you.  It does?  That you had been chatting with over Gmail.  Oh, yeah.  It's supposed to watch you.  It watches your Gmail activity and adds your friends automatically.  It was weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a setting for that, though.  There is.  I think when you installed it, too, there was a checkbox to have it not do that if you  didn't want to.  I just clicked Next, Next, Next.  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the value add that Google can offer, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The VoIP technology is from where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Global?  Global IP sound.  If you go into Gtalk and then do a Help About, it'll say it right there.  Ah, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve's looking for some form of super high quality.  You know, it stands to reason.  I do the radio show over ISDN using one 64 kilobit channel.  That's enough for CD quality audio, for high quality AAC audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but the ISDN line is a nice solid point-to-point connection.  It's perfect.  There's no latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  There's no...  Zero lossage.  Yeah.  But it stands to reason that if I have a 6 megabit connection, that I should be able to  somewhat duplicate that.  So Steve's been looking for something that will do this.  Yeah, but you're talking about going over the cloud.  Well, I understand, but the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The internet, for those of you who don't understand what I'm talking about.  If I only need 64 good kilobits...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over the rainbow.  It seems like I should be able to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it all depends on which way your packets get routed or if you have any quality  of service, any QoS guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, with Skype and other VoIP clients we've messed with, it seems like once you get above  three people in the conversation, that's where things really start to break down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's because of the upstream bandwidth cap.  That's what really kills us.  It works well at this...  It's still...  Yeah, it sounds good.  We've got three right now.  It's as good as anything.  Sounds good.  One of the reasons it works in here is because I have 768 up.  And so the more up you have, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you go business class DSL with that?  Oh, you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DSL Extreme.  I'm considering upgrading my own.  And the Co is practically next door.  It's like out in the block.  That helps too.  Yeah, it helps a lot.  So, but Steve, have you found...  I mean, we found this one thing in England which is extremely expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Called Audio TX.  And the problem is it uses just a TCP transport instead of using a UDP transport,  which is really what you want.  So they're going over TCP, meaning that they do introduce some deliberate delay  in the connection to allow the underlying TCP transport to do the error correction  and create the reliable connection for you.  But I did experiment with it because they have a demo mode that runs for anywhere  between five and 30 minutes and then it just drops your connection.  And it sounds spectacular.  But Leo, what you and I did yesterday I thought was completely acceptable using Google Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll keep doing that for you and me because there's only two of us  and it works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's strange.  I would think if you went TCP that would be worse.  I mean, I understand the error correction, but if a problem does occur...  If you get an ACK, if you don't get the ACK, you have to re-send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's where you get all sorts of problems.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so in fact, I brought Global IP Sound up and I have been on this site  in the last couple of days.  So I rummaged around and I found them when I was doing the searching.  So in the case of TCP, if you don't mind some latency between the endpoints,  then this thing was using MP3 compression instead of a lower bitrate codec.  And that was really why it was working so well.  Oh, and I forgot to say that we were running at 320kbits.  Instead of, for example, right now we're at about 46.  Because I'm monitoring the bandwidths that we're using for Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What most of these guys are doing is, assuming a bad network,  they're trying to improve the compression to the point where  you don't need a perfect connection.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  In fact, you and I have a different goal, Leo.  I would like to have a studio quality connection to you  for the purpose of recording these MP3s.  Well, it's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just buy an ISDN line and a $7000 codec and you're set.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whereas the goal of most people is just to have a free connection  where you can understand the other person.  It's a different.  And it's working.  I mean, here we are with Skype and it works great with Google Talk too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, the last, at least for a while, I think the last Skype twit.  Because next week we're going to be live at the Apple Store at One Stockton.  I'm saying it again.  I just want to make sure somebody shows up.  I'm definitely afraid we're going to go there and there's not going to be anybody there.  That's September 4th, 4 o'clock at the Apple Store at One Stockton.  And then following that at Noonan's Bar and Grill.  I know people show up because they've got booze.  And no, Patrick, I didn't get a deal with them to get the free booze.  I'm sorry.  I've got all the black coffee you can drink though.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How about that?  Well, it's the miracle of a $5 to $20 tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can usually get all the black coffee you can drink.  It sounds like you need some right now.  Go have a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll just top shelf lemon drops you order that I'm afraid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I figured, you know, Dvorak's so worried that it's going to be a dull.  He says it's going to be like a CES panel.  It's going to be dull because we're all sitting there.  I think if we just get everybody drunk, it won't be anything like a dull CES panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worked for Dignation.  Yeah, and it's worked for that meetup that we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't drunk, but everybody else was a little hammered off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be a really funny lineup.  What does each individual member drink?  Lemon drops.  Lemon drops for you, 40s for Kevin.  No, no, no, no.  Are you saying you affect the 40s only for the broken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, well, these 40s are a little...  He's not a malt liquor guy. He's a beer guy.  Yeah, I like beer. I like a good Chimay red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll get you some of this dipsy barley wine.  It's supposed to be very good. Old dipsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said it's really strong stuff, like 8-9%.  Yeah, yeah.  I like that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The term barley wine doesn't appeal to me, but I'll have to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Devorak's going to drink Bordeaux. We know that.  Steve, you've got to come up for this.  I can't bear it that you're not going to be able to be part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prager's a white wine guy, right, Dave?  You might get me into it.  Good, good.  I'm cool with that.  Wine coolers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wine coolers.  So in the vitals...  I personally prefer Zima.  Zima?  No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  Who drinks that?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  12-year-olds. What the stuff is on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, the first...  It's aimed at people who are 21.01.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first alcohol I got drunk off of was Zima.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Boone's Farm Strawberry Ripple.  They don't have this anymore, but they used to have this candy-flavored wine, basically,  which is clearly aimed at kids.  Like box wine?  No, it was strawberry ripple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like deliberately candy-flavored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, Steve. You're roughly my age.  I don't remember Boone's Farm and Ripple.  Oh, yeah.  It's still available.  Apple, apple, something or other.  Yeah, they still make schnapps and some horrible flavors,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  which are totally for the entry-level student drinker.  It's got to be aimed at children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's something to drink to teenagers in college.  I think it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Who are the biggest consumers of alcohol in this country?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just read a study that they're almost all binge drinkers, by the way.  Did you see that?  People that drink what?  Young drinker, underage drinking.  Well, that makes sense.  You don't sip a glass of wine.  You're there for one reason only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they just have a term for the activity that's been going on forever.  It's always been binge drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the biggest problem is you look at all of the great beer ads  of the last 30 years for all aimed at teenagers.  It's not like somebody's going to move to Stroh's when they've been drinking.  Oh, yeah, they want to hook you young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  What you start with is what you're going to die with.  Same thing with cigarettes.  That's why Joe Camel.  In the biting the hand that feeds us department,  Elliott Spitzer, the attorney general, literally feeds us.  Elliott Spitzer, the attorney general for New York,  and the guy who's by the way running for governor,  has won a judgment against America online for $1.25 million  because it was so hard to cancel AOL.  And you know what they found out?  What happens is there were about 300 consumer complaints to his office.  They did an inquiry.  They found that the company had been rewarding employees  for quote saving subscribers who called in to cancel.  Saving them from themselves.  So what it was doing was giving these employees incentives  to just ignore the cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was social engineering from their side.  You have to go through like three or four different hoops  to finally cancel your membership.  And they would offer free months.  They would do all this to try and keep you.  And that's a problem.  If they offer you a couple months, you're like, oh, I might keep this around.  And then you forget to cancel it, of course, after two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have on my credit card bill probably five or six things  that just automatically renew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you just forget about it.  My gym membership in LA right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right. You're still paying for a gym you can't use.  And that's why the whole plan behind the TWIT monthly donation is that people will,  you know, it's two bucks.  You're going to forget that, right?  Just keep paying it for the rest of their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have an EarthLink account I've been trying to kill off for I think 10 months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm embarrassed to say I had a Prodigy account that I signed up for  when I worked for the site in 1997 that I canceled only a year ago.  And I literally never used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Prodigy still exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a down payment on a nice used card.  We support our industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never, ever used it.  Yeah, well, it kept getting sold.  Somebody else owned it.  I'd get these letters in the mail saying, congratulations,  your Prodigy account is now dime a dozen ISP.  It's an SPC now.  SPC?  Yeah, that's right.  I got Yahoo.  And I never used it.  And finally I called.  And they said, what's your password?  I said, you're kidding.  I set this up in 1997.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, David, you were telling me the other day about your Netflix account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  As soon as I moved from San Francisco to LA,  I stopped using my Netflix account because I didn't have an address.  I didn't know what my new address would be.  And I just kept getting charged.  I haven't ordered a Netflix movie in a year.  And I give them 20 bucks a month every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now I've got to find them.  They're like put up in stores somewhere.  I've got to find those three movies so I can start getting new ones  if I want to use my Netflix account again.  Or you can just pay 20 bucks.  Yeah, I know.  They don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't mind at all.  You can cost them four bucks or something.  TiVo turns a profit for the first time.  Yay.  Too late.  Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, especially now that they're talking about putting ads on the screen  when you fast forward through commercials.  Bye-bye, TiVo.  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they've already been doing that to some degree

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with pre-cashing commercial content.  And then whenever that commercial will pop up on TV,  you'll get the little thumbs up thing in the corner saying  if you want more information, push thumbs up right now.  And it'll play that commercial that's already stored on the TiVo.  Yeah, because you could ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They made, get this, revenues of $46 million last quarter,  they made $240,000.  Hey, it's positive, though.  It's better than losing $10 million,  which is what they did the quarter before or the year before.  I think, frankly, now, I have to say,  I'm starting to see more and more guys who are of a certain tech savviness  dump all of that stuff, even maybe dump the cable  and start watching shows off BitTorrent.  And that's basically how they get their TV.  I mean, don't you think that's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's me.  That's IPTV.  I just moved into my new place, and the roommates got the cable boxes.  I was the only one who did not get the cable box.  You don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't need it.  Every show that you want to watch,  if it's not a good show, you can't, I mean,  you're not going to download Will and Grace.  Oh, you could.  You could, though.  But you're not.  But all the cult stuff that we like, like Firefly,  yeah, actually Will and Grace is a bad example,  that's a funny show, but like Firefly and Lost and Weeds,  those things are all on BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're up before you can get them.  Yeah.  Because we're on the West Coast, they air on the East Coast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they encode them, they post them, and then you can get them on there.  Well, I'm blown away because it airs on the East Coast.  And then commercials out, puts it up before you can watch it here.  And they capture the HD version,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so you get a better quality than I would be getting.  I'm blown away that many people have these HD capture cards.  So my question is, now by the way,  I should underscore that this is illegal.  Okay, who cares?  So my question is, what's illegal?  What I would, I don't know.  Nothing we've referred to here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it aired publicly anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I would, oh, that's, well, yeah, but that doesn't count.  It's still copyright material.  Yeah.  Just because it was on the airwaves doesn't mean anything.  That doesn't protect it.  So it's copyrighted.  What I would like is something like a Mac Mini, a little thing,  that I could somehow easily control and program to download these torrents.  You know, a media device that's torrent-focused.  Has anybody done something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sort of a torrent cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A torrent that I could just, you know, I don't want a TiVo.  I don't have a cable.  I don't get any TV into my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about like a Myth TV or anything like that?  No, no, because I don't have cable.  Okay, so you want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to be able to put this on, plug it into the ethernet,  and I want some easy way to control it so that I could say,  you know, I don't know what's running a Xurius with a script or whatever,  but I could say these are the shows I want.  It would be nice if I had a grid, a TiVo-like grid on that thing.  These are the shows I want.  And then I want to play back to...  I want Myth TV, but I don't want it to be getting it from the cable.  Right.  I want it to be downloadable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want it to be coming over Patrick's cloud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want it coming from the cloud.  Has anybody done that?  There's an RSS plugin for it.  Next system.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a great, great topic.  As long as we don't go to jail for it, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, how could you get around it?  Well, there's plenty of legal BitTorrents.  So just say it's for...  Don't guys do this for Battlestar.  This is...  No, you call it the Battlestar Galactica media player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the problem is there's no consistent naming conventions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's why you have an interface to trackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Xurius allows you to put in keywords and things like that  that it can look for and then pull down BitTorrent files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's another problem is that the MPAA just sued a whole bunch of BitTorrent users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have that fixed too, because I'm using the iPhantom,  which is...  The cable modem goes into that and then my router goes in the iPhantom.  And that sends an encrypted...  It scrambles it.  It's encrypted IPsec to their servers and then anonymizes it.  So you don't know who I am.  I look like I'm iPhantom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also seeing a lot of sites now offering the MagnetLink,  the decentralized Vizoresk tracker, which is another option too.  You're not using a tracking site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The truth is, in the long run, I don't want to do this for illegal purposes.  What I'm hoping is this is the way IPTV might play out.  I'd like to get the system.  I'd like to get Battlestar Galactica, which is offered legally as a BitTorrent,  or whatever people decide to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say Comcast offered a service where you'd install an application.  You could choose the shows that you want and then pay per show.  Sure, I'd do that.  Right to your PC. Would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as the PC is hooked up to the TV in the living room, right?  What you really want is a remote control interface on the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, isn't that their in-demand service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it kind of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then you stop to pay the monthly...  I mean, they don't offer all the shows fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a one-time fee. No, it's not all the shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say an a la carte way of...  Right, exactly. Just the channels you want to buy.  It's common.  And there's free stuff. That's what I like.  I think there's going to be more and more free stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Battlestar Galactica is legally distributed as a BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my understanding. I think it was Galactica that did this.  They put up the one or two episodes, didn't they?  They don't do it regularly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. They did a couple. I think they did two episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then I'll be honest with you. Quality wasn't all that great.  And it was in 4x3, it wasn't even the widescreen version.  They would be very smart to do this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because I don't think it hurts your television audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So basically, yeah, that's the interesting question.  So is the television industry and broadcast and cable going to be as smart, ha ha ha,  as the RIA was in eventually moving their content to an online distributed legal media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I certainly hope they're smart enough to do that,  and that it will happen for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is commercial support,  because we're always fast-forwarding through the commercials anyway.  And as you guys said, the shows are being captured and commercials edited out,  because no one wants to sit through that.  I'll pay a buck a show.  It takes 60 minutes and drops it down to 40, because it's one-third commercial now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It surprised me how many vendors I talk to in the industry,  especially display industries, that they're talking about now,  moving back to radio for advertising,  because they know everyone who watches TV is usually using a PBR device to fast-forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, good, because everybody listening to radio is now listening to podcasts.  That's true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Or XM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you guys were talking about having your credit cards bled slowly,  I was reminded that I've got three or four XM receivers that I'm licensed to use,  but I never listen to.  There you go.  There's another one.  Serious, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think podcasts are going to ...  Here's another example of stupid TV executive tricks.  There's a family guy in a Simpsons podcast.  I thought, oh, Fox is brilliant.  They're doing podcasts of the family guy in Simpsons,  and you'd think they'd put the show audio or put a clip.  What do they do?  They have some moron reading a show's synopsis with all the jokes taken out.  What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I subscribed to it.  I saw the family guy on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, all right.  Even if it only had 10 minutes, you would love it, right?  I know.  Just a 10-minute clip.  You wouldn't not watch the show.  It would make you watch the show.  Yeah, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You say, I've got to see that show.  Family Guy is one of my favorite animated series.  Maybe it's a right ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The kids watch it, and I have to stop them.  It's so foul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's so much worse now.  I mean, not worse, bad, but ...  So foul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I love it.  It's not foul on a South Park level, but ...  No.  No, but it's ...  It's not the kids, Leo.  It is funny.  11 and 13, they love it.  It's exactly at their level, but I don't want them to start thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then they didn't know what Peter was talking about when he wanted to play the waiting game?  Oh, that was the worst one.  I don't know what he's talking about.  I don't even know if that should belong on this podcast either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, those who know will be appalled, and the rest of us are just completely clueless.  That was hardcore.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just not cool unless you watch Family Guy.  Kids know it.  It's a very funny show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kids know it, and they love it.  Oh, you can get that on BitTorne either.  Well, see, we don't ... Well, that's it.  We don't watch it, but we don't BitTorne either.  We just rent the DVDs, because the first few seasons are out on DVD, but it gets worse.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The latest season in Muslim is hardcore.  Are they still on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still on.  I guess it must be.  They wouldn't be ...  Oh, yeah.  Adult swim, baby.  Here's an example of a bad idea, though.  They could really do well.  Maybe it's a rights issue.  Maybe they don't have the actor's rights to use the actor's voices or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many terabytes, sir?  19, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a quiz for you.  What comes after terabyte?  Petabyte.  And then?  Yadabyte.  Nope.  Exabyte, then yadabyte.  No, is it exabyte, then zadabyte?  Then yadabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the yadabyte.  Yada, yada, yadabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's gigabyte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is no gigabyte or jigawag.  That does not exist.  So, but I think people for a while did say, sometimes said gigabyte instead of gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it gif or jif?  I say gif.  I say gif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it could be jif.  Uh-oh.  I say jif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, have you seen how for measurements, though, for storage, they're impressing upon, at least  in the international community, did not say kilo because kilo equals 1,000.  And it should be kibi for 1024.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because it's binary, not digital.  Yeah.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about just make it even more confusing for people, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kibble than bits.  Kibble.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kibble than bits.  Kibby bites.  Kibby bites.  Instead of saying kilo, kibi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to mute Patrick.  I can't figure out how to do it.  Oh, well, sorry.  It's kind of funny.  You better not.  You'll push the wrong button.  I know.  I will.  Now I'm using this stupid lady mouse and I can't right-click.  I can't left-click now.  I can only right-click.  The whole thing is like stupid.  Is that the name of the Apple mouse?  Yeah.  They licensed it.  There's not enough feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you don't know that you're really doing the right button.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem is I always have both fingers, even when I'm doing the right button, on at  the same time.  And you have to consciously do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to consciously lift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so it's a proximity sensor?  Yeah.  It senses your finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  It's a typical over-engineered solution for a perfectly good product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds cool on paper.  You don't need it.  It's overkill.  You know that sounds cool, though, when they came up with the idea.  It's like, oh, proximity sensors for your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's a little piezoelectric speaker in it to make click sounds.  It's just talk about over-engineered.  It's just a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If somebody wears their headphones 90% of the time, I'm using a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the audio also gives you a little mechanical feedback, too.  Oh, OK.  I mean, because it's clicking, it kind of feels like there's some mechanical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you guys tried the new G5 laser mouse from Logitech?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the one where you can put the weights in it?  Yes.  That's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, that's a mighty mouse.  That's the ultimate gamer gift right there, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you've got a serious gamer on your list, go pick some up.  What makes it so good?  Customers.  One is you can weight the mouse in any of the four corners.  Wow.  They include a little set of weights, which are pretty cute looking, actually.  But the cool thing is just that laser pickup.  It's 20 times more accurate, they claim.  And I believe it, than their previous LED-based optical sensor system.  Who makes it?  This isn't the Logitech one, is it?  It works better on more problematic surfaces, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Logitech.  It reminds me of the Pinewood Derby, like you put in little weights in the thing.  Holy.  You drill out the bottom of your Pinewood card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still have my card.  Yeah, I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pinewood Derby was awesome.  I got third place, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm proud of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My son got second place and went to the semifinals, but then we lost to some...  Yeah, there's always a kid...  Did you do the dad's one, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the dads can make one, too.  Right.  Well, the dads end up making them anyway.  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, no, you're making it.  His looked like a kid made it.  And then there's some that have enamel and they're varnished.  They look like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there were supposed to be weight requirements.  There are.  Were there not?  Okay, because the guy who ended up winning the one at ours, he must have had like 15  lag bolts bolted just screwed into the wood on the back.  They must have weighed four pounds.  They weigh just like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a careful weighing at the beginning.  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  But you can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I got screwed.  Can you still use graphite?  Yeah, they used to use graphite on the wheels.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is where graphite...  Powder graphite, baby.  I even shaved off those little nubs on the plastic wheels on the inside that touched.  So it wouldn't reduce friction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so funny that you guys remember that so vividly.  I guess my son will too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you do the little regatta?  No, we haven't done that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fun.  Let me ask you, when is that Windows Vista editorial panel that you guys are going to do?  When is that?  Is that already done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was actually on the 26th, but we do have...  If you go up to the Digital Life TV website, we've got a link to the video I did, which  is a quick walkthrough, taking a look at Arrow and Glass and some of the security features  that are in there.  Can you give us a summary?  The biggest thing people are going to notice is the new Arrow design, the Glass interface  or the Glass edition, which is essentially adding transparencies to the interface.  Pretty Windows.  And then the user account protections, which is stuff you can lock down gaming and you  can lock down access.  But the biggest thing is if you turn the security on, which is actually a pretty intelligent  thing to do, anything that would normally require an administrator level account to  install, it will request you to type your password in.  So, anytime you're installing new software or any of that stuff, it's actually a brilliant  addition.  I will be curious to see whether or not they ship that turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what keeps Apple's OS X safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, it means you can now usefully use Windows without being the admin account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's key.  And that really, I think that is the bottom line about why Windows is currently insecure.  Is it because everybody runs an administrator and it never asks for permission when it's  modifying the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so it will be interesting to see what the final version of that looks like.  It's got a lot of potential.  So, tell me what Arrow is and what Glass is.  I've heard you say this.  What are you talking about?  Arrow is essentially the new design.  So, that's the new graphical design for Windows Vista.  Yeah, essentially.  It's their version of Aqua.  I think Glass is just the transparencies that are employed.  So, you can see a fuzzy version of the window that's behind the window on the very edges  of the frame.  Alpha channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So far, they've got nothing new that OS X hasn't had for 30 years.  Go ahead, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty much my reaction to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you guys like these transparent windows where you can see through the whole surface  of the window?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just annoying.  A lot of Linux users do that, though.  They love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as you have full control over the level of transparency, I find there's always  a certain point where your eye is okay with it, but if it's not transparent enough or  if it's too light, it's either annoying or useless.  I end up turning it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talked about who is it that was going to, as you're using the computer, if you  don't use a window for a while, it kind of fades out in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're already doing that in Word in Office 2003.  The toolbars fade away.  It's the most annoying thing ever.  It's typical Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like those self-customizing menus.  Yeah, the personalized menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You always have to click the little double down arrow to get the rest of the items on  the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a father's knows best attitude.  By the way, Apple has it, too.  Look at the one button mouse.  For some reason, these technology companies just don't trust users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, I think it's that the companies have run out of things to do.  So they're just adding features to make another version number to move everybody up and get  some more revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now with new disappearing menus.  Watch that.  Guess where your document went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is nothing new to the tech industry.  No, no, it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you really want to see the contents in this folder?  You don't recommend you change any history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Given how far graphics technologies come, I'm glad to see operating systems at least  incorporating the basics of some of that power, hopefully.  You know, if you're going to make it look pretty, you might as well take it the entire way  and utilize the power of the latest hardware that's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of disagree.  I kind of think that keep it simple and use the power when it's appropriate in a game or,  you know, but let's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying just add fluff for fluff's sake, but you know what?  If I can have well done transparency that, you know, doesn't say requires a Pentium 4  and half a gig of RAM in order to operate properly, which at this point, that's pretty much  every system sold.  Right, right.  It's just it's kind of nice just to see that we've gotten to that point.  Granted, I kind of miss the old days of, you know, DOS, but that's what Linux is for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a little UI sugar is fine, but it's just, you know, I mean, you got to do it subtly  and appropriately.  It's an aesthetic.  Look, it's aesthetics.  And I guess the best thing to do would be let users do what they want, right?  Customize it, make it easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Customizability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll also be interesting to see whether or not people adopt to the whole shared.  Yeah, they basically put share in every folder window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as they put sunny in every folder window, I'm okay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was this deal about the peer-to-peer sharing being turned on by default so the computers,  so that these new machines were trying to connect to other ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I presume that these are beta features that they will have the good sense not to ship.  That would be just nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen any of that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that some of their Avalanche stuff?  Have they started to incorporate any of Avalanche into the OS?  No, because pretty much all the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have some sort of peer networking technology that they said was also briefly on in the early XP,  but they decided not to include it.  But it's now back in Vista, and it's turned on in these betas,  so that the beta machines are like looking for other beta Vista boxes  and hooking up and creating a peer network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it for quality feedback or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's like they think that peer-to-peer is going to be a next generation important technology,  and they want to build it into the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I kind of agree with that.  I mean, just kind of headless peer-to-peer, just for peer-to-peer's sake, makes no sense.  If you've got a task to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Leo, it'll be using universal plug and play to reprogram the NAT routers  and poke holes through our security in order to find other machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think of ZeroConf, which is what Apple calls it rendezvous,  and then they called it bonjour because somebody else had rendezvous.  And by the way, it's not avalanche, it's avalanche.  Just making sure you get that right.  What do you think of ZeroConf, Steve? Is that dangerous?  You know about ZeroConf. Is that dangerous?  I think it seems like a good thing.  I think it makes a lot of sense as long as you restrict it to the LAN

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and don't let it go out over the WAN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you plug in a ZeroConf printer, you don't have to install anything.  Absolutely. It works great.  It's totally cool.  Yeah. So that's right. Keep it to the LAN only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they ought to do something clever, like make all the packets that are emitted  have a TTL of two or three so that the packets can't,  nothing can keep the packet alive as it tries to go out on external routers.  What a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's enough time to transverse your LAN,  but nowhere near enough time to go out to the NAT.  What a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And no one does that. It's like so simple.  Did you think of that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would go patent that right now.  Short TTLs.  Do you see a Microsoft employee brought a virus back to Redmond from Malaysia?  Measles. That's the virus.  I love that. Really?  The King County Health Bulletin says,  the infected person visited the following areas,  Malay Satay Hut in Redmond,  Thai Ginger in Redmond,  the Microsoft Redmond campus and the Microsoft cafeteria.  And they give the times and dates that the guy went there.  So if you were there, go get your measles shot.  This is the problem with offshoring workers.  Bring back measles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was probably there to pick up the latest beta of Vista  and bring it back to Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That could very well be.  Okay, one last story then we got to go because we're running out of time.  Halo, Universal.  They've signed a deal with Microsoft to do the Halo movie.  Master Chief, the backstory.  Exactly.  I think that Joshua Brentano should sign a deal with them to do the jumping trucks trick that he figured out.  I hope it's a good movie.  You remember that guy?  Yeah.  That was the funniest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You take all the little warthogs, you drive them around so they're all facing each other.  What do you do? You launch a rocket into it or something?  They do this...  Parallel.  So this is all live action though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a Doom movie coming out with The Rock.  Have you seen that?  The only thing that gives me hope for this Halo movie,  it's written by the guy who did 28 Days Later.  Wasn't that a great movie?  Oh, yes.  It was a zombie movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, a bunch of us sat down and we tried to list one movie based on a video game that didn't suck.  They've all sucked.  So maybe this is the one that turns it around.  Final Fantasy.  I'm not holding my breath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, not only suck, but some of the worst movies of all time.  Lara Croft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think of the product placement opportunities for Microsoft.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Master Chief dolls. Master Chief head gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of which, real quick, I know we got to go,  but I just saw a list for the top hacker slash computer movies.  And I want to know what you guys think.  Let's do it.  Okay, so we got hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before you say it, let's come up with our votes.  So hackers would be in there. War Games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me give you the list so you know all the options  because there might be something you forgot about.  It's a big list.  Okay, hackers, sneakers, War Games, Antitrust, Swordfish,  the original Mission Impossible, well, not the 1996 Mission Impossible,  13th Floor, Code Hunter, Enemy of the State, Lawn Mower Man,  the Net, Track Down, which is Takedown, Tron, Net Force, Matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's only two in there that are count, Matrix and War Games.  That's it.  Tron, baby.  I loved hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tron is a great movie.  Oh, wait, wait, Pirates of Silicon Valley.  That's a pretty good one.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hackers, you buy Robert Redford as a hacker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was still good for the title.  No, no, no, no, no, you're thinking of sneakers.  That's what I'm thinking of, sneakers.  That's what I'm thinking of, sneakers.  Yeah, sneakers was the property for hackers.  Hackers was Angela Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least with War Games, they had Matthew Broderick using a dial-up modem.  Oh, wasn't that great?  That was awesome.  That, now, if you watch that movie now, it's a period piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's it.  He had an IMSAI computer and he had a 300-baud modem.  Yep.  He put the cups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Transcript:  Oh, the good old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm telling you.  We had the director of that on the screensavers.  Remember that?  Good one?  Was it John Badham?  Who directed that?  I've forgotten.  It was John Badham.  He came in and he had the photo book that he had from it and it was just really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Kevin, what's the result of the voting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't seen the poll yet.  This is just a list.  Where is this?  I don't think they have the...  Will you dig this for us so we can all vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's actually on the...  John Badham, yep.  Short Circuit.  John Badham, yeah.  Short Circuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He did Red Dawn, right?  Yeah.  Most realistic scenario or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  I just dug it so you can find it at dig.com slash user slash Kevin Rose.  When he digs it, it stays dug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Done.  What?  I would say War Games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my favorite.  Matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  War Games is my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  War Games is my favorite.  Oh, the Matrix has to be the top of the list.  The Net.  The Matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's been unfortunately destroyed...  The Net.  Is that Sandra Bullock?  Yeah, I was terrible.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Unfortunately, Matrix's memory is tarnished by the sequels.  Yeah, best trilogy ever.  Don't you remember...  Oh, they cheesed out at the end.  I'll take that to my grave.  I still haven't seen the second and third because I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, don't do it.  Yeah, it'll spoil it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't you remember the feeling...  Well, see, I saw it before anybody.  I didn't know what I was seeing.  Neither did I.  Don't you remember the feeling walking out of the theater going, oh my God, that was  the greatest movie I've ever seen.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My friends were like, let's go see this movie.  I go, oh, I don't want to go see The Matrix.  What is this stupid trap?  Yes, stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't you read?  But it was a fantastic idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's it.  The Matrix really is a Matrix.  I mean, that...  I'll never have that movie.  But the whole thing is, how do you really know?  That was a great feeling.  You don't know.  It is a construct.  The whole world is a construct.  Of course it is.  Oh, it's a great song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even remember that now.  When the credits play?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, it's too bad they did the sequels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  trilogy.  The next Indiana Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one, the first trilogy, the second trilogy?  The first trilogy, the second trilogy.
