It's time for TWiT Episode 165 and we are going to talk tech  today with John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog. John's going to talk to you again. Sorry I missed  you last week but we are glad to get you back sir. Glad to get you back after last week I don't know.  It was terrible. Horrible. I doubt it. I don't even remember. I just say that. You know it's like a  comic. Oh the audience last night. They were awful. They didn't laugh at anything. Also with us one of  my favorite raspberry crazy ants Mr. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle who now has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  power. That's right. That's right. After 11 days of not having power after Ike. Wow. We got it back  about 11 days afterwards. It was hell. How does that affect a geek like you? Well you cling to  your you cling to your iPhone. And your guns and religion. Yeah I was going to say this. That's  right. And when you and when you could find a plug that has power you plug all of your gadgets  into it. Charge. There's a big mall here called the Galleria and people were going up to the  Galleria and finding the plugs where the cleaning crews plug in their their vacuums and cleaning  machines and plugging in their notebooks. There are people saying they were camping out in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Galleria. Is this because the why did the Galleria have power but not residences? The way the power

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  company here restored power they went to kind of the key areas first. So the medical center,  the big commerce centers got restored power first and they kind of worked out. And the  Galleria was one of the areas that they brought up right away. Because everybody needs to shop in a  disaster. Yeah absolutely. Very important. But my wife learned to cook omelets on our gas fireplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my god. I was proud of. So we have a gas stove. So we'd be okay I guess with that. But still.  That's the big main broke. It's very yeah it's very scary and we're going to have a big quake

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right John? And you know when the big quakes hit I don't know how much you're affected up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  where you are. I think it's not much. Oh no no no we're we're actually near the San Andreas Fault  here. But we're on our house is on bedrock but the Twick Cottage will actually sink below the surface

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of the sea because we're on landfill here. Oh well bedrock is of course the way to go. Oh yeah.  I mean most a lot of people don't realize that most of San Francisco is on bedrock and when they  have a big quake it doesn't damage a lot. And the big quake in the 1906 was from the problem was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the fire. It wasn't the quake so much. On the last quake in 89 I was up on on the on quite the hill  where Quayt Tower is and nothing. And but you go down to of course the marina which is based on  it's basically the entire marina district of San Francisco is built on the foundation of ships  that were sunk after the gold rush. And mud. And mud. And so when it shakes it liquefies and you  just sink into it. So it's a it's a anyway I you know we're all facing horrible disasters before  the show we were talking about epidemics plagues. Do you ever read Gina Colada's book The Coming  Plague? There's a there's a cheery fireside book. Her premises we are on a brief. I ordered that  book and got a pina colada so I just said it. No Gina Colada. It's a it's a their premises that we  are on a brief very short temporal interim in which we're you know winning the war against  bacteria but you know it's going to come back the way it was before and and we're all going to die

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  basically. Well you know maybe it wouldn't come back the way it did before if these pharmaceutical  companies were working on antibacterial measures rather than various things like Cialis and Viagra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the ads on TV. It's all for erectile dysfunction. Yeah. We're all going to be very  sick but very horny. If yeah well never mind I'm not going to make any jokes about four hours. I  just I just I kind of I'm with you. I think you know maybe we're all a little bit gloomy a little  bit glum because the economy is just not you know looking too good. But an interesting post and I  know you you remarked on this in your tech blog at the Houston Chronicle Dwight. Interesting post.  I think it was in the New York Times saying maybe that the tech industry will miss  this particular bust. What why are we not we're going to see a little bit this week.  Apple's results will come out. Google's results though came out last week and we're very positive.  What's the story? Is the tech bust going to hit or are we going to dodge a bullet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I think you know one of the things that there were actually two stories in the New York Times.  One of them focused on on Apple saying that Apple is maybe able to avoid a burn from the recession.  The other story talked in general about the whole electronics industry saying that this is the kind  of thing that people cut back on. That you know they don't buy iPods. They don't buy high end  cell phones. They don't buy the kind of things that are considered luxuries. But at the same time  you know the next day they had a story that said Apple may not face it because it plays to a  completely different niche market. And one of the things that interests me here is just exactly how  much this the economic downturn what we've seen on Wall Street actually affects real people day to  day. I think people react psychologically. They quit spending and that kind of pulls back on the  economy because the economy is consumer driven. And so the electronics industry ends up getting  hurt. So if people just kind of ignored it and just said yeah those wacky folks on Wall Street  and just kept doing what they do will the economy survive? I'll tell you where it is going to hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're already seeing this is in all of these web 2.0 startups that are venture capital  based but have no revenue. Because they they're going to lose their funding. They're just going  to have to close their doors. Didn't we kind of see this on the on the bubble John? I mean kind of.  I mean that's what happened right? Is that sorry no more money see ya. Yeah no there were guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that were cut off right in the middle of it after you know they already announced they got the 30.  You know you don't necessarily with a lot of these deals get a check for 20 million dollars when you're  funded. You can get you know they said we're funding you for 20 million dollars and then they  start to dole out the money so it's keep you from spending. And at any point this happened to Red  Gorilla. Who? I don't even remember them. Red Gorilla they had this huge building downtown San  Francisco and it was like it was one of those you know personal management you know PIM. Right. And  kind of in the cloud and kind of not. Anyway it they just pulled the money just at the right in  the middle of everything. The guys are doing fine. Everything was on track to what they would they  promised to do. It was they weren't like making any mistakes but the VCs just said you know don't  like what we're seeing. We're stopping. Your checks are not coming anymore and they had to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  literally close up like overnight. Wow. Twitter. About this time in 2000 October 17th I found a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  story on it. About this time. Right these things are cyclical. So in October it's always the bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  month. So Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey the guy who invented the concept. We don't know. Fired, quit,  Ed Williams taking over. This to me is a symptom of the beginning. Right. We're seeing companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lay people off. eBay lays off a thousand. Well in the case of Twitter Ev and Jack switch jobs.  So I'm not sure that that's what you think it is there. Well you know I'm not sure either. Someone's  got to be the chairman. Someone's got to be the CEO. But the CEO is running it day to day. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in a way it's a vote of no confidence for the way Jack was running it. And some say yeah  chairman that's you know first step on the way out. What do you think John? Are you following this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know unless you're there I don't think you can really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Completely true to Twitter form. They're not saying a thing. They're becoming the Soviet Union  of startups. I mean just we know what? What? No nothing happened. He does not. They did a blog  post. They did a blog post on it. Well but it was completely disinformational. Well it seems to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that at least the operation is still running and then as part of the news rundown that we have  today Brittany Spears. Oops I did it again. Has finally joined Twitter which was something we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talked about almost a year ago. What will happen when some big star finally goes on Twitter? Has

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anything happened? She's got about 1900 followers. It's not really her? It's her people. Well yeah  no you can read it and tell it's not her because it's written in the third person.  Is it twitter.com slash Brittany Spears? No curiously it's the real Brittany. Oh you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why? Because somebody's got look there's two posts on twitter.com slash Brittany Spears. One is  I think I'm going back to rehab and I can't remember any of this so that's  that's not that's not her. The real Brittany just like the real Dvorak huh? Yeah I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that was an homage to me. It is an homage to you. Over a million hits in 24 hours on the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brittany Spears.com you guys really are the best fans in the world. Well there is a reason to visit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Brittany Spears.com site because there's a couple they have a photo of her September cover  on Allure. Yeah. And you can see why this woman has just got to be the most amazing person. If  you're like a makeup artist or somebody who just likes to you know makeup women that have this kind  of semi-neutral face that could be made to look like anybody. It's true it doesn't look like her  does it? No it looks like some Italian hot you know like the you know some hot Italian actress  or something. She's still got the honker though. Yeah well you know I've seen that I've seen that  nose made up. The first time I started noticing this with her I was in Singapore and they had  these pictures of this gorgeous blonde woman without this big nose because it was you can make  a nose look bigger or smaller if you're really good makeup person. You know what John no one's looking at the nose.  So anyway the point is is that I said who that wow look at that is that some local woman it was  a like a mouse and they said no and the guy's matter of fact said no that's Brittany Spears and I  I swear to god if you saw this picture you would never recognize her in a million years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Well the makeup artist is an artist in this case created like a different thing on the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well actually the makeup artists real makeup artists are indeed artists it's astonishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what they can accomplish. Brittany now has a blog too not only is she on twitter she's got a blog  but you're right the blog's in third person as well. Oh is this the Allure cover? Oh yeah.  You're right because she's got brown hair. Yeah or black or whatever color it is. Yeah I'm seeing it now yeah.  Doesn't look anything like her. No no but but she looks good. Do you think she'll date me if I say  hi you know say hi to her on my twitter and and she gets a lot of followers? She I guarantee that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  she'll never hear from you. I'll never hear from her. One of her minions will get back to you maybe you'll have a fan that  picks it up and she'll mention it to Brittany and say hey you know there's Leo Laporte's got all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people and he said hi and she'll go who? Yeah who is exactly what she'll say or past the bong.  There's Stephen Fry I'm much more interested in the fact that he's on  twitter's and by the way he's he's twittering from his African adventures which I think is very cool  and there's also a John Cleese or maybe it's John Cleese it's in Africa right? Well he's been on  he's been on twitter for a while hasn't he? Yeah I mean I think those are to me those are the  celebrities I'd much more be more interested in following. Yeah I know but this is  don't forget Hodgman. Hodgman we can't forget Hodgman absolutely. Yeah but these are all nerd

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  celebrities we're talking about mass market celebrities that could that could bring down  twitter if all these little girls who think Brittany's great all got twitter accounts even  though I don't you know it may not happen. I don't think they can that's the problem I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they know how. You might be right. MC Hammer's on twitter hey. You know Hammer is actually Hammer.  Hammer's like not there's not his people he's doing it you could tell. Right yep.  Cleese I think Cleese is you know okay so Hodgman's got 12,000 followers. Cleese has 7,000  followers. Stephen Fry 7,000 followers. Brittany 2,000 followers I don't know. She just started.  Brand new. Yeah give her time. Should I worry? Is she going to be the next Kevin Rose to eat my lunch?  It's Kevin Rose that should be worried. That's right I'm not I'm not you know who's almost  almost I think he's almost at a thousand now as Obama. You mean a hundred thousand. I mean what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  did I say a thousand? A hundred thousand absolutely. So you know there's one way to to challenge her  Leo how do you look in black hair in a push-up bra? Oh you've never seen anything like it that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all I'm gonna say and you never gonna. Yo Obama's now 101,000 almost 102,000. That's that see and  and Twitter's responding very well to this. I don't think the question anymore is can Twitter  scale? I think the question is can Twitter monetize? Is there a way to make money out of this thing?  Because if it's not I think they're going to stop getting funding at some point. They've promised a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  business plan in 2009. It may be too late. No you know the thing is with these kinds of numbers it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pretty hard to turn your back on it. I guess so you couldn't you wouldn't shut something down that's  this successful. What are the numbers now? Does anybody know what the numbers really are? Nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  knows. There are last numbers I saw published was 2.2 million that was in July. Yeah I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  around three now. There are sites that you know try to track everybody. A day? No no members total.  Oh members oh I'm gonna post a day I wonder. You know what I think Jack said something when he came  to bear hug camp. I think it was 60 let's see they they will give you a feed there's like an  academic research feed that has I think 600 posts a minute and that's a small that's a fraction of  the total. So it is you know it's probably 100 posts a second to it. I don't know I mean nobody  knows because nobody you know Twitter's not telling. You can go to these sites that attempt to try like  twit dot twit dur dot com or twitter counter dot com. Twitter counter let me see how many people  they are currently following. They should have it here somewhere. I don't see it. Twitter I think  was three million people and these I think they just scraped the the site trying to find people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somehow I guess. But you can't do it that way. I mean that's not that's not anywhere near signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be but it would be better than just the total number right Dwight because you the total  numbers I mean that includes a lot of people sign up post posted once or never or never.  What you'd really want to know is how many active users there are isn't that what you care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So what do you think is Apple immune? I don't I don't think we know. I mean it depends  on kind of what kind of an economic downturn this is. If it's real and even people who have  the kind of money they want to spend on Apple computers decide they don't want to do it then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah it might. Apple announces this week not a $800 computer not a $900 $1000 their cheapest  laptop and they go up to like almost $3000 with a top of the line laptop in a way thumbing their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nose at the recession. Thumbing their nose and also kind of saying who they really are. I mean  they've decided that they I think with this announcement that they really are a company  that does premium products at premium prices you know they have been pushing  to get Windows users to switch and I think there's just so many Windows users who are  going to switch and spend more money for a Apple machine than they would for some of these cheap  Windows machines you could get and at some point that pool dries up. Oh and so growth is limited.  Growth is limited I think in terms of the switchers. I think you'll continue to see it I think there's  still some left but not much I don't think. Have either one of you seen the new Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ad the new Hodgman ad that it attacks the Microsoft ads which I've been waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no oh let's go apple.com slash switch. Yeah they just put these up. The ad for people out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there want to hear about it it goes as follows you got Hodgman sitting there with a big pile of money  and he's going and he's got and he's taking chunks of the money putting in this bigger pile  and he where he puts a pile of money in there says advertising and then he takes a little  bit of money puts it in Fix Vista another smaller and then the Macintosh guy says hey you know what  are you doing you know you're not going to you know you can't you're not going to be able to  Fix Vista with just that little pile when you get all that money go for advertising and Hodgman's  punch line is oh you're right and he takes all the money from Fix Vista and shoves it into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pile for advertising. No I have to say that let's play let's I gotta play it I gotta I'm sorry  Apple's gonna get a free ad. Oh I'm a Mac. I'm a PC advertising advertising advertising fix Vista

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advertising advertising. Fix Vista oh I'm just doing a little budgeting Mac you know with all  the Vista problems that have been frustrating PC users I have to take drastic action. By investing  in advertising. Yes advertising and I'm also putting something toward resolving Vista's problems. Do  you really think that amount of money is going to help fix Vista? I guess you're right yeah.  I'm just putting it all in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay that's brilliant and it's going to make Paul Therotte go ballistic.  He he already hates these ads he says they're taking unfair shots at Vista. Is Vista really that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so. Anybody want to defend it? I think if you're I think if you're on a machine  that's designed for it I think if it is if you got up-to-date drivers and you know you can put  up with the user account control I think it's fine. I love the arrow interface. I'd I would  love to figure out a way to glom the arrow interface onto OSX. Really? I was 10. Yeah I love arrow.  I love it. Oh yeah sorry. Oh sorry. What's wrong with you? You're something. I love that I love  that like glassy see-through I'm into eye candy you know. I think you know I don't think there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anything wrong with attacking a competitor with what might amount to a kind of stretching the truth  it's it's illegal in the United States to do that and it's not legal in Britain by the way.  Apple ads have been pulled several times. Yeah no it's not legal in Germany either but it's not  not legal a lot of places but the point is is that it's where it's legal I don't see any problem with  it because it's taking what people are perceiving in fact Microsoft acknowledged this with that  Mojave experiment perceiving things is a bad idea and then milking it to promote your own product.  I mean this is just the way it is. I heard that Vista has been paloring around with terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just heard that I don't know if it's true or not but I heard it. Well I got one of the I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sent by Apple to review one of the new Macbooks and I gotta say it is a pretty fine machine. I  have a black MacBook is my own personal machine and I really yeah and I really like it. I mean I'm  it's a very impressive I don't know if it's enough to make me want to give up my black MacBook yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it is well made. It's really well made. Oh you did? I ran out and bought it you know actually  the first one I have purchased I've tried to figure it out and I can't count them but I bought my first  Mac in 1984 almost 25 years ago now and I probably owned several dozen never had one DOA this one was  DOA. It arrived it gave me just enough time to install everything work like you know 10 hours  getting everything just right then died but they replaced it immediately. I mean I walked in and  then they said okay let's give you a new one and you're right I have to agree with you the  where it really excels Dwight besides the fact that it costs almost three thousand bucks  fit and finish is spectacular. It is but that price it should be. I think it's a BMW don't you  think it's kind of a Alexis it's a kind of a a luxury a status symbol of a computer. Right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know again the question is like the question of the economy are people willing to pay extra

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for that? It's risky. Well we said this when the air came out would people pay 1800 bucks for a kind  of a computer that really wasn't very powerful and yet looked great. The air is probably more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  susceptible to getting slammed by a downturn than the other stuff. It's been a success. Yeah but the  downturn is in play now let's see what happens. Yeah what's interesting is is you know these

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  designs were done probably started two years ago right and and so a lot of the the planning and  and so forth certainly for the way they market it the way they price it happened say six months ago.  Right and so what you end up with. They had no idea in other words. Right and so it comes out now what happens  when they have these expensive machines nothing to compete at the 500 600 700 dollar area when  the economy turns down you know what happens to that particularly for those people who are  interested in switching. Your prediction? Oh damn Leo you would do that wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No you know what nobody predict anything you want. Dvorak's learned this years ago.  Doesn't really it doesn't really matter just say what you think and nobody will remember anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay here's what I think. Yeah I think that Apple is going to probably have one more maybe one more  through Christmas a quarter in which they kind of gain some market share and then they begin to  have largely replacement sales on older Macs and they you know what's going to happen ultimately  is people who are looking to switch are going to look at the price when they don't have much money  between a say 600 700 dollar Dell and the Macbook and they're going to go with the Dell and forego  switching to the Mac and I think that's the risk that they run. So I'd say I give them another  quarter through Christmas and then start watching real closely in late in early 2009. You agree John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my reckless prediction. Not completely because I think that once the presidential  election is finished that we're going to have a an upswing in the market in general that will  eliminate this this fear this short-term freakiness that's out there and I think Apple will be just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  fine. Typically that is what happens. If the economy stabilizes and if everything is fine  then I think yeah I think you're right John. It's interesting because you'll hear the pundits and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even the economists say this is the worst economy since the depression which took a decade to solve  and yet in our recent history these kinds of things do seem to kind of resolve themselves fairly quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know you got the one thing that's always being overlooked with this particular  situation or for one thing to me it's a panic not a depression and the panics used to be very  common in the 19th century but we haven't seen too many recently. The thing that's always being  overlooked is that in a real depression the public at large is hurt as much or more so than the  professionals that are in the business. The public was not in this market and in fact my one of the  employees that we have at the Dell was remarking to my wife recently that you know she got up and  she was depressed about this whole thing this market crash and all the rest of it and she dawned  on her she said you know I don't have any stock. I got no stock. I don't care. But wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  don't people have them in their retirement accounts in their 401ks? I talk to a lot of people who say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what am I going to do when I retire? Yeah but that's not money that they were going to spend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anyway. And if they have more than a few years left as Jim Cramer said if you got more than five

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  years nothing to worry about. Yeah and they look at it and say oh my god I lost half of my 401k.  What this is actually going to manage to do to the detriment of people who believe otherwise  it's going to eliminate the probability or even possibility at some point that social security is  going to be privatized because it just shows you that the that you know this is not a safe way to  go to do to manage these these little accounts by yourself. The one caveat is that people do use

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um stock-based funds and investments to save for other things. So for example we have a fund that  we're using to save for our kids college and we're coming up on having to spend that and it suddenly  is has about half the money in it that it had before. That's all paper money if we wait but  but we're coming up on you know next September trying to get our kid into college. So it it has

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a real impact in those kind of situations. Yeah it just depends where you are I guess on the  on the scale. I'm with you John I think it is kind of a panic and in fact I think this is probably  a good time for a company like Apple that has what do they have 20 billion in the bank they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they have no significant debts. Yeah no they're in great shape financially by the way Warren  Buffett came out and said and if anybody wants to read this my column that we just ran in Market Watch  uh discusses the the what I believe are some good ideas in terms of investing in tech. But Buffett  came out and said hey you know this is the time to buy. I mean what was everybody thinking? Now if it  was if we were sliding into a depression it wouldn't make any difference because it's just gonna  you're gonna be screwed in one way or another anyway but I still believe that until the public  is fully in and the market is is skyrocketing where you can actually have a crash that there's  I just don't see us so wimply falling into a long 10-year depression and we've just been in a 10-year  downturn since the crash in the 9-11 so I mean nothing has ever gone on for 20 years. So your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  prediction John is it's not going to be six months and then recover you think they're in good shape.  I would say the same thing I in fact I'm probably the most bullish on Apple and the tech sector in  general. Look the tech sector's been suffering look at Dell for the last two years has been suffering  but that's because of razor thin margins and PCs. A company like Apple with great margins great cash  position no significant liabilities I think is in great shape. I think we're also I think we're also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in a situation where you know we have enterprise large enterprise operations going through cycles  where they buy new hardware and we're coming up now at this point on one of those cycles. That  would hurt the PC business badly wouldn't it? Right if they stop that now I gotta tell you  we were we're in the process of upgrading our systems at the Chronicle to do Dell's and that's  kind of been put on hold for the moment because of economics and so we're kind of watching that.  We were about to newspaper industry you know it has its own issues. You got your own cyclical

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  problems and the cycle is all one way I'm sorry to say there's no turnaround for print.  Yeah suicide is an option. Yeah well but you've done it you've done it and any any sensible  reporter at this point has done a done what they can to transform themselves into digital media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  playing it for hours and it's and it's getting less interesting not more interesting which is  very but you are playing it for hours well not anymore I mean I really tried to give it the  benefit of the of the doubt and uh and played it hard and I you know I just it doesn't it didn't  get more interesting it's kind of a it's a yawn I'm very disappointed I was this was the game I've  been waiting for for two years you don't John you didn't take a look at it probably no we you know  it's funny because we tried to get will wright on the show uh when the game came out a month ago  and he was at a time he was traveling so they they called us recently they said you want to  talk to will now and I said no never mind poor will I love will he's a great guy yes and a genius

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but no thanks anyway so my favorite game of his was sim ant oh I love sim ant what's  sim ant sim ant had taught you about ants it had a sense of humor um the the way you won the game  was almost seditious where you took over you moved from a yard into the house and and of course here  I am getting myself identified with ants again raspberry crazy sim ant but it was just it was a  wonderful game on a bunch of levels and uh just as the all the sim cities have been yeah well I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  excited about this anyway little it's called little big planet it's going to be ps3 only sony game  it really an interesting it's kind of like a platformer but with puzzles user created  con it's going to be like next generation gaming user created content social networking  really interesting art style one little problem they uh I guess they released a pre-release  version got an email from a uh a player he said while playing your latest game little big planet  in the first level of the third world in the game I noticed something strange in the lyrics of the  music track of the level when I listened carefully I was surprised to hear words from the koran  uh words words saying every soul shall have the taste of death and all that is on earth will  perish now why is this a problem well this is the the letter writer goes I'll tell you why it's a  problem 50 people died after the danish cartoons uh letter writer says we muslims consider the  mixing of music and words from our holy koran deeply offending we hope you will remove that track from  the game immediately and sony said oh yes sir and pulled back it was supposed to be launched  october 21st it will now be a week later and that game that song will be gone you don't mess around  in this kind of thing the last thing sony needs is an intifada you know fatwa a fatwa against

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ps3 as to as to what theologically the argument is against mixing music with the words from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  koran well you know here's the interesting thing the guy who made the song says I'm a devout muslim

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he didn't consider it uh it's a it's a it's a that group of fundamentalists that uh I think  that's what they're pushing they're pushing their weight around I think that's what it is and um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know it's there is a chilling effect don't you think I mean I'm I'm hesitant to say anything  good idea sony get that out of there meanwhile barack obama's campaign the first campaign ever  to buy video games ads in video game campaign ads in video games product placement interesting do  you think I mean is that going to be is that an effective way to get I mean it's an effective way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get free publicity for putting the thing in there in the first place it probably doesn't  cost too much does it I don't know I mean I don't think it's effective in selling anything but I  think you got so much pr for who needs the you know I'm sure is well worth it the image that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saw was of a picture of obama and one of his ads on a billboard as you're racing right racing by  in the game and I just can't think that people are going to look at that we're playing the game and  go oh look there's barack obama I'm going to vote for him unless unless people who are playing the  game snap to it and go hey that's cool he's in a he's in a video game that guy's cool and under  those circumstances they might get some votes but not a lot I think it is a publicity stunt it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's a bunch of different games but you're right the one I've seen and I think was most most  publicized is from the from the game interestingly titled burnout paradise you know if I were mccain  I would have bought an ad for obama and a game called burnout paradise to be honest it doesn't  reflect well on the campaign and and it was aimed it looks like it was aimed particularly at voters  in ohio and other states where there was early voting because the billboard says early voting  has begun I mean I think it's a really interesting idea I think the technology in these games now is  that you can buy an ad for a limited period of time because obviously this is going to look  you know next year it's going to look like an old billboard that was left lying around unless they  can change these games the video the ads in the games and I think they can now I think they come  from online sources but I'm not but I'm not sure I mean you know if I were a game manufacturer I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wouldn't want an old game but what they do is they a lot of these games have online components  you're actually racing against other people so they must they throw it in there right and I  suspect that when you make that connection they're able to place ads in there on those  billboards and and so you know by the by the time it's all over what you'll see probably are ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  asking to help repay john mccain's debt could be could be by the way do you see sarah palin on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  saturday night live yeah there was actually a good version of it actually on the snl website as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  matter of fact it was online before it aired in California I was surprised it doesn't surprise me  that seems dumb these guys have to go to bed I'm tired I don't want to stay up let me just post it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it does seem dumb but you know that's where I saw it I never watched the Saturday never watched it  but I missed it I missed I forgot about it and I never you know went to watch the show so well you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know I have to say if the if the politics thing doesn't work out she's got a career in tv she's  was very comfortable very poised didn't she start out as a broadcaster yeah she's she's a  broadcaster and a beauty queen so she knows how to hold the camera they had a rap she didn't she  declined to rap which I think was probably a smart move but I you know she showed this is a smart  thing to do she showed good humor about herself she was poised she was likable and and and alec  Baldwin hit on her so I think all all okay that's a win win it's a win win it's a success alec  baldwin he he plays the whole thing as if he thinks she's Tina Fey which is very was very funny I  thought it was very well done but yeah worth watching this is an example though of uh and you  know it's NBC's been so nervous about undermining their viewership by youtube postings and then they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  post it before the show airs in California they posted it on youtube or on their own site no I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think on hulu and uh and various other sites I actually SNL.co or whatever it is SNL yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no I don't I still don't understand why they care about the youtube stuff what difference does it  make they're not making money from the Saturday Night Live website ever happened to Saturday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Night Live and frankly it made it relevant and frankly I'm glad I didn't watch the show I heard  on twitter from a lot of people said oh man what a waste of 90 minutes you know but but you but and  Sarah Palin's only in two different you know at the beginning of the show and in the middle and  that's it and uh and the rest of it was a waste yeah they weren't having her doing any sketch comedy  well she read her she read her lines I don't know if she was reading a teleprompter or what but she  she delivered some lines and did a good job but I've watched it looked better than a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people that you see them looking over at some cue card somewhere in the middle of nowhere I'm telling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you if the politics thing doesn't work out she'll be a commentator on Fox before the years out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Saturday Night Live uh you know hit its prime 20 years ago it's pretty much burnt out but one of  the interesting things I was thinking about this about online video is that it's kind of like music  you know there are very few whole albums that are worth buying anymore there's one or two songs  great right and Saturday Night Live it's not like that too with television now you can kind of  hone in on just what you want to see on television thanks to the internet you don't have to quote

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  buy the whole album and just like the record companies the tv companies hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  although if they if that's how they create their programming to be thought of in that way they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  could take advantage of it if they're smart well and I think the record companies have started

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to learn it's okay to sell single copies although gee like they never did that before with a 45 rpm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  record I mean the internet brought it back you know 45s kind of died for a while in the vine  after the cd but ultimately the internet gave a new life to the single how much was it was a 45

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do you go you old guys remember about a buck yeah I thought they were about a buck from almost from  the get-go and they never really changed much in price they may have been cheaper early we're all  but I don't remember I always remembered them as a dollar well you should remember how much the 78s

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay okay I was waiting for that boy thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the borac like those cylinders yeah those cylinders are the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I heard a great npr piece several years ago about the reason why those the 78 the older 78s and the  cylinders where the singing style is like that that the way they recorded them was they put their  heads in giant horns that were just like the kind you use to listen to it and they had to sing  really loud and so you wound up getting this kind of strained very almost shout singing that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  did and that's why that was acoustic recording which kind of ended around you know like somewhere  around the late 20s I believe and then it was then but they still kept with the 78s and then  what happened was that's why you had these early you know George Morrill used to be a big collector  so I'm pretty much oh George Morrill the Morrill computer yeah he was a huge he had one of the  biggest collections of 78s in the world but anyway the the acoustic recording days yes you had the  things actually had to be to master the record you had to shout into it was mechanically recorded  and then they did come up with electronic stuff later and then that what would change what to me  I thought was interesting what changed was the the nature of the singer because you could now  bring out baritones like a Bing Crosby you could have that light tone as a  Rudy Valley Rudy Valley had a high pitched loud voice and Rico Caruso perfect you're right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wasn't a der bingle until recording technology advanced now George was wasn't George doing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  project to restore all these yeah he had actually restored a number of them there's available on  CDs he was one of the early pioneers of certain kinds of restoration and unfortunately died you  know before he could really finish a lot of his projects but that's I have a I have a lot of  material from him that I'll play every once in a while really that he had stuff that he'd converted  over well I now that also is just original 70 I have like a you know I don't have I never  collected 78s even though I have a few because we have a crazy device up in Washington with a crank  on it but but I have a lot of audio a lot of you know reel to reel tapes with a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tremendously interesting songs you're you know you're a fascinating fellow John whether it comes  to Easter eggs at Costco or rare 78 recordings you just never know what John's going to be into

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or strange oil-based instruments well actually I got into the 78 recordings because I've ran into  from when I took broadcasting in school I had run into some guys who were collectors back when  and they kind of turned me on to them and one of them was a DJ around here named Jim Watt  who seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth but he's around somewhere and he had a  really nice collection of 78s but when Moro got into it it was just became ridiculous he was just  buying out he must have had 20 or 30 000 unbelievably good 78s that were mint condition

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wow and what happened to his collection when he died is it I got bought off by a guy by another

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  collector and I think it got some of it got distributed because every collector who collects  these 78s they tend to focus on certain kinds of music and they get rid of the stuff they don't  like so the some guys will collect jazz or some guys will collect novelty tunes and there's all  kinds of different sub genres or they'll just collect an era and so I think the collection's  probably been spread out by now I'm not sure that's a shame oh that's too bad yeah no you know he  had in one side light he had if he lived to be 200 he had more material than he could listen to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  24 7 I you know they're actually I'm behind what he was up to because I know a lot of radio folks  and audio journalists who have reel to reel recordings of interviews and and classic in  studio performances and and stuff that's just going to die if it doesn't if it's not restored

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in the next 10 years it kiss it goodbye well I think most of that we can get onto a digital  format but the stuff that it is really going to die and I think they can't do anything about it  is those two inch uh these are video tapes those big giant remember the two inch tape  pneumatics yeah no not the pre-unimatic I'm talking about that big ampex that has a two  inch wide tape with a with a rotating four rotating heads that go horizontally right or vertically  up and down the tape there's only a few of those machines left working and there's no  replacement parts they stopped making those things in the late I don't know in the 60s I guess  they were the very first videotape recorder yeah those big giant things ampex made them yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in fact wasn't Dolby on the team that designed those I think Dolby is probably  owns most of the patents he has there was one I don't know if it's working that was on display  at the San Francisco airport that was in the possession of the Dolby company but boy yeah  right I mean those things once but even if even if they had the players the tapes the the you know  start fragmenting after 20 years or 30 years they're not going to well they also degrade and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have some magnetic issues across talk and they're lost but no they're getting moving as much of the  stuff as they can from all the NBC tapes and the accumulation of these things onto the you know  that's from dead media they're trying to get it digitized as best they can but they're not going  to get halfway through it until it just these machines aren't going to work anymore well it's  a tragedy doing that who's doing that John there's a bunch of there's a these there's like  non-profit organizations doing there's some guys in New York to it the internet archive or  I don't know if he is or not but I think there's I think you could find out who's doing it if you  get a hold of the Museum of Broadcasting in New York they probably know all about what's  what's doing what it'd be a good story for you to write yeah fascinating you know the same thing  with the umatic and the rest of those tapes are going to probably crap out too and then there was  then we had this era that's more recent which I think is even more tragic of these contradictory  and non-compatible digital formats that are out now right well and stuff was as we've talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before was just reused or thrown out you know the first Johnny Carson appearance the first  Super Bowl there's no recording of the first Super Bowl oh I didn't know that it's they threw  it out or reused the tape it's lost I mean of all things and somebody's got to have somewhere where

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they sat down and aimed their super 8 camera at it was that's the way you know in fact that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  way Kinescope has done of course they basically filmed a video there's probably a Zapruder

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  somewhere of Super Bowl I but you know I mean that's going to be a fragment you know maybe it's  not such a problem now because everything is recorded by everybody in a million different ways  you know everything's t-vote everything you know even the even the video that we send out  on twit live is being recorded by by fans and saved on their hard drives so and everything's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  recorded in 18 ways yeah the problem is just cataloging it I mean even back in the 30s  people would record off the air you know they're being nerds then there's always you know there's  certain percentage of the population does this kind of stuff they'd have their own transcription  machines and they make these big 16 I think they're 16 inches is huge you know you've seen them Leo  radio stations big transcription disc which is a one shot you make one right and they would record  like a Benny Goodman concert right off the air and put it on one of these transcription discs and  those things are openly traded but they're not you know there's so many of them and they're  they're not cataloged and nobody knows any you know you might not you find some old somebody just  died and then they're addict they may have a bunch of them who knows I mean it's that's what's  happening with this digital so we're not going to recover these shows sad well and I got to tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you from having gone 11 days without power and thinking about everything that I have that I  couldn't get to at the time you know I had some stuff on some hard drives that I would have had  to schlep to someplace where I could get power to get access to some of the stuff that I wanted to  get to because I hadn't put it in the cloud and uh and you know if there's no power the digit all  the digital formats are gone we have some kind of catastrophe uh you know if I may get science  fiction like a nuclear war or something and the power grid goes down a lot of our documentation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is just gone it's all it's all electrons it's not recoverable in any way well god if that happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though I think we got other problems there's other issues so everybody my files are gone

Transcript:  to put it on the live stream but maybe we'll put it out that's what people should start doing it  there's so much great audio content out there and now that there's a way to distribute it  and and it's cheap or free to do so I really I would love to see more and more of this stuff  distributed hey we got to take a break I want to come back you Dwight Silverman have played with  the new Google phone I want to get your take on this right you've played with it right I do I have  one in my hand so I'd love to get your review of that we're going to talk about that and in a bitter  irony the McCain campaign complains about the DMCA to YouTube we'll find out what that's all about and  YouTube's response but first we pause for station identification brought to you by GoToMeeting the  good folks at GoToMeeting GoToMeeting means that when you're on that conference call and people's  eyes are crossing and they're tuning out and they're playing with their Google phone and doing  solitaire or tetris or emailing you can wake them up you can get them back and get them engaged with  GoToMeeting have your meetings online saves money from traveling in person and saves a lot of time  increases your productivity you'll do more you'll travel less and man it's a great way to close sales  or to collaborate I do it for collaboration all the time or or training too now available for  PCs and Macs setup is just a couple of minutes it's secure and you pay one low flat rate every  month for unlimited use so you stop counting your minutes and you stop counting the time  and the number of meetings you have look try it free for 30 days go to meeting.com  slash twit that's the website go to meeting.com slash twit sign up today 30 days absolutely free  show your boss your clients your colleagues they're all going to agree GoToMeeting is changing the way  we do business go to meeting.com slash twit we thank them so much for their support of this week  in tech now we are going to talk a little bit about this very interesting story the McCain campaign  sends a cease and desist letter to YouTube because YouTube they say is too willing to pull down the  videos from the McCain campaign seems that these videos from I guess they're of network appearances  and so forth they're getting DMCA takedown notices from the from Fox and others and YouTube as always

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just goes well we'll pull it down right is that I think this the way I think the story is even  more interesting than that because some of their ads have been pulled down too I think there's some  dirty tricks going on here from the Obama campaign so the Obama campaign is sending a takedown notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and then YouTube's as usual just not questioning it they just go okay I mean we're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  even McCain ads that McCain produce and they own and they post them and then somebody from the other  side says oh no you got to take this down this guy and well they have to demonstrate some sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of infringement don't they I mean they could just say apparently not that's the whole point of this  article well here's the irony McCain supported the DMCA he voted for it and serves him right then  and I don't know how active he's been in this there have been movements in the Senate to  change it to make it have fair use for instance which DMCA does not allow for so you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who's to who's doing the takedown then I don't think it's the I don't think it's the Obama  campaign you have to show that you have the right to claim that you're infringed what they're doing  is apparently they're showing video clips from news programs from Fox and so in theory those  are the folks who would be doing the takedown I don't think if I flagged them on something that  would trigger a takedown if that's the case there and I think YouTube is doing this anyway I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube is doing it way too quickly well and this is the McCain the McCain council who wrote a  letter which you can read online it's been highly widely reported basically saying that they're  saying it's it's it's your list it's too easy to take stuff down but I don't think they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  asserting that it's the their opposition well let's take another look at this from a third or  fourth perspective which how about this for a concept why is YouTube under the obligation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to post anything ah well that raises a whole nother legal issue there's this whole safe harbor  issue right if they are a publisher if they are editorial exercising editorial discretion  they have all sorts of liabilities that they don't have if they just say anything goes and  until you tell us to take it down that's why they want to assert this kind of oh we you know we  don't have any and of course there is there is a very good case to be made where you're putting  ads on this stuff you're a publisher they don't want that so the McCain campaign has said we want  you to stop processing DMCA takedown requests in cases where YouTube decides that fair use applies  but of course there is no fair use under the DMCA the YouTube's chief counsel responded with two  points he said having YouTube determine fair use claims is difficult and risky that's that  risking their their safe harbor lawyers and judges this is a quote quote lawyers and judges  constantly disagree about what does and does not constitute fair use no number of lawyers  could possibly determine with a reasonable level of certainty whether all the videos for which we  receive disputed takedown notices qualify as fair use so they err on the side of caution they just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  take it down this is just another reason why we need a serious overhaul of copyright it's broken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it is but i do think there's an irony that's never gonna happen the whole impetus right now  is an international wipeo they passed it they passed ip pro and this and and george bush signed  it into law now we have a copyright czar no it's just gonna get worse and worse it's not getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  better it's the exact opposite direction but the good news leo is you myself dwight we're all  content you know makers creators well and we don't play our cards right we can also leverage it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  little bit i infringe all the time i infringe before breakfast uh yeah we're talking about  copyright copyright i'm sorry no i mean we just did i just played a winston commercial for crying  out loud you know i mean i don't mind infringing i but of course if they take me to court i'm gonna  i'm gonna say it was john's idea of course had nothing to do with it so how do you like dwight

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how do you like the g1 it's it is much cooler than i thought it would be you know the pictures  that were shown when they first announced it didn't do it justice it looked ugly as it does look ugly  but it's actually fairly sleek in fact it reminds me the lines remind me of my black macbook and  the mechanism for sliding up and down is pretty cool the action is cool in fact a product manager  at t-mobile told me that i i asked them if there was some reason why it swings up and out the  screen when you push up most htc based phones which is what this is just slide straight up they said  it was strictly for cosmetic reasons because it's cool it's a very uh it's it's slimmer than you  think it would be it's not as slim as the iphone but uh it's sleek to hold the software works well  it still looks like a 1.0 and it definitely is not as elegant as the iphone would you switch to it  from the iphone um if i were to no because it doesn't support exchange and t-mobile just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't have does houston have an have the high speed yes all right yeah yeah we were one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  early early cities to get it which is probably why they sent me one i mean that's a big issue in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fact they said that we're not going to they're only selling it in i think 20 or 22 cities the  store where the stores where there is high speed although you can order online i did i'll be getting  one wednesday but i'll be using it with edge i can't i mean oh you don't have 3g there well i'm in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  petaluma yeah but um a lot of the communities that are closer to big cities like the communities  around san francisco uh will get it when they say san francisco has 3g they mean that market

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right so um uh you might have it not know well yeah maybe it's i looked at the coverage map which is  you know always a fiction anyway and it doesn't look like it it penetrates up here to the wine  country but that's fine it's worth living here because i just drink more wine and i don't care  how fast the network is everything take your time i don't need to down now how's the browser is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  safari like safari browser is web kit and so it looks very much like safari it's it you know it's  much better than any windows mobile browser or the or the horrid uh blackberry browser uh but it  it's fast it it has a pretty good pretty speedy processor in it and things things happen very  quickly on it um the menus are very text-based i kind of once you drill down into the menus there  you know for things like setting up your wi-fi and so forth it's uh it's not very graphical it  reminds me i saw one review of it where they described it i think oh malik said it was  windows mobile done right that's a good way to describe it it'd be pretty hard to do worse than  windows windows mobile well the other good thing about it is that you know that anybody can um can  write an app for it there's no gatekeeper as there is with apple so you're gonna have a lot more apps  i think being generated for it and you also have a lot of crap they've got a kind of a social  network where people will be able to review and rate them as you can on the apple app store right  but also then this surface there's a kill switch in it that google now that's interesting now this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was a very controversial thing when apple admitted yes we have a database if the phone and the phone  at some undisclosed juncture just checks the database if that application is there there's  nothing in it right now it will disable it will uninstall or somehow disable the application  and then shock of shocks apple got a lot of heat for it but it well apple's proprietary it's to be  expected so does the android phone is it android or is it the g1 is it t-mobile doing this or google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  t-mobile is not doing the the kill switch it is google and it's android and i think one of the  reasons why they didn't get as much flak for it is that apple has apple is the gatekeeper on the  app store so it is kind of the protector in this case but i think that when in the case of android  there's no there's no gatekeeper the protection is after the fact so if someone were to successfully  upload a malicious program somebody's got to be able to jump in there and get it out of there  and i think that that is the primary cause for it now granted it could be abused well and also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if there's no if you don't buy the application from the store i mean websites the nice the thing i  like about the google phone is a website if i develop an application i put it up on a website  you can download it directly to the phone will the kill switch work for that stuff yes oh anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes well their idea that i understood was that they were worried about people abusing their  software developers kit or or selling uh you know pirated stuff or doing using or using pirated  stuff that they for some reason they google felt that they shouldn't be doing or something like  that but i'm thinking something i'm confused here but the question that kept coming to my mind when  i heard about this is since it's open source can you hack out the kill switch right i would think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that that that code would be visible and just recompile well it's in it right it's in android

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and the android software is available so yeah i imagine you probably could but at that point  you know if you do that you know and obviously you grab some malware then it's all on you right  yeah maybe you don't want to cut that out right i mean to me it's a if there's no gatekeeper there's  got to be some some form of protection and i think that that's that's it well wait let's back up on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that concept okay so i load some malware in my system i mean don't i really want some sort of  an anti-virus product or something to get rid of or as opposed to just having the phone killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no no it doesn't kill the phone just kills the app but but what if let's let's put this in perspective  what if microsoft did this to windows what if microsoft said we've put some maybe they have for  all we know but there's no evidence of it we've put some a way to reach our hand into your computer  and pluck out an application well they've been talking about this for years and people go crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when they talk about it yeah and i think in some ulas you'll find stuff like this written i mean  there's some ulas that say that they could go into your machine and kill the program and then  they can also do this and that i mean it's just like microsoft wants to push it for documents and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and this is part of tpm and that whole trusted computing thing and where where they you could  have a word document that you could revoke permission to read and so you know and that's  been very controversial but this is even going farther to say and and the i guess the question  ask is would google do it if it's porn would google do it if an application violated t-mobile's  you know maybe there was a tethered internet capability you know what would they do this for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well here's the other question what you're asking that one which is why does it have to be google  i mean if what dwight says is true which is you get a malware in there and you have to call google  or somebody say help me help me and then they send out a signal to kill the program why can't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just do that yourself from your laptop yeah well you should be you can delete the software but you  may not know it and there may be a variety of reasons that i think it's a little big brotherish

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  i would like the i would like totally yeah i would like control of that not let google just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kill something that it doesn't like here's an interesting question you know we've we've heard  about it on in in apple's software we've heard about it in uh in google's do we know that there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't one in windows mobile we don't we don't know you know and i think maybe we should now  start be paying attention to this since both apple and google have implemented maybe it's in every

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cell phone yeah maybe it's something standard in every cell phone that just nobody's asked that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  question before well then maybe it's in the operating systems on our computers that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sitting on the desktops well you never will know if it's not open source there's no way to you know  to verify such a thing in fact the only reason they found out about it on the iphone is because  they were able to decompile the source code and look at strings in there and they found a url for  an apple website that has a database right of black applications empty right now but applications  that are forbidden and they deduced from that that there was this was a kill switch of course  with open source you can immediately just determine it so that google announced it there was no reason  for them to hire or no way for them to hide it what's interesting is that apple they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually is an application that apple distributed that people paid for that violates most wireless  carriers terms of service and that is the that is net share which was the tethering right that's  the example i would use right and apple has not disabled it they could kill it they just pulled

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it out of the store and those who downloaded it already are okay right except i can't make it work

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i've never been able to make it work that's another issue maybe that's why i have killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  itself maybe that's why they killed it i i i think this is antithetical to the to the  notion most people have of their personal computer being their personal property  and that no company should have the right and this is why we hate the recording industry is why  sony's root kit is so anathema we nobody should have the right to reach their hand into our  personal computer and modify it and as these little devices become more and more computer like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're not phones anymore well and you don't own your software anywhere you license i hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah you know come and get me copper i'm i'm getting i'm i'm gonna oh i'm mad well maybe  obama will change it yeah obama'll fix it obama's your new bicycle so did you see that obama is your  new yula yeah you see that there was a website and the guys that got a book obama i think was  obama's my new bicycle dot com yeah matt honan yeah that's that's the flimsiest premise for a  book i've ever heard of but john you you keep working on it because one of these days you're  going to get that book out have you put did you stop writing computer books oh yeah me too yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well what happened was the market was no no no there was there was always a market but the  problem is they all everybody got bought up by the one same publisher pierson and now here's the way  the business works people always come in well i'm writing a computer book you know and then they're  either going to a really low payout from a from a riley book or they're going through one of the  pierson publishers and the game goes as follows and i'm always saying why should we why should you do  this subject yourself to this particular conflict of interest if i'm gonna do a book for like  print as hall for example and they own macmillan and q and everybody else i mean they're competing  with themselves internally and so here's here's the model for today's that which i think is genius  by the way from the other side it goes like this i write a book xyz and i give it i sell it to  print as hall let's say which is owned by pierson everything's owned by pierson right and so they  start selling the book you know it starts doing really well and so then they say well this this  whole topic xyz is really good let's have q do one and q doesn't have authors they just you know  they basically pay that's my old publisher right they pay you to do the book and then you know  here's your check and then get out of here and you get a flat fee and that's and so so now i tell  authors this so here's the deal think of yourself as the publisher you wrote a best-selling book for  print as hall and they've cloned the book for q and now they have a big budget of promotion  to put into one of the two products are they going to put it into your book where they have  to pay you a commission for the sales or are they going to put it to the q book where they  it's all profit to them hey you're working for these people does this actually happen has that  actually happened i mean just all you have to do is take a look at the at the at the offerings of  all these different companies and there's a bunch of conflicts of interest throughout right well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know and i never made enough money to make it worthwhile you can't you can't you can't it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  impossible you used to be able to when these companies are all independent right i've just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  started uh writing computer books did it for uh timing timing a bit terrible timing i helped  larry maggot out with his windows vista book for peach pit which is owned by pierce and then i  just did uh published uh earlier this year running windows on your mac for peach pit and they do  beautiful books they do beautiful books it's really really nice looking books not selling real well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  particularly the vista book who would buy a book nowadays when you can get all this stuff online

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it's much more timely well i think the people who buy computer books right now want everything  kind of all in one place they they may be semi-old school the the running windows on your macbook  it's the only windows on your macbook out there right at the moment right so it's kind of a you  know it's it's a specialty book and it's not doing too well i mean not too badly it's it's  selling pretty well haven't made any money off it yet but it's it's uh you know it's selling but it  but the interesting thing is is that i think there's a certain type of person who just doesn't  want to search who doesn't want to find it who wants it all in one place and they are um you know  the more and more people are getting it online and those folks who buy books are less and less

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well you know the thing is if you write a definitive book it's much handier in a book  form than it is to scrounge around online for this and that and the other thing right uh i mean if  you're like for example learn learn want to learn css or phd yeah that's i still buy books for learning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  programming languages in fact i just bought one on squeak the other day you know it's just too much  it's too hard to read the stuff online well here's the irony the book i bought squeak by example is  online you can read it online it's an open book but i ended up going to lulu and having it printed  because i wanted it and so how hold up next to the computer as i did it right right i always thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that i always thought the computer books should because things move so fast and change so quickly  should all come almost in loosely form like in a three ring binder and you subscribe to the book  and as new chapters are done they're sent to you automatically i've talked a bunch of publishers  about that idea and they all just kind of snort at me you do it yourself you don't need a publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who needs a publisher what do they bring to the table nothing yeah actually nowadays it's probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just as easy to do print on demand stuff and yeah take all the money yourself yeah whatever money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there is well i like podcasting i'm gonna keep doing that or whatever you call it netcast you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show i think it's heard and used and i'm not sure but it's heard all over the country and it's it's  absolutely a very different audience than the twit audience and in fact i found that despite promoting  twit ruthlessly on the radio show it has not helped one whit because those people those people are not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as technical yes and people who who read my blog regularly do not generally read my column and vice  versa i'll get email from people who read my column and i refer them to my blog and it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  company that's done that successfully i think is cnet early on with the television stuff yeah i agree  with that there would be no cnet website if it weren't for the tv site which really propelled  traffic there and i've not seen it happen ever since yeah they did it in a peculiar way maybe  it was timing i don't know john is both online and off devorek.org slash blog is his blog of course  he's got a great many podcasts including no agenda with that he does with adam curry and tech five  and cranky geeks.tv and of course the market watch column as as as long as i've known john  he's always been an overachiever he just he just doesn't write at all the good it's done me now
