Transcript:  But is that is that the case? I don't think that the black and red necessarily makes it a difference here in terms of retail  Although we know that the most technology products are sold in q4  Sort of from September till December  But what I do think is that it's a cat-and-mouse game with the consumer and it's always changing and it's always going to change  So at one point in time is just Friday then they threw in cyber Monday now  It's the week before and it's always moving one thing that's different this year is that their category is emerging on different days  So phones Android phones unlocked phones generally before Thanksgiving and on Thanksgiving and Black Friday  Then Black Friday and the weekend is clothing Cyber Monday is shoes.

I gotta get a new TV. Tell me which one to buy  What do you think 4k? Are we are we but are we where are we?

End time: 776.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're sort of approaching the bubble words. It's worth considering  I'd say I mean if you buy it today, you still won't get very much out of it

Start time: 776.42
End time: 793.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might be a long time before you do it might even be worse than that because the 4k you buy today will not necessarily  Support 4k standards right right going forward. So it'll sub it'll continue to work  It's not like these new standards will break it  But you may not get the best picture out of it of a 4k TV that comes out after these standards are established will be

Start time: 793.06
End time: 808.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Better. I mean, I think that I do think it is actually true that upscaling kind of works in some cases and stuff can look good  Stuff which is not 4k can look good on a 4k TV  Where are you getting 4k content? Otherwise, you aren't basically. Yeah, you have to buy Sony gives you a hard drive with a 4k TV

Start time: 809.60
End time: 826.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get that's not that's not the $800 4k TV though. No, I have a new campaign. I want my TV to be dumber  They dirt amen. Yeah  Why are they putting smarts in these TVs?  Cuz the smarts that Samsung and LG and all these guys put it is so dumb. I'll tell you why it's in the way

Start time: 826.52
End time: 857.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because they it's the same reason why?  Nobody in the in the mobile business or the cable business wants to be a dumb pipe, right?  They want to they want to add value  Otherwise, they just have to compete on this basic service and their margins go down the TV makers. It's the same way  They're terrified if all TVs are exactly the same because all we do is connect these little outside boxes to them  But the outside boxes are a better approach just like using Android auto or carplay would be better in a car  Because there are companies that really are good at this stuff  And then there are the companies that aren't so good

Start time: 857.66
End time: 930.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems to makers are not so good a monitor should be just the monitor and I can apply the smarts in whichever way  I prefer an Apple TV or a Roku or a blu-ray player whatever I choose  Right the problem, you know, we have a very fancy I bought the Samsung curved OLED  Well, I had to it was research well  And yeah, it was a very expensive TV. It's a lot of research like $9,000  And it turns itself off at random intervals you're watching a show and it just decides I don't think he's watching and turns it off  It's an eye tracking technology. It pop. Yeah, it's too smart. It pops up. So I'm watching the World Series  I think the Giants were in it this year, right? Yeah, and the Celtics and then I was I was watching  The Bruins and the Bruins and I was watching and then all of a sudden it says Yahoo Sports  It takes up a third of the thing. Yeah, I didn't do it to you. Would you like to watch?  Would you like to get stats from Yahoo Sports? I'm watching the World Series here  I don't want to have to find the remote click the X and get rid of that thing. It's very frustrating  periodically Samsung very kindly  Sends me warnings and notices that pop up over the yeah, I love getting a software update notification while I'm watching a TV  Show servers are gonna be down at midnight on Thursday. Just wanted to let you know I'm watching here

Transcript:  I retired my harmony one because  Another case these TV companies have decided that there's not an on switch and an off switch  There's one switch that toggles but the remote doesn't know what state the TV's in so in order for the remote to work  You have to turn everything off  First with all the other remotes, but you have to find now. I have all my remotes  What do I need the one for you've got to turn everything off or it won't work because it'll turn the TV on  But it'll turn the box off and it's like come on

Here's the 840 EVO, which is now being replaced Samsung's  Latest EVO is the 850 but 120 gigs for  terabyte drive  We're talking 35 cents a gigabyte  That is a big drop from the buck a gigabyte more that they were costing and it's no longer

You might think oh, well, that's what they do  No  They affect they tear this stuff down so they can create repair manuals and if you go to ifixit.com you will see literally  tens of thousands of  Repair manuals. These are all free. This is not how they make their money.

That's for the real geek in your life  I fix it comm slash twit use the offer code twit to take ten bucks off any purchase over fifty dollars or more  Let's see, where should we go here  You're the boss. What do you what do you like on? I have a whole lineup of fabulous stories  We were talking on Tuesday with Steve Gibson about this  Semantic discovered it this new virus  reg in  We say reg in because it is it uses the registry to hide itself on a system  But what Steve pointed out immediately is this was not written by your everyday hacker. This was written by  Somebody with lots of resources at their command very sophisticated  Symantec says they have seen traces of this since 2008  So this is very much like Stuxnet or flame. These are viruses that are created by governments  To be used against other governments  Symantec said they don't have the dropper that is the  Very clever little bit of code that gets on the system whether through a targeted email  USB key there variety of ways it then downloads encrypted pieces  Decrypts them deletes itself. These are root kits. So no one will ever see that this has been installed and this stuff is  Very Steve says very impressive very well-written  Glenn Greenwald at the intercept said it is a part of a decade-long joint operation from our own NSA and  It's British counterpart the government communication headquarters or GCHQ and that's based on disclosures from Edward Snowden  Symantec said in the world of malware threats only a few rare examples can truly be considered  groundbreaking and almost peerless  What we have seen in regin is just such a class of malware, you know, there's some  Credence to what Glenn Greenwald said because of the countries they've found  Regin in Saudi Arabia Russia Pakistan Afghanistan  India Mexico Ireland Belgium and Austria  Not one infections been found in the US or England. Hmm  That might be one little clue that where it came from  What's interesting is it goes in in fact if you look at if I should load the Symantec PDF because  they have lots of graphs and information, but if you load the PDF you'll see a pie chart of  The industries that it infects and it's telecom its airline reservations. It's hotel reservations  It's exactly the kind of thing Saul would use  to  Spearfish a company and get information about people  What do you how do you guys what do you feel?  Let's assume the US and perhaps Britain wrote this and has applied it in cyber warfare  Is that it seems to me that's better than shooting people. Well, can I ask this question in reverse?

This is spy stuff, right?  this is spy stuff spy stuff like this has been going on and what I don't like about it is that you end up with a  Lot of independent people's computers getting compromised when they're kind of collateral damage for a larger story that's happening here  but this is a  Front in a you know in an information battle in a Cold War in a you know  It's a spy novel writ large on our hard drives

Transcript:  And you make a good point is that the source code goes into the wild and then it's amended by someone who's less sophisticated and more  nefarious then you have the power of  Of  Intergovernmental spy agencies working against individuals and that seems that would be bad and that is what happened with Stuxnet

Start time: 1973.60
End time: 2023.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did leak into the wild. It looks as if  Great pains have been taken with reg in  to avoid that  so  For instance, the modules are encrypted and can only be so you can't examine the source code  The dropper which is  semantic put a nice little Trojan horse icon next to it so you understand that it's essentially a Trojan horse that sneaks under your system via email or  Whatever and deletes itself as soon as its job is done it  loads in and  decrypts the next stage and the next stage and the next stage and it  You know, it's very hard to get any of these pieces  In fact semantic says we don't have a copy of the dropper. We can't find one  So that means the bad guys probably are having a hard time, too  It's also highly targeted it's a spear fishing attack so it's not just spread out in the wild  Basically the stuff is not any more

Angela Merkel is not happy that we're tapping her phone calls because she's an ally  I think I imagine the chinese government and the russian government probably expect that that is attempted on them and they're probably  Uh, not surprised when that happens, but it's a these are all different issues  but I think the reality is we live in a world where all of these devices are connected on the internet and  Many of them have huge security flaws  And of course, they're going to be exploited by spies and criminals and that's the world we live in

Transcript:  That's the 21st century there is collateral damage and I think maybe with this next story can is some of that collateral damage  one of the things that happens is that around the world u.s industry gets penalized or  Is less welcome and the european union has voted  A european parliament has voted to break up google. Yes  Uh, and I finally I have a feeling that some of this of course is the is the way they treat privacy in europe  Where they have a right to be forgotten and all sorts of things that break the internet fundamentally crazy euro stuff  But I have to think that some of it also comes from the knowledge that the u.s is  Maybe doing some of the spying and maybe is it not to be trusted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's my question to you guys. So so google provides a service which is search, but their business is ads  If you think about it search is just their marketing  So why are those two things?  in conflict as  anti-competitive as being  Monopolistic this is just i'm playing devil's advocate explain that to me

Start time: 2209.62
End time: 2232.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think part of the that's exactly what this legislator is saying is that  google is in some of the businesses  That it searches over for and i've always kind of been bothered by the fact that google is a content company with youtube  Uh, and there's always the threat. I don't think it happens  But there's always this threat that google's search engine would favor its own content over my content for instance  I don't think that happens

Start time: 2233.38
End time: 2242.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Showed that that didn't really pan out so great the cool thing about search engines unlike operating systems is any consumer at any time  Can switch with very little effort?  Unfortunately, I wish we did have three or four other search engines that were as good as google and a fraction as successful  All we have is bing and yahoo, which is a front for bing and the only reason we have bing is because microsoft  Can afford to lose lots of money and they have hundreds of millions of dollars every year  That is what worries me the thing that worries me about google's dominance is that while bing is okay  We don't have a thriving competition. We have duck duck go  Which is actually quite good and run by a few people but isn't it really riding on google's back?

Start time: 2417.74
End time: 2430.06

Transcript:  I mean, isn't it google's results that they're delivering? They don't have their own search engine. No, actually they do  but I don't but  Is it mature? Is it actually working?  For a long time duck duck go was just repackaging other search results

I'm sorry yahoo bing  But you could reset it if you wished and there is word that apple probably will do to something similar next year  I mean not to

Transcript:  They can't do and I think they can't really just mess around with the order too much  I mean, I think part of why?  yahoo did the deal with mozilla is if mercer meyer had been ceo of yahoo when the deal with bing had happened that deal wouldn't have  happened because  It really  It was yahoo kind of giving away something really important  And I think today's yahoo was much more interested in search  As being important than the yahoo that did that deal was a few years ago.

That was about a month ago that those were announced  Are you worried for your job? No, no, i'm just curious what what the how could yahoo not make it?  The world how could yahoo not make it?

I think a bunch of people talking about tech on a podcast is  Both the wrong people and the wrong audience  We don't use yahoo make it I keep likening like remember when david poe got up at ces and announced yahoo tech and all of the  tech bloggers made just like snide comments about how ridiculous the whole thing was  Well, those those guys are speaking to the super techie audience that we're speaking to and yahoo  And I don't mean this as an insult yahoo is more like a newspaper  Yahoo is reaching a really different audience these aren't people who are super into tech or super into other  Other specific topics there. It's an older audience  It's a less technically savvy audience and there is a lot of traffic that still goes to yahoo  But it's not the people that we're used to talking to so it's really easy for us to put them down  When if you start thinking of it as something like a newspaper where there's just general interest  There's a lot of traffic. They're not interested in anything in particular  Yahoo has that power so we might not get excited about it  But it doesn't mean that there isn't a place for it in the internet

I mean i'm talking to people who work at yahoo tech  That's what I hear is like you get featured on the yahoo homepage that that firehose comes at you right and it is just a  Massive amount of traffic, but that that's a little bit like to use my newspaper analogy  I mean it's like writing about tech in the business section of the newspaper people aren't buying the newspaper for the tech  Column, but it's in there and they might read it, but it's just it's not it's part of a much bigger package

I fought the fight for high  Uh high geek content  And I always felt like if you and maybe and I guess my question is have times changed maybe  In in those days, I really felt like you made a mistake by saying i'm going to do and everybody did it  Tech content for non-geeks. Nobody cares if they're not a geek the people who care the most about tech content are enthusiasts  So make your content aimed at the people who care the most about your content enthusiasts. It's like at the time  I would say it's like the espn  Doing a show about football for people who don't like football. So here's the rules  You have to make 10 yards every and nobody would watch that because the enthusiasts would go. Well, that's stupid  And if you're not an enthusiast, you're not going to watch it show every week

Transcript:  What is it they used to consume 10 of the population used to consume 80 of the content around technology that used to be the metric  And now it's changed but in a different way than we expected instead of everybody wanting to go to the verge  The vertical of technology is basically consumer reporting, right? So, I mean there's no distinction  That's what you do. That's for a mainstream audience. I'll cover  Phones and makeup and parenting and food and it's all the same

And you know, I I feel like sometimes that's what that's what yahoo is trying to do  I don't know whether it'll succeed at it  But I do think that's a missing piece of the web right now

Transcript:  No as far as we know at least yeah, I don't think us getting upset about uber is going to make a huge difference  but I think there is this  Perception of them that used to be more positive  That is going to be reflected in future coverage of them. There was the sense that they were the one hope fighting against  Entrenched taxi companies and now everybody's taking a step back and saying are they too big?  Should we be looking at alternatives to uber as well?  We were giving them too much credit  So I do think this will have a long-term impact on them of some sort  I don't think it's like everybody's going to delete uber off their off their phones tomorrow when it's over for them at all  But I do think they're not they don't have the halo around them and people who cover them are not as  Predisposed maybe to give them the benefit of the doubt because they've been they've done too many things that are so jerky

Start time: 3688.78
End time: 3724.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the problem is when the ceo's behavior is mirrored and the behavior of the culture down the chain  And it's a corporate culture issue because then then you start getting a weird feeling and you know  Maybe if it's a company that makes your software and it's software that you use and it's just you can you can  Brush it off. I think i've heard from people who think you know  You're putting themself your life in their hands in a way by signing up for the service and getting in a car with their  drivers and there is  Whether it's realistic or not  There's this feeling like there's a partnership and there's a trust level there and so to have a culture issue  With a company that you feel like you're putting some trust in that is a problem nailed it because you know why I think that uber

So if the drivers are jerks, they're out of business  He can rate you if you're a jerk you're out of business and you don't have to pay him  You just get out of the car when you ride.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think one more thing on uber and I don't know if this is bad or not. Maybe we'll get the panel of experts to explain  uber's android app  Goes out and twitter's going to do this too and looks at every app on your phone  To see what you got looks at all the data it can get now we've seen before  And and and i've always calmed people down when they look at the android permissions  Because android had you know, it requires you to request a lot of stuff  Even if you want to do one little thing  It's kind of got a big umbrella category and people look at and go my god, it's gonna make phone calls  No, it's not it just needs to be able to access the dialer or whatever  But this looks like according to geron sec the uber act app actually  Calls home and sends data back  To uber about your sms log your call history your wi-fi connections your gps locations  Your device id it's a long list

Transcript:  So it's not just the wi-fi you're connected to it's the wi-fi in your vicinity  You could make the case that uber is trying to make a kind of a skyhook style map location map or something like that  but but  Really does this seem like again? This seems like more bad behavior from uber  That's a lot of information battery level health plug device info, I mean this is a ton of stuff  This is from the cult of mac uber has provided some clarification to the company's data gathering  It mentions that the blanket access is actually a requirement from google  Access to permissions including wi-fi networks and camera included so users can experience the full functionality of the uber app  This is not unique to uber and i'd agree with that  but the quote but in fact  Recode notes the uber competitor lift does require the same access  so i'm unclear it sounds like  uh that this this company that uh  Geron sec that revealed this saw data of a variety of kinds being sent and that's the problem asking for the permission is one thing  Everybody needs to do that. It's what actually happened  Um  So if if we'll just have to see but this is what I mean about how

You can go to flickr and change the license in all of your  Images and you might you might want to do that. I license creative commons on flickr, but non-commercial and that would stop them from selling my  pictures  50 million of the finest 50 million of the finest photos on flickr now on your wall  Huh?

Yeah, they're nice prints  It's too bad too because as somebody who will use the creative commons license photos on my own website, right credit  What this is going to do it's going to pull a lot of photos off of creative commons on flickr and make the whole service

Transcript:  I mean these are people who as far as I know  Intentionally said yes, you can use this thing. I took for commercial purposes, right make money off it  I think the fact that it's flickr doing it probably gives people a different attitude because they didn't expect that to happen  Right and flickr probably could get around by this and avoid an unforced error just by throwing a little money people's way  That's a great term an unforeseen forced error, but more morally. I think what flickr is doing is just fine people said  You can do this. You said it's legal and it's ethical. It's perfectly

The music industry is finally suing an isp over  piracy  BMG and round hill music are suing cox communications  Saying that cox has not done enough to punish those  Who download music illegally this is what the isps wanted to avoid when they agreed to the industry's six strikes rules  They didn't they didn't really want to get in this battle. God law moves slow. This is like  This is seven years ago eight years ago. They're using nabster. Actually, they're really compliant complaining about a bit torrent  In their complaint the music publishers describe the cox network as an out of control den of piracy  quote today  Bit torrent systems are like the old p2p systems on steroids.

Yeah, even that's old  They're using performance enhancing drugs on the old p2p systems  They're roided out despite its published policy to the contrary cox's actual policy  This is again from the complaint is to refuse to suspend terminate or otherwise penalize subscriber accounts  That repeatedly commit copyright infringement through its network in any meaningful numbers. In other words cox is not  firing customers  When it gets a complaint from the music publishers now the six strikes rule and I I think cox was a signatory to this  It gave you six strikes  The music publisher would write a letter saying ip address 192.1.168  Is using bit torrent and cox would send you a letter. Hey knock it off  You get six times it gets the punishment gets worse each time up to the point of possibly being banned from the service  cox here's what cox alleged a cox subscriber account  with ip address 70.168.128.98  At the time of the infringement believed to be located in fairfax, virginia was used to infringe 24  Particular copyrighted works  1586 times

But they'd like they want to skate around any kind of  lawsuit  This is the first time the record companies have actually said, you know what we're going for it  In the past there's been this kind of truce

I just throw it in the trash  Well, we'll watch this one again with interest this does feel like we haven't had a loss a record company lawsuit in ages have we  Um, they realized it was a really bad idea to sue end users  Uh, nobody's going to complain about suing cox

What was it?  1590 it sounds like  Uh, you know, they have been giving, you know, basically selling these copyrighted works to thousands of people  I'm sure the way bit torrent works is you get bits and pieces from a lot of people  I'm sure all that means is there were 1586 connect connections  And uh, they you know, whoever this was knowingly or unknowingly  I think a lot of people in style bit torrent client and don't realize that it is then serving out that content  They had there's those 24  Whatever songs in their bit torrent folder and  1586 connections one subscriber engaged in 39,000 acts of copyright infringement over 189 days 39,000
