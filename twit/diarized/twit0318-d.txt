Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  than we on the West. It was, it was pretty insane. I actually, um, I, I was  reading a lot of books about Afghanistan at the time and so I knew a lot about  Bin Laden and everything. And so when it happened, I kind of had an idea that  that was what was going on. And I was, I'd actually just moved back to the city  that day. I was in Jersey for the summer, like living in a beach house. It was  post bubble. So were you a student at the time? No, I was, uh, um, I was,  worked for some dotcoms and made a little bit of money and then, and then  wasted it all away, skydiving and traveling. But you were one of those guys.  Well, I wasn't like a big bubble boy. I was a little bubble boy. That's cool.  That's great. I honor you for that. Thank you very much. I was a bubble babe.  And so I came back to the city on September 10th and actually my girlfriend  at the time and I had made plans to meet at windows on the world on September  11th at seven o'clock. And that morning woke up and I used to skydive a lot back  then. And so I remember looking up at the sky and being like, wow, today would  be a great day to go skydiving. Cause it was like very, very, very clear and blue.  And then watch the planes hit and then watch the, so you saw it all happen live.

Start time: 290.06
End time: 315.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually there? Um, instantly just cause I know a lot about planes and I'd been  reading about Bin Laden and all this stuff was going on.  So you probably more than any quicker than anybody realized it was a terrorist.  Well, the two days earlier, there was a, um,  there was a guy in Afghanistan who used to fight the Taliban and was, um,  he'd been killed two days earlier by Bin Laden.  And there was like a lot of stuff online about wealth online back then.  It was a different story,  but there was a lot of discussions about what was going to happen. Um,  and so knew pretty quickly that what was going on.

Start time: 315.66
End time: 320.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  You know, there's so much, of course,  every network's doing their nine one one remembrance and all that stuff.  So I don't, we don't necessarily need to go great into it, but there,  but there are some tech angles. Uh, YouTube has a nine 11, uh, channel,  which I think is quite good. There, this,  this is one way to experience a nine 11. And I think, you know,  there's a whole generation of kids who, you know,  either dimly remember it or don't remember it. And for them, um,  this is a great archive. And that's one thing we have to remember is that, uh,  as, as, uh, you know, media progresses, this stuff goes hyper recorded.  Oh, absolutely.  This is pre YouTube, pre Twitter, pre Facebook.  And yet we have a lot of video.

Start time: 383.94
End time: 395.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Archive.org, which is a Brewster Kales, a really wonderful, uh,  group they're archiving the entire internet,  but they also have a television news archive that they made with NYU called  understanding 9 11. Um, that is different than the YouTube.  It's a little more scholarly, frankly. Um,  there's a lot of different information here.

Start time: 418.08
End time: 433.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is seemed like a YouTube was trying to tell the stories.  You got a lot of almost documentary style footage of people telling their  experience. I mean, it was very moving. I poked around on that last night. Whereas,  uh, as the internet archive tends to do,  they're looking to just preserve the essence, the facts of what happened.

Start time: 434.24
End time: 452.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a lot of it. But as you say, Nick, it would be so different today.  Let God, God willing, we won't have something like that happen again,  but history tells us anything.  We know there will be some other thing like this that we will be recording,  whether it's a tsunami, an earthquake or a terrorist attack,  and it will be so different. Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 781.54
End time: 800.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I was going to say is is there's this, you know, everything is obviously very somber  right afterwards, but I remember this breath of fresh air.  Like I think it was two weeks.  They took a week of war when the onion came back.  Oh, really? And they were the first to to really  to really, I don't know, release the tension by putting their satirical take on it.

Start time: 800.50

That is OK, I guess.

Start time: 843.42
End time: 854.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it took quite a while.  Like, I remember Daily Show was like several months until they got back on.  I remember like I watched that YouTube maybe less than a week ago, like  when John Stewart was back on.  And it's like it's like it's it's a little bit gut wrenching.

Start time: 855.02
End time: 883.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. No kidding.  All right. Well, that's our tribute to to a 9-1-1.  And let's not, of course, forget the people who  lost their lives in the attacks and also the amazing  New York City Fire Department, Police Department,  who really leapt into action,  many of whom also lost their lives in the collapse of the buildings.  NBC's Twitter account  was hacked by Scriptkitties this week.  Scriptkitties.  Even maybe, right?

Start time: 885.69

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you never know.  So here's here's the here the four relevant tweets.  NBC, first of all, they notice their logo changed a little bit.  Breaking news, Ground Zero has just been attacked.  That's horrible, frankly.  Yeah, that kind of that kind of sick, sick humor.  And then another one with the NBC News logo restored.  And then this is not a joke.  And then finally, NBC News hacked by the Scriptkitties,  followed them at S underscore kitties,  which is fairly stupid because what do they expect to have happen?

Start time: 923.74
End time: 928.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do they expect to have happen?  There were the Twitter's like, oh, that's fine.  Just keep that account.  Enjoy those followers.

End time: 939.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 939.94
End time: 947.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 948.30
End time: 971.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think this is what we kind of are starting to realize about  LulzSec and Anonymous and now the Komodo hacker,  which is just this guy is his manifesto is is twisted and perverted and bizarre  is that these people are maybe not exactly normal.  Yes.  There there's something going on more than I mean, obviously they have mad skills.

Start time: 972.06
End time: 981.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't even know if that's the case, because a lot of security experts  said that the guys behind LulzSec, the only person that really knew  what he was doing was Sabu, the guy that ran it, everyone else, which essentially.

Start time: 981.30
End time: 988.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 999.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1000.20
End time: 1004.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1006.76
End time: 1025.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sabu is still tweeting away and he's there, you know, he's still doing his thing.  And so as far as we know, but I wrote a story about the who who they were  a few months ago, and Sabu was really smart about hiding his tracks  many, many years ago before he actually even got into this stuff.

Start time: 1025.90
End time: 1044.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there there is a wide range of skill among hackers.  And there are well, the script kiddies, of course, at the lowest level,  there are people who don't really even know what they're doing.  They're using scripting tools that are created by more sophisticated hackers.  And there's a lot of that going on, obviously.  But then there are people who are very skilled.  And those are the ones who are scary.

Start time: 1044.80
End time: 1048.71

And by doing so, issued certificates for a lot of sites, including Google.  Those Google certificates were used by Iranian, the Iranian government  to hack hundreds of Gmail accounts, maybe thousands of Gmail accounts in Iran.  Looking for dissidents.  But this but this guy, Komodo hacker, let me see if I can find his paste bin,  because it's the you know, he's published a manifesto  that's kind of amazing.  Let me see if I can.

He says he's 21 years old and he's just getting started.  He's not associated with the Iranian government.  He just gave them the certificates.  He did embarrass, I think, embarrassed some people in this.  For instance, he showed a password,  administrative password that he hacked that was kind of trivially weak at DigiNotar.  He also says it should be added in the Wikipedia article for SSL  that I removed SSL or CAs certificate model.  And now he has a better way, which someday he'll tell us about  just the imagine the I mean, the ego and the.  And yet what we don't know is this could be disinformation.  It could have been the Iranian government that did the hacking.  But I have to say, reading this, it feels like there is somebody.  This is a person.  And let us anger him quickly.  Well, apparently we have because our site is now offline and this show is is over.  Thank you very much.  It's been real people. Good night.  Let me see if I could find his other his other paste bin.  You know, he's got quite a few of these.  Let me show you the the password here.  He, by the way, one of the reasons this is credible is that he posted  the public key certificate for DigiNotar, which only a hacker would have had access to.  I signed Windows calculator using Google cert.  That's proof.  Very, very interesting.  I mean, this certainly is whoever sent this is is genuine.  But a little just a little bit creepy.  Nothing much more to say here.  I probably shouldn't have said anything at all.

Does he first of all, does Yahoo need saving?  Liz, what do you think?  Yes, definitely.  They've got but they've got great properties.

I mean, it's still a strong site.  So why is it so hard for the board?  And I have to blame the board as much as I would blame Carol Bartz for this.  She called them doofuses.  Violating, I think, her disparagement clause, which may cost her some money, because apparently  it's a 14 million dollar termination fee.

So she gets one last email, add a little shot from sent from her iPad, which I thought was  kind of cute, saying they just fired me by phone, which I think is, you know, it's a  little bit of a shot.

Do you think that she is at fault or is the Yahoo board at fault?  I mean, I have to say she was given a very tough task to figure out how to take all these  disparate but valuable pieces and sew them in delicious, terrible flicker ignored.  I mean, the things things languished for under her care.

Start time: 1645.40
End time: 1657.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the them languishing shows that what Yahoo did not need was someone to be  blustery and boost morale.  That was not going to fix everything.  That's what she tried to do.  But she didn't try to do a lot of other things.

Start time: 1657.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

She got it made art of desk efficient.  So they thought she could do the same thing for Yahoo.  What the kind really needed is someone with more vision that can set a direction.  The problem is, when they tried that last time, that was with Jerry Yang, the co-founder.  And while we all like in Silicon Valley, love having co-founders, CEOs.  He didn't succeed. He didn't succeed either.

End time: 1854.48

Start time: 1854.54
End time: 1863.44

Somebody I don't remember who probably John C.  of work, so they should just fire them all.

Start time: 1892.20
End time: 1915.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the problem is that the company isn't looking at the long term  gains or looking at short term gains.  And if they don't see them instantly, then they shut something down.  And then I don't think they're I mean, I personally don't see them looking  at the big picture of what, you know, to to to five years from now.  I don't know what they can do.  It's patient. Yeah, they're way too impatient.  How long was Carol there for?  I mean, it wasn't January 2011, not 2009 to now.

And I mean, I was speaking this week with someone  who's working on their social efforts, and they have like incredible opportunities  to kind of socialize some of their media consumption experiences that, you know,  Facebook could try to start to do that.

Actually, the big mistake was when they turned down Microsoft,  which offered thirty one dollars, thirty three dollars.  Yeah, I'm there.  They're currently Yahoo's worth less than fifteen dollars a share.  If they had accepted Microsoft at thirty three dollars.  And they said, oh, no, we're worth more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't I don't know the exact intricacies of what's being argued over,  but I think the whole payoff has a lot more to do with the fact that they fired her  than whether or not she's on the board.  It was pretty clear she wasn't going to be on the board if she's been fired.  I think the company should not.

Transcript:  I could I could run that company into the ground real quick.  All right, Mike Harrington.  Now we got to talk about Mike Harrington.  What is there to say about Mike?  All right, we're done. Let's move on.  I think Ben Parr, if you were thanking Carol Bartz for all the good text,  I think you got to thank Mike Harrington.  He's great. I think this is great.  So so just to summarize, I can't even summarize.  This is something we saw coming  the day that AOL announced the day that Mike Harrington goes on stage  with Tim Armstrong says, you know, we're great buddies.  We're going to it's going to be great.  You knew this was this day was not far off one year almost to the day later.  Yeah. First, he first he slams in gadget, which is Yahoo's number one property.  AOL's number one property saying, you know, they're not journalists.  I don't know what he said. It was ridiculous.  Joshua Topolski and Neil Ipital believe shortly thereafter, rightly so.  In fact, Topolski tweeted, I am so glad I don't work for AOL right now.  Just the other day.  Then what else happened?  The memo, the AOL private company memo that he released immediately.  But you'd expect that. Oh, yeah. He's independent.  In fact, I think that was that's probably good journalism.  But he was rattling the cage.  It looked like he wanted to get out of there.  And of course, finally, he starts the Crunch Fund,  which is a 20 million dollar venture fund that's designed to invest  in the companies that TechCrunch covers.  Now, AOL must have known this was coming because this is what TechCrunch  was started to do.  AOL invested in the fund.  Yeah, and they put 10 million into the 20 million fund.  So it's very confusing.  But then Ariana Huffington, this is the problem.  Ariana says, well, you can't make me have this man.

Start time: 2266.72
End time: 2269.94

Start time: 2276.28
End time: 2283.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so OK, so number one, I assume that the problem, as it's being stated,  is like, well, there's a conflict of interest is bad for the block.  But well, they fired Mike.

Start time: 2283.56
End time: 2293.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then he quit after.  I love that.  I love that.  He said, well, I'm going to quit.  And he said, unless and unless you fire, I can't remember what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was either unless you sell it back to us

Start time: 2296.66
End time: 2318.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or you let us choose the next executive editor, the full editorial control,  full editorial, which I respect.  That's he says the deal all along was we would have full editorial control.  And by the way, all his writers are standing by him.  M.G. Paul Carr, everybody's standing by him  saying we want, you know, full editorial control.  I don't blame them.  Is that possible as an AOL entity?

Start time: 2319.88

She doesn't want to have this media organization that's like she runs the media  empire. That's what Tim basically gave to her, except for this one little one  in the corner.  That's not going to fly.

Start time: 2339.66
End time: 2344.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what he said.  He said, we understand that TechCrunch is a different kind of journalistic entity.

Start time: 2344.90
End time: 2360.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they can't.  So they can't put TechCrunch within AOL or within  within Huffington Post because it is so different.  Right. It's it's it's an opinion.  You know, it's like so they either give it full control or they move on.

Start time: 2360.96
End time: 2371.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've kind of changed my tune at first.  I'm curious what you think, Nick, because the New York Times is famous for.  You're not allowed to invest.  You know, the Times has an investment fund, by the way,  which Mike pointed out, but it's completely separate.

Start time: 2382.08
End time: 2438.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the Times is famous for its editorial independence,  and I still respect the Times for that.  And I think that's a good thing.  And as as a journalist, I thought this is the one thing we don't need.  And, you know, whenever you have a trade press,  whether it's automobiles, stereo, the U.S.  government, whenever you have a group covering a small group,  there's always this kind of problem with getting no, you know, socializing,  getting them know inside the beltway journalism.  And as a tech journalist, I always feel like we have to be way above  suspicion. I mean, it's really important because people, I think, assume that,  well, your advertisers influence your coverage and we can't we certainly  wouldn't expect you to be independent and objective.  And so we really want to.  So at first I was kind of offended by Mike's point of view.  But I've kind of kind of the other way. It's like, well, it's TechCrunch.  It was never intended to be independent.  It was Mike said at the beginning of the day one when he founded TechCrunch,  I just want access to the deal flow.  This is a blog that will give me access to the deal flow.

Start time: 2439.88
End time: 2452.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's certainly there's a number of blogs out there.  And I don't know if the landscape of journalism is changing, obviously,  with with blogs in general.  But is anybody surprised that there's that there's hidden or not disclosed things?

Start time: 2452.48
End time: 2456.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the thing that bugs me that I don't like, which is that Errington says,  oh, everybody does it.

Start time: 2456.56
End time: 2507.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the so this is that's what bugs me.  OK, so I've been at the Times for eight years and I became a reporter two years ago  and made a lot of friends in the tech world in the six years before,  because I worked at the research labs and did a lot of public speaking.  And I remember when I first started reporting for the Bits blog.  And I'm not going to mention any names, but a good friend of mine  started a startup and and gave it to Errington and TechCrunch.  And I called him up and I said, what are you doing?  Like, you know, that I just started and he said, look, it's nothing against you.  But if I don't give it to Mike, they're going to write a negative review.  If I don't give it to him first.  And that happened over and over and over again.  And I don't necessarily think that's journalism.  And that's that's where I have problems.  There are things where he invests in funds and things like that, that I have problems with.  I think he's a brilliant guy.  He made TechCrunch out of literally out of thin air.  But to compare TechCrunch to other entities and to say, well, everyone's doing it.  I don't I don't agree with that.

Start time: 2507.96
End time: 2519.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not fair. Well, in fact, you know, he points to Kara Swisher,  who Liz, you work with, saying, well, he's calling me out as well.  You two. What's your conflict of interest?  Because Kara's married to a Google executive.

Start time: 2519.98
End time: 2537.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm also married to a Stanford student who does.  Well, how dare you? Facebook, which is a company I cover closely.  But I mean, yeah, and I don't like that conflict at all.  And I actually probably would cover Facebook more closely if I weren't always worried about that.  But Kara pointed out, well, look, you can only marry one person.

Start time: 2549.68
End time: 2571.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, there are conflicts of interest everywhere.  I mean, I think if I remember correctly, Mike was arguing when Mike Arrington was arguing with David Carr from the Times.  He brought up an example of when the Times wrote about the Boston Red Sox and the Times company actually owns part of the Boston Red Sox.  I mean, does every single article that that everyone has to do with the way that TechCrunch writes is different,

Start time: 2572.20
End time: 2585.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because TechCrunch writes and a lot of blogs do now.  And I do think I've sensed the distinction of having moved now from GigaOM to All Things D,  where we're really much more careful about stating our own opinions.  TechCrunch has an opinion in every article you read.

Start time: 2585.74
End time: 2639.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll say, I think that's why I love TechCrunch, which is why I love to read it because of that.  Right. Yeah. No, but it's but it's a much bigger journalistic question.  This is not something that should be discussed just within the realm of technology and TechCrunch and the New York Times.  I mean, it's the question of that I think is actually going to come to a head much more now with everyone's on Twitter  and all these journalists that are coming out of school that have this long history of,  you know, I remember when I first started at the Times and eight years ago and I was in a news meeting and I walked out  and I said to one of my editors, I said, what do you think about X?  And he was like, I don't have an opinion on that. And I was like, what do you mean?  Of course you do. Of course you do.  I'm a reporter. I don't have an opinion. I was like, come on.  I was like, you have an opinion. I was like, I know you don't have an opinion.  But he really steadfastly said, I do not have an opinion.  And if you look at my Twitter feed, you can tell I like Mini Coopers or I like M&Ms or whatever it is.  Does that mean I can't write about those things?  Because I, you know,

Start time: 2639.54
End time: 2653.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I think the distinction is what voice do you, you know,  if you want your entity to be a voice of perfect, you know, neutrality on all these issues, then yes, it is important.  But that was never what that was never what TechCrunch was about.

Start time: 2653.70
End time: 2691.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reporting, you know, I asked Jeff Jarvis, because he's a professor of journalism.  I said, is this recent? He said, yes, this happened when we went from having four newspapers in a market,  each representing a different point of view.  You know, newspapers used to be very slanted.  And when they came down to one newspaper in the market, it was decided by the journalistic nabobs that we should be objective.  We are reporting should be objective. There should be no point of view.  It should be merely the facts. Let people decide.  And that's relatively recent. That's within the last 70 years.  So this idea of non opinionated, purely objective is is an artificial concept that I kind of like.  It's not what we do here.

Start time: 2692.54
End time: 2722.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the conflicts of interest brought TechCrunch down.  I think Mike Arrington's polarizing personality is making it impossible for him to be a part of that picture.  And I think he'll do fine.  He was sick of it.  The reason TechCrunch was bought was because he went off stage with an interview with Tim Armstrong and said, I'm tired.  And Tim Armstrong said, how about I take that off your hands?  And now it's a year later.  It's gotten worse for him.  He's had to, you know, now he works at this big corporate company where he has to file expense reports and he hates it.  Right. We knew this would happen.  So now he gets to go be a VC.  Like this is not a bad outcome for him.

Start time: 2722.46
End time: 2727.80

Start time: 2746.46
End time: 2761.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Part of the problem was like he didn't inform Ariana beforehand, apparently.  And Arrington's not the only journalist.  It's also venture capitalists. There's several of them, but they're not the same polarizing figure.  And honestly, if he had named it Crunch Fund, I think there would have actually been a better outcome here.

Siegler and Dave and Paul Caron, all those guys are standing behind the person they respect, who's given them this job and made this name for them.  But I wonder. I think they're very loyal.  They're very loyal. And I admire that.

It's like, you know, I know people that worked for in the Eliot Spitzer camp and their jobs were their careers were pretty messed up because of the selfishness of Eliot Spitzer.  Right. What happens to these guys now, depending on what happens to TechCrunch?  I think that's my question.

Start time: 2800.54
End time: 2888.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's talk about let's move on, because it is kind of an inside baseball argument.  I don't think the real world out there cares.  Although as journalists, we care a lot because it really well we do.  And it's and it really affects.  I think what Mike's saying, and I think probably would agree, is that you can trust our readers if we disclose to make the decisions about how objective the material they're reading is and whether they should judge it.  And we certainly I'd certainly trust our viewers and our readers.  I wish they didn't have to be so, you know, discriminating.  But they do. And the truth is, you know, there was probably always was some bias.  So it's not a bad thing to tell people, look, you've got to consider the source and judge whether that source is reliable on your own.  Yeah. And I think that's appropriate.  I don't think that's inappropriate.  I think that'll be the outcome of all of this.  We live in a new world where everybody has an opinion and you just have to weigh each person and see if you trust that person's opinion.  So AT&T's opinion of T-Mobile is they're awful.  They're terrible. Please let us buy them.  So it's a very interesting argument.  AT&T answered the government's lawsuit.  Of course, the DOJ is asking the courts to block AT&T's 39 million billion dollar takeover of T-Mobile.  AT&T says, well, here's the problem, that T-Mobile really isn't doing very well.  And we want to buy them for the wireless spectrum, not because their operations are so good.

Transcript:  Which we found out, by the way, thanks to a leaked memo, their own lawyers leaked a memo that said it would cost us three point nine billion dollars to get to the 97 percent 4G  coverage that we're claiming is the big benefit of the AT&T T-Mobile merger for 10 times more.  Right. Exactly. DOJ.  I mean, the AT&T says, quote, T-Mobile is losing customers and subscriber shares in a growing market is not a unique or material competitive constraint on AT&T  and will not be one going forward in the absence of this transaction.  In other words, these guys is history anyway.  You really should let us merge.  You know, there is a reason there is maybe some precedent for that, because, of course, the federal government allowed there are only two satellite radio services in the US,  and they allowed XM and Sirius to merge because the argument was they're going to go under without us, without the merger.

Start time: 2965.54
End time: 2985.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't think we're running that threat with AT&T.  AT&T ain't going under. But what if a T-Mobile would anyway?  Well, you know, why not let them go down and then let them AT&T come in and buy it on a fire sale?  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand this.  I would love to have a drink with the one person who thinks it's a great idea and that consumers will win.  Well, we can go over to AT&T headquarters and I'm sure we can find a couple.

End time: 3010.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll find that person, buy you a drink.  In fact, here it is. The merger is good for consumers, says AT&T.  The combination of T-Mobile and AT&T is good for consumers.  Integrating the two networks will free up spectrum and create substantial new capacity to meet the spectacular growth in demand,  resulting from an increasingly online world.  They're just throwing crap in there, aren't they? Just phrases, random phrases.

Start time: 3024.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He used long distance. So apparently, you know, back when AT&T and all those guys first started out,  it was essentially the Internet of the telephone long distance era.  And there were thousands and thousands of these companies that offered long distance service.  And AT&T gobbled them all up and ended up having a monopoly over long distance.  And we kind of got screwed, as we always do.  And the same thing could happen again.

Yes, he says, well, the FTC doesn't like me to talk.  But, Tim, I think there is an argument that, yes, it's certainly important to look at history and history does sometimes repeat itself.  His position is that all new technologies start open and then the powers become closed.  Powers that make sure it becomes closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it is and it isn't.  And this is probably a great discussion because the Internet is more resilient because it's an open platform and it's why it's going to end up beating apps probably on mobile devices.  However, the wires that we use for the Internet are all owned by AT&T and Verizon.  Very, very few, you know.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. Ohm's just amazing.  I just I just think he's a great guy.  However, I also think All Things D is fantastic.  Those are two real.  Now, by the way, Ohm was used as an example by Mike Carrington.  Look, Ohm's investing.  How come Ohm Malik gets away with investing?  Giga Ohm gets away with investing and nobody says word one.  And then Mike Carrington does it.  What's the difference?

Transcript:  You know, it's it's it.  I don't think that you can like ability.  Exactly.  It's all about perception.  It's not about the perception.  Yeah. I mean, you know, as a Giga Ohm reporter,  I was totally uncomfortable with that relationship  because it was someone else's conflict that I had to disclose.  That, you know, it's a weird place.  It was not a happy thing for me as a reporter.  I don't want to be put in that situation.  But I think, you know, Ohm has kind of Ohm is not a daily reporter anymore.  He he writes kind of columns about his intuitions, which are often right about.  Well, I read things way far off in the future,  and it's not really about the kind of deal flow that he's doing.

Transcript:  I read Fred Wilson for the same reason.  He's I mean, he's a venture capitalist.  He's got investments.  But I don't read him for his reviews of what, you know,  of a Web 2.0 company and whether it's a good company.  I read him for his insights and I think same thing.  And frankly, I think Mike has insights.  So, you know, these guys are pundits.  We're pundits. I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  Anyway, we'll get back to the conversation.  And I want to know why Nick Bilton thinks Apple should buy Sprint  and how we can talk them into doing that.  But first, pretty, pretty, please.  Let's talk about carbonite.  It's backup done right.  Carbonite was created. It's an interesting story.  David Friend, who created the ARP synthesizers,  it's kind of a serial entrepreneur, he was enjoying the fruits of his leisure.  His daughter was in college.  She called home and said, Daddy, I lost my term paper.  And he thought, you know, I can't I can't help her.  There's no she's got no backup.  There must be a better way.  So he literally said, I'm going to invent something.  And he invented carbonite.  Kind of nice story, because it goes full circle,  because last year when my daughter headed to college as a freshman, of course,  she went with a laptop and carbonite installed on it,  because I didn't want to get that phone call in the middle of the night.  Carbonite is cool because you put it on.  It's great for a laptop. You put it on and it just starts backing up.  Whenever you're online, it's backing up.  Uses SSL. So even if you're at an open access spot, it's completely secure.  You can add your own encryption, by the way, strong encryption.  So your privacy is guaranteed.  It's cloud storage.  You know, this is cloud storage before anybody even really started talking about this.  You can log into your carbonite account on any computer, on your iPhone, your iPad,  your Android phone, your BlackBerry, and there's your data.  So it's you don't even have to wait for a disaster.  But when disaster strikes, it's just peace of mind.  You know, you can restore seven billion files to date have been restored by carbonite.  Wow. Seven billion for home or for office.  Try it for free right now.  Just go to carbonite.com, use the offer code twit.  You don't need a credit card.  And by the way, if you do decide to buy, use twit again,  because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12 to three months.  It's only fifty nine dollars a year per computer for the home for businesses,  because it's multi computers in multiple locations.  Two hundred twenty nine dollars a year.  It is really the best deal and backup out there and cloud storage.  You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right with carbonite.  Look, she's installing it right there, right there.  Let us move on. All right.  So. Sprint's not for sale, we should point out, although if AT&T acquired T-Mobile,  Sprint would be so far behind, you'd almost have to sell.

Start time: 3416.40
End time: 3460.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sprint's not for sale, but it's it's got a market cap of ten point three billion.  It was much smaller than very recently.  It's shrinking to it's over the last last couple of months.  Its stock has dropped from I mean, it's had a 52 week high of six point four or five,  and now it's at three point four or five.  It's pretty bad. And what they have.  That's too bad, because I love Sprint.  Sprint is great. But what they have is an amazing data network.  Right. They don't have a great voice network.  Who cares? Who uses a voice?  But the next generation of all these Mac products are going to have data in them.  And so if you purchase for ten billion dollars, let's just say they pay  fifteen million dollars, they still have fifty five billion in the bank.  Right. It's like nothing. Apple.

Start time: 3460.78
End time: 3475.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple. Well, and the rumor is that Apple will offer the iPhone five on Sprint  and that Sprint might offer an unlimited data plan.  The last company. And of course, you have to when you're the also ran.  This is why when I keep T-Mobile alive, because being weak is good for consumers

Start time: 3475.56
End time: 3542.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you have to entice them.  I'll tell you what, this is certainly super engaging for me because I still have  the unlimited plan on my iPhone for I got grandfathered in.  But you know, it's just a matter of time.  Well, and that's just it.  And in fact, the thing that kills me about it is that I'm limited.  I can never never tether legally.  And of course, AT&T is now cracking down on people who tether.  I got I got one of those texts saying,  uh, you're tethering bad boy.  And so and so I went a few months without it.  But then I found myself on the way out to DragonCon.  I had to access some files.  And so I installed a PDA net on my jailbroken iPhone,  which is supposed to have a disguise mode.  And it was 48 hours.  They they nailed me again.  And they're like, OK, seriously, you're busted.  And I and I was like, all right, well, you know, it's like if you convert me over  to, you know, a tethering plan, then I'm going to go to another carrier  because what's the difference?  The only reason I'm still here is for the unlimited.  You're talking to a representative.  Yeah, AT&T.  And did he understand what you were saying?  Oh, yeah, no, he knew exactly everything.  He's like, look, I see where you're coming from.  And it's obvious from your data usage that you needed unlimited plan.  If you want to keep the unlimited plan, this is for real is your last warning.  So now I'm on I'm on red line notice.  And I'll tell you, man, if they offered tethering on Sprint,  I'd be over there so fast.  And I'm a 13 year subscriber to AT&T Wireless.

Start time: 3580.92
End time: 3588.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so back to the original point, you want to you want them,  you want Apple to buy them so that they can put data on all their device and say,  like, the data is going on all the devices.

Start time: 3588.68
End time: 3597.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a question, right?  If you look at some of the the rumor sites and things like that,  you can see next generation MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros that have 3G.  They have 3G and 4G chips.

Start time: 3604.18
End time: 3625.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the question is, does Apple charge you for that?  Is that just one more thing you have to pay for?  Or when you start to look at competitors,  they're going to try to get into this space.  And when you start to look at tablet competitors,  which is the biggest deal for Apple right now, you know, when when Android  when Amazon releases their Carla tablet in the next couple of months,  which they're going to do, it's going to have built in 3G.  You're not going to pay for it.

Start time: 3625.84
End time: 3636.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's the other thing is that that if Sprint really does have the bandwidth,  then Apple has the branding that would allow people to pay an outrageous amount  for wireless coverage that just always works.

Start time: 3636.96
End time: 3662.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's here's the problem I have with the whole thing.  Sprint is just the US.  The Apple is and it's CDMA, which means it can only be the it can only be the US.  Like purchasing this thing doesn't really help them outside of the US.  And they're they're much bigger than just the US.  It doesn't solve the overall problem.  They would need a worldwide network.  And there's no acquisition they could make to do that.  They would have to make five, six of them.  And that would cost seventy five to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if T-Mobile's worth thirty nine, thirty nine billion, I think they're worth a lot of money.  But you don't have to be an all cash deal.  Well, Apple stock has got some value.  Apple stock has got some tremendous value.  You don't have to say here's a check.  You can you can work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, AT&T has a market cap of one hundred and sixty four billion  completely out of the question.  But I wouldn't buy AT&T if they were like twelve bucks.  I mean, no offense to AT&T.  But but but maybe they have maybe the strategy is that they focus on the US for that.  And then they have a 3G chip that works across overseas or something like that.

Start time: 3699.18
End time: 3703.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 3704.80
End time: 3714.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So the other problem with the strategy is if the partners will get pissed  and they'll just be like, we're not going to sell your iPhones once you sell it.  And that that's oh, come on.

Start time: 3714.30
End time: 3720.20

So here's here's the question is, you know, it would be smart  because Tim Cook would be in a way saying, hey, I'm I'm a player.  Yes, it's not just Steve Jobs.  I'm I'm in this game.  Yeah.

Apple employee, an engineer, works for the company.  Just kidding. Yeah.  Yeah. Well, that's curious. I wonder, you know, I mean,  if you accidentally post a picture from an iPhone five, if you get in trouble.

And it's pretty clear that is either a Sony set, eight megapixel sensor  or an eight megapixel sensor from another company that Apple uses called Omnivision.  That the that's because even though it was a cropped picture,  that the full the XF showed that the final dimensions, the big dimensions  would in fact be eight megapixel.  Yeah, I don't know.

Then all of a sudden, the whole world becomes obsessed with 1980s geek culture  so that they can try to decode where his Easter egg is.  So as a result, you have these bizarre mashups where you have  Dungeons Dragons playing, you know, playing joust against, you know,  while flying around and X-wing fighters.

When they couldn't get Yelp, they created Hotpot.  Remember?  Right?  Not much traction.  What Google really wants and where the big cash of course is for is if you start using Google  to find places to eat.  And perhaps, and there's some concern from Open Table that Google might even do a reservation  system built around this.  There's a lot of money for Google in that kind of local search.  But the problem is right now that Google can create something like places and Hotpot,  and it's got no traction because we've got other things to use.  Correct.  We already use Zagat.  So you think they're buying from you?  You use Zagat?  Oh yeah.  Zagat.  When I was in Paris for LeWeb, I was in a hotel.  I was saying, well, is there anything good here?  Zagat has it and you just go there.  I use Zagat in every town that they're in.  I think that what this does is it gives them some credibility.  It gives them a brand for Hotpot or places and then makes their local search relevant  and valuable.  So I think $125 million, that's a deal.  That's nothing.  That's interesting.

They're going to be, like I said, they couldn't get Yelp, but this gives them  It's better than Yelp.  Yeah, very, very credible.  And there's a lot of ways they can integrate that.  I don't remember what they were offering for Yelp.

But there's all these new and emerging interesting restaurant review and recommendation apps.

Transcript:  OK, so there's some really cool features to Foursquare,  and like with the Explorer.  And I'm friends with Dennis, so I should probably preface that  so people don't write a blog post about me or something.  But like, so the Explorer here, you can,  there's like these neat little features where you can literally type in Thursday  in Explorer, and it'll tell you all these really cool things that are going on Thursdays  in the area that you're in.  And I feel like it's more.

Transcript:  No, this is where Zagat is a brand that's so valuable.  Is you, as a Zagat user, will go to the web, or yes, you're right, or fill out a form.  You'll have, if you have the book, because he started in these long red books that everybody bought.  Remember those?  Remember books?  Yeah, remember books.  Nope, not to you.  Zagat is a brand, I think, that made the transition of the web into the smartphone quite well, actually.  Yes, and it did do a good job.  And they did charge 10 bucks and it was worth it.  And once you buy it, you'll realize it really is the way to go.  Not Yelp, because the problem with Yelp, Hotpot, even Foursquare, especially Foursquare.  Have you seen any new ones like Ness or Nosh or Alfred?  No, and what is it, Foodspotting?  The problem with those is the reviews are spotty.  They're all over the place.  For some reason, the Zagat reviews are reliable and trustworthy.  So I think that this is the brand, and I think it's a smart brand to buy.  It is, it's the photos of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because unlike Yelp, where anybody, including a competitor, can put a review,  with Angie's List, those are not anonymous.  And same with Zagat, they're not anonymous reviews.  And I think that that's what makes a difference.

It was one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had because  A, I found a great restaurant in a giant city.  That's great.  Via Twitter and then I met people, which was really fantastic.  That's fantastic.  That's something though, again, like what you do, that is I think  most people don't have the skill set or the desire to do that or the Twitter followers.  It's just the...

Start time: 5342.58
End time: 5358.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And first of all, the setup for this would be like that's what everyone called Microsoft,  more evil than Satan himself.  At some point, if you did a search, then Microsoft came up as the number one thing.  So their rebuttal to that is now on Bing, if you type in more evil than Satan himself,  you get, well, I guess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  That's the fake word that Google made up to see if Bing was copying your search results or not.  And then once this started showing up, they're like, aha, we nabbed you, Bing.  And so Bing, thinking that it's petty and whiny, responded with...  Now when you search for that word, it shows up as a translation that the word is orcish.

Start time: 5410.34

Start time: 5844.40
End time: 5847.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this because it confirmed what intuitively I think we all thought and noticed.

Start time: 5847.98
End time: 5851.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I did not think this was intuitive.  Would you explain these results, Nick?

Start time: 5851.62
End time: 5878.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So Hillary Mason, who is the lead scientist at Bitly and probably has bigger brains than all of us put together,  did a study where she took a thousand of the top links that are shared on Bitly,  and most links are shared on Bitly now,  and she looked at the lifespan of the links,  and an average lifespan of actually a regular link is around three hours or so.  Three hours.  But if it's a breaking news story, a link only lasts for about five minutes.  What do you mean, say last?

Start time: 5878.90
End time: 5886.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Keep in mind, they're saying the half-life of it,  which means like half of all the links it's ever going to get have already happened.  Correct.  After three hours.  Yes.  Five minutes.

Start time: 5886.24
End time: 5887.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that long-tail thing doesn't really even apply.

Start time: 5887.32
End time: 5896.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it clicks or appearances?  Clicks.  So if you post a link somewhere, is this true of a news article as well as Twitter?  So it's the same theory with everything,

Start time: 5897.46
End time: 5905.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  except YouTube, but we'll get to that,  where you have the spike and then it lasts for the half-life of a certain period of time  and then it falls off indefinitely.  So you don't get a rebirth.

Start time: 5906.64
End time: 5918.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In general, a link that's published somewhere  will get half of all the clicks it's ever going to get in the first three hours.  Correct.  But if it's news-related, it'll get half the clicks it's ever going to get in the first five minutes.  That's what surprises me.

Start time: 5919.04
End time: 5936.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five minutes.  So what's interesting though is it's different on different sites.  So Twitter, the average, the half-life is 2.8 hours.  Little less.  Facebook is 3.2 hours.  Little more.  And email and instant messages are 3.4 hours.  So if you want a link to last a little longer,  you'll get an extra 24 minutes if you post it to Facebook.

Start time: 5937.31
End time: 5940.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that works?  I mean, like, that's a strategy?  That could be a strategy.  I mean, it definitely is.

Start time: 5941.30
End time: 5972.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, after the research indicates that,  and I remember, oh, doctor, Owen JJ Stone was talking about this research about Facebook anyway,  like a year ago, and that's when I finally started working on my Facebook presence,  because number one, of course, they've got, you know,  we learned that finally there's 100 million Twitter followers, users out there.  But there's 400 million on Facebook.  And, you know, so I started working on the Facebook for that exact reason,  because they will go back and they'll mine,  because people on Facebook are constantly looking for even old stuff.  They just want new content.  I wonder what Google Plus is.  That's a really good question.

Start time: 5972.94
End time: 5995.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that this is surprising.  I mean, I think it's great to have numbers attached to it.  But if you think about it, I mean, Twitter, I would actually expect Twitter to be shorter,  because it's a constant unfiltered stream.  Facebook, on the other hand, gives some weight to it.  I think Nick was mentioning YouTube was the longest, but that makes sense.  A link that's shared on YouTube, it's not really the same as sharing a link  as a status message on somewhere else.  It would probably be a link shared in the context of a video,  and a video has a longer shelf life.

Start time: 5995.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People return to that again.

Start time: 5997.00
End time: 6014.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't think that this is particularly surprising.  I think it probably tells you that if you're in a medium, like say email,  where you're expected to kind of come back after a few hours and read all of it,  you have a better chance of someone getting to it.  On Facebook, like where they do a little more filtering,  if it's interesting, it'll stay at the top.  On Twitter, it keeps going, it keeps scrolling by, so you're not going to see it.

Start time: 6015.48
End time: 6018.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6019.20
End time: 6021.78

Start time: 6027.22

Transcript:  But I do agree.

Start time: 6028.04
End time: 6036.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, but even so, I still think five minutes is pretty amazing considering...  I mean, this is a Washington Post link that she's referencing.  Five minutes later, it's done.

Start time: 6036.68
End time: 6052.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not saying that the story goes away, it's saying that that particular link...  So for example, we could both be linking to the same story, okay?  But let's say Leo looks at his feed, five minutes ago, Brian said something about an earthquake,  one second ago, Nick says something about the earthquake,  he's going to click your link, the most recent one.

Start time: 6052.54
End time: 6054.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Correct. I rest my case.

Start time: 6055.56
End time: 6058.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's the same article is what I'm saying.  I'm saying the article doesn't go away.

Start time: 6058.08
End time: 6063.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually different articles, I think, at that point,  because there's so much content flowing through and there's so many retweets and links.  I think the link makes them more canonical.
