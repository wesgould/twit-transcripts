Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After you ladies gentlemen welcome to another fine edition of twits Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you breathing heavy in the background this week? Does that mean am I the my the breather this week?  There's always somebody breathing heavily. I think you're the breather this week. Oh, I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is your favorite tech podcast Leo Laporte breathing heavily Kevin Rose hiding in the darkness with his lockpick kit Robert Heron looking around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is cold will not go away? That's cuz you're smoking Robert. It's menthol baby. It's a curse. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thursday Thursday afternoon. I look somebody square in the face and say I never get sick ten minutes later  It just hit me God. I think it was me you looked at and said you wouldn't get sick by the end of the day  I was miserable. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got a knock on wood, baby. Well if you never do get sick, then you wouldn't be sick now now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No logic their doozies when I do get sick their doozy, so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Robert you got the lead story today Microsoft warns on security  What are they like 42 updates are coming out on Tuesday for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's get to the point where pretty much any time you turn on your Windows machine  It's gonna check for an update and find one. So right. What is it? What are they saying come Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have ten more updates. This is the regular they do it every second Tuesday of the month and they've you know  What do you guys think you think this is a good idea or not?  I mean for a while it was it was the patch of the moment and then they said well wait  Maybe we just better do it once a month, but then that leaves you kind of open for a month, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what bugs me is the fact that you know anybody who's updating their system if they have if they don't have a broadband  Connection they either have to wait for 42 hours for the download or order the CD to get service pack one or service pack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two a good a good way to get around that though is to just leave your system on overnight huge percentage of America does not have broadband

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's time to change. It's time to get some broadband 52% of America has broadband now. That means 48% doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. I mean, it's it's still pretty close to 50-50  But in the case of Windows updates since service pack to it  The system encourages you by default to have your automatic updates turned on and the default time  I believe is it like three in the morning  So if you just left your system running overnight your that usually solves the problem of slow connection if you if you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's the why are they waiting till just you know one one day a month to do this?  Why not just stage them throughout the month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see it as such a bad thing really you consider that most of the the hacks that they're fixing or security holes that they're fixing  Are are cutting-edge threats that perhaps you know  Maybe it would take another month of being out in the wild before a serious threat could be mounted  But they're gonna have a patch out that hopefully we'll cut that off ahead of time unless it's like, you know  A seven-year bug or something that's been there forever and it's been in any version of Windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, are they sticking hard and fast to this though?  I mean if something comes out say on the Wednesday after they do their major patch for that month  Are they gonna release it later or they're gonna have to wait a month to get that patch. They're gonna wait a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. That's what they've been doing if it's ultra critical though, won't they throw something out there immediately? I think they will but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently nothing's been ultra critically yet. Tell me I mean that really it isn't widely known until  Microsoft releases the patch anyway, right?  I mean how widely known as these are these exploits once the patch comes out everybody knows about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think for the professionals out there who who infect machines for money  They're aware of this stuff because it's in their interest  But I think for the general amount of script kiddies out there are people who simply take an easy-to-use tool to cause mayhem  I don't think they're gonna be seeing or be able to use any of these exploits

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hopefully in time because of things like automatic update. Well, I'll give you I mean, here's part of the problem  Look, I just my hard drive just died and I'm reinstalling Windows and I had a Windows image. Thank goodness  I used ghost to make a Windows image of the install so I didn't have to go through the full install  But it's a service pack one image. So the very first thing I do before I even go online  I tell everybody to do this  I install service pack to halfway through blue screen at death the things dead and I have to reinstall all over again  No wonder people don't want to install patches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can download service pack to as a standalone idea. That's what I do. I have a standalone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  172 megabyte file on a CD didn't stop a blue screen of death

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Infuriate that sucks. Yeah, no kidding. Is it an was it an older piece of hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the same piece of hardware that was running the same image and service pack two before I don't know what happened  All of a sudden, it's just you know, we're it used to work and then work anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I went through literally two weeks of pulling my hair out trying to figure out a problem  I was having and it turned out it was a power supply related issue  Ah, and I went through two seemingly brand new power supplies that people had given me and I finally went on bought one of my  Own and guess what?  It worked as soon as I know dropped one that I had pulled out of a package you never I mean this it's such a complex  System, you never know what's wrong. Yeah. No, that's why I love the shuttle boxes. Everything's pre-wired and I just drop parts in it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and that's the advantage Apple has they make their own power supply me where they spec their own power supplies  At least you know what you're getting yeah proper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean any reputable PC vendors also testing their equipment before they ship it out as well  Hopefully catching we can only most of it the more it's directly rated to how much you pay though the more you pay  I'm sure the better they are tested  You have you know the high-end PC gaming companies or gaming PC makers out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any evidence that an alienware or Falcon Northwest is more reliable?  I mean you sure pay a lot more for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Know exactly what they do to test those systems and it's about as rigorous as you can think of each and every one  Yes, that's good, especially well one company in particular  I mean, I don't want to name names  But they were talking about how they put every system through a five-day test and 24 hours a day  Trying to break it and they're they're fearful of things like driver updates because you know  They're worried that the new drivers might introduce problems. I take the opposite approach  I say they're the driver updates in particular for graphics cards are really necessary just because  There are so many little things that could happen when you code a big game nowadays that could cause a problem or a bug or a  crash or or performance so  Frequent patches and driver updates in particular for the gaming scene is just critical

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're really two different schools of thought aren't there?  I mean if you never change your computer and never install anything, it's always gonna operate the same way or  You update everything all the time and hope and pray that's gonna continue to work. I don't know. I don't know which is the right way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny  I've been going back and forth because I think you know  It's always nice to build your own computer spec everything out  You know what you're getting and then it is nice to buy something that's already pre-built for you  But my problem the biggest thing that just drives me nuts is that all these pre-built computers come loaded with so much crap software  Oh, it's just I got an IBM ThinkPad and there's like 30 applications  I will never use you try and uninstall them and the system gets all nasty. That's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the first thing I did on this tablet PC was uninstall half the stuff that they came with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Can you reinstall the app the OS easily? Is it just using Windows XP on your tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, see here's the well with mine  I was gonna say with with the ThinkPad it comes with another image on there  It has all that crap already installed on the image. So when you try and restore the image you restore all the crap  They don't give you the original Windows XP CD. So none of them do that. Actually some of them do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm okay  So I have a HP tablet and it has tablet edition the problem with this one is it has no spindle  So you you you can't install anything unless you do it over the network or you make a disk image or you know  Some sort of some sort of massive hack and then it has this thing called altiris which is a backup  But it backs it up to another hidden partition on the hard drive. So as long as the hard drive doesn't die  I'm okay, and it's a constant backup. So what's nice about that is I can  Make any modification the system like uninstalling these things and it will modify my it's like a system restore  It's like a global system restore. So that's pretty good  So now I've uninstalled all that crap and now I have an image of that in a sense  I can go back to that point in time the uninstalled but I don't have any you know  They gave me a Windows disk. But what am I supposed to install? I can't that's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like to the less you pay for a computer the more extra crap you get installed on it  Either through deals made through the manufacturer or something that effect we're in a crap. This is a crap society

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a crap generation there's crap everywhere there's ads everywhere. There's no you know, there's  Cranky old man. That's all  I hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but a lot of what's crap to us like Kevin certainly doesn't want you know  The software running in the background that allows Dell to fix his machine  But you know, there's a lot of insert name of non computer experts here who think that's you know, the bomb true  Hate that stuff. I know I mean it's amazing  What's like buried really deep down in the system that you you don't realize until you wipe the system rebuild it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what are you guys doing for backups nowadays?  I'm gonna get one of those external networkable hard drives that do the retrospect incremental backups

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are you doing the are you doing another one of the one touch the Mac source?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have the Mac store one touch now that it's actually a networkable that has the larger 45 10 100 1000  I think in the back throw it in the closet hide it. So if anybody breaks in they don't steal your data and then  I have to be careful here. You know, I got so many computers and and all this stuff  I try to you know  At least throw hard drive somewhere where you know  If someone breaks in they can't find it and then do your incremental backups to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually building I've got three penium two boxes and one of them I'm turning into a new  Smooth wall firewall and the other ones becoming I'm gonna use probably open filers really cool looking  I think I'm just gonna use NAS light, which is a really cool. Someone is breathing really heavily. It's kind of hot  Gotta be Leo. I know it's just really distracting. It's like having someone breathe in my ear. I'll move the microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just naughty man  Wait till I start farting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just disgusting  But actually it's pretty cool server elements.com is a website and there's you can get downloads on fresh meat that and it's essentially just  Turns a box into a network  Network attached storage box. I'm gonna try that and see if it works, but it's really cool  So they've got a version of it. They've got a they've actually have a version of it that'll do large disk support on older systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool. I am I have I foolishly went out and bought the IO gear boss, which is you know, network attached storage  Router oh  What a piece of crap. I can't believe you bought one of those. I am such a moron. I don't buy anything that says boss on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well boy, I'll tell you we should we should actually have a round of applause for being honest and  Open enough to admit that you actually bought one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean you knew it was a bad idea. I should have asked you first. I didn't know I yes  You should have asked me it seemed like a good idea because I mean, I mean I am  Storage, there's a I'll tell you the flaws though. I'll tell you what's wrong with it. First of all, see here's what I thought  Look, it's got built-in VPN built-in FTP built-in web server  It's a 200 gigabyte hard drive 300 bucks and I have in it's a firewall. It's a firewall  It's a router. So here's what's wrong with it. Mm-hmm crappy router  It has very few port forwarding capabilities really limited kind of stuff  It doesn't stealth it only stealths two ports  It's delts the bios net the bent net bios ports, but it leaves all the other ports are closed, but they're visible  so it's like it's saying shoot me come on get me come on and then  It's got a couple of just like really gross flaws  For instance if the power goes off it stays off the thing doesn't come back on so your whole your whole network storage  Is down right? It doesn't know man and your routers down, right?  And you don't know what's what happened to my network because the power was over you accidentally turned it off or whatever  It it's I mean, it's just there's it goes on and on and on it  It's it's just goofy but I am using it as network attached storage and I've backed up all my  Photos to it and all my music to it and I mean it works for that. It's fine for that  And so that's you know, it's it's a centralized backup

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I plug every piece of a sensitive equipment I have into an uninterrupted power supply including my network here  Yeah, even if the power goes off for like 15 to 20 minutes  I can still sit there and you know finish up what I was doing without worry  Yeah  But it's it should but true if it totally drains at least my router comes back on and everything just resets, right?  The worst thing I have to worry about is maybe getting a different IP address next time around a router shouldn't you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go away and not come back when the power comes back. It just doesn't make sense. Anyway, it's it's disappointing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's overpriced and it's just as far as file backup goes. Do you guys ever use like the offline files app?  That's built into Windows itself  My I believe my IT department at work has a way set up on our local network that anything I drop into my documents  We'll get backed up to a mirror my documents folder sitting on my drive  So I use that frequently and I do that on the Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have they have an iDisk backup on the Mac that I do it automatically sinks your iDisk that has the advantage of syncing  It to all of the Macs that are that you're using so I have access to the all the same files on all of my computers  Which is kind of nice and it makes local cut it is yeah, it's a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I mean you only get 250 Megs if you mess with Google's like using a Google program to use a Google Drive  As a remote storage Google file system Google that's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean like say you I mean not their file system like their OS that they use internally but using like a the two gigs you  Have as a as an emails for online storage. Yeah, it's slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually I mean people have been talking about that  But I just haven't tried doing I would see anybody's actually running it  But you mean the download that you can use to back stuff up and automatically email stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No  Where it simply just takes a Google account you have and uses it as two gigs of remote storage like a drive  Let you can actually give it a drive letter and right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how does it what I want to know is how it spans the files because you've got a limit to the amount you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Attach to an individual email at II. Yeah, I've used it before it breaks it up into small little five  Megabyte chunks and then gives it a little ID in like the subject and then uploads them one at a time  It's just all transparent to the user. I mean behind the scenes. Yeah, it's a hack  It's just a silly changes something it breaks everything and then there goes a silly hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo or is it a cheap bomb proof two gigabytes of storage for nothing? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. It's a silly hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are you gonna get it back? What how do you restore it? The only thing that's what it is now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the client software is for? Yeah, that's how the client software works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right you are putting the data out there and if something ever went wrong with that account you've lost them with any other storage system

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See the only thing I'm concerned with is I would want them to use the Google's API in order to actually make this work  If they were using the official like Google API, then I would say okay  Maybe this might work, but they're actually kind of scraping the system and it's it's a little bit of a hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what makes me nervous. I agree  I mean if Google said here's your SDK for saving files on Google, but they're never gonna do that. Oh, that'd be awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. It would be abuse in term probably in Google's eyes. So not the coolest thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well there to their credit. They haven't done anything about it. I mean they're letting people do it  I probably because most people are not doing it yet  Yet. Hey, did you see that the the OS 10 point 4.1 the Intel OS 10 is apparently on the wear sites already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's awesome. I can't wait to get a copy less than a week. I have to get a copy. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If anybody has it there email me  What is this about Apple being a hardware company when now all the focus is on their potential takeover not anymore in the OS world  So who predicted this last week this you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't think it'd be cracked so fast. This forces this forces them to sell it right. It hasn't been cracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has just been leaked off the developer systems, but you couldn't put on the system  No  What I'm saying is they have they have a they have a small number of systems are selling to developers as of the worldwide developers conference  I don't think any of the scary security stuff. They're talking about doing for the release version, which is summer 2006 has been implemented yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you run this 10.4 point 1 on a white box PC now from what I hear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the rumor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was speaking with a friend of mine who's a Mac developer and he was at the conference and he said he actually got a  Chance to play around with the machine. He was looking inside of it and it's just a standard Intel motherboard standard onboard Intel graphics  There was nothing crazy. Nothing special. No special Apple chipset on the board  It was you know off-the-shelf kind of stuff  So I don't see any reason why not at this point anyway until they add that protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See the minute it's cracked if you think it forward it  let's say it is cracked and they somebody does figure out a way to put on a white box then Apple's gonna have to  Do a shrink wrap release of it because otherwise they're losing all this revenue and then all of a sudden they are a software company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know gonna be interesting to see what happens. They screwed the pooch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just not a happy man today Leo. They screwed me. I'm telling you I hate Windows. I hate Apple. What's left Linux?  piece of crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those boot CDs are cool long-lived not picks and the other boot CDs out there. I'm just I'm not gonna install anything ever again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just gonna run live CDs of everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey at least with not picks you'd have about two gigs of apps on one CD  So pretty amazing if you're open office and you're it is it is really amazing. That's the heck I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OS 10.4 point one live CD, baby  How long before that happened tick tick tick tick tick that's a hack that's what I want to see come on guys  I'm waiting for you hackers get going get to work. Let's do a quick search on that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So SEC's pushed up the digital TV signal deadlines. Does anybody care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what is this these is this the consumer electronics guys saying we need money. We're not selling enough HD TVs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's this coming from? Well, basically no, it's it's it's actually standard sets between 25 and 36 inches have to support digital signals by  March 1st  2006 instead of I guess it was gonna be  See March April May June July 1st October or 2006 and then all of the sets  All the smaller sets they're gonna actually convert over seven months earlier than the original FCC deadline  So they basically means they're gonna support  Digital signals on these these are regular standard. These are not ATVs  These are regular standard TVs the the CEA was pushing for this  Yeah, that sounds right the because a lot apparently a lot of retailers were were are convinced that consumers aren't gonna buy  any of the digital televisions, so the the manufacturers didn't want to get stuck with a bunch of  TVs that nobody would buy and the retailers want to get stuck with a bunch of digital TVs  They didn't think they could sell so they lobbied the FCC to force the deadline earlier  For the digital compatibility of the television, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really just to raise awareness with consumers about the to say that you know what everything will transition to digital eventually  Here's why and to get them simply thinking about it because I believe this week  It was reported that Comcast is actually really almost forcing some of their original customers who are sticking with analog only  Reception in the home to move over to digital because then once all the analog  Consumers are done and the system is completely digital they can then start implementing  Digital on every channel and increasing the quality of those digital channels as well through hopefully more bandwidth and the copy protection  Of course, but the whole thing about digital TVs though is kind of like a so what odds are if we're moving to this digital  Environment anyway, who doesn't have a set-top box and that set-top box will do the digital conversion for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't want a set-top box. Don't don't confuse but don't confuse cable and broadcast  This is to convert to digital broadcast technology so they can resell as much as the television bandwidth as possible  Who still watches rabbit ears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See I'm all for that too because that's my favorite form of TV is digital over the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently something in the neighborhood of 30 million Americans

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh lord, but that's what's there watching four channels. What are they watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean they're watching ABC NBC CBS  Fox and then a couple of UHF Indies that's nothing and there's also I mean the other thing is is yeah  But you remember something Leo you're also talking about you know all of the Spanish  You know a huge percentage of the Spanish language channels Chinese language channels Korean language channels that are locally broadcasted communities are still going out on UHF

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or some well and they need to go HD. Absolutely. Let's move. Hey, if you're poor, let's go HD as of today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are 1500 digital stations. There are 1500 digital stations in 211 markets. It's not HD

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's digital TV. Well, which way is it gonna be Leo? You've just argued one way which is no one watches broadcast TV  We should kill it all off and you just went the other direction which is so you're saying this is for people who are watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Broadcast television. Well, who is that? It's somebody who is not the somebody who should be buying a digital TV  It's somebody who's who's watch probably watching a 13 inch black and white television watching Chinese language programming  They need a digital TV like a hole in the head or those of us who watch PBS and HD  Yeah, I think what the real market what's really going on here is they want this frequency you talked about this before with a yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to resell the broad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. They want the 700 megahertz frequencies. It's worth billions and screw consumers screw the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think it has also anything to do with if it gets back to terrestrial broadcasting as a competitive media or medium or getting you  Your TV the way you want it. Do you think that would then?  re-empower the local broadcast stations who are probably being decimated by just the the variety and breadth of cable offerings and satellite offerings  And yeah, you think that would well, you think it's kind of a ploy on their end to say  You know what? We're the local the local stations broadcasters fought this tooth and nail for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really didn't want this to happen and I mean I think broadcast is I mean it is really now just the realm of  Local small-time television, you know, look what happened to Channel 4 in San Francisco true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was that was a there was all sorts of weirdness around Channel 4, you know  But I mean check this out consumer electronics because the CEA obviously has a  Vested interest in selling as many new televisions as possible  Numbers are claiming that 33.6 million which is 12% of the 285 million television sets in the US  Are used to view over-the-air television programming today. Wow, so only 12% of TV sets  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I think this is basically an unholy alliance between the federal government that wants those frequencies back because it's a windfall of billions of  Dollars and the Consumer Electronics Association that wants to sell TVs to people who don't really want to buy them  And and and neither one of them is looking out for the interests of the individual there  But I mean they're both looking out for the interests of big business or big government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think part of what everybody's always wondering is what a set-top converter box is gonna cost  I mean what's amazing is right? This is this is the end of 2006. This is supposed to hit right? Yes, that's soon  Yes, and that's part of why I was thinking about this. That's really soon. Yeah, that's not far away at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's that's 18 months away. The chips aren't cheap digital TV chips, please. Okay a couple years ago  Yes, they were pretty expensive. But when you have cards selling you can put in a PC for well under 200 bucks  Yeah, the chips themselves probably cost no more than say 20 bucks a pop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're also talking the orders of magnitudes and difference in the purchasing amount  I mean, there's never gonna be a huge number of people, you know purchasing the boards for PCs  But I mean, you know if so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in terms of what it would cost then to integrate that into a television that cost it significantly drop  It really shouldn't at this point  It should be a non-issue short of making it look better or upscaling the  Pinched digital feed they're gonna be using trying to cram as many channels as possible into this new bandwidth  They have right and I just I have I've had digital cable or digital even even satellite  That's completely digital and I still see you know visual flaws here and there  It's all changing direct TV has their new direct new direct way satellites going up this year already started with one and they're moving to MPEG 4  Lots of people I talked to you are really taking Comcast HD over some of the other options out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially with the demise of zoom and it's amazing how bad some of the digital cable is that's floating around right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other thing too is that they have digital cable?  Yes  But even if you have the digital cable set-top box less than I believe less than half the channels that you'll receive are in  It are sent digitally  It's still mostly analog on the digital systems and that's part of that problem of still having to support the people like me  Who haven't switched up yet or switched back just because of that?  I like certain things about analog cable as in you know  I don't have this lower third and ugly ass menu system being forced on me or the incredibly slow channel changing that suddenly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jumps in when you're moving to a digital channel system listen. I mean we're talking here's the guy who's the HDTV expert  That was our our HDTV guy and he still watch an analog cable that tells you something about consumer demand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the transition point we're in right now. There's not enough content. What is it of of everyone who owns an HDTV?  It's I think less than 13 percent have actually watched HDTV on their HDTV

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean it was like there's a difference between digital TV and HDTV. Yeah, it's this it's this weird transition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we need digital. We need digital transmission and we need more sources like, you know rentable content, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's common confusion and certainly among consumers and obviously even among experts about the difference between HD and  Digital TV what about now? Let's talk about this broadcast flag, which the courts have thrown out  Isn't this kind of a backdoor way to broadcast flag if we go all digital?  This is the third part of this unholy alliance. You've got government  You've got the Consumer Electronics Association and you've got all the content creators who are desperate to copy protect everything  They don't need a broadcast flag. If everything's digital, they just prevent copying through the digital wealth

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank goodness the courts refused well in theory right but if you're running this  I mean it's gonna be interesting is there's always been a lot more controls on the HD content that there have been on the standard  You know digital version of the NTSC content, you know anything that's widescreen versus anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's four by three. We think of DVD content right now as well. That was digital protected  It happened to have one little aspect of it. That was very weak in terms of its protection  And  Yet there there's a there's a very successful digital format that we've all lived with for quite a while now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, I think that's that by far is the number one digital format and the number one high-quality  Television format. It's not HD. It's ED, but it's it's it's really what most people think  I bet you if you ask people most people think DVD is HD

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true they most people associate it with just the set they're looking at or the display they're looking at and not the content itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny. I have an HD TV and I don't watch anything in HD. Well women's tennis is actually pretty good. But aside from that  I'm just really waiting for kind of like the HD DVDs or the blu-ray to push it  That's what I what I want really want is movies in HD, you know, I can care less about TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was very excited. You know, I had a dish HD unit for review and I saw ESPN HD  Wimbledon I thought oh great Wimbledon. It's gonna be HD TV. I tune in it's NTSC with bars  This is ESPN HD. There's still there even they can't even do 24 hours worth of HD  And and some of them and this is the premier tennis event in the world. It's not it's an NTSC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean that was last year. That's where that's where they the signal you're receiving is 720p or 1080i  But then they add it's basically the original signal  You can see it's letter or a pillar box in the center with their logos down each side

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our ESP ESPN HD guy told me oh, yeah, most of our stuff we ups we up scale  We don't you know, we're not you know, we're turning it into HD. It's not HD  That's the other issue is you're looking at a 1080p a 16 by 4 ratio, but it's not high def content

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's some good programming out there though. The discovery HD is awesome. Monday Night Football is amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you like to watch crickets mate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey NASCAR over half of this season. It's been broadcast in HD and I love it  High speed sports. That's where you really appreciate a good HD feed sports the Oscars big events like that and then movies totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm just happy for you and I Leo that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neither one of us has ever had to make HD broadcasting. I know I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got high def radio coming. I'm terrified. I'd have radios. I mean, it's it's out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I hope it just simply improves the cameraman attributes  I'm sick of shaky cam and the bigger the screen you have the more you notice camera movement  So for everyone out there shooting home videos, it's like don't shake the camera so much use a tripod

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please home videos. It's MTV baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh when you start looking at stuff on 60 plus inch screens and somebody's moving the camera on a lot get everyone  You know reaching for the drama mean. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to change everything  Everything you know is wrong  Leo you sound so I'm depressed I am I'm sitting here trying to get my goddamn windows to work and life sucks  85 to 86 degrees in this Garrett office. I'm starting to feel like Dvorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You start to sound depressed I'm just cranky

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cranky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright well, let's change the subject AMD details early quad core plans story up from extreme tech comm so  Friday they did an analyst briefing  AMD said they are making and this is one of the best quotes of all time quotes  irreversible progress on  Specifically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Multi-core microprocessors and 64-bit processing this guy's going to the George Bush School of Elocution. I don't know  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Hockman is a guy I do a bunch of work for Riddick's Dream Tech  Made to put made sure to put your reversible progress in quotes  Yeah, that's a that just made me laugh, but but yeah  It's an interesting whole idea of like four processors on a chip is a little disturbing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is it is that they're just gonna leapfrog right over the penny MD. I mean obviously this is a you know marketing move  They're not gonna do two they'll do four why why do dual core when you could do four core

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting thought yeah 2006 AMD ships its specific of virtualization and Presidio security technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this aimed at workstations or is it aimed at the servers? Is this desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is more the server end during the first quarter 2005 AMD captured 28% of the total market for four-way servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll see this dribble down to everything though consumer stuff soon enough  Yeah, it's simply that it's cheaper to it's cheaper to build more cores than it is to keep shrinking the process at this current time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just strikes me as kind of capitulation from the chip manufacturers. They're saying yeah  Well, we just really can't get our chips much faster or much more efficient  So we'll just put more of them on a on a die. It's it's like it's a clue just it  And it's and I mean am I wrong or the benchmarks? They're not showing four times the they're good for servers because you're doing  Transactions where you have lots of things happen simultaneously, but they're not great for desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what the Intel guys were saying over and over you know  It's interesting is they were saying like the dual core  The Intel guys were saying the dual core Pentium's you know you're gonna feel a difference as an end user  It's like it's not very benchmarkable at this point. Nobody's using everybody  There's 42 different variations on benchmarks of people homemade benchmarks that people are using but he said that you know  You'll notice a difference and I remember this guy  I used to co-host a television program was a early dual processor system fanatic true  I still was that right it was Leo it was me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I still have my dual Pentium threes, and that's why I know how crappy it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did you see you used to sing the praises of dual processor systems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think dual processor should Leo. I think dual processors fine. It makes a lot of sense  For a certain class of applications server applications  We have it works where there's a lot of things happening simultaneously if what you want to do is burn  3d rendering if you've got a well threaded program in a well threaded OS yes  But but it doesn't really benefit  It's not I would I I do think it's it's it's in a way saying yeah  We just really couldn't make these processors any more efficient  We really couldn't push the clock speed any farther than we have we have no other way to go and  And I just seems to me that it's it's a it's a way of the it's a marketing thing right  I mean, it's more of a marketing thing that it's all marketing stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you rather they would you rather they accelerated to a you know a six gigahertz processor that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  4% faster than the four gigahertz no you're right. You're right. We haven't seen much improvement  I'm still using a Pentium for two point four gigahertz, and it's fine. Thank you. There's a reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a reason why Intel finally backed away from using you know the clock speed numbers, right?  You know if Intel's backing away from using clock speed numbers. There's two things going on there  They're either so frustrated that AMD's you know got what close is it Robert is it 18% of the market that AMD has now?  Wow something like that sounds right. You know they're either so frustrated that that you know that they're either so frustrated  The AMD has been able to to do their thing where they're more efficient processors  Which were killing dinged because they sounded slower because they had a slower clock speed even though they were doing the same amount of work  Right there either. You know it's a twofold thing  They're getting away from that into you know if Intel was saying for years people buy based on the clock speed number people buy based  On the clock speed number and they're moving away from that it means  You know they've gotten to the point where their clock speed number doesn't seem to be very useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't you feel as though that this is a good step though in the right direction  I mean we have so many this is something that Apple did a long time ago with the g4s remember  They couldn't really get the speed of performance that they wanted Apple did that because they were flatlined on their processors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's happened to Intel's happening with Intel right now. Yes exactly exactly  Intel's now in the same boat Apple was a year ago, and and that's what I'm saying is it's kind of a way of saying  Yeah, you're right. I mean we're not going to get to four gigahertz  More to the point I mean you've got Prescott  Which is really kind of a flopped chip because the pipelines were too deep the branch prediction wasn't good enough  And it generates a thousand watts the things like a little you know you could use as a hairdryer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can attest to that I just I just finished building a Prescott Bay system  Did you over the weekend and it is an amazingly hot box and is it fast?  I you know what I had the spare parts, and I built it for a friend  And it is it is fast  But it is one of the you really have to be careful with the heat sink and yeah and use a good heat sink  Because there is a lot of heat coming off of that it under load. It's getting around 75 degrees Celsius  It's like what is that like 160 degrees or something? I'm tempted to liquid cool it at this point  So but that's under extreme load under your average condition  It's down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know 50 sub 50 aren't the dual core chips gonna be really hot are they gonna be hotter too, but they wouldn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Theoretically you wouldn't have to run them as fast or at the same equivalent speed if you just have more of them  And we're still dealing with you know we've had what two decades of OS's and hardware optimized for single thread single CPU use right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just gonna say that with Intel and now AMD doing it  It seems like yes, you know the application developers are just gonna start writing for a dual core in two or four way  And it'll things will you know you'll see certainly hope so remember. It's not the same as twice as fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean a processor that's twice as fast faster than two processors  Because it depends on you being able to split things up  Yeah  I mean if you have the space between the two processor and the threading on the app if they have the choice  I mean you'd want to have a faster processor as well  I mean are we are we not gonna have faster processors is at the end of the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think processors are gonna. I think processors are definitely gonna get faster. Oh, no, what's the record now for switching transistors 600 gigahertz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six terahertz Wow some crazy number like that  And then the scientists are just coming up with the new single atom switching using quantum mechanic or the you know quantum spin  So hopefully we'll have it. You know that's another way. They could reduce heat  It's just you know we're in that they're in that crazy transition time with new technologies coming up for multi-core  We're being teased with you know the upcoming even game consoles now are becoming supercomputers in their own right yeah  And Sony just announced they're gonna have the hard drive out on for the ps3  That will include a pre install of Linux so who knows what you could do with that as well  And like you know most wise people do at this point isn't that interesting that they're actually putting Linux out for the ps3

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a developer box?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they did a Linux for the ps2 when they when they unveiled the network adapter for the first time a couple years back  That was part of their dev kit that included the hard drive as well because the hard drive actually attaches to the network adapter  And that was preloaded with Linux as well, so it was a the ps2 itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know so they've done this before yeah, and this was a development environment was that the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now when you have the power of the cell processor it wasn't so much a I never saw anybody develop using the Linux environment  I was always curious to see what anybody did with it. It was more  I think just to say it could be done like oh  You know what we can compile that kernel to run on this hardware here you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was to say to hackers hands off if you guys read the some of the articles in the PlayStation 3 Linux stuff  Now positioning ps3 is a supercomputer  He says but people won't recognize it as a computer unless we call it a computer  So we're gonna run an OS on it in fact the cell could run multiple OSes in order to run the OSes  We need a hard disk in order to declare that the ps3 is a computer  I think we'll have the hard disk pre-installed with Linux as a bonus Wow  Wow, oh, mr.. Kutegari. I feel like we're 19. We're kutura. Excuse me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good ragi who knows with enough storage that could be the do-it-all box  You know with the right right inputs outputs any of those little new media boxes coming up can do that  We just need the content we need high-definition content damn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just hope Apple doesn't look back at this and say gosh. We should have really gone with a cell processor  Maybe maybe the PlayStation 3 is my next computer. Hey, it's a computer. You know hey here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a computer with the cost of graphics cards. I can't believe how much you shell for a graphics card nowadays

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they gonna have two ATI?  Processors in that ps3 crossfire is it SLI? What are they doing? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No well on the PC side  They have their crossfire motherboards that they're showing off already in the chipsets that support two cards in the same system  And it's a nice advantage that they have over Nvidia's SLI is that the cards don't have to be exactly matched  And what else is there there is and I'm not gonna touch those for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys running the same problems?  I know we tried to do a couple demos on the show  Of the SLI and it was just buggy and certain games didn't work right well at its launch there were some issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing the same thing CPU guys are doing they're throwing multiple processors at the problem must be the wave of the future well  Graphics cards by their nature are highly parallel right right it's a very different kind of environment does the game have to be SLI compatible?  Not necessarily so that so the BIOS handles the threading there seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to be two different ways that are better optimized for open GL and direct 3d gaming in terms of say  Here here are several ways you could think about splitting the screen you could either say the top half in the bottom half you could  Have interlaced lines you could throw a tile system over it and say you know what you do these this row of tiles you do  The next row of tiles there's all these different methods and some work better for different API's than others  And that's that again you're on the cutting edge if you're messing with any of this right now  And you're dealing with the growing pains, so it is being worked out. I think  ATI announced with their new system their crossfire technology. I believe it's called they have I think 12 SLI modes quote unquote  So you know  Until they get it figured out what works best work  What doesn't if you're just riding that that bleeding edge and plus you're probably using close to a thousand dollars for the graphics cards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's it's funny  I had a friend of mine asked me whether or not he should get an SLI system, and I couldn't recommend it  I was just like now hold off  You know wait another year wait till they get all this worked out  Are you are you guys recommending any of these SLI's or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I'd say we're past that very first bleeding edge generation of motherboards that supported it so now there's I'd say  a half a dozen good options out there, so at least at least you didn't buy it right when it first took but  Right now you can only buy Nvidia solution. That's mature enough that to recommend ATI's was just announced  I don't believe you can actually buy anything right now  Regarding that and so you know if you want to live and die on the edge, and you got the money to do it sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we're not really talking about frame rate improvements here  Quality of the visuals right and that's where you see the biggest improvement both so you can't have higher resolutions higher frame rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can either you know have 16x anti-aliasing 32x  You know an isotropic filtering or you could say take that up to 16 by 12 or higher  Huh, and you know where it's gonna become really important is when we have displays that are you know your your 40 50 inch home theater  Display that'll do you know 1920 by 1080 progressive yeah, you want to drive like a 3 megapixel display  At 60 Hertz that's where you're gonna want you know right a beefy system  But when we're talking resolutions you know 12 by 9 and under you know doesn't matter or even up to say 16 by 12  I like 16 by 12 for gaming with no AA on a 19 inch display  I think that's that's that's where I shoot for on my own gaming experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think we're getting a taste of this looking at H dot 264 and 1080p  It really takes a lot of juice to play those things back without dropping frames  I mean you have to have a pretty hefty system  And so it's obvious that what we're going for these new these new video standards are gonna be very demanding definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there is no 1080p format that well there is a 1080p format of course  But nobody is actually recording much in that that you can buy short of like the Windows Media 9 HD

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can do rendering in through 1080p, and that's where you'll see it first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's the real-time gaming in 1080p is here and now yeah it for that kind of resolution a  There aren't that many displays well PC displays can do that resolution of course  But actually getting a 1080p resolution into a home theater display right now is a bit bit of a challenge like for that  I remember I was mentioning last week the sharp aqua so I have in the 45 inch aqua  It's a 1080p native LCD flat panel  Beautiful beautiful display. I love it  The only thing is the only way to send a native the only way to send a native 1080p  Signal into that display is through the RF the digital over-the-air RF connection  You can't hook a DVI you can't do it through HDMI bandwidth too high for no actually DVI is specced up to  Somebody forget the person's name off top my head, but bless them for some of you  If you get links last week for some good information  But turns out the spec for DVI is rated up to 1080p the thing is is that transmitter and receiver hardware wasn't even manufactured  Until March of this year, so and new and and yeah with those record with those receivers and transmitters now  Being manufactured in more quantity we're gonna start to see all the new displays coming forward hopefully support that through digital inputs  Soon but for right now  It's it's really difficult to find a 1080p display that you can input 1080p into outside of the PC style display

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's a hypothetical I'd like to throw at you. I think I've got a new sponsor on the radio show  They don't want to pay me cash. They want to pay me 20 grand in trade for a home theater system  I don't want to have a huge. Yeah. Well, I don't know how far 20 grand will go  I don't want to have a huge honking display. Would you get the awkward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So far, I like it a lot. You know what? It's the first display  I've had in where boom it it the industry standards for color in  Television broadcast and things like that this TV just you can hit a couple of presets boom  You are very close to industry standards just right out of the box and that's very very rare to find in in displays nowadays  So I know that when I'm playing my DVD or watching an HD TV broadcast  The color is as intended by the people who created it. I get it really and for that accuracy. Yeah, it's not bad  But I'm getting in two more displays this week. I'm getting in pioneers new 50 inch plasma  I don't want to take a look at and that's that I find plasma is better for video  Yeah, but if you plan on watching video plasma is hard to beat. All right. Yeah  I mean LCD is coming on but where LCD matches plasma at the the pricing level and the size level  You're it's almost twice as much money, right? Well, I don't mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't need a big I don't want a big honking screen  I just like you looking for 50 inches or no. No, no, it could be smaller than that  I just want a nice screen. I want a 1080p 42. Yeah 42 is fine  I just want 1080p is what I really want and a screen that you can see in the living room  I mean so people can you know, I don't have to sit right next to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one nice advantage of LCD at least for that sharp in  Normal viewing light bright brightly lit rooms. Oh my goodness. I think is awesome  It actually I think it looks a little bit better because sometimes with most LCD technology  You don't get the really really dark blacks and when if you're sitting in a dimly lit room  But it's the bright the brighter the ambient lighting becomes right the  Contrast something looks gray on the screen. It'll get darker and darker looking  So your eyes tend to see things darker the brighter it is within with the ambient lighting itself  So for brightness, yes for you know, all the bells and whistles of a seven eight thousand dollar display  It is I'm pretty impressed. I gotta say I'm writing up a good review of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Robert when I move back up there, can we do a movie night in your lab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds great my lab is currently the size of a closet we're building out a new facility  So as soon as that's done definitely movie night at my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was either that or or get one of those super stable turntables, you know, that's got this special  Liquid hydraulic balancing in there that was about 20 grand so I could either do that or a full home theater system  I don't know. What do you think? I'm buying a fifteen thousand dollar turntable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can  You really can oh, no. Yeah, I listen to I listen to an original like  1947 Louis Armstrong LP on and like a  $15,000 crazy looking turntable with probably like forty thousand dollars for the speakers and at the home theater expo last year  And that was just a that sounds better  You know what? I just in vinyl just sounds neat and it sounded it sounded as good as you could make that vinyl  It's pretty warm. It sounded perfect. Yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah, made you cry  but but please I  Don't I don't need an eight thousand dollar tweeter sitting in my in my you know front pair of monitors  Diamond we milled this tweeter from a block of diamond. It's like great  Yes, it sounds amazing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know. I'm having a hard time really thinking about getting a TV  I just I've been it's been fine without a TV for this time and I'm not sure I want to buy another TV  It'd be nice to have a really good stereo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what at least hold off on the TV decision until the end of the year  It's starting from this month till throughout the end of the year right now  It's when the smallest of the new displays come out progressively or as it follows throughout the rest of the year  You'll see larger and larger displays and by say October November  The biggest of the new displays will be out and then prices fall accordingly. So that's good to know  Okay, so the end of the year  This is the stuff we saw at CES at the beginning of the year and it is some of the best tech  It's the best display technology ever and it's now just starting to finally make it out in the market  So I'm never in a hurry to buy anything when it comes to new displays, which is you know  I'm sure the manufacturers love hearing that commentary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that cutoff date for buying a new but we're really in the transition phase of a television right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it would be good to put it off as long as you can definitely but for the a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know they're looking or they're looking for displays that are sub to grant and or they want something in that price range, too  And that's that's that's that's as challenging to find a good product in that category as it is in any category  It's just the value stuff finding for people  I find is probably the most challenging part of what I do  Because but like I said this those 37 inch LCDs are coming up from Ben Q and Westinghouse and they'll offer  1080p resolutions and they're gonna be priced at around, you know  1999 and I'm really curious to see those those are starting to trickle out right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Patrick sent me a link. Is this a tech TV on this date photo blog? What is the deal on this Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh somebody it's a collection of stills from the site. Wow, this is awesome. Who put this together? I have no idea  It's a lot of it's off of fatty Maddie's jib cab and then the and then the jib camp shots and the spy cam too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see it. What's the URL? It's a text America photo blog text TV  techtv-  otd dot text America comm it's tech TV on this date dot text America comm and it's kind of cool  It's like, you know, what's going on what happened on this day in tech TV history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of sad really. I have a quick question. What's so how long should I wait before buying a new?  Should I just wait till Christmas season or the first of the year January of 2006?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you'll see all the new displays that come out by Christmas and you'll want those so bad that it'll put you off another six months

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See I need a I'm gonna have I need a TV in like July, dude

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I hear you in time for the in time for the start of sports season. So what what do we get?  What size are you looking for? You know, what kind of space do you have like in terms of do you need a flat panel?  Or do you need a rear projection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still okay. I'm still think CRTs are the best deal for the money right now, especially if I don't write room  I'm tempted to buy a projector because the place I move into a lab space on a wall for to use a projector  I don't like the angle issues with with most of the projection rear projections. I've seen I don't want to pay  I want to keep it like under $2,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I I've I reviewed a 32 inch LCD panel this week or last week. That was a pretty damn good  Overall, I had some definite issues, but image quality and detail even in a brightly lit room was was amazing and it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $1,100 so whose was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was from a wind book actually it had some significant  It had some very specific issues that I kind of railed it on but as a display for HD content  I was I was very impressed and you consider that price point though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is that the one that had the shutter in the when it was doing the NTSC stuff? Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This actually had a stretching problem or scaling issue when it came to standard definition content  You know if that really really bothers you that would that I think would be a major turn-off for getting that particular display  But it but for HD content it was spot-on for most component and DVI based content  It was spot-on and the detail I found it was just phenomenal  But again that price at 1,100 bucks say you're really good CRT based TVs  You know, we're gonna weigh about a hundred pounds more a couple hundred pounds more and they're right about that same size for not much  You're not gonna save a whole lot less by going CRT at that point  So it's we're really getting to that interesting time where flat panels are gonna really I think of one technology or another take over the CRT  Finally and rear projection technologies. It's just they're too big and not sexy enough. You are not sexy enough. You must leave now  You know, you know what though the when I left CES at the beginning of the year  I was still convinced that CRTs in the in the 30 inch range 30 to say 36 at the max  I guess were your best value in HD TV because you get them for around 800 bucks or so  but now that we're seeing LCDs of  Increasingly better quality and improved quality coming in at prices under a thousand now or right around a thousand dollars  Yeah, I just don't see it being very much longer before a flat panel technology of some kind will satisfy you at a price  You can afford and you know within a few years that'll just mean bigger and better for everyone  But it's years down the road, right? But if like I pointed out was it that Toshiba that Toshiba CRT was awesome  I don't know what the hell I'm saying anymore  I'm drying out. I'm parched  It's a head cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is this about my cold medicine? What is this about DVD decrypter? What did it go out of business?  What happened the websites down right? They got a cease and desist. You're kidding. Yeah, they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know who it was  They gave him the cease and desist as it just sounded like okay, we're done. We're really done this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like three two one studios. They're gonna think they give it to the wrong guys though. Did you guys I never used decrypter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was always a shrink guy. What about DVD shrink now? That's and they were based out of the UK. That's still there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I downloaded it today and that's free, right? Oh, yeah  So was that the problem was that DVD decrypter was a company were was it a lightning UK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a huge huge fan DVD shrink and let's see  basically  They were given the cease and desist and anyone hosting the file was told to take it down and the person who is the author of  The application said that you know what?  They don't have the time or the resources the resources are the big one to put up any kind of defense against this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, the CD free he the CD freaks posted a letter. He wrote he's like if if you know, three two one studios  Can do it can't do with millions. What am I gonna? You know, what chance do I have to fight?  Although the the rumor is that the rumor is that Sony served him the notice  Cuz and that the slash time is the best quote as it is rumored that he broke their new copyright protection within 72 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that was my favorite thing about that app didn't matter what DVD you had a hold of you could just  Strip it get it on your hard drive and you don't have to worry about  Region codes or you know, do I need the disk or am I gonna scratch the disk? Sure can be a pirate tool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everything can be a pirate tool is this the part where we remind our listeners that this is a  Violating copy protection is a violation of the DMCA

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very useful for personal backup, you know, what's sad is that Canada which has up to now not had that  Copyright rule that you can't reverse engineer encryption is about to pass a law next week that will make it the same  and you know where this all comes from is is a  WIPO the world intellectual property organization, which is a United Nations a United Nations group and  White white boat essentially is setting the patent and trademark law for the world and  Encouraging all developed nations to go along with I was talking to Cory Doctorow this week  He's a you know, we always used to have money from the electronic frontier foundation  He actually is is an observer at white bow at the United Nations  He says the problem with white bow is even though it was a UN Chartered organization and their charter was to promote  You know the sharing of  Of information it was pretty much controlled by intellectual property companies like the Motion Picture Association of America  They're supposed to be non governmental organizations NGOs nonprofits  But it's the MPAA and the RIAA that's on white bow and they got their agenda pushed forward which was you can't backward  You know, you can't reverse engineer copy protection. So now Canada is going along for the run. It's really sad  Because there is a fair you there's a legitimate fair use purpose to making backup copies of your DVDs  Totally, I don't think Roberts pirating DVDs to sell them on the streets. He wants to make backup copies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's it's not selling it on the streets that they care about so much as you know  It tore it and peer-to-peer, but you're not doing that Robert. Are you you know, no never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know Robert isn't and if he was he never admit it. I wouldn't do that period. It's just it  I'm a quality whore  It's like I have to have things in pristine quality and I'm not gonna put up with any shaky camcrap  Nor am I gonna give away something I paid good money for you know  I buy seasons of of shows I like because I like having it in that good quality that's commercial free  It happens to be as well  It's another reason I like watching DVDs and there are good legitimate reasons to make backups that yes one  Sometimes I run into region code problems where I get a disk from overseas and I want to watch it and I either have  To give up on my PC  I have to change the drive where you only get five times you can do this before the drive becomes  Unchangeable again, or I have to use some piece of software to get around a region code  Or I want to watch it say on my PSP or I want to watch it on a portable format  Or I simply don't want to have the disk with me Hollywood and the and the and the people who own the content give me  No other option and I'm tech savvy enough to be able to get around that and you know  I don't think twice about it personally and you're not alone  There's a lot of other people like you yeah, but there's also a lot of people that are it's like if they gave it to me  At a fair price. I can't even buy the original Star Wars anymore. Yeah, so how is it stealing if they're not even selling it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo you're saying you know we're the well-behaved people that are disciplined and only back up copies for our own use  You're not the people that try me you get regulated by default  But you know I mean how many how many millions of people I mean look there's no way to  There's no way to establish the relationship between you know file trading and piracy and lost sales right however  You know I you know how many people you know and you can get into the whole well  I'm just sampling I buy a CD if I like it, but if you think about it  There's an entire generation you know of teenagers that look at you like you're on crack if you talk about buying music  You know because they download it all I mean it's it's gonna be interesting to see you know is there are there legitimate issues yet?  Do I think broadcast you know television going after people for for doing file trading on broadcast episodes is kind of ridiculous  Yeah, you know do I understand why cable companies are wigging out you know HBO or somebody would they be upset if?  Deadwoods being traded online I can see why they'd be upset because they want to sell the DVD box set

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the music kind of get the music industry got smacked with it first and that drove them to immediately start well at least nowadays  You can for a fairly low price buy music online, and it's an increasingly competitive  Space as well which I think is gonna be good for everyone, and I I hope that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Online music sales most of its things most of online music sales horrible  I mean is the selection bad rights the access the quality is atrocious compared to a city

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know we get around that though to Pat  I mean  I've been using a him to decrypt all of the music that I buy just so I can you know do what I want with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do too. I just hit jay him, but if the quality is not there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm using the higher quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought I've bought eight or nine hundred songs on the iTunes music store  It's not like I'm not giving them my money believe me  They're getting my money, but I don't want any copy protection on it, so I jay him at all right you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say isn't Jay him amazing. It's a great little app now by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is no guarantee that once we've Jay him this stuff  Apple won't make some change to their DRM that makes it all unusable and and frankly I know it's ripped it all out though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right it's just an it's just a what is it a MP or M4a right now?  It's a completely. I mean you can never tell that it was ever there to begin with that's not true because we don't know exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What stuff Apple's putting in there?  So there could be other things that aren't being stripped out the only really safe thing to do at this point would be to convert  It to an mp3  And then you wouldn't have which by the way Jay him will do automatically and then you're safe because it's no longer an AAC

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of any stripe you know yeah, I'm not too worried about it  I'm just gonna keep it you can always bet you know the Jay him does a backup for you  Have you seen that working right it to a different directory you can take it offside if you want the safe thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is make a backup copy of the original unmodified AAC so you if Apple does flip a switch you can get back to where you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love how you can deauthorize without actually deauthorizing have you seen that well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is you know I started using Jay him and one of the things that scare me a little bit is  It off you you know in order for it to decrypt you have to get the keys in order to get the keys you have to  Authorize a computer right so instead of actually authorizing your reeling computer it makes up a fake GUID  That's random you authorize that GUID and then it's an additional computer  And you can you know get the keys the problem is you know?  You can either do it temporarily or a long term all of a sudden you've authorized five systems  You know instantly and and they even warn you don't do this a lot because it might catch track attention from Apple  That you're authorizing deauthorizing authorizing deauthorizing  So I think it's one of those things you want you want to do  And then you know  Decrypt everything at once and get it done with because and then and then by the way  Unauthorized because you've got a bogus computer. That's authorized. It's fun. It really works great  I think it's a great solution the man trying to keep us down  It's just because I want to put it you know why I'm doing it  I want to put it on that file server that piece of crap boss  And I don't want any copy protection on it because and that's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the only reason Leo went to prison for our sins

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to be a martyr. I want to see some free Leo t-shirts. I'll print the free Leo bumper stickers
