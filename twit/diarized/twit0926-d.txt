It's great to have Alan Malventano back in the house  I have to keep up the standards. It's great to have Alan Malventano back in the house  Longtime host at this week at computer hardware our twitch show. He was at Intel  He's an SSD guru Intel spun off his current company  Solidime  Which now makes the Intel SSDs except they're  Solidime hi Alan  I liked it so much that I  I liked it so much that I  I liked it so much that I

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I liked it so much that I was not part of the spin-off and joined them anyway. Oh, that's interesting

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah  also  Submariner  Naval intelligence officer former NSA analyst did I get that all right?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Just get all over the lifetimes

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because that NS that NSA analyst is helpful these days, it's good to have somebody who's had experience on the inside  Yep, welcome Alan. It's great to see you also from semaphore.com  Good friend Louise Matsakis is here. She writes about tech at  Semaphore I just good to see you  Alio, how's it going? Welcome. Did you ever are you now or have you ever been an NSA analyst?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  No, and I have never leaked anything private in a discord server is your first name reality. No, okay

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that story is a fascinating story and getting weirder and weirder as time goes by we'll talk about that a little bit  Also here not his first time but the first time in a long time Yanco Rutgers  Who is you you may remember him from giga ohm and then variety and then?  protocol

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  That's pretty much it I get them all there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's great to see you and go he has a great new newsletter called low pass  Which has it that's a clever name filtering the future  But you've always focused on the streaming and media and as you said the the confluence between technology and media and always great  Topics and great content. So thank you for being here. It's great to see you  I've been you know, like you're here in spirit many shows. We often quote you  So appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah always well, you know when variety  Was smart for variety to hire somebody knew about technology because it you know, it really is an entertainment magazine  But but the world has changed. I guess we should talk about  The writers strike because that's on in full force started this week  Already, you know, there's a big back and forth between the writers and the TV and motion picture producers  The the big changes that they're striking over are  Revenues from streaming which don't trickle down to the writers particularly and AI  The writers are very concerned probably reasonably so I don't know that AI will  Either take their jobs or supplement their jobs  And one of the clauses they were hoping for in a new contract was one that prevented AI from going through their old scripts and creating  new scripts  from them  Last week somebody pointed out that how many how many years of the Simpsons are there there's hundreds of Simpson scripts  It would it be possible for something like chat GPT to write a new one based on all the old ones  Anyway, the motion picture and television producers  Seem very reluctant to negotiate on AI. In fact, all they their counter proposal was we'll have a yearly meeting  Let's talk about it  We'll get together

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Presume you kind of talk to people in the WGA about this. How serious is that concern for about AI?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I think it is serious and I think they're also  Sometimes it gets played off as oh  It's just these people who are afraid that robots are taking their jobs or something like that, right?  But they are having very valid concerns  I think one one of them is what happens when like AI goes through old scripts and maybe even rejected scripts  Maybe a student is gonna tell you oh we like what you did  But we're gonna go with something else and that something else happens to be an AI version of a script  That's trained on your script. So that would kind of suck for writers, obviously  But I think the bigger point here is that writers get paid less  For marking up or sort of reworking existing scripts than they get for original works  And I think writers are rightly worried that students might just have AI  Showing all these  And then say, you know, this is not perfect  Why don't you like work on it and then you get paid half of what you would get paid for if we if he took  Your script so that's I think a really valid concern. I could see that actually happen. I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Think there's a serious concern last week. We had Alex Deimos security guru on and his concern is that AI  Is so facile at generating content necessarily accurate content  But but you know kind of convincingly well-written content that it's gonna be an information  Overload that we're gonna have and and the Washington Post had an article this week kind of confirming that saying AI is already  Writing books how-to books they're writing recipes  It's already cranking stuff out like crazy. So I think this the writers guild is rightly concerned  One of the stories that the Washington Post it's Willa Ramis writing this he does a great job  Talks about a software developer in this name Chris cowell who wrote a very technical  Book for a very small audience  Called automating devops with gitlab CICD pipelines. Now you probably understand if you understand what any of those words mean  That is a narrow slice  But three weeks before it came out a  Book with exactly the same title came out and  As far as he could tell the the author Marie Karpos had never written anything before had no presence on the web as  He figured it out. It was written. There's a book publisher in India an education technology firm called in case stall  That has dozens of books on Amazon each with a different author  Each with five-star Amazon reviews from the same handful of India based reviewers  All apparently AI generated and  That you know you spent a year writing a book about devops and CICD  With a narrow audience and somebody beats you to the punch in three weeks with an AI generated book. That's not good  Yeah, no, it's it's really bad I think what you're seeing is sort of AI

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Filling up the lowest common denominator  Information on the internet right like it's all the SEO blogs these books you're seeing on Amazon  That's their Kindle self-publishing program, right?  Which we've seen a lot of sort of abuse and you know spammy books fill that section previously  I saw a great tweet earlier this week that was like wouldn't it be so wonderful instead if  Google was trying to figure out new ways to  Filter this stuff out right? It's already been a big problem in their search results for a long time  I would just love if there was a company that was taking the stance  Hey instead of giving you a chat GPT powered bot we're going to you know, emphasize human results, right?  And we're going to make sure that you see, you know, the best quality  Human generated content as possible. I would switch to a new search engine that was putting an emphasis on that  But instead you're seeing a lot of people saying that you're not going to be able to do that  I would switch to a new search engine that was putting an emphasis on that but instead you're seeing it's going the other way  Exactly, right, right

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  It's getting harder and harder to tell it to whether something's coming from like a bad content farm or from a bad AI, right?  I think louise you probably have the same issue and whenever you write something there's people or you break some news or something  people are picking it up there's  Reputable outlets rewriting it picking it up doing some own reporting  And then there's always these really weird websites that sort of get it right and then at the end of the article totally goes  off the rails and  becomes like a weird conspiracy theory and  Until recently, I thought it's all just content farms as people in india getting paid like 10 cents to rewrite the story  But i'm starting to suspect that a lot of that stuff has been AI all along and that  Like half of the google search results for many top six are just AI garbage at this point

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the reason that it's hard to tell between those two things is because these bots were trained on  So much of that stuff, right?  So like they're they're able to really easily generate that type of content because so much of it was already polluting the web  And I think it's just really nefarious and unfortunate that this is um  Already starting to happen on a pretty wide scale. Um, I wrote a few weeks ago about how this was starting to happen with online reviews  Um, I encourage everyone to do a google search for site yelp.com and search as an ai model  Uh that response that you get back from chat gbt and you'll find  Uh google has cached all these really funny reviews on yelp for bakeries, you know for I think it was like a sewage  Service somewhere in california and it's just full of ai generated reviews that you know  Someone didn't even bother to take the part out where it says as an ai model. I don't have personal opinions or whatever

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this is uh  This is a really fascinating google search  uh that you can use on twitter and a lot of places and what it is is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Frequently chat gbt will start an answer with as an ai language model  So if you search for that  You will find it everywhere  Uh vice pointed this out  uh  And and they're not even bothering, you know to cut it out  Note  It's just everywhere  A user review for a waste trimmer posted on april 13th contains the entire response to the initial prompt unedited  On amazon as an ai language model, I mean  It's it's terrifying but is it but as you point out, it's low quality content  So low quality content has always been a problem with the content farms and stuff

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe we don't have to worry about it because it's just low quality content  you know

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  a few months back when ai started to pick up steam I uh  I and I said this to multiple of my friends at the time. I went I really feel like we're  At the beginning of some form of a renaissance here  Like this might really be an interesting thing that we get to watch unfold and that has slowly been shipped away  By by what you know the types of things that we've just covered here, right like look at how quickly  society has proven to us that they're just uh, going to use this new thing in  Ways that are just you know nefarious or any other

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know opportunistic and I have to point out that while you can now look for as an ai language model  uh  And and immediately eliminate those responses. It's not going to take long before in fact, probably people have already figured it out

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Right and and then someone's going to need to make an ai model in order to catch  All the yeah ai outputs and then how it's going to be this war of ai is happening behind the scenes, right?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I think I think that's especially true because right now the vast majority of what you're seeing is people using  The chat gpt interface, right?  But since the ai opened since the api opened up for the ai  You're starting to see now like all these sorts of third-party apps that are using the same technology  So, you know, i'm sure somebody's going to come out with a fake review generator right where it automatically strips out that language  Um, or you know a fake book generator or whatever it is that's optimized for that purpose  I think one really interesting story that i'm going to be following for sure is  How well  Does open ai and the other companies creating these large models?  Do they police their api access right?  Are they going to be cutting off hundreds of apps a day or are these apps going to last a long time before?  The access is cut off and I think you know  Content moderation stories can be tiresome, but in this case, you know, they're paying for that api access, right?  So I think there's sort of a really direct  Line to revenue so there's an incentive not to clamp down on the majority of these apps  And I think that's going to be interesting to see

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Um how that plays out how and I think on the other on the other side when you when you talk about these reviews  Maybe it doesn't even matter that that's in there because when you go to amazon you don't read 5 000 reviews  You look at this and you say oh, it's 5 000 reviews on four and a half stars average. It must be good  But then you missed the part at 4 900 of those reviews contain that language that says as an ai model  I don't really know what i'm talking about or something like that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Alex runs stanford's internet observatory, which is basically looking for disinformation. He's concerned about the next  Years presidential election he says  Bot farms and disinformation are going to go crazy  thanks to these new tools  What do we how as users should we?  Deal with this what?  You know as consumers of information  You guys all create information, but as consumers of information  Is there is is there a trick is there a tool or should we just forget everything we read?  Yanko, what do you think? Oh, go ahead. You can start louise. Go ahead

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Well, I think you're gonna see you already before we had this influx of all this ai content  You already saw a movement towards closed spaces right like closed discords people using signal or these curated communities  And I think you're gonna see  More and more of that the same way that now there's a premium on like  Handmade ceramics right like handmade jewelry after we saw sort of like the explosion of machines, you know  Churning out all sorts of like, you know low-cost junk, right?  Like I think you're gonna see that with the internet right now  You're seeing like some publications say like oh we're like open to experimenting with ai or we're gonna generate  You know ai quizzes like buzzfeed, but I think you're gonna see  Like subscription publications and subscription, uh, you know services online emphasizing we guarantee this is 100 human  There's going to be no bots like, you know in this discord server or whatever

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I think the next problem then is that that might lead to a rift right or to do to divide  Where some people can afford to pay for all the subscriptions on new york times and whatnot?  To get verified information that has been written by humans  That has been going through an editorial process and then you have the the one level lower  All those people are rewriting those news and ai has a much easier  uh  Like avenue get in there and wreak havoc  Um, and then if people can't afford all the subscription fees, that's really troublesome

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a just think about the average person  probably isn't the you know, very  Uh deliberate subscriber and going out to make sure that they're getting the correct sources, right? So  This type of thing going on is going to catch up  You know the broad net is going to catch the majority of folks that they're just like  Oh, I heard about this thing. Let me just google it and then whatever results they see that's what they look for, right?  They're not they're not being careful to be in any sort of uh, any sort of a walled garden or anything like that  You know, so do we have to teach is it now time to teach people?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, I guess it has been for a while to be a little bit more discriminant in their media consumption  um, you know, look I look at uh  CNET none of you have worked for CNET, right?  We had when this story broke that CNET was using AI to write its uh, personal finance  articles, we had the EIC of CNET on Connie Guillermo and she had just uh,  You know published a statement saying well, we have humans check it. We're very careful  It's just doing the stuff that this was one one of her big points. These are it's just writing articles. No  Nobody wants to write louise and yanco don't want to write those articles. So we have a machine write them and then an editor  Review them actually as it turned out there were still many many mistakes in these personal finance articles  CNET, uh  was rumored to and their  You know personal private equity owners red ventures were rumored to be really doubling down on this  And uh, and it looks like red ventures has been planning to use ai written  Content in all of its other sites sites like bank right bank rate.com really our content farms to some degree  Be sad to see CNET turn into that

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  But and right after that came out the light of a bunch of writers. So yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't need writers. We've got uh  ai  Should we be I mean, you know, it's funny because uh, there was just a meeting at the white house on thursday  Uh, all the all the big ceos came in to to meet with the vice president  Um president biden came in and tipped his hat hat and said we need you guys to help  Uh  Gundis and arpacci was there. Uh satya nadella was there  Sam altman from open ai antropic  Ceo was there. Um  But I mean what are these guys doing? They're not saying  What I mean this is their business

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I have to say what was sort of funny about that meeting to me was that uh,  First of all, it was interesting that apple and meta were not included. Um, so what that sort of left was  Uh open ai the big company partnering with open ai the people who left open ai to start competitor and google  Right, like it is sort of a narrow group of people that have a lot of power right now  And I think it's important to push back against that like one of the great framings that I loved of the writers that went on strike  Was why can't the ai replace studio executives, right? There you go. There you go  So great like why does it have to be why us most creative job?  Yeah  That people really like to do and that we sort of value that that's coming from a human and has a human perspective and and does not  Sort of pollute the internet with spam or you know, create really  Reductive, you know narratives, I think when you ask it to generate stories and stuff, it's not only inaccurate  But it's often just like really mid right? It's kind of boring  It's sort of bad because it's just sort of taking an average of everything on the internet  So it's not surprising  But why do we have to replace these things that are so valuable within our culture? Like why can't it be you know?  Why can't we use the ai to analyze, you know?  Budgets for for studios, right? Like why does it have to be these really creative jobs?  Um that end up being things that get replaced  Um, because I think this technology is really powerful can do a lot but why?  You know, I just don't get it  but on the other hand I do think that the that the editor in chief of cnet has a point that  um  these  You know this aggregation these these sort of like, you know, low value articles that are just trying to catch, you know  A random google search or whatever though. That's not what a lot of people envision themselves doing when they want to have a career in journalism  Right, so I think there's some point there but  Just automating that process. I'm not sure  Really? That's just sort of a really sad and narrow  Use of this technology which could be used to do a lot of really cool things  But instead it's being used to write, you know seo articles and spammy books

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  And and the question is like articles that nobody wants to write are those really articles that anybody wants to read?  Right, why are they just like clogging up the pipeline and clogging up the google news for those with seo garbage?  well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe nobody wants to read but people are searching for right? That's why it exists  Uh, you're gonna search for bank, you know  What's the best savings account rate and you're gonna get to bankrate.com and be served a bunch of ads  And even if the content sucks, they got you with the ads. They're there and you saw them and they get to  Charge the companies for that. So I guess I mean, I think honestly they don't care if the content sucks

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  No, it's all about the the roi for that effort, right?  It's super low effort to just make an ai do a thing and then just throw it up there low efforts. That's exactly low effort

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  um, I love the  picket signs  Writers guild, of course, it's gonna have the best written picket signs  Right  um writers guild of america ai wrote the sign and then it's crossed out and says this sign  Uh live from new york on strike  My favorite succession without writers is just the apprentice

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  That one's great  That one's really great

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I told chat bt gpt to make a sign and it sucked  The force is with us that was probably on may 4th, uh, we have some notes a little shot at producers  Uh, no ai the ai obviously a real concern would love a two-day delivery on this amazon  One  Nice I want to get a baseball hat that says writer even though i'm not  My brother's career is more stable and he's a magician  Writers we need them  um  uh

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  By the way, let's not forget that. I mean this this extends to tecturnalism too, right which used to be my beat  You know and and and the written form  technical detail type info, which is a thing that ai tends to do  Reasonably surprisingly well, even if it gets some stuff wrong. It sure sounds like it's right  um  You know none of this was around and I was already kind of seeing some writing on the wall doing my job back at pc  Respective where it was okay. There's an awful lot of this stuff is moving to really short-form video content  Yeah, people don't seem to have the patience to to read a written technical article anymore  They just wanted in a five ten minute. How quick can you get me the you know the information side of it?  We've been heading this way for a long time haven't we? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean that was so it was already heading that way  for a long time, but  Now we have this piled on top of it  Right, it adds even more pressure which is unfortunate right because that you know, that's  It is admittedly. It's a niche  But there's there are people and that would like to be more educated about a given technical topic and it's  Handy to be able to google something and get you know an actual  Good long-form article on that technical thing, especially in tech in general, right? Especially like computers and whatnot

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean in a way going back to that white house meeting it actually makes sense to invite the folks  Running google search engine and being in all those things because if anybody can help  Filter out a lot of the garbage and steer people towards high quality content whether that is  AI generated AI assisted or entirely human made it is search engines, right and  a lot of them have been trying to use AI and  Being chat bots and whatnot for kind of an interface type of question  But the next step is really like how do you revamp that whole thing to make sure that a lot of the garbage doesn't clock up  everybody's results

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you louise had one suggestion for people which is create your own private spaces  Uh that can't be infiltrated by AI, but then that just creates puts you in a filter bubble, right? You don't get to  See stuff outside of your immediate circle

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely not the only solution  But I think it's something that people are going to increasingly crave depending on how much  AI generated content ends up on social media or ends up in some of these places  Um, I think people are going to want to know that they're like talking to a human  I think you see that a lot already for like other parts of the economy that are automated right like people  Oh, yeah, they want to talk to a human. They don't want to talk to a customer service bot  They they value companies that where you can call someone nice who will help you  Um, or you want things that are handmade hand designed that aren't just you know, coming out of some big factory somewhere

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  artisanal writing  It's time for artisanal writing. I think that's the way things are going

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  It's like, you know, how many times do we think that like, you know AI like, you know  AI generated music for example is not going to eliminate musicians. It might eliminate some types of music

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the labels are worried about that a little bit. They shut that drake song down real quick

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I mean, I think the ip thing is a huge  You know unanswered question and it'll be fascinating to see how the supreme court and some of the lower courts decide on that  Because that's I think that's one of the big concerns that's keeping a lot of um,  Some companies at least with maybe like more conservative legal teams from immediately jumping into this stuff, right? Because they're really worried about  copyright complaints

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't know of course we have no idea these days how the courts will rule but  In the case of the drake song it was completely original  And so it wasn't like it was samples  Which you know, we know that case law supports  Writers, you know the creators rights in that case, but it wasn't samples. It was generated  It sounded like drake  Can he is he copyrighted his voice? I don't think you can your sound  It's going to be very interesting. I think the legal experts i've seen of all kind of said  There isn't really a case for preventing this kind of ai mashup

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean, it's sort of impersonation and using his likeness, right? It's not copyright anymore  It goes into like different areas of law, but it is true  A lot of the companies have been using a copyright takedown notices  Which are really not meant for something like this, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's good. We live in interesting times  And I guess I the best you could say is just tell your friends and neighbors and people who aren't maybe  Paying attention that watch out because there's a lot of going to be a lot of there's gonna be a flood of fake content

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  And real content that people say is fake like you know must

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's part of the problem too isn't that that's the old soviet flood the zone technology technique  Which is it doesn't matter if all these bot farms say anything believable or credible  It's just you're flooding the zone with crap so that nobody believes anything even the real stuff  Uh, we may already be there  frankly  So google has been slow, uh to uh jump on this bandwagon. It's interesting sundar pachai was there they have bard  Which is kind of unimpressive wall street journal yesterday  Uh said google plans to make search more personal  With ai chat and video clips and there's a word they use that i'm just loathing but i'm seeing it more and more  snackable  Snackable is the big not great choice  Google plans to make its visual engine its search engine more visual snackable  Personal and human yanko you've got to run into snackable before it sounds like it sounds like quibi to me

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly sounds like i mean google has started with some of that stuff already right for a lot of  Popular topics when you search you get the blue links on top and then you scroll further down and you get sort of cart type  of interfaces and a lot of  colorful  snackable things  um  What I thought was interesting about that story was that it said it's going to allow you to ask more follow-up questions  which helps people to maybe  Be a little bit more precise or figure out what they're actually looking for  I actually kind of want sometimes the opposite  I would like google to ask me what i'm looking for because maybe i'm searching too broadly and  If google got back to me and said do you want to bake this cake for yourself or for your dog?  That might actually be really helpful

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right very important get that one right. Yeah  Do you have you ever baked a cake for your dog?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Uh, my daughter has yes  We we all tried it it was not very good

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's quite cute  I didn't know I didn't know there were dog cake recipes, but if there aren't ai will be writing them soon  Uh google search visitors as you say this is from the journal article might be more frequently prompted to ask follow-up questions  Or swipe through visuals like tik tok videos in response to their course. This is by the way the thing that I hate about  Big tech or just I guess the world we live in  You know what you could blame hollywood. They keep making sequels. Nobody's trying to make something the next big thing  Google's rushing now. They're scared to death. They're rushing now because Microsoft came out with chat gpt  And they're worried they're going to lose their advantage in search  So they're going to make search more like that and oh by the way as long as we're doing this  Let's make it more like tik tok because that's the kids love that and it's it's it's chasing your tail  The race to the bottom it ends up being a race to the bottom. I think and I I understand google's nerves  on this but  Copying the other guys because yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  They got to do it because other people are doing it and then everybody rushes to do it  And then you don't get a good product out of any of them because they're all just trying to get it out the door

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I think the tik tok bit is actually really interesting because um, what are the things I was contemplating when you know  This huge search bot wave happened is that we're seeing an increasing number of younger people who are actually using  Tik tok as a search platform and the platform is much better for search  Than say instagram or other visual based platforms, which is not surprising because this you know, this transition already happened in china  Which is where tik tok is from?  Um, so I think that's interesting because you're seeing these companies scrambling to make an ai bot when younger users are signaling  Know what we want is maybe something integrated into a social platform or we want that visual content  We don't want to talk to a chat bot  We want to see normal people who are posting videos because you know when you talk to those users, why are you using?  Tik tok it's not just oh, they only have the attention span for a video  They want to see normal people who are reviewing something or showing them, you know  Advice on where to go on vacation or you know immediately showing them a video of that recipe, right?  You don't have to scroll past all the seo garbage  You know 1 000 word introduction to get to the guacamole recipe or whatever  It's just right in front of you and it's a normal person making it and you can decide whether you trust them

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, uh jammer b just gave me a uh, really  Interesting story. This is back from 1988  You have my audio?  See if we've got it  Uh, tom wait sued doritos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a new tortilla chip called salsa rio doritos. It's buffo bapo bravo gunho tally ho, but never mellow

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is not tom wait sounds exactly like him, doesn't it?  Uh, it's a doritos ad where they copied his voice and he had a has a very distinctive voice  uh  He sued and in 1990 won 2.475 million dollars in damages  from frito-lay

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  So I guess he probably did not sue for copyright infringement. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Voice theft

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  The voice thief is coming

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I mean, you know because they're taking advantage of the thing that is unique to that other persona, right?  You're basically stealing and it's not just I mean it was voice back then sure but  Potentially, you know with all these ai things and just where computing is going in general  What's the stop some you know you could make I just saw this short video short movie that was made where?  um  They basically inserted spock into a star trek themed thing, right?  And it was extremely convincing like how many steps away are you from being able to just take an old actor?  You know, even if they're with us no longer with us doesn't matter  Right and just insert them into a thing and now you just have that person in that thing  And if you try to we know their limits, yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I guess drake could have sued but who do you sue if an ai generates a song with your voice?  Who do you go after?  Right turns into a finger pointing game  The person who commissioned the ai to do it, I don't know the person who publishes it maybe yeah, you have to go after the publishing  Which is by the way what they successfully did and I think that's why they used dmca because they were able to get it taken down everywhere

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, platforms don't respond to anything with the same level of speed that they do dmca takedowns, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just they well in fact, I think most of the time it's just automatic right we get hit by that all the time  and even though  for instance  I i'm taking my my life into my hands by playing that doritos ad I could get taken down by everybody  Tom weights  Doritos  But it was it's in a commentary and a news story about this topic  So it's very it's for sure fair use but that doesn't mean i'm going to go to court to defend it  Right, you gotta file a counterclaim  Well, and this is the problem with youtube as you know, that takes months and by then nobody's going to listen to the show because it's it's old  so  generally  I mean  It's a chilling effect. We we go through this all the time and I often just don't play stuff  That was that was I think very germane to the topic, right? But  Uh, yeah, absolutely tom weights who lives down the street might well

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Disagree. Yeah, that doesn't stop people from you know, exploiting the system, right? I mean the flip side

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  The flip side then is that we're gonna see  Or we already have started to see artists license their voice models, right? So grimes did she said for 50 50 a 50 50 spray  Right. Yeah, I mean that was more of a late night tweet  How much is going to come out of that is a question but  I think uh john legend did google speakers for a while where he would tell you  But the google speaker would tell you the weather in his voice

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know it was a deal because it expired  So I paid for it and then but they only had it for a year or whatever  I have melissa mccarthy in my amazon echo

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  There you go  But they're all all time limit because I think the artists or their managers are smart and all  Yeah, you want to keep that sort of limited and in the bottle  You don't want to give them the right and perpetuity to do whatever they want with your voice

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Obviously, this is of course this always happens when there's a new technology, you know going back to uh, ned lud and the loons

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When there's a new technology there's displacement there's disruption  Um, that's what silicon valley harold, you know hails is the disruptive force of innovation  And there's always winners and losers there and obviously ai is about to disrupt  Well, I always ask this question i'll ask it from you because I you all because I haven't asked it of you yet  But is ai going to disrupt or is it I often think maybe this is just a trick  And uh, it will just it'll wear off and then we'll do the next big thing  Or is this going to be totally disruptive  Maybe it's already is it already disruptive alan. I think I think it's already

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I think it's already  This it's disrupting on multiple levels multiple angles all simultaneously, right? It's not just the topics we've been talking about today. There were  For you know, what month or two ago just the photo based ai generated imagery and all the copyright

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know questions there playing with the new 5.1 mid-journey and you can go on twitter and see a bunch of it's gotten more and more  Photo-realistic to the point where it's almost I mean you can easily generate an image that  Looks like a real right and not only that

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  You know earlier  Earlier it was mentioned about oh, yeah  Well, we're not sure if the api is open or if the companies are going to lock down certain things or try to limit it that way  This is computing. This is a compute related thing, right?  How many compute related things start in the cloud but then computing compute in general advances to the point where  You can just have this running on a system in your basement  Or a few years later on your regular desktop system

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah on your phone. Yeah, I mean what I mean got majority running on a phone, right? Someone already was I think yeah stable diffusion

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can run on your phone as well. Yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Right. Well, you can run it but i'll be it with a very limited data set, right?  But as things expand, you know the data sets that they just trickle down right all that all that expansion just trickles down  Over time it always has um, so whether you know, I don't I don't see this  I don't see this just going away because it would be too easy to do it  Willy-nilly not too long from now on any devices, right?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  People always overestimate the short-term impacts and underestimate the long-term impacts, right?  Right, and I think so the drake example  I think that will be sorted out in a way where people follow artists and and you know on spotify they will  Verify those types of things that it's only from the real artists, but then there's a whole other area of the music business  so like when it comes to  Uh licensing music for films oftentimes it's already where you know people music supervisors are looking for  Something that vaguely sounds like the beetles but right now they still license some british band for that in the future  They might just say oh, you know, let's just generate something that sounds like a beetles. Here we go. Yeah, right

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it turns into not making the ai not so much model exactly drake  But just to be close just close enough, but not close enough just drake-ish enough

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, i think though also a lot of the applications are not going to be the really sexy things that people are talking about right now  And those are not going to be the first things like a lot of the applications for this stuff is going to be like really boring  Administrative work or it's going to be in really high tech sectors like biotech  Where you're going to be seeing this technology used pretty quickly  Um, and I totally agree that you know, the short-term impacts are probably being overestimated the long-term impacts are being underestimated  But I think you're going to see it kind of come into these  Um, you know just like more boring like, you know, like rote data entry type things before you're going to see  People flocking to an ai drake concert or whatever  I think a lot of that stuff people are still going to value a human and I also think  I'm trying to remember when you know, these things feel scary that it's not predetermined  You know like we as a culture and as a society get to decide how we're going to use this tech  And I think it's important not to accept whatever the narrative is from open ai or google that  You know, this is going to transform everything and everyone's going to lose their job, right? Like that's still to some degree  Up to us how we want to use this and I also think the consumer response is going to be really interesting  Like I don't know if you guys saw but amnesty international tried using  Uh ai generated images in a human rights campaign and the backlash to that was really intense

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how did people find out did they say they were doing that?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, they disclosed it and it was like really really bad. I mean it was about uh, you know colombian it was about columbia  civil rights movements there and  They had this woman who was you know being taken away by by police or whatever and she had a columbian flag  And it wasn't the columbian flag like the ai got it wrong  Of course, and that was the first image and it's just like so they didn't have to disclose it because

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was kind of obvious

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  All the refugees have six fingers. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they've fixed by the way, they've pretty much fixed the six finger problem. Here's um,  Somebody's using the latest mid-journey to generate  pictures of presidents as football coaches  Uh, and uh, and the hands are the hands are pretty good  Um, it's you know, I mean, I don't know. Would you be fooled? Maybe you would  Some of them were pretty obvious. Uh, I might believe that one of bill clinton  um  Reagans aren't very good carters are all that weird quality. There's a certain quality isn't there? Yeah. Yeah  Lbj is I don't know. I believe lbj is a football coach  You're right. There's an uncanny valley. I guess still huh for now at least. Yeah  Yeah, we're getting we're getting better and better and better though. I mean, so it's obvious again

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  It's getting better very rapidly. Yeah is the thing. Yeah, right  This isn't like think about how video game uncanny valley has progressed  It's taken years to get the really super realistic video game engine graphics, right?  But this the ai stuff it's this this is not that many generations to get to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. That's pretty funny. The the the herbert hoover is college football coaches actually  The only thing is it's too good quality like it would it should be older. Yeah, this one's believable  So you can see  That it's only that's woodrow wilson  Warren g harding is a college football coach. I don't even did they even have college football william howard taft  Some of these are quite believable. I don't know. I think we're gonna live in we're living in a time now where you can no longer  Yeah, I mean it's what you see

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Well  And it is being used behind the scenes a lot just not this we don't know the things that we're noticing here  Well, no, there's I mean programmers programmers have adopted. Yeah, extremely quickly

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it pretty so alan you code you're still a coder? Yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I I dabble but here's the thing i've i've always coded  Out of necessity right? I need to do a thing. Okay, let me learn what I need to learn  you know, I have to I have I know where to look to find the answer right and  You know someone who's much more skilled than me at programming those folks are still using  Sure, the chat gbt's to take care of the more mundane things and they're the experts and they can yeah  They act as a copilot, right?  And it just I just need this thing that does this thing I can sit here and take 10 minutes to do it  Or I can take you know  Five seconds to just get that spit out for me and I know enough about it where I can very quickly review it and  And know if it's going to work or not and tweak it as necessary, right?  It fills in those gaps but for someone that's at my skill level obviously lower than those experts  But still I know what i'm what I want it to do. I know what the system can do  Um, I can at least get 90% of the way there very quickly and if anything learn something along the way  Right, like I didn't know how to do that function, right?  But I knew what I wanted done and it's teaching me and at the same time  I'm able to fill in whatever couple of holes that there may be  You know to make it work to make it run in the long run. Isn't that what's going to be the the most useful?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  way to use ai is as a  Collaborator to work in hand-in-hand with a human not by itself, but hand-in-hand. Is that right?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, and what i've noticed is  What we've just discussed about the fingers and how okay that was wrong. So obviously some obviously humans intervened  And got they trained it like crazy on hands. Yeah, and they trained it like crazy on yeah made some choices there, right?  Um, the same kind of thing can appear can be applied totally different ai type thing now like tesla autopilot for example  right, um  The recent versions of autopilot i've noticed  Tend to kind of stay on the opposite and the lane as semi trucks  Oh interesting  Uh, I don't think it's doing it because it did it on its own  I think it's doing it avoid those guys  Yeah, it's it's it's a very if you're if you own a tesla on any of the recent firmware  You'll notice it is extremely distinct. It is very purposeful. You're like one car length away from the semi  It moves over a little and as soon as you pass its front bumper  It's right back in the middle of the lane, right and that's that was very you know, you can tell  Human had to intervene it didn't figure that out all by itself. I'm sorry  Right. It was a very specific programmatic sort of intervention by humans  So you're not just be able to let this thing go you have to like

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know intervene a little and teach you saw was say he doesn't like tesla self-driving. It's tried to kill him on several occasions

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Uh, it it has it has tried to kill me as well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I haven't had the recent one  I had it on my model x and it there was a there was a curve on the highway  It always tried to drive into the divider every single time you just learned. I will say let it do that

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  well  True. I mean you and I and many other tech folks like to be on the bleeding edge and some of us like to sort of  Lean into testing something. Yeah. Yeah, see when it turns into your actual safety though, it's a little it gets a little dicey  um, yeah, but yeah, i've been surprised by  how you know  before  When I used to try it every once in a while it would scare the heck out of me and now  It's like oh, this is  They might be getting close. It's doing things that I would have done normally and that's kind of surprising me

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I remember interviewing ashley vance. This is back before elon was an evil genius and was still a genius genius  uh about his book about elon musk and one of the things he said which I think was very true is that  The difference between tesla say and ford was that tesla was being run like a silicon valley company  Where you iterate you try you fail and try again you iterate and ford is much and all the you know, traditional car companies were much more  judicious  and cautious  Um, but maybe we maybe with when it comes to ai we need to be a little bit  Loose with the I mean certainly looks like microsoft traditionally a very cautious company has thrown caution to the wind  And said let's put this out and see what let's just see what happens with chat gpt or you know being in chat

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Um, that was that was the loosest. I think i've ever seen microsoft go on a thing ever

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but maybe that's what is that what we need?  For ai to succeed. I mean  I don't know  Was by the way signed that letter there were a number of people who signed a letter saying we should including musk  I believe we should pause six months  Which I always interpret is like wait six months so we can catch up and then you can continue  Just give it we just need a heads just a little bit at the head start

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Um, I mean right elon is what recruiting people from deep mind. I don't know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He wants to he's not gonna pause let's put it that way

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Right ai as a fundamental concept is in startup mode. Yes, they're in go fast break things mode  Yes, everywhere is that risky? Yeah. Yes  I mean  As long as it's not steering my car, I guess

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What if it's steering an election?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yes, that's that's the worry right what if you know what if it on the head

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, you know, what if the results in 2024? I don't mean like ai will  vote  But ai disinformation might prove

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  It sure can influence

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, it has what about like did you guys see the joanna star and video in the wall street journal where she she cloned herself her voice  She fooled her bank, right? I I think I think uh, joseph cox at mother board did that as well  And they were able to fool banks. I mean, that's the kind of stuff that I worry about in  The short term is like just you know, a serious increase  I told my mom that like we have to have a safe word because if you think i'm calling you like, you know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ask the same word because I feel like she fooled the bank and her family

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly and I think that that kind of stuff that's what i'm really terrified about like I feel like disinformation sometimes can be sort of a nebulous concept  And like what do we mean? What does it look like right? Like i'm not saying that it's not a danger  But when you see that kind of thing, it's like okay if they can get into your bank account, it's sort of game over

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, but social engineering has existed for a long time people have been  Playing tricks on banks and other institutions for a long time. So I think  What all of this leads to is just we need better security across the board against malicious actors  Whether they're humans or ai or a combination of those things  stuff just needs to be more secure and  Maybe ai will bring us there. Maybe that would be a good good thing good outcome

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  When you when you combine the potential, you know  That what we mentioned at the beginning of this where we were talking about the reviews and all the review spam and everything  You know take the malicious intent of those folks with the power of ai  and  someone who  Knows social engineering who would typically be a human who was trying to social engineer their way into your bank account  Now back that up with ai  Oh my goodness. Yeah, right like that's extremely powerful. That's it's it's learning  It's doing a it's taking a brief few minutes to google everything it could possibly about you and come up with  Much more solid guesses about any possible security question answer, right just in an instant  You know potentially on the fly as the call is happening, right? That's  You know, that's dangerous, right? We need much better. I mean everything should be  Two factor even when they're talking to you on the phone and I don't mean like some some companies try to do a second factor  to add security, but  I've lost count how many times I didn't have my second factor for example to make changes to like an at&t account  Or something like that and you add the pin code  But then if you don't know the pin code they can just turn it off right there on the call for you, right?  Maybe they ask your birthday or something so that it doesn't you know, it didn't do any good, right?  It's in and it's certainly not gonna get the better of an ai trying to get in

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Know we're in deep

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  This got depressing fast. Yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, well it means but it means that all of the people on the other end of those transactions need to be on the bus  Right, they need to have the computer. Not I mean, I remember when Charles Schwab said

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you can use your voice to log in  And I thought this doesn't seem like a good idea  Well now we know it's not right terrible idea  Do you have uh safe words yanco for your family?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I don't know if you want to go there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually talked to my daughter. We might all have them. No, I talked to my daughter about this  I said, you know if you hear from me  uh  And so we worked out a scheme. I don't want to

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Say too much about that, but uh, don't give up the password to your luggage. Leo

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I I I do have to tell a story a couple years ago  Something happened to me that no ai was involved in this at all, but I got a call  I had an la number at that time and it was a scam call, but somebody pretended to be uh,  Somebody pretended that they had abducted a family member  Yeah, yeah  Basically somebody was screaming in the background calling my name and I could figure out really quickly that was not real because I wasn't living  In la anymore. They didn't know the name of the family member, which was sort of a important detail in a hostage negotiation situation  um, but  I just imagine at the time for people who may be  Coming for countries where abductions are more common  Or are just in different situations where that could be a real situation  So that could be really crazy and now you add ai to it obviously  It gets even scarier when the voice now sounds like it as well  I think there was stories about that recently too where people have been using the very same scam

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But with simulated voices it happened to one of our regulars on our shows larry maggot  Uh last week published this article in the san jose mercury news how I nearly fell  For a frightening virtual kidnapping scheme  Uh 20 minutes of terror  Now this is a guy by the way, who's as technical as we are. He actually is the founder of an online safety organization  connect safely.org  Uh, he said the call felt real to me  And threatened to separate me not from not from money, but from someone it was his wife. They used a  simulated voice  He says it began tuesday morning when my wife drove to san francisco to visit a friend most days  She and I are together at home or she's somewhere nearby  He says I was already a little nervous because you know  Last time she drove to san francisco. She was sideswiped by another car  Uh 12 37 my cell phone rang with a caller id that at first glance looked like it was my wife  I now know it wasn't exactly her number same area code same prefix same last number. So it was all but three  At the time, you know, oh that's that's her because he was worried right when I heard what I heard was a crying upset woman  I assumed it was my wife because it came from her phone. This happened to him last week, by the way  I repeatedly asked what the matter was but I couldn't understand her answer  All I could imagine was something horrible must have happened then a man came on the phone  Identified himself as a police officer  I'm telling this is worth reading and knowing about and telling family members about to understand this scam goes on  He said he said i'm a cop. I need to verify who i'm talking with  He said well normally i'm going to refuse a request but I felt desperate. I gave him my name my wife's name  And he then admitted he wasn't a police officer but a member of a drug cartel  my gosh  Now this is a nightmare this is a nightmare and I know larry he's sharp he's like us  He's not gonna fall for this stuff  And said that he had my wife with him in san francisco  I don't know how he says he knew she was in san francisco. Maybe I I don't know  Maybe he said something about her location. Maybe not. I wasn't thinking clearly  A security expert I spoke with later explained the technique start with fear  Follow with an authority figure to gain your trust  The cop and then pivot to the threat. I mean this is like a pattern  He says it worked with me even though I pride myself on critical thinking skills  There was enough information to cause me to worry. It could be the real thing. Either way. I knew I was dealing with a criminal  So while I had him on my cell phone he at least did this I put him on speaker and dialed 911 for my desk phone  I didn't say anything to 911 operator but knew they would hang on and listen to the call  at one point  The caller told me she'll be okay. Just bring five thousand dollars to a walmart parking lot in san jose  I found out later the 911 operator put my local police on the line  So they heard nearly the entire call including the ransom demand and the threat  He told me not to contact anyone asked me if I was alone  I said I was at one point the 911 operator asked me for my wife's phone number, which I whispered into the desk phone  The scammer heard me asked who I was talking to I denied I was speaking to anyone just said I was talking to myself  Because I was nervous. He then asked me to get in my car  I didn't but kept him on the phone as long as I could  The car request was to initiate the next step in this the compliance process  Once you follow one instruction  You're more likely to complete the process

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  And pay the ransom, right? So they actually want them to go to the walmart parking lot. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he says we spoke for over 11 minutes. He finally hung up on me probably because he realized I wasn't going to comply

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  So anyway, even though he initially fell for it that is extremely quick thinking to call 911 on their line

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's you know again, I would say  Larry is no more vulnerable than any of us here  You know, he's he's savvy, right?  Uh  So the police came to his house. The officer said it's likely a scam  He did say call your wife. There was no answer  He called again and she answered she's fine. Never in danger. The police had texted my wife  And they contacted the sfpd to dispatch an officer to look for her. So they they took this very seriously

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Wow, so was she just blissfully unaware driving

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, she had no idea right? So it's this article needs to be like a public service announcement. Yeah  Well, he put it in the san jose mercury news. I encourage

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh people read it. I guess they didn't it wasn't really an impersonation of his wife's voice  It was just a scared female voice, but it was enough for and it was close  They must they knew something about him and this is by the way. One of the things that's really scary these days  is  There's enough information out there with data brokers and elsewhere  Bad guys are able to learn enough about you to to really kind of fool you  They almost knew his wife's phone number somehow  They knew she was in san francisco or guess she was in san francisco. We had a scam happen at work  Where somebody impersonated our ceo and sent him messages to everybody not to me  But to all the employees all her direct reports  uh  And fortunately our staff was smart enough  They didn't do anything about it, but I can imagine what the next steps would have been  And and this is because because somehow our company structure corporate structure  The names were employees their emails or phone numbers and at least his email and phone number were available to a bad guy  Who then was able to implement that attack? This is how spearfishing happens now. This is very

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Scary stuff and it's just fishing as a tale as old as time. Well and it you know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For a long time I kind of and I still kind of feel this way like I don't have any privacy fine  So what what's the worst they can do? Well now we're starting to see  That maybe privacy is important for security  If nothing else  Yep  Uh good news the bad guys. I mean the good guys the good guy bad guys the hackers  Are gonna are gonna take this on defcon which is coming up this summer  In las vegas is going to have an ai village  Where they've invited hackers to show up dive in find bugs and biases  In large language models from open ai google anthropic and others  They expect thousands  Uh to kind of red team  These ai large language models  So, you know, this has worked very well in the past defcons had that remember they had the election machine village where people  were presented with uh electronic voting machines and  Were able to show how they were hackable and and where the vulnerabilities and then didn't they try and sue like the election companies trying to try and  Sue. I think dominion dominion wasn't too happy as I remember  Uh, anyway, this is good, right? They're uh, they're not just looking they're gonna look for bias  Hallucinations and jailbreaks

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I think that's awesome  I mean, I don't know if you guys saw but the other day opening I launched a bug bounty and I kind of put it  uh, you know put the link somewhere to um  Write about it in my newsletter the next day and by the time I went back to look at it  They had already paid out like dozens of bugs. Oh, jeez within like, you know 24 hours  So it showed you that like, you know, I think this kind of red teaming is really important  If you go down to like on the bug crowd website, it will show you  Uh how many bugs they've already paid out? Uh,  It should be there. Yeah, that's the bug crowd link. Yeah, so you can see on the right they've already uh  rewarded  38 vulnerabilities  Yeah, and uh, you know, that's pretty that's pretty strict and they're also not considering bias or hallucinations or anything  So that's just literally like security problems with the platform

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's the first thing I remember started doing with chat gbt is  Is hacking on it? Yeah, i'm sorry

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Remember none of the good work that those folks are doing are going to stop people from using the ai for nefarious purposes  Right just point that out. It'll do it more securely, right?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Well, at least yeah, i'm hoping at least people's chat histories are not leaked  We saw that there was already that one uh big bug that they found where people could access other people's chat histories  And you know, there's already been stories coming out showing that people are using this chat bot as a therapist  Right, you know, it's it's really worrisome what what you know  That chat history could particularly look like i'm also that reminds me i'm super interested to see  Will those conversations be used for targeted advertising and how soon you know?  We already saw snapchat said that they were going to use the outputs from their bot  Or the inputs and the outputs from their their ai bot for advertising and that's going to be really weird  If you have a therapy session with a chat bot and then you see ads based on your therapy session. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is why microsoft is now offering according to the information  Uh professional chat gpt for companies costs 10 times more  But it will be 10 times 10 times more  but uh, which and you know  At least that your inform your corporate information won't leak out samsung has already told its employees do not you may not use  Uh an ai to help you with code or anything else they're worried about leaks

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Um amazon as well amazon said only use our tool. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  All I can think of during the whole ad was uh, steve gibson spent an awful lot of time talking about I know I know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me think here you can this dropper is a thousand iu of uh  One drop is a thousand iu of vitamin d  But if you put in two drops or five drops or ten drops you can increase it  I think a thousand's enough, but you definitely want to add that vitamin d that is a and it's an easy way to do it  It's just a little dropper it goes right in there  Uh how predictions we'd start with the writer's guild, but I didn't really finish it  Yanko predictions is this going to go on the last one went on what a hundred days back in 2007?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean the longer it goes on the more power the writers have right because right now hollywood still our streaming services still have a bunch  Of stuff that they banked and that can use for a while. They're coasting once that yeah once it drags on  They're really going to have to wonder like how are we going to fill this void and what are we going to do about it?  I think I might predict that's going to impact different companies differently and that might also like influence who wants to settle this how fast  Like netflix seems to be in a better position because they have so much international content these days  And people really dig korean tv shows and stuff. It's really successful on there  If you're disney if you're hbo or max now, I guess  uh  That might be a little harder because you don't have that much of a catalog and maybe you don't have that many shows queued up  so the longer drags on  Uh the harder it's going to be for hollywood to get all of that. I think I remember

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I seem to remember last time that that happened that for instance letterman  Did a side deal and got the writers back earlier. All right  Um, I can imagine we were talking about this on wednesday on macbreek weekly that apple  especially  Uh might be incented to say okay. Okay. Okay here here have some it's apple's throwing money at people. Anyway, have some more money  Uh, because we really need this content  On the other hand the longer it goes on  Doesn't that when when our favorite shows start going off the air or or not finishing their seasons  Doesn't that start to put pressure on the writers from from fans? Like are we going to start saying hey, I you know  What happened? You know, my show's gone

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  For sure. There's also this point where uh, especially warner media  uh  Warner discovery, uh, they they already started to cancel a bunch of shows or not put shows on  They don't seem to mind doing that do they yeah, and they can use this now as a sort of an excuse  If something didn't perform completely well, they were like, oh well, we didn't get to make that out of season  So just let's just can that project and you know, we take a tax write-off good for us bad for you, but

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the evil david zaslav who's running this  Says the writer's strike will be ended by a love for working  All right  He is really nasty a nasty piece of work. I am not at all happy with what's happening at hbo honestly

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  The whole the whole landscape has shifted dynamically if you think about between  What it looks like now and the last time there was a writer's strike right like you have  There's a totally different set of players at least big players now  Broken valley took over hollywood basically since then. Yeah. So now there's like this different layer of like  Probably less likely to see all of the execs on the one side try to get in the room together and sort of like figure out  Okay, what's the game plan here? Like now it's there all those guys are competing against each other  To try to you know, that wasn't you know, you just said about apple, right?  Maybe apple will just kick them some money earlier what david letterman did like now you have that many more  Big players that are potentially going to try to you know solve this  Uh and be the leader of solving it. So maybe that actually makes the strike be shorter

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I mean zaslav got paid  39 million dollars last year. He's not hurting but these companies do say oh, you know all of this competition  You know, we're not making the kind of money we used to be netflix seem to be struggling for a while  Um, isn't that the counter argument that well you guys want more money and and times are tougher than ever for the streamers  Is that true? They just had record profits. They just had record profits

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Like i'm just not sure that I believe that like the streaming platforms are doing better than ever  I mean, it's certainly a different business model and I think you know the  glory days of tv or maybe over to some extent but  No, I I I don't think that that's reasonable and if it was, you know  You'd see the people making 39 million dollars a year being fired, right?  Like if you can still make 39 million dollars a year, it's probably okay. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Two years ago. He made a quarter of a billion dollars. So  You know, he's hurting now. He's

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I feel very sorry for him

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  He's just he's just really doing it for the love of work. It's the love of work

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He just shows up. It doesn't really matter what you pay me. I'm just gonna do it because I love  I love work. We love I have to say we love though  This modern content world for a while a couple of years ago  We were saying we were in the golden age of television the golden age of  content  Um, we watched a lot of it during the pandemic  They're making more money than ever before is it's is it still the golden age of content?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Now we're in the golden age of a tv series that you might get really like and really enjoy and might be produced really well  And then it's just gone the next i'm just glad succession has been complete is done

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's in the can  And they can't they can't stop my succession because that then I would really be really unhappy about that  Um, yeah, there's actually more there's more to watch now than ever before. I can't even you know, it's  I can't even figure out what I want to watch next. I don't even know there's so much stuff

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Uh, and well and the shame is that for a lot of the older content your retro  You know, you would go watch some tv show you used to watch in the 80s, right? All these same services  They're all still there. They're licensing. Yeah. Well, no, they're not in there. Not as there's a lot of them  Yeah  There's a certain television series that it happens to be on netflix right now  I know it's going to be gone next month and there's whole articles that are come out occasionally on here are the next series  They're going to be missing from from netflix or who or whoever, you know next month and then  It turns out they were the only service that had that particular series  So the only way for you to watch it was there and it's just going to be gone until somebody else decides to license it  And add it to their library. Yeah, it's not this like growing infinite library, right?  Yeah, actually yanko we all assumed it would be but it's not you had a really good piece

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In your low pass newsletter about free tv. That's now the hot thing, right?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean so that was sort of interesting I think to to to the point here with with all the titles a lot that is coming back or  Getting revived on these free streaming services or free linear streaming services. There's pluto out there  There is a lot of these services that I feel a little bit like basic cable  Uh, but stream stuff in a in a linear way and you can switch channels and all those things  But my article focus on sort of the next thing behind that because one of the people who founded pluto one of those early  Peroniers and free streaming is now building free televisions  So instead of just giving away the content they actually want to give away the tv sets themselves  Wow, where's the demographic for that? That's fascinating. Well, you know people like free stuff and I think the bet here is oh  The free content worked so well  What if we like take it to the next level?  And in a way if you look at the tv market in general tvs have been getting cheaper for like a decade or so  TVs used to be really expensive and now you can go to best buy a walmart and buy a really good really nice size tv for  300 sometimes 250 dollars, which is crazy. Just like five six years ago those prices  And now this this guy, yeah pausen who was a co-founder of pluto has a new company called tv  And they want to build this free tv set that's going to be like a regular tv  Then it's going to have a speaker built in sort of like a soundbar and then underneath of that  It has a second screen built into the main tv and that second screen  Is all about showing your advertising non-stop and maybe every now and then there's going to be a widget to show you some  Support scores or some news headlines when news breaks, but otherwise you watch something  Maybe you watch netflix on the first screen without ads and then on the second screen  relevant to that  You're going to have some ads pop up and in exchange for enduring that you get the entire tv set for free

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is a wild idea  Do you think people go for that? People hate ads, but a free tv. That sounds pretty good

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing everybody says they hate ads, but advertising  still is billions of dollars, right and people  Are going back to the point. I think where you know, we have all these streaming services when you bundle them all together  They're getting pretty expensive  And especially with recession and maybe people, you know  Not having as much money as they used to before trying to save a little bit more  They're going back to some of these free streaming services. So why not give them a free tv as well?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So is it ticker just like on cnn?  That's where the ads will live, but there'll also be information there and other stuff

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Right, and it's interesting when I when I publish this story  One of the first responders on mastodon was actually somebody saying time for an ad blocker and then the photo to it was a roll  Of duct tape  You know that could happen  Um, it's going to be interesting. I asked myself the question like how are they going to pretend?  Prevent people from getting these tvs for free and then just doing  Doing that blocking it putting a sound bar in front of it  Yeah, maybe putting a sound bar in front of it  Or maybe just smashing the entire tv for a stupid tiktok challenge or something like that, right putting it on craigslist or whatever

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Oh lord

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There'll be a contract in there that you have to

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  They'll I suspect actually that they might it might be a free tv on paper, but maybe they're going to put it in stores  Sell it for 300 dollars. And then if you have it active and if you use it you get some somebody back a rebate or something

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you point out and this kind of blew me away that  Vizio only makes about three dollars per tv

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  It's it's crazy that's the profit three dollars  And tvs have been a really thin margin. I mean there's the samsung's and the lgs they make really expensive high end tv sets  They're making money with that right? Yeah, but sort of the mid level or the lower level the tcl is vizio  Those those tvs that you pick up for three four hundred dollars on at walmart or whatever  um  Those margins has always been razor thin and they're getting thinner right with uh supply chain shortages shipping getting more expensive during the pandemic  Uh roku has been pretty transparent about they don't make any money with their streaming device  They actually lose money with every dronga that they sell and they're trying to make that back with advertising  Vizio is the same thing. They're doing running ad supported video services  If other companies have their ads on their devices, they're getting some kickback from that as well  So that's how they make money so in a way

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're already getting the subsidized tv because when you buy that vizio tv, they make the money not on the three dollars  Uh, but on the ads that they there's you say that they generate twenty eight dollars and thirty cents  per user  Uh with ads and other fees in the per quarter more than more than 100 bucks a year  per user  So you're already doing that in fact, you know, I have often thought that they put cameras in tv's not so you could do zoom  But so they can see if there's somebody in the room  Uh when they sell the ads I know that information goes back to advertisers. Yeah, there were four people in the room watching

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if they need cameras for all those things. I think  We all tend to overthink these things a little bit  In the end, it doesn't matter quite as much if they say oh on average three people watch  Everything that's on our tv that that's good enough for the advertiser  But yeah advertising on tv's has long been a big business and traditionally there has been sort of the business of the networks and so forth  And the cable operators now it's the business of the companies making those tv's. So this is going to be called telly

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh sometime later this year the biggest thing to happen to tv since color  I think it's going to be a little bit more complicated to say that they're going to be selling it in a store  But we don't know the actual details as you say it might you might be they'll sell it in a store

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  And it's just going to be more subsidized or  Yeah, they didn't talk to me and it's been completely stealth  I sort of found out about it through people who knew some things and then I dug up additional details. It's a great scoop

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wild just a wild story it ties into this story about ad blockers  I think it's certainly our audience more aware than ever of  Ad brokers or information brokers and ad tracking and things like that  The ftc was suing a company called  Kochava  They were a location data broker. They  sold information about where you are  Information they get from your phone presumably to advertisers  Kochava according to the new york times collects more than 90 location data points a day  From about 35 million active mobile device users  So you may not realize it but when you have an app and you give it location permissions  It's not just for the apps developer, but it may also be sold onto a broker  The location coordinates can reveal where each mobile device has been approximately every 15 minutes  Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint last august saying uh, it's problematic because  Not only does it track your visit to a store it could track your visits to private locations like churches  mosques synagogues abortion clinic clinics domestic violence shelters medical centers and homeless shelters  The location data could be used to track not just the dates and times patients visit abortion clinics for instance  But also track the locations of health care professionals who provided medical treatments like abortions in their many states  Where that would be against the law  So the ftc sued and lost  On thursday a federal judge in idaho dismissed the lawsuit against kochava  The judge wrote regulators had not provided sufficient evidence to back up their claims that the company was unfairly selling information  On the precise locations of millions of people's mobile phones  They said well you haven't proven any harm

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Now I mean  Go ahead. I I think yeah, I mean I think what's just so unfortunate about this is that lena con who you know  I admire a lot and is trying to do. Um  a lot on tech at the ftc. This is just such a good example of how you can't really  Do this without legislation right like if we had a national, you know privacy law that lena would be interested with enforcing  I don't think that you would have had that outcome in this case. But the problem is that she's trying to shove  um, you know antiquated laws into a more progressive  Model of data privacy and we just don't have the legislation to back that up

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The founder and chief executive kochava charles manning celebrated saying the company has complied with all rules and laws including privacy laws  Uh now the ftc said it's not a quali. It's qualified victory  because the judge did agree

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Location data could enable third parties to track and harm smartphone view users  He the judge merely said regulators hadn't given him  Adequate evidence that consumers were actually suffering or were likely to suffer substantial harm. So the ftc said, okay  Well, at least he stipulated that it could be harmful now. We just have to prove the harm presumably that means they're going to go back to court  um  And and fight this one, but that's discouraging  Because it's such an obvious to me. It seems like such an obvious invasion of privacy  And that's the harm by itself  Judge disagreed

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  So maybe issues here too is that um a lot of the states now, especially when it comes to these abortion laws the restrictive abortion laws  There's some states that now and basically deputize citizens  So if you're a citizen and you suspect a doctor provides you can sue them for damages. Yeah  You know  It's not too far-fetched to think somebody could buy this location data and then just monetize it by suing a bunch of doctors  Or a bunch of people who go to abortion clinics new kind of ambulance chaser. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  um, that's  terrifying  We'll watch obviously we'll watch that with interest because I know our audience is very concerned about privacy  Of all kinds and that's why I mentioned this in the context of that ad supported tv. I mean  Clearly what you're selling is information about you in order to get a free tv  so  Very very interesting  Let's see google has turned on pass keys  For a passwordless future  I immediately turn it on but there's some concerns about well, maybe maybe this is risky  It replaces not only your password but your two-factor so when I turned it on I went to a page at google  And made my phone essentially be like a yubikey  The idea is that by unlocking my phone with face id or touch id or a pin  And by the way, I probably would not recommend you use this with a pin  Uh, but it couldn't be used that way. You can unlock your google account  And of course the risk is if somebody gets your phone  And your pin  Yep, suddenly they've got your google account along with everything else alan you you think this is a good idea. Would you do this?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  It doesn't feel that great to me. Yeah hot take  Yeah, yeah from the former security person. Okay

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I'm also worried about like I just think this over reliance  And I know that you know security experts will tell you to move away from sms  But this is still you know an over reliance on your device and your phone and your phone account, right?  And and I I just worry about that like, you know every time one of these things comes out  I'm like how many iphones are stolen a year, right? Like I I just feel really bad for people who  Uh, you know get separated from their device for whatever reason because you know all your backup codes whatever it is  You know, you might have stored there. It can be really really difficult to get into your accounts. I mean the only um  way you can safeguard against that is to ensure that you have you know an iCloud backup  Right of your phone because I think if you are able to restore from an iCloud backup

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You'll have a lot of that stuff, but I don't okay. So this is uh, and this is still unclear  but uh the phyto alliance which created this pass keys, uh,  protocol has never been  Clear about the idea of moving these keys  In fact, they don't really they really have never provided a way of moving these keys  And I think that they see it as a security problem like well if you can move the keys now you got a problem  apple  Does not allow you to import or export the keys what apple's doing with the iCloud key as far as I can understand  I keep trying to read these documents and understanding them is when you get a new iphone  The keys will be moved through your iCloud to that phone, but the key is stored in a secure enclave on the hardware  This iCloud the name iCloud is merely that when you get a new device from apple you can move the keys over  As far as I know there is no  And phyto two doesn't allow for any export import of keys

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  They see that as a hazard well, that's a great way to ensure you never switch to android, isn't it? Oh

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I never thought of that. Oh, yeah exactly  Uh, I don't it's yeah, and and apple's been queried about this  I remember when they announced support but google and apple microsoft all support pass keys  But uh in every case, I think the companies are seeing this as a way to keep you from moving off of their platform

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I wonder how it works for sort of unusual devices like even smart TVs  I've never been in a situation where I have a i have a google tv  And I have two-factor authentication. I have a ub key or like one of those keys  And so it suddenly asked me to put my key into the usb part of my television and press the button  And I had to climb behind my tv basically to lock into my google account. That is not a good solution  Yeah, so so how is that going to work with?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sort of well, I don't think we're ever replacing passwords to be honest with you and that's the problem. I think this is sort of a  A solution for some in some cases, but I don't think it's going to replace passwords. You still need a fallback anyway  Because if you lose your phone, you got to have a fallback. So all of your previous  methods of logging in  Still work. You can't turn them off

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  That's another trend i'm not thrilled about now is that there's a lot of companies out there that seem to be trying to move away  Towards or push their users into oh the next time you sign up you could do passwordless  This is so amazing and all they're doing is really just sending you a confirmation email  So they've reduced it down to a single factor  For you, it's not even what you know anymore. It's just what you have

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, which is your email and that's not very secure at all, frankly

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Well, hopefully it is as secure as you can make it, but the average person isn't doing even that

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yeah, for some for some services, it's fine. Right? So  I mean, I know slack does it and one could argue that maybe for some slack  Behive does it your uh, yeah, but but for that if you subscribe to my newsletter and I highly recommend you do  But if you log in there and somebody else was going to hack your email to then read my newsletter  Yeah, it's an unlikely scenario

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Right. Uh, one i've seen do it lately is microsoft  Yeah, it's very very I don't know if that also I don't know if that also carries over to your one drive account

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a different state for sure. Yeah, so here's my google pass keys  Page, I don't think there's any harm in showing you this  For a long time maybe even without your knowledge android devices have become pass keys. You can see my google pixel 7  Was a pass key which i've never used as is my s23  Ultra those are automatically created when you sign into your google account. Here's the pass keys  I've created and the pass key with the iCloud keychain is in the same blob as  my yubikeys  So they're treating this as similar to a yubikey and it's true if you if you got my yubikey  You wouldn't need anything else  Like well you would you need my password plus a yubikey, right? I guess that's the biggest difference  The pass key there is no password. It's just the pass key

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  But in those cases where somebody gets a device of yours and you already have  The browser has already saved your password and now it asks you for the second, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't ask you though anymore password managers dashlane and one password say we're going to  Support this  But again, this is this issue that the phyto alliance doesn't talk about export import of  Passwords, so I I guess what you would be doing is replacing your iCloud keychain or your android  device with  One password which i'm not sure is a good idea either  um, so  This is i google's jumped on this and a lot of people jumped on it because no one likes passwords  But I think there's a lot of questions  Google thinks is strong enough that even users who are using its advanced protection program. That's the program  I created for members of congress and famous people  extra secure  They can use it too  Instead of the physical security keys google used to require you have two physical security keys with the advanced protection program now  you can use pass keys  I I really want to hear from some security gurus on this one. I'm not convinced. I mean my personal, you know

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Best known method that i've been using that now that i've settled on is just uh, everything's passwords  It's all made with a password manager, right? I'm using a bit warden  Um for that piece, but then everything that's important has a second factor and the second factor is in no way shape or form tied  Yes to to the email or the anything else. It is a completely separate thing  You know, which is which bit warn even bit warden even tried to make it a little  You know easier for some folks. You can add a two factor. No, let's see. Yeah bit warden  That's a bad idea  I think I don't do that  And maybe I would do that for for again something that offered a two factor if it was just like a blog or something simple  Right, then it's convenient. I can maybe cross that bridge, but i've just sort of personally made a firewall where  Thou shalt be no two factor. Yeah on the thing that has the passwords, right? It's just its own animal

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm i'm with you as well  Yeah  Unfortunately, a lot of banks require that you use sms  For your second factor, I guess that's better than nothing  That's not much

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're kind of in a mess  All right. I want to take yeah, go ahead louise. No, I was just saying I agree.

We thank you zip recruiter for all that great support we get from you  each  And every time we need to hire  Um, we were talking about, um  Ben smith's new book traffic  and  what was at the time when when he was at buzzfeed and  And later at other sites the way to you know  Make it in news was to generate traffic with attention grabbing headlines and social media  it seems to be  A little more problematic than it used to be uh with protocol, right?  Uh, I guess giga ohm in a way in its way and now vice  Apparently set it to be head for bankruptcy according to the new york times buzzfeed just shut down their news division  froze it all  Vice was valued at five point seven billion dollars have been looking hard for a buyer can't find one  Is the online news business in trouble louise?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Good question. Well, I live really close to that vice office, uh, and I used to work at vice. Um, and I can say that  uh  I think there were a lot of mistakes that were made at these companies just about the business model and how they structured the business  Um, you know, I just watched even in my short time at vice, you know over and over again sort of pivoting away from things  That made money, you know starting a cable news channel when their core demographic was cord cutting more than ever  I don't think it's just about this viral news model being um, you know, not as good as it seemed potentially  But that was definitely such a specific era, you know  I think of like the personal essays the catchy headlines, but also a lot of like, you know, really hard  um, you know  admirable reporting for sure, um, and I I think we all have you know seared into our brains anyone who worked in that era  Uh these tools one of them was called chart beat  And you could see in real time how many people were clicking on your article and it would sort of move to the top of the list  Uh of a website and and yeah  There was nothing that sort of hit the little serotonin receptors in your brain like that and and gawker and some other  Workplaces actually had them on screens  Uh that would project into the into the office so you could see you know  How you were stacking up against your competitors and I I definitely think that those sorts of incentives are not always uh,  Most positive. Yeah, I don't miss those days. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Buzzfeed it said was too reliant on facebook too. And then when facebook stopped sending links their way it was all over

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Um, yeah, definitely  I think that's one reason that semaphore is honestly like doubling down on newsletters because we want to own the audience  We want to know who's reading us how we can contact them in the future  We want to be right in your inbox instead of you know, sort of a drive-by on  Uh facebook, right? I think that's totally you don't want uh, you know  One day the platforms change the algorithm and you've totally lost your audience

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yanko you've been through these wars, too

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yep, uh, and part of two companies that folded so yeah, I think  Uh  part of that issue is what louise described the the traffic chasing and I think part of it was also that some of these bets  That they made were just really really expensive  with the  idea that they would pay off in the future and so they raised a ton of money on those ideas like making bespoke branded content and  Doing crazy video things and so  And if you raise hundreds of millions of dollars or even even more in the case of wise, I guess  Uh at some point you have to be able to pay that back and  that  Sort of forces you even more to chase those those audiences and those ad dollars and everything and  That's I think even the bigger problem. It's not that news itself isn't can't be run profitably and and they're saying huffing post  is actually  Uh profitable, right? So, um  Basvid is saying huffing post is going to stay around as a news organization because they're profitable  So you can run profitable news organizations, but if you raise so much money that you have to make this  Crazy profitable and you take these crazy bets. It's easy for those things to go wrong  I guess, you know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even today, uh with what you're doing yanko with a newsletter what semaphore is doing with this newsletter. We're still trying to find a model  for online news, it's not that  I mean, it's just and so I understand the desire to experiment and vice. It's I mean motherboard was a really great  source of security news for  Years, we we quoted it all the time  but part of the problem is just that the  Is it just that it's hard to make money in news?

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  I think it's hard to make the kind of money that justifies, uh, you know hundreds of millions of dollars in  Uh, you know venture capital funding and I think that's true for a lot of businesses right like it's not just news. It's true for  Uh ride hailing right? It's true for food delivery all these things where it's been really hard to turn a profit  Um, and I I think that's the problem. I think you can run a profitable news business. Absolutely  But it's about the scale of that and understanding that you know  You're not going to be read by everyone in the country every day, right?  Like but you know the messenger is trying it right? There's another one of these big big operations that has you know  Incredible aspirations that's about to launch and they said I think they're going to hire 500 journalists. So, you know, i'll be praying for them  Yeah, no kidding this again, you know

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I like how you said that you're not rooting for them, but you're praying for them

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of tells you something some of the problem is uh, and alex kantrowicz has talked about this in his big  tech newsletter and podcast the over  Financialization of these of these models that you know, you have to get vc funding and then the vcs are really pushing you to go  To show profit to have an exit  And it's just not a very it's not a very tenable way to create  Value, I don't know what the other I don't know what the opposite solution is  You can't bootstrap a jonah pareti at buzzfeed famously said I know news is never going to make any money  But it's important so i'm going to pay for it out of my own pocket and he grew tired of that obviously  Because it just never made any money  I don't know what the alternative is  But it sounds like it made a lot of money. Yeah, a lot of money. It just didn't make enough money to justify

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Hundreds of millions of dollars news did yeah news didn't yeah, I think I think that's the that's the problem  I mean, I think buzzfeed news did make some money. But yeah, I don't think it made enough to sustain  Uh the scale of the operation that they had right? He just like he said I just like news and I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm actually in his i'm with him. I like it too. In fact we you know  We're kind of a parasite on the on the online news industry and all we do is talk about your stories  I hope that's okay. This is important commentary is important. I hope that's okay with you  But i'm smart enough not to try to spend money on enterprise reporting because it's expensive  So I let I let uh, you know ben do it and uh, and just piggyback off semaphore and  And then so forth um  But we need news and I think that one of the bad things that this  Finance financialization and finance pressure and and traffic pressure has caused is that a lot of news is just so link baiting now  Uh, I think it's turning off users. I think we're users are not going to want to read it anymore  If I see another listicle, I don't go to listicles anymore, right?  And that was the famous buzzfeed model

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If I look at microsoft's news  Service it's almost entirely link bait articles  You'll never believe what happened next, you know  And I guess that's what drives traffic

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, but it just dilutes the the experience yeah greatly, yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually this today is a bad day to look at this because we have two very very big news stories that are dominating  dominating news and they're real news so they're not doing listicles on those but uh,  Yeah, normally it's a lot of just kind of crappy stuff

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I think we've seen models that work though emerge over  the last couple of years and I wouldn't  Sure, there's these big companies going under but I think in a local news space if you look at local non-profit news sites  They're really sort of providing a resurgence of some of the stuff that newspapers used to cover. I hope you're right  We have a great one. We have a great one here in oakland and berkeley is a familiar one, too  um, and you know smaller publishers  Newsletter-based publishers and some of the big ones are doing well, right? The new york times is doing well  So there's examples for things that work  Just these big massive bets on glitzy things and raising I think vice raised 400 million dollars from disney alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  They were never going to be able to pay that back in a reasonable way

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Funny thing is chart beats still around

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  And parsley is the other one. Yeah parsley, huh?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I just I boy I think news is so important and I think an informed  electorate is so important and um,  I just hope that there is a way forward and I would hate for it just to be  The new york times and the washington post  And and and nothing else so we got to find a way to make this possible. What is your local?  oakland and berkeley is it a newspaper is it what is it it's here's oakland side, which is a

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Nonprofit news organization that's doing really good work and covering local stuff really well in berkeley. It's berkeley side  I know that down in i.a you have laus which is yeah, laus is awesome  Public radio station down there kpcc. So they're doing good work and a lot of that is  Uh, some of it is advertising based some of this in case of i think laist. It's primarily just grida  supported  And so finding the right mixture there and keeping those newsrooms  Manageable in size and not promising the world. I think is a good recipe for for success

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Local news is so important in that course  That's one of the first things that goes away when you have that only can support a national enterprise  Of course berkeley and oakland and la are big metros  Here we are in little 50 000 person petaluma, but you know, there's a petaluma patch. There's a local newspaper  I guess there's ways to get this information  You read laist. Um louise is that

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really important. I mean i only moved to la a few years ago, but I think local news  Um, you know help me learn about and integrate into a new community. I just think it's really crucial  Yeah, and even just like you know, I think  To the of course like, you know, the really hard news is super important  But I think one thing the new york times the la as some of these other publications understand is that people want to know  Like what are the latest restaurants they want they want recipes they want crossword puzzles like they want sort of like  Lifestyle fun community part traditional lifestyle coverage. I think that stuff's important  And I think it's it's it's good when news organizations realize it's not just like winning the pulters or like which disney princess

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you it drives traffic the best la restaurants to eat brunch with your dog to me?  That's a good thing. You need to have articles like that  Yeah crucial information, yeah, no, in fact, this is great how to live with our coyote neighbors  No, this is important stuff do these writers at publications like this are they able to make a living are they doing this for the love of it  Do they have to have a job delivering food with uber eats?

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  I think uh,  I mean, I don't know every example, but I think at least in these examples  Those are real journalists that i've been working for real jobs other news organizations in the past and good. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. That's very encouraging  Makes me happy  Um  Google i.o this week  Let me take a break and we'll talk about google i.o because we're kind of running down the clock here and I  Want to give you guys a chance to tell me what you think.

Yeah, there's gonna be a folding phone and I guess  Well, we'll see if they if they  What they say about it at google io, but they have with video teasers on youtube and twitter  Teased this is it  Uh, looks like it's a two-screen phone a extra wide screen that unfolds and then one on the front  So you get you get both it unfolds into a 7.6 inch display. That's pretty big  Uh, the exterior screen is 5.8 inches  Here's the scary thing the rumors are it's going to be as much as two thousand dollars  Any do do any of you use folding phones?  No, i'm trying to figure out who this is for  I think it was a lot of money. Yeah. Well that for sure, you know  Somebody wants the coolest looking thing. I guess samsung's been selling these as have other companies for some time  um  I don't know. Maybe it's just I don't know. I think that the sweet spot in android is the cheap phone not the expensive phone

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I think they keep trying to encroach in the space of  premium, you know how there's well  Maybe some of that but maybe also some of oh look at how much more you can do with this because it has the bigger  Screen like assuming that you're gonna bust out a keyboard or something  And use this thing as as if it you know was like a larger  I think that's where they try to start going with these things because what I mean  Why else would you need the screen to be really that big?  Right other than either to show off or to try to be more productive somehow but to be more productive  Okay. Well now you need to do some other ui or interface  Things like to be able to effectively uh leverage that right? Well, we'll see how google makes the case I guess on

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wednesday  uh, I wonder if google will address jeffrey hintin the so-called godfather of ai who  Uh quit google so that he could warn of the danger ahead. He does not by the way  Uh think that what we're currently seeing with chat gbt and bard and so forth is dangerous. He's more worried  I don't know about the sci-fi  Future when it's robocop or something

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Is it bad that I was so worried that his photo in that article was ai generated doesn't look real does it?  Do you think it's fake?  It's a really nice picture, but it's we'll never know anymore. Will we?  Right. See maybe he's making the point right now

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, it's scary kade metz had an article, but he also did interviews with I think the mit technology review  And so forth  Uh, it is a little concerning that people who should I mean he basically created large language models who should you know understand the deep?  Uh implications of this are worried about the future  Um, he actually uh, he uh as a graduate student in 1972  Was the first to create something called neural networks  Then a professor of computer science at cmu  Left because he didn't want to take pentagon funding went to canada  um  He is opposed to artificial intelligence on the battlefield  In canada, he built a neural network that could teach itself to identify flowers dogs and cars. I remember that actually  In fact, I think we had one of his students on our show up in canada as I remember  chief scientist, uh, let's see  Google spent 44 million dollars to hire him and his students and acquire their company  Uh, he got the turing award for their work on no neural networks  But he's a little worried  He says as companies improve their ai systems they become increasingly dangerous  Look how it was five years ago and how it is now take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  He's also I mean  Really respect what he did there, but he's also as the article states 75  Yeah, which is still younger than you know, a lot of the politicians we have but  Um

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think everybody's younger than a lot of the politicians we have yes. Yeah, but at this point, you know

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Maybe he's just too old  I don't know if he's too old but sort of it's time to retire. Yeah. Yeah  it's an interesting good way to retire to say I  Can't I resign protest he had I mean he's having his op in heimer moment

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You remember when robert op in heimer the physicist, uh who helped perfect the atom bomb first saw it  He says now I now i'm become a death destroyer of worlds. He was  Very adamantly afraid of what the atom bomb would bring and that I understand  That was not unreasonable

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't think his standpoint is I don't think he's not being genuine  Right just for I don't think really just impelishing or I don't see any concrete

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh thing to worry about that he's talking about honestly, well

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Right, but none of us have the perspective that he might have so so there you go. Yeah, you know, it's  Maybe just food for thought right? It's uh something

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  His one good point one good point is it's hard to see he says it's hard to see how you can prevent  Bad actors from using ai for bad things, but that's true of all  All  technical  Advances, right? You say the same thing about crypto  Cryptography not cryptocurrency

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  But look at all the ways that we  Went down the potentials even earlier in this show where things could go down very bad roads, right if unchecked so  Maybe the warning is you know, maybe he's just trying to get the warning out there just to make people

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Think will sundar prachai on wednesday take any time to reassure  People he's got to explain why google is so far behind

Speaker: Janko Roet
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just thinking about that because sundar used to go out on on stage at aio every year and talk about ai  Right people were just like oh, that's his thing, right now  It's everybody's thing and he's kind of behind actually so it sort of turns the conversation in its head. It's going to be interesting for sure

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We will be watching jeff jarvis and I uh 10 a.m pacific on wednesday right before windows weekly and  This week in google google i.o may 10th  Used to be something i'd look forward to so with great, you know  Excitement and i've laid the last three google ios have been you know, I guess it was covet but they've been very disappointing  Let's go ahead. Yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Sorry, uh, yeah, I have an inkling he may temper it maybe with you know, if they are a little bit behind  as we all can observe, uh, maybe he  Uh strategically tempers the the or you know  Sort of makes it a little bit, uh  Washing over them being behind by saying oh we're being extremely cautious

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what tim cook's position was when they apple quarterly results came out on thursday  His three word response  I don't know. It was more than three words, but uh, jason aiden writing for ink says I liked his three word response  Which is uh, we're going to be  deliberate and thoughtful  In how we approach ai  Uh apple way behind  I mean the problem is we don't know if they're behind or not because they're very secretive. We know syries way behind  But who knows apple could have a killer ai just waiting in the wings  I think ai is going to be the very most interesting topic at google i.o and we look forward  To talking about that  Let's see. What else? Uh before we the halo amazon halo. Bye. Bye  Bye, good article in the verge about all of the plans  Amazon had chris welch writing  To celebrity fitness classes and ai-powered personal trainer  Apple watch support that was all supposed to come out this fall amazon killed it before they got there  Hmm I had a halo it was dopey  It was dopey  And well the problem is you had fitbit you had apple watch you had all these  Devices with screens and none of which required you to get naked and take pictures of yourself before you used them  Nor did they have monthly subscription fees  Well fitbit did but you didn't have to I I think it was just not a well thought out  Plan any of you use the halo  I

Speaker: Louise Matsakis
Transcript:  Use it for five minutes these devices though. It's always really unfortunate when they just you know, oh, yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stop supporting the platform. Yeah, people probably put a lot of money in there. Yeah

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I do. Uh, I do use your last sponsor

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You use what was oh express vpn gotta use a vpn for years. Yeah. Yep. Yep  Um  I guess that's pretty much it. I don't  What tell us the latest greatest?  Technology advances in ssd alan melvintana. Oh boy anything

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  You're just lining me up to really seem biased for my own. Oh, go ahead

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me guess is it coming to us from soledime synergy 2.0

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Listen if I was still running the beat doing the ssd reviews  I would have been  I would have loved to be able to be the person to write the article that john cultor here was able to write

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In tweaktown. So what is that? What is why is software matter?  with an ssd well

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  As it turns out if you start really digging into performance  Of ssds for various tasks and you start doing really detailed analysis and tracing and seeing okay  Is there any low-hanging fruit left?  That we can squeeze out of the system and make this thing quicker  That is not necessarily all about oh we have to do gen 5 pci  We have to do this we have to do we have to throw all this hardware at it. Is it possible  to squeeze  Some extra performance out from some optimizations elsewhere in the stack  And as we have discovered the answer to that is yes  And that is in the form of a driver  Which we now make and as a part of the synergy 2.0 software that we just happened to launch last wednesday

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when you get windows you get a standard microsoft nvme driver. Can you replace this with a soledime?  driver

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  You not only can you but our software does it for you and it's free

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And does it make a difference? I mean will it work with other ssds?

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  So there's a couple of points to the software. There's the driver piece and the driver piece  uh has some benefits for  There's a one of our ssd models called a p41 plus which is a qlc ssd  Which has a cache as as most ssds do especially qlc ssds  Um, and our driver in that case helps that product be smarter about how it uses the cache  So it's able to do things that a normal ssd can't do because normal ssds have no idea what's running around what's running on windows  Right. So the driver is the thing that can sort of link those two halves together a little bit more better

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  More benefit in windows than you would say in lennox or mac os

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Absolutely more benefit in windows. We have to focus on windows. That's where the I mean everybody knows  That's where the bulk of everybody is and we're you know  Our driver guys are working as hard as they can just to get to accomplish what they've accomplished so far. So  Unfortunately, we can't make it, you know work everywhere. We had to focus on the biggest fish right now and that is windows  um  There's also some other pieces in the driver that are things that you wouldn't actually get a benefit from so much on the lennox side  Because there are things that the windows driver just  Microsoft isn't going to sit there and endlessly optimize their driver. They're just going to do what they need to do to make it work  We had the extra cycles to burn on making it better and more optimized  So we did a bunch of optimization on you know on and along those avenues and found some low-hanging fruit  And we're able to get some extra gains there as well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So gamers and pc other pc master race people have probably long been aware that you can tweak your ssds to get better performance  Samsung offered software to do that for a while the magician  Tweaktown's conclusion is this is the successor  Synergy 2.0  It makes they said as much as an 8 difference in performance enough so that an inexpensive solid-ime ssd can outperform  the higher and  Samsung evo extreme models that's pretty darn good

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually I was pleasantly surprised remember. I usually tend to look at these things  Objectively, even if I happen to work at the company right and part of my job at the company is to make sure that yeah  Make sure that we're testing the things correctly things like that right and uh, I was  I came on board and started testing  Testing this new these new drivers. Even I was kind of like wow. Okay, how much i'm excited. How much does it cost?  How much does the driver cost nothing?  Oh  How much would you pay?  The driver is one piece. Uh, it's also there's also a synergy  Ui  That's also a part of the package and that gives you your typical  Toolbox type functionality that you would have seen and with you know other competing things over the years, right?  Every ssd maker tends to have their own little software package  You can install to do various things like secure erase and other, you know  Your other utility type functions of the of for storage in general, right?  We're doing our best to be more open about that as well  So while the driver is the thing that's really just attached to to benefit our hardware  The the ui and then the toolkit type software that we that we are providing  We try to make it as open as we can. So for example to secure erase and ssd  We are opening up secure erase most companies only make it work with their own product. We're making it follow the standard  You know nvme secure erase type operations. So as long as  Even if it's our competitor's ssd  We don't care as long as it conforms to the standard way to secure erase and ssd our software will let the user do it  Right. We're not we're not trying to lock everybody into a to a walled garden  You know  We really want our our software to be like a swiss army knife for doing ssd type things for a long time

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I always recommend intel  ssds  Probably because you told me they were the the best this is before you even worked for intel and the software and the  Firmware was the best  This is essentially intel's former ssd division, which they spun off

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yes, these are not new ssds, right? These are this is essentially a queue and and uh, a continuation  Of all of the work that had been done all of the pedigree from all of the work done back at intel, right?  It's the same team. It's all the same folks  Yeah, they just spun off and they you know began this new company this new initiative solid dime and  The work continues and you know the the engineers  I don't know what it was but something about that spin-off and that move and everything the engineering guys and the driver guys like they really just  Something lit and they just started really, you know putting out some some amazing work

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you get this driver software just by when you buy a solid on  ssd

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I mean, it's not in the box. It's just there's a link. Oh you download website. Okay, go to the website download it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you're using a solid i'm ssd on windows, you should probably get this software because it'll make a difference

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  You're just leaving performance on the table if you don't right? It's it's just silly. You know, the other thing that blows me away is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know when ssds first came out and one of the things we always talk to you about on the this weekend computer hardware was  Well, are they going to be reliable? Are they going to be robust?  They're going to last as long as spinning drives they it seems to be are more robust and reliable than spinning drives. Yes  I mean it depends but they're pretty is down to there. No, there's no disadvantage  Is there and they're a lot faster

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I mean  Okay, there used to be a disadvantage in the fact of hard drives  You could just keep writing and they would never wear out but modern hard drives actually start to come with an endurance rating of their own  Right as far as how many petabytes you can pass through the the heads in the disk  So that the thing that used to be a differentiating factor is kind of no more at this point  So it's they're even more on on a level playing field

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and the price per gigabyte used to be ridiculous for ssds. I'm see this is a solid i'm  Two terabyte drive for under 100 bucks

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yep, well, I don't know if you I don't know if you remember because you might have not caught the pc perspective podcast  But like for years ryan shroud went on and on  chanting 10 cents a gig right as a price point that he was hoping that we would get to  And the thing you just showed is a nickel five cents a gig

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes  Unbelievable we live in  Amazing times. That's all I can say and thank you for the work you do  You sold me so from now on no more samsung  980 pros  You get the same performance for less

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  I'm saying it. I trust trust the independent reviewers. Not me. I work for the company. So don't take my word as gospel

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I take the press guys words. Yeah. Well, that's what the tweak guy said. So I believe him

Speaker: Allyn Malventano
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean i'm i'm i'm happy to like  I like that i'm working here. Yes  it's yeah, it sucks that I no longer work in the press and no longer get to play in the in that in that battlefield, but  This makes up for it being knowing that i'm working on stuff that really you know is doing good, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice new review john colter just just came out a couple of days ago at tweaktown.com  Get the get the new solid i'm synergy 2.0 ssd software when you get your  SSD from soda dime. Thank you alan. It's great to see you  Someday, I just want you to do a tour of all the stuff on your bookshelves behind you  Oh, we don't have that kind of time crazy what's going on back there?
