End time: 219.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a...  Yeah, it's an app about apps.  It's an app about apps.  That's what I mean.  And it looks like the app is running on your phone, so it's better than looking at text  descriptions and screenshots.  Actually show you the app running and it looks full screen on your phone.

Transcript:  It's clever because, frankly, I think this is what everybody in content is doing, is  writing an app around their content.  You know, Conde Nast.  Yeah.  This is what you do these days.  Yeah.

Start time: 230.92
End time: 245.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I found amazing is that no one is really caught on to the idea of using an app as something  for episodic programming.  It's not like something you just download once and it only does one thing.  I mean, update it with RSS feeds and every day there's a new episode.

Transcript:  That's my favorite.  I really like that.  Yeah, that's real good.  I wish a version like that was available for the iPhone.  I'd feature it for sure if it was on the iPhone.  There is one for the iPhone, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The same kind?  I haven't seen it.  Same guy.  ShiftKey software.  Craig wrote it first for the iPhone and then there's an iPad version.  But I'll put it on this week.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Sure.  Lots of stories today.  I don't even know where to begin.  I guess, let's talk a little bit about the news and then we'll talk about the personalities  on the show.  Give Kevin a break.  Poor Kevin's been grilled for the whole week about Dig 4.  I love, just on the record, Dig 4 is fantastic.  You know that because it's kind of...  It was your idea.  It was my idea.  It's the feature set I wanted.  But I know some of the Dig fans are not happy.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  But first we should start with our old friend Paul Allen suing everybody except Microsoft.  And for some reason Amazon.  Claiming he basically owns every technology on the web.  I'm surprised he didn't sue you.

Start time: 324.84
End time: 326.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sued quite a few people, didn't he?

Start time: 326.84
End time: 365.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The idea was that his company, Interval Research, which was a blue sky R&D company, I remember  it was running while we were doing tech TV.  Paul owned tech TV and Interval was going on while we did tech TV.  In fact, they closed it because it was just too blue sky.  They weren't creating any products.  Well, I guess they created some patents.  And now Paul is suing Google, Facebook, eBay.  Everybody, all the big players on this, saying that he has the patents that basically are  used to...  I don't know.  It's kind of...  They're such vague patents.

Start time: 365.54
End time: 368.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's for processes like recommendation engines and stuff like that.

Start time: 369.24
End time: 370.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is odd that he didn't sue Amazon.

Start time: 371.78
End time: 375.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He sued Apple.  No, I think Amazon's listed.  Amazon's listed.  Here's the rundown.

Start time: 376.00
End time: 402.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm quite sure Amazon's listed.  Google, Facebook, eBay, Apple, Yahoo, AOL, Netflix, Office Depot, Office Max, Staples,  and YouTube.  You're right.  eBay.  No, it got eBay, not Amazon.  No Amazon and no Microsoft.  Of course, Amazon uses Paul Allen technology and Microsoft is...  He's the major investor, obviously, one of the guys who started it.  Is he Amazon as well?  Yeah, there's some technology that Amazon uses that's Paul Allen venture.

Start time: 403.44
End time: 404.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft also has 803 lawyers.

Start time: 406.80
End time: 412.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you'd think Google might have a lawyer or two in its back pocket.  I'm sure they do.  Why is he suing Office Depot?

Start time: 412.80
End time: 432.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I suspect that they've licensed it, that they essentially have struck a deal with it and  probably...  Paul Allen's been talking to Google and all these other folks for a while and maybe has  not been able to score a hit with it, but he's there in Seattle with Microsoft and Amazon  and they're probably already licensed.

Start time: 433.88
End time: 437.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this an example of a patent troll?  Absolutely.

Start time: 438.68
End time: 457.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I can understand if he was going head to head with one of these companies and he  was put out of business and they were using his patent and they had infringed on his patent  and now he wants to get a little something back, but the guy is a billionaire and he's  just sitting there on these patents.  Why sue Office Max and Staples?  That's on his list of people he's suing.  It's crazy.

Start time: 458.92
End time: 466.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's go back to the origin.  This is about business processes like the OneClick, which is the famous Amazon patent.

Start time: 466.28
End time: 468.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon has that patent and has declined to pursue it.

Start time: 469.48
End time: 471.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought Apple paid for it.

Start time: 472.60
End time: 485.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe they licensed it to a few people, but Amazon could have...  I mean, everybody uses OneClick.  Amazon could have been much more aggressive.  I think what they decided, I remember that reading, Jeff Bezos had decided, well, we're  going to own it.  We could pursue it, we could go after people, but we're not.

Start time: 487.36
End time: 491.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But obviously this shows that the Patent and Trademark Office is severely broken.  It's screwed up.

Start time: 492.36
End time: 493.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's bad news.

Start time: 493.36
End time: 499.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I do have a contrarian view on this though.  I'd like you to bear with me for a minute if I can try and roll it out for you, Leo.

Transcript:  That's the war sonnus.  So I don't know Paul Allen.  I don't know if he's a nice guy or douchebag.  Did he close Tech TV?  He did.

Start time: 513.32
End time: 515.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's not a douchebag.  He was kind of a doofus.

Start time: 516.52
End time: 521.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he's definitely smart.  We know that and he's probably not smart.

Start time: 521.68
End time: 522.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's had some bad investments.

Start time: 523.52
End time: 543.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say he's not the smartest guy I ever met.  We don't know.  We can't tell.  He's not in great health.  Well, he retired from Microsoft because he had Hodgkin's lymphoma, but he seems to have  recovered from that.  I think that that actually was a pretty good move on his part because he got out of Microsoft,  took the stock with him and now has a giant submarine and ship.

Start time: 543.90
End time: 573.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So take this.  Let's try this on for size.  Let's say you're Paul Allen.  You don't know.  You've had a near death experience, Hodgkin's lymphoma.  I guess it could be terminal and you want to work on your legacy.  And I think the tip off is actually that he didn't list Microsoft and Amazon in his lawsuit  because he doesn't want to give them any hassle.  And here's why.  I think Paul Allen is actually a patriot in the truest sense of the word.  Oh my God.  Bear with me.

Start time: 573.90
End time: 578.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm bearing with you.  I'm bearing.  I don't know if I'm with you, but I'm bearing.

Start time: 578.24
End time: 642.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we know that this patenting of software and the way the patent and trademark office  run is severely broken.  So what if he went after me?  If you want to really for once and for all get rid of these stupid patent lawsuits, the  best way is to get the biggest tech companies on the planet and all of their legal teams  and have them all band together to prove that your patents are stupid.  Well, maybe that's fighting to show how bad the patent laws.  Yes.  Then we have jurisprudence that these patents are bogus and maybe he's doing this as his  final legacy for the world and saying, let's just have everything.  All the lawyers, Google, Apple, Facebook, all these guys, of course they're going to  win.  They're going to prove that no way these patents you have are bogus, which will immediately  obfuscate any other stupid patent and software.  I think the guy is a genius.  They will win.  They're going to win.  Look at the law firm they've got.  Sussman, what is it?  Some rinky-dink firm, Sussman Godfrey, who represent little guys against oil companies  and win like $16.

Start time: 642.80
End time: 649.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the interval research attorneys?  That's the ones.  That's a small firm.

Start time: 649.18
End time: 650.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not a big firm.  That's interesting.

Start time: 651.80
End time: 655.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that might be a good theory, Adam.  Most of your stuff is crackpot, but that...  Yay!

Start time: 656.80
End time: 660.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think you should play the Hot Pocket sound again.

Transcript:  A special request from Dallas going out to Dwight, everybody.  Stop talking!

Start time: 666.14
End time: 704.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but think about it.  If you had nothing but money and you could drag all these guys into a fight, and of course  Google and Apple, we will fight this vigorously.  I wish someone would say something different.  We will fight this.  It has no merit.  We'll fight it vigorously.  Why don't they just say it's a douchebag?  That would be much simpler.  And I think that's exactly what he's doing.  He's trying to prove once and for all that these patents are no good and he's going to  get the biggest guys in the world to prove it and then they're going to turn around and  go, oh, wait a minute.  We can't actually sue people over our bogus patents anymore, including that douchebag  Merck Gash who has the podcast patent.  Oh, yeah.  What is the status of that?  Well, he's just sitting there.  He's ready to troll, right?

Start time: 704.96
End time: 707.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why...  So now if I call him netcast, am I off the hook?

Start time: 708.68
End time: 713.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because he's still a podcast.  He has patented episodic subscriptions and it was awarded.

Start time: 715.04

Start time: 733.61
End time: 738.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he's just sitting there.  So I hope Paul Allen doesn't phrase job in losses.

Start time: 738.48
End time: 744.30

End time: 763.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 763.64
End time: 773.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If there was one reform I'd like to see come out of this is that you're not allowed to  sue after two years of somebody breaking your patent, of using your patented idea.

Start time: 775.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not just make software copyrightable?  That's different.  I think it's writing, it's words.  You write it in a...  People write it in an ID or a text editor.  I think it's copyrightable.  That'd be great because then we have...  You can even copyright that under Creative Commons.  It's all set up.  The whole idea of this trademarking or patenting is ludicrous and it's actually stifling innovation.  Totally agree.

Start time: 802.22
End time: 815.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know it's a broken system.  It seems to me to go back and look at why the patent office was invented.  It was actually invented to try to stimulate innovation and get more people to invent things.  How's that working out?  It's now being used against innovators.

One of our guys at DIG reached out to him and said, hey, do you want to go have lunch?  You want to grab a coffee?  How fun.  And he wrote back and he was like, yeah, sounds good.  What a good idea.  I know.  So here's the problem though.  We are about to go visit him and he writes us on Friday that he had to jump into a meeting  with Jobs and he couldn't make it so we're rescheduling for next week.  So you haven't had it yet?

Transcript:  So I love this theory and I know Kevin, you wrote a little bit about it that Wednesday  Apple's got a big announcement.  It could be just, you know, more iPods, but there's a lot of theorizing that there'll  be an iPod touch with a front facing camera, the retina display.  That seems reasonable.  Obviously an updated nano.  Some people say it'll be square, but here's the real question.  You said, and I think I agree with you and I TV might be a really good move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're right, Leo.  I heard you talking about that I think last week on Twitter.  Was it last week?  Yeah.  And boy, I hope so.  It's fantastic.  You get your content through apps and it wasn't, didn't Job say at the D conference that you  had to circumvent the whole cable industry and other than getting your bandwidth, obviously,  I think it's great.  And for content producers as well, wouldn't it be great to just fire up your Twitter.  You're doing it.  You're doing it.  Exactly.

Transcript:  You're ahead of the game.  So Kevin's post is why Apple's ITV will change everything on Kevin Rose's blog.  And I couldn't agree more with you, Kevin.  Why don't you kind of summarize what you think?

Start time: 991.40
End time: 1040.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've heard the rumors like everyone else about, you know, the different things  that are coming to ITV.  Apparently this is going to be like a $99 device.  So something that's within the price range of, you know, an average consumer.  And the device will be iOS powered.  So the same OS that powers the iPhone, the iPad, it's just going to run on this device.  Which opens up the whole app library.  Right.  Exactly.  All they have to do is recompile it.  And boom, your app is working on your ITV.  But the interesting thing is that, you know, some of the stuff I was thinking about was  we already have these other devices like, you know, our iPhone, iPad.  You know, these can instantly be remotes and controls and give us an interface to interact  with the ITV.  I mean, I don't know.  There's a game on iPad called Chopper 2.  It's a helicopter flying game.  Love it.  Which you control with the iPhone.  Which you control with the iPhone.  Love it.

It's kind of like based around the Chrome browser.  It's a browser.  It is a browser, right?  So but then they have Android apps and that OS is a little bit different.  Android apps and that OS.  So why have both?  To me, like why don't they just stick with the Android OS, make that kind of like the  OS that runs anywhere, allow it to run on their Google TV, allow it to run on, you know,  a laptop, whatever it may be.

I mean, I visited China and actually visited some of the Apple supply chains, the companies  that make Apple stuff, and Apple has the best supply chains wrapped up.  They're not going to go to work for somebody else.  And that's what...  When people say, well, what's going to happen after Jobs disappears from Apple?

Not because right now anybody would use that much, but because if you start watching TV  on your iTV, you'll quickly hit that.  So there's one.  And then of course, net neutrality.

I think that they showed that they either don't have the guts or the will to become  a bandwidth player.  They could have.  They put the 4.6 billion down, but they didn't pull the trigger on it.  They let Verizon and AT&T split that band.  And that was basically saying, well, we're not in it to play.  And now, of course, with this net neutrality deal, they've brokered with Verizon.  They're showing really that they don't have the guts to do it, I think.

They kind of have a history of working with the music industry and somewhat with the movie  industry.  But except the stuff that I've read recently, I think there was a Wall Street Journal piece  that basically said that only a couple of studios are in on the ITV.  Well, they're going to watch.

Well, now, instead of doing a deal with Apple and being on the Apple store at 99 cent rental,  they make an app.  They charge you 10 bucks a month.  They don't need Apple.  Apple collects its 30%.

When I had my iPad and the Lost season was finishing up, I was watching on the ABC app.  I was watching Lost, and they had their little ads that ran every five minutes or whatever  it may be.  And in the future, if it's 99 cents an episode, I'll click buy it now.  It'll go instantly through the Apple store.  It's done.  It's no accident that Netflix is on there.

And they say in Hollywood, where I reside now, the joke is exchanging real dollars for  digital dimes.  It's just not enough money.  It really isn't.  That's mainly because of the unionization of the motion picture industry.  Well, then they're out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then they're out of business.  That's what cable companies say, is they say, we can't make it as a bits provider.  We have to sell premium services or there's no model for us.  I think it's why Verizon put Fios all over the country.

I think the app will be winners.  I think the app model makes sense.  My question is, OK, I'm the cable guy.  I'm the guy who owns the pipe.

And then I found some guy, actually some guys who do design work and they design some stuff for me.  And now I've got a guy working on an Android version.  I mean, it's great.  I think you're absolutely right.  Look at you, man.  You've got a little one-man shop, really.  And you've got some infrastructure, but it's, I think we're disintermediating all the big companies.  Particularly when it comes to media, I think it's going to spread out into the edges and it's going to be,  it'll come back eventually.

And, you know, nature does the same thing.  So we're in a period right now where where the current structure is being taken apart.  But Adam's right.  You know, eventually everything will be centralized.  We'll have another round.  I don't know.  Media companies.  I disagree.  I think it'll be done differently.

We don't need to be in any one spot.  You know, Paul Graham talks about how how stupid, how foolish the idea of building an  office with cubicles in it.  It's very industrial age.

Transcript:  I mean, some of the story here is not that USA Today is failing because it's a print.  It's because the print edition of the Wall Street Journal became the nation's newspaper.

Start time: 2589.87
End time: 2655.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  It's a matter of competition.  I think print will always be around in some form.  What's on it is going to be different.  Just like the way AM radio changed when FM came along, I think there will always be print.  Print is a good technology in and of itself, and there are times when it works better than others.  But I think that the future of news and the future of local news is indeed digital.  I don't want to say necessarily the web because I kind of agreed with the wired piece that the web isn't dying.  Really?  It's being deprecated.  And apps like you guys were talking about earlier I think are going to be the future.  I think people will get their information in very precise ways through precise applications.  And so I think that that's what every media company should do.  Unfortunately, the Houston Chronicle does not yet have an app.  We are working on one through Hearst.  But I think that is indeed the future.  And the web is being deprecated for sure as well as print.  I guess it's kind of weird talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I have a real world example of USA Today.  Jonathan Schwartz was really nice.  He wrote an article about the Big App Show.  And I could track most of it.  I think because it went online first.  And within a couple hours I had, I don't know, like 15,000, 20,000 downloads of the app.  The next day it comes out in print.  It's nothing like crickets.  No one cares.  And this has been true for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is very little transfer from print over to Brigitte.  We run in the Chronicle a reference, a refer to something that's online.  It drives very little traffic from what we can tell.  However, I think that's a matter of the audiences being very different.  You know, people are not going to go look at something, put their newspaper, their print edition down,  and then go to the web and tap on it.  But I think that when you have these two different audiences,  each one of them cares passionately about it.  And what's funny is digital people who are really into using the web and apps to get their news,  when their name appears in the newspaper, they go crazy.  When we have a story that runs in the newspaper with somebody in Houston who's involved in the digital community here,  they go nuts because their name appears in print.  They're so excited.  So it still carries some power.  Yeah.

You know, we've talked about Dig Four before.  You debuted it here.  Is that your idea?  And I was really thrilled.  Well, it wasn't really my idea.  But I like the change.  The idea being that, of course, you can continue to follow everybody.  But if you want, you can also follow people that you know as in Twitter and constrain  your news that way.

Start time: 3340.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So, just to give everyone a little background on that feature, we've had that feature forever  for the last three years.  Oh, you have?  Oh, I didn't even know it.  It was just tucked away.  Yeah.  Like there was a friending.  We didn't call it following.  We called it to add them as a friend.  Right.  But it was like a hidden feature.  Right.  So the main reason we made My News the new default is that upcoming, like the upcoming  section where people would actually dig stories to get them on the home page was used by a  very, very small amount of people.

Start time: 3371.32
End time: 3372.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there was a lot of spam in there.  There was just a bunch of crap that was going on in there that, you know, we looked at that  and we said, OK, we have, you know, it was less than 1% of the audience.  The audience was actually going into upcoming.  It was less than a half a percent, actually, that were going in there.  And so, you know, how can we get, you know, when you dig a story, how can we push that  out to your friends and the people that you know so that we can help spread the message?  Because I was digging great content, but no one would see it.

Start time: 3395.38
End time: 3398.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  I want to follow Kevin Rose.  I want to follow Robert Scoble.  Right.

Start time: 3399.42
End time: 3442.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's who I want to see.  So basically what we tried to do is make that the new default view.  And so what we did is we created a directory of users.  This directory, some of the people out on the Internet have said, like, it's clear the  publishers are paying you for this.  And we've never taken a single dollar from any publisher.  I'm in that directory.  You didn't pay me for that.  You didn't pay us for that.  So basically what we tried to do is like, OK, what is the most popular content on dig?  We reached out to some publishers, to some wacky sites like, you know, the oatmeal, the  onion, Scoble, Lea, Adam will add you the list if you want to be.  But essentially what we're trying to do is create a directory of interesting people and  taste makers that you might want to follow to find good content.  Right.

Start time: 3443.78
End time: 3456.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Leo, there's news breaking on dig right now.  I just dug an article that says Google is in talks with major studios to rent movies  via YouTube.  And so if you're following me, I dug that.  So you'll see that on your dig screen.

Start time: 3456.82
End time: 3484.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So that would be on your right at the top of your news when you log in to dig if you're  following Scoble.  So but here's the issue, though.  There's a couple of problems.  We've had a lot of feedback that's come in.  And so what we're trying to do is basically spend the next week and look at the stats,  look at the usage, look at the feedback and figure out which things we need to fix.  Because every time we do a release, there's always something that we have to fix.  The promotion algorithm is clearly broken.  It's not looking at enough diversity rules that we've had in the past.  So we're trying to fix that.

Start time: 3484.84
End time: 3486.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that one of the things people complain about?

Start time: 3486.32
End time: 3591.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, we had a day where we had probably 10 or 15 stories from Mashable on there.  And so Mashable went out and said to their audience, like, everyone sign up for our new  dig account, follow us, dig our stories.  And the audience did that.  And we used to have this little piece of the algorithm that would go out and make sure  there was enough digging diversity in a story before we promoted it that is no longer working  on the new dig.  And so we promoted a bunch of Mashable stories, like a bunch in a row, which we've never done  before.  So that's coming back.  We're going to fix that.  The other stuff is we want to bring back upcoming because if there's some people that really  are passionate about it, they care about it, like, sure, we can add that back.  That's no problem.  And but the big one is really we want to make sure that that directory of users that we're  presenting to you is not just a list that we pick at dig, not just something that, you  know, a handful of people sit around a table and say who should be first, who should be  second, but really that it's powered by the users.  So what you'll see in the future is that everyone will be in the directory.  Every single user of dig will be listed in the directory.  And you'll be ranked based on how good of a digger you are.  So how good you are at finding cool content.  So when you go to the tech section, if you are one of the best tech diggers, meaning  your content is always being dug by a bunch of other people that are into tech, you'll  be being ranked high.  So that means that, you know, that's not going to be a major corporation or organization.  It's going to be an individual.  If it is, it's because people voted on it.  Exactly. If it is in gadget, it's in gadget because they have good stories.  Right. Or if it's you, it's you.  It's it's basically but it's going to be fair and open to everyone.  And I think, you know, honestly, looking at the feedback, that that's a big issue that  I absolutely think that we screwed up on.  Like we should have had it that way from day one.  But, you know, it's going to take the first thing we have to do is stabilize the site  because we've been getting a lot of broken wagons for a while now.  I like that. Instead of the fail.

Transcript:  But Kevin. Yeah.  Can I ask a question?  And I've never really used dig.  I did sign up for the dig for beta a couple of weeks ago when you were on the show.  And you've talked about dig a lot.  And I have no dog in the hunt.  But this being this week in tech, I'd like to ask you the question, which I think is  the elephant in the room, which is a really tough one.  I just take it as a journalistic question and nothing else.  Hit me. I would say that the some of the vibe that's out there and I may be wrong.  That's what I'm feeling and hearing is Twitter came in and ate digs lunch.  How would you respond to that?

Start time: 3628.66
End time: 3839.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that dig is is a very different use case.  Not very different, but it's slightly different.  Like when you go to Twitter, I'll give you an example.  Like we have Tony Hawk is one of our suggested users on the dig profiles.  And also he's a suggested Twitter user.  If you go out and you follow him on both services, you're going to get his links  and everything he's talking about, you know, maybe he's dropping his kids off at the park  or whatever it may be on Twitter.  On dig, it's all about the links.  It's only the curated content that you're finding on the Web that you're bringing,  that you're digging, that you're spreading with your audience.  So, you know, there's there's a there's a room for everyone to play nicely together.  You have Facebook, which is a combination of things that your friends are liking,  you know, profile pictures of change with your friends, new relationship statuses,  things like this, which is put into an algorithm.  They spit out a page they think you like.  Right. You don't get everything.  You get a mixture of certain things.  Twitter is everything.  So it's the raw feed much in the same way that dig is a raw feed.  You get everything in the as it's being dug, presented in your in your my news.  But with dig, we said, OK, we've always been about the links.  That's one thing that we're good at is servicing, you know, cool content.  Why not just we want to cut out all the other crap and just make it just about that raw feed.  So, you know, I don't think that I mean, of course, yes, Twitter has taken some of our traffic.  There's no doubt about it.  Twitter and Facebook.  I don't think that it's it's it's not like it's it's one of those things where I believe  that Twitter is the death of dig.  I mean, we still are a very.  Profitable, healthy business, just sitting there doing what we do best, you know, so  unless they get into like the link aggregation game where they create a zeitgeist of information,  where you look at a page and you say, OK, aside from trending topics, here is the best stuff on  tea or whatever it may be, any type of vertical.  That's kind of where we're taking things going forward.  So actually, let me explain a little bit better.  So the way you look at dig today, you think, you know, diggers have always thought, OK,  it's all about that front page of news.  When you go there, it's like the zeitgeist of what's happened in the last 24 hours where  we plan to take it is that, you know, we want to create this director where you can come  in and say, these are my interests.  You can come and say, I'm into rock climbing, I'm into tea, I'm into whatever it may be.  And when you do that, we want to start monitoring how good you are at digging and finding  quality content in those verticals.  Right. So we want to build verticals of content based on your interests, based on your digs,  and then create a leaderboard and create tastemakers in those verticals.  So a great example is I created a Twitter directory called We Follow and a little over  right around a million people have added themselves to this Twitter.  I think a great solution.  And they've tagged themselves all these different terms.  And right now in the We Follow directory, there's 900 people that have tagged themselves  under the word knitting, like knitters that are really passionate about knitting.  They care deeply.  They care deeply about it.  So what we're trying to do at dig is, you know, OK, let's follow that same model.  And how can we build out verticals where we can get these super, super passionate  people about a given topic into these verticals to participate, to gain rank and have  like, you know, reputation in these areas?  And and then the best of the best will make it to the front page.  And that's the front page of the top news section of dig.  So if you wonder, you know, a lot of users say, why have you created this my news?  Well, we want this my news experience to be a really personalized version of dig.  And it's not just about big media.  It's about following taste makers.  It will be about defining, you know, that your interests and then eventually hopefully  creating a really cool customized news page that you'll want to consume daily.  So I'd love to be in there under apps.

Ben's good at this publicity ploy or did he really seriously?  Yeah, I don't know how much they would sell it for.  The Reddit guy responded, said, you can't.  I don't think it's for sale.

On Wednesday, Google announced that they were going to put free voice  calling in Gmail.  This is using a Google Google chat.  Google Talk.  You do have to download a plug in that gives you video and voice.  And all of a sudden, in your chat list is a phone call item  and you click it and you can dial any number in the US and Canada for free.  They say free at least through the end of the year.

Take that to Dvorak.  Yeah, he was like, oh, so in 2006, Peter Norvig,  I think his name is he's the director of research at Google. Yep.  In 2006, he said  Google is working.  And in fact, I have the whole system here.  PDF Google is working on a system that listens to what your TV is playing  in the background and then serves you relevant adverts.  That says literally he literally says these ideas will eventually show up  in real Google products sooner rather than later.  And so I'm wondering, is this one of those products where Google  because it's pretty seamless.  I don't remember installing anything.  And even if I have flash turned off, it still works.  And it doesn't ask me, you know, like if you go to porn sites  and you want to do your webcam, it says, are you sure you want to share your video?  I mean, I'm reliably informed about that.

I don't know if it's happening, but here's the director of research saying  it's going to show up in Google products.  And here we are. My microphone is now active.  So I'm curious.

Start time: 4980.18
End time: 5011.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, you know, I would credit that  because after all, again, Google told us this when they they put out,  remember that Google 411 and you would get it was free for one one service.  And they later told us, oh, you know what we did?  We we use the Google 411 to improve our voice recognition.  And one of the reasons Google's voice recognition in Android is so good  is because they learned a lot by getting a lot of voice samples from Google.  Four one one and corrections from Google four one one.  Now, that's not using what you're saying.

And this is from this is, yeah, I think 2006 when they posted this online.  It's it's pretty cool technology.  But the whole idea is to listen to what television show you're watching  and then serve up ads on your I guess,  if you're surfing or anywhere you are and in the future, maybe on Google TV.  All I know is the guy said it's going to show up in real Google products.  And here's one that might be applicable.  I have no idea what's what's happening under the hood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6200.64
End time: 6223.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we've got honestly, there's I would say out of the feedback  we've gotten, probably 75, 80 percent of it's really valid stuff that we're going to fix.  And then there's some stuff that, you know, certain spammers are trying to hit us with  and certain people that have an agenda that, you know, want certain features like.  It's funny, we had this we had this one time where we removed the bury feature from dig.  And that was a big controversy.

Start time: 6224.06
End time: 6234.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now, wasn't this, though, the issue was that right wing spammers  were burying all progressive or left wing articles and the other way around.  And then it's on both sides of that.

Start time: 6234.24
End time: 6242.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It became a war. It became a war.  And I hate this kind of stuff.  But, you know, we looked into it and the bulk of burying happening was around  political stories, of course.

Start time: 6242.40
End time: 6247.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's like the most partisan, divisive topics are the ones  they're going to get people doing.

Start time: 6247.20
End time: 6267.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's it's it's just a really nasty mess.  So we've got to figure out how to how we can potentially fix that problem  with algorithms, but it's going to take a while.  All I have to say is that honestly, we everyone at Dig knows the issues that we have.  Just, you know, it's going to take a couple of weeks to get everything ironed out  and get it stable, get these features out of back.  So just give us some time. We'll get there.

Start time: 6267.98

Start time: 6270.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, it's it's another at least a week of of stabilizing the site.  Why is that? Because, I mean, you're using the same server as the same.  We're not. Well, you're not.  So it's a brand new back end.  It's all Cassandra base now.  So we're out of my sequel.  That's a big deal.  And there's there's new bugs under certain levels of load that we didn't ever see before.  And so this is stuff.

Start time: 6292.24
End time: 6311.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I commend you this doing this kind of stuff sucks  when you've got users and particularly people who rely on this  and you and you try to progress things and change things.  It's hard. It's really, really hard.  I've been in that position on a smaller scale and it's it's tough.  It's no wonder you're drinking beer. That's right.

Start time: 6312.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he was drinking beer long before this.  Kevin, it's because you don't have enough women on your go and look at his.  Oh, we didn't get to talk about Mike Harrington and his his link bait post.  What exactly did Mike was trying to figure out what Mike was trying to say?  Basically, he was saying, it's not our fault.  We try. We really want to have women on.  But there just aren't any.  Is that or it's their fault?  He knew it was a hot button.  Oh, of course.

Start time: 6338.24
End time: 6376.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He loves putting his finger on things where he knows there's heat,  heat and fury.  And it's been a hot button for a long time.  The first programming conference I did in the 1990s,  basic visual, basic programmers inside insiders, technical summit  had four hundred twenty five men and two women show up. Right.  And this has been a undercurrent.  It comes up every year or two years when, hey, there's a show that's  has no women on it.  Somebody will write a blog post and say there's no women on Twitter.  Everybody will get there, you know, up in a bud, a bunch.  And we'll talk about it.  And that's sort of what what what happened this weekend.

Start time: 6376.64
End time: 6402.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's a very legitimate point to be made, which is it's it's  is if there are not many women, it's it's passing the buck to say  it's it's their fault or there aren't any women.  But I think that there's it's a two way street.  And I think that there is it is also very difficult for women  to make it in technology.  They are deprecated. They are put down.  It is not an easy thing.

Start time: 6402.52
End time: 6410.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Oh, you know what? He's not fighting.  He's not scared of me because he doesn't care about me,  but he's scared of the Twitter army and he knows that that would be a mistake.

People who post link bait articles  because it's all about getting hits, not about real content and real  and real discussions. This is a real subject.  This is not this is not a minor subject to cover.  And to use it for link bait is a big mistake.  Women in general, we talked about this on our agenda this morning.

Start time: 6535.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

This is look at how women are portrayed in the media.  This is why this happens.  And if you want to go left and you want to do something a little different,  that's where you it's it's more peer pressure than criminal minds.

Transcript:  That the main geek is a woman. Right.  You know, there's there's examples on both sides of that fence.  It's also hot. It is a deep problem.  I mean, and it goes back to college.  And in my first year of computer science classes,  there was about 40 percent women second year, 15 percent.  It starts there.  And that's that's why arguing it out about, you know,  getting more people on stage at conferences really isn't hitting the right problem.  The right problem happens earlier.

We have five panelists today that was so many that I couldn't invite anymore.  But I almost always invite some  at least one woman to be on. Look, there I would like to get more people of color.  I'd like to get more women.  I'd like to get more diversity in general.  I'm doing what I can.  Many of our hosts on Twitter are women.  And that's that's comes out of a commitment on very large percentage.  Yeah. And frankly, the people who run this company are women.  And I'm proud of that.  And and but that's because I'm trying to be gender blind and color blind  in what we do.  And you're right, there's there's no woman on this panel.  But believe me, before we top this top take the subject on again,  I will get some women on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's science and technology wide.  And it's a big it's a big waste.  If you ask me, it's a big waste of talent.  And I think that to do, you know, link bait around that is, of course,  on the other hand, look, he stimulated a great conversation.  So maybe it wasn't completely wasted.

Start time: 6696.91
End time: 6780.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think it's good that we talk, but we don't talk intelligently about this issue.  And I don't see that happening.  I mean, you know, on the on the other side, women are doing all these  women only conferences now blogger and other things.  Does that really help?  I mean, it's ghettoizing.  Yeah, because you here's an example of something that I saw in my career.  And I've seen it happen a few times in 2002.  I did a dinner and we made it open.  So there was no, you know, we said, if you want to come here, anybody's welcome to come.  And I think two women showed up, Ben and Mina Trot.  Mina Trot was one.  And I forget the other one.  But 40 other people showed up and they were all men.  And a lot of people in that room now are the people who run Twitter.  You know, Evan Williams was there.  Ben and Mina Trot, who run six apart, was there.  Dave Weiner was there.  Brad, Brad, who started Live Journal was there.  And if you aren't there while things are taking shape,  while there's some networking opportunities, you you're at a real disadvantage.  Yes, you're at a real disadvantage.  And those are the people who decide, you know, conferences and books and  all sorts of things, you know, real powerful people now.  And it's a tough problem that starts early in somebody's career.  And I don't know how to switch it.
