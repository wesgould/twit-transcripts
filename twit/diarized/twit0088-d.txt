Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anybody tried Yahoo pipes yet I was playing around with it this afternoon I can't make heads or  tails or how to make it work yet but the stuff that people have already built kind of cool at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  least you can get somebody explain what it is please oh it's a long it's kind of a hard  explanation basically you're gonna hate this John you know UNIX pipes well it's like that only for  the web well what's the point Merlin can you explain better than that yeah I mean I play with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it just a little bit it's a way it's a I mean you couldn't on one level I guess call it a mashup  tool the idea is that you can take different kinds of like RSS feeds from different places and apply  little bits of logic to it to kind of mash it up in different forms and that's a very short  explanation of it is it a scripting language no it's no it's a good the neat part is it's a  drag-and-drop gooey and so you can basically say you know I want to take this feed in that feed and  I want it for example actually boing-boing was saying well you know if you don't like posts by  a certain you know author you can say just remove those so you apply a little logic to  mashing up feeds and then kind of make make new stuff out of it so what have you tried that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like I mean because they have a lot of people who made pipes yeah well most of my time was spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  connecting the little pipes themselves because the visual interface is really cool but I didn't have  enough time to learn it to make anything real I looked at the New York Times flicker mashup which  searches the New York Times feed it takes the New York Times feed and searches for keywords there  does an analysis of some sort and then comes up with flicker images related to the stories that  are on the front page of the New York Times so it's that's that's an example it's a mashup of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  flicker in the New York Times but it's but you don't need to use Ruby on rails anymore you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  draw and and it does it yeah used to be you'd have to cobble together crazy pearl libraries  and screen scraping and so for example if you wanted to make one all-encompassing page that  pulled in all the Leo feeds in one place that's something you could whip together pretty or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody else could the thing that's I think that the reason it's a hot news story I mean it is a  cool technology but it also is the first time in quite a while that Yahoo has been first at  anything I mean this is completely unique Google probably saying don't we should they should have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thought of that it's pretty impressive it's also not something that they've had to buy in right all  the cool stuff Yahoo's done recently has been bought in and this seems to be straight from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  labs in some ways it establishes it puts Yahoo back on the map as a innovator don't you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  does really it came out of nowhere I don't think anybody was expecting it by it from somebody do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we know well we don't know but it doesn't look like they did you know I just did a search on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the thing for IP TV God nothing you have to create but see you could create an IP TV pipe  yeah maybe I will I know you know it's not so much I think it's cool but it's not so much what you  could do with it it's just that this is this is I think from I think there's I think there's a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  need for this stuff I mean there's been sites out there on the list for my own usage is how I see  myself using it there's been stuff out there before like super glue which I'm not sure even  exists anymore which is a site where you could point it at a bunch of feeds and then it would  make one kind of page that would assemble all that and I think for somewhere between like the  complete you know geeks and you know the standard users just for a power user this is kind of thing  where you could make some really interesting stuff look at you I need can you put it on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  page when you're done or do you have to go to the yagoo give somebody's pipe somebody a pipe oh it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  does come from Yahoo that doesn't it but I think you can subscribe to it so it is an RSS feed yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so you can get an RSS feed out of the whole thing yeah so no wait a minute let me get this straight  I can create a bunch of pie I can do a I am you know as much as I hate the term mashup but I can  take a bunch of these things and make some sort of a mess let's put it that way and then I can  make that into an RSS feed and then I can subscribe to that RSS and I can put that RSS feed on my blog  over on the right hand side where I can put RSS feeds I can yeah Jason Calacanis is gonna hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this he you know we just ran twill with this week in law and he was railing against the idea of  other people taking this was when he was still at AOL but taking the the feeds and and making  their own feeds out of them but this is exactly what it is yeah it might undermine the I don't  know the ability to monetize something but the whole idea of RSS is I mean you get the RSS you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  getting links back to wherever it is I mean it's the same link what this doesn't make how it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  retrieved right it's very cool interface you got to play with the interface I'm gonna I'm playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with it now yeah it's really I think yeah I think one of the coolest things about it too is that  people will be able to take advantage of it without having to build a pipe right there'll be a lot of  pre-made pipes that you can configure but if you want to you can go in and modify it yourself and  and play with it so you know there's the idea of creating your own newspaper you know that's always  been out there where you pull in the best articles from the different sources is sort of a step

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  closer to reality but if you don't want stories about you know what's her name you just a Nicole  Smith yeah you know I have to we're on a wavelength will you could eliminate all the stories about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anna Nicole Smith yes you know well I'm putting these well I'm putting these pipes together are  these turtles coming after me is that gonna happen turtles do you see turtles never mind  you just gotta think of the Mario and the pipes oh I don't we just gonna make sure your pipes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  don't get clogged right way that's the tubes so you know this actually does prove that Ted  Stevens was right Ted's a visionary he was close maybe he knew Yahoo was up to this series of pipes  he was close I think this is a I think this is a very interesting thing that Yahoo's done and you  know I subscribed to a service it was called dig dot and then Kevin sued him and now it's dog dot  but it that aggregated dig and slash dot and delicious and this would be easy trivial to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something like that now a lot of people are doing this right now I do this right now inside my

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sorry give us that what was that again you got to do yeah no doge it's actually still dig dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got us I think let me see I'll have to have to check it because I have haven't been there in a  while I just see that's the it's an interesting thing I don't go to their site dog dot dot us  yeah I think dig dot still works but Kevin got mad at him and not Kevin personally the team of  lawyers that he has hired so they had to change that as in many places that had the word dig in  there title so I guess they're really the big story besides the Anna Nicole Smith story is Steve  Jobs really kind of surprising everybody by putting a essay right there on apple.com saying  hey a challenge to the record industry you don't have to put copy protection in you don't put it  on CDs why are you putting it on digital music Apple doesn't want you to do it stop yeah he does

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it himself though what's the way we get he said now see I think this is this is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because people I think have a long time I am one of them have assumed that the reason Apple loves  DRM is it forces people to use the iPod when they buy songs from the iTunes music store it you know  it's a it's it preserves their monopoly he says no we do it because it's in our contracts with  the record companies from day one they insisted on it well well there's a discrepant piece of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  information here I mean maybe I that's what I thought too but I was on the fact I was scheduled  to do a CNBC thing but I got it just didn't work out because we lost our line but though but I  listened in on that what's her Roy's in the one that used to be the head of the RIA a oh no not  Heidi the other Hillary Rosen Hillary Rosen Hillary Rosen Hillary Rosen and she said that's not  true that's you know she said that Steve should get off the pot if he wants to cut it loose that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what she said well he could for indie labels I mean there are plenty of indie labels who would  like to sell on DRM music on iTunes but they're told they can't but they have to have it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you have it Larry Lessig made that point right away he said okay Steve put up or shut up let's  see you on DRM those artists that don't want it okay what about what about the stuff that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple puts up I mean stuff like his keynote address does that have those aren't copy protected

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  now that's just a pure straight and he has not I might point out at any time suggested that they  take the DRM out of the TV shows in the movies they sell no but I think you know what this is  obviously a response to Norway and France saying you know you've got to open up the iPod he says  we can't open it up because the record companies won't let us open it up from day one not only  did they insist on copy protection they insisted on a system that if it were cracked which it has  been several times could be fixed within weeks he says copy this actually I thought this is great  he says DRM doesn't work he says the record companies already release their music without  DRM in fact most music is sold that way let us you know let your music free I mean does anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  else think this is just like a negotiating tactic like we all know that the record labels you know  they're pushing for more and more and more they've got the you know Universal's got its  zoom deal to get its cut or whatever and we I think there's a quote wasn't there that the  Universal guy was saying well now maybe we get this with Apple and the iPod and I think this is  just Steve sort of like pushing back in the other direction and saying okay so you want a cut of  iPod sales and we want you to you know release all your music with no DRM maybe the final position  is we just carry on as we are which suits Apple quite fine thank you very much well I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the record companies have to sick cave to Steve I think that Steve makes the point I think a lot  of others observed it wouldn't hurt would it hurt Apple to get rid of the copy protection they  already have a monopoly it's not going to they don't need it anymore and it certainly would make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  consumers happier and wouldn't you buy more music I think they'd sell a lot more music it may hurt  them on the device side maybe there's an argument to be made that that people wouldn't buy an iPod  if they didn't have to to shop at the iTunes music store but I think a lot more people would also shop  at the iTunes music store because I don't I never probably increase iPod sales for all we know you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think yeah they're dominant because it's the best player not because you have to have it to shop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what it amounts to now is it's it makes him look like he does it's classic Steve in the sense that  he comes out there and he he regrabs control of the conversation it was everybody else on the  defensive it's a jujitsu now he's the good guy that's right now he's the he's the good guy looking  out for the consumers and he's gonna leave it to everybody else to just go fight it out the bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  companies I don't mean to jump ahead in the conversation too far but do you think he knew  about EMI's announcement when he put his posting up according to the Chicago it's not even an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  announcement it's a leak according to the Chicago Sun-Times EMI has been pitching the possibility  of selling its entire music collection to the public in mp3 unprotected according to the article  several other major music companies have considered the same route but none have gone as far as EMI  has now first of all doesn't say what bitrate mp3 the record companies have historically you  know done things like 96 kilobit mp3 and if you want the good version you're gonna have to have  DRM they own they they're the third largest music company they have the Beatles lots of  artists Nora Jones it would be you know that's the issue is this that well they have quite a few  they have the Beastie Boys I know I know Jay Giles band yeah he's really it's a bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  dinosaurs you're mentioning my love blood rain kids are going to the indie stuff come on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  memories have just been sold da da da anyway I think that I think that frankly this is the  beginning of the crack in the DRM iceberg and it's almost it's gonna it's gonna melt faster than

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the sheets of ice in Greenland well he's done a lot to you know raise awareness of DRM amongst  the general public isn't he with this because it's been all over the mainstream media and how many

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DRM stories do you see in the mainstream media well yeah exactly and I'll tell you I was at the  front page of every newspaper I got called by radio stations I mean this brought the issue very

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  much to the foreground okay so what do we conclude here since we're languishing are we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  languishing that's what I are we concluding what are we gonna I would hope well okay here's my  questions for you would removing DRM hurt Apple in any way yeah would it be would it be good for  music sales yes yes here's the tough one and now Steve asserts it wouldn't hurt the record  companies either because it doesn't work would it hurt the record companies to remove copy  protection no nobody believe it would besides the record companies no it wouldn't why would it why  would it there already if you want if you don't want seat copy protection you just buy a CD and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how on earth can it increase piracy piracy is already a vast majority surely it can only go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  down I totally agree with that I mean right now they're competing with free pirated music by  putting out broken music so how would changing it to unbroken music that is easily available to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everyone hurt them Cory does has been saying for miles ago up copy protection is about to fail to  be phased out we saw it once before remember there was in the early days of computing software a lot  of stuff was copy yeah almost everything and they they realized it's not doing any good and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just pissing off our customers it was really I mean increasingly it's just something that's just  a hindrance you know for the honest consumer who's actually spending the money so Steve's gonna come

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out of this smelling like a rose he's gonna be the guy who pushed you know who blew the trumpet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we've been pushing longer than he has nothing interesting though is it's good I think it's  gonna continue to increase the rift we start to see between the future for artists and the future  for labels because the people who are gonna be hurt potentially I mean I'm not saying they will  be but if anybody could be hurt I think it's gonna be the labels with that I think it's gonna be  great for artists if they do it just because there's gonna be so much easier a lot of our  are worried about this a lot of art yeah you know there's let there's layers of artists I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mean there's high-end artists that make up you know Millie doesn't like this there's a certain  layer of artists that that think that they're just being ripped they just really see themselves as  the city there's two kinds one of them is there's a big group like Metallica they see themselves as  the center of the universe and then people stealing their music and then there's the small  artists that sell the very you know they don't really have a lot of sales and then they see that  everybody who takes a song is take is literally taking money from in their pockets because they  really don't they're not doing a big business and those are the artists that complain the most well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I haven't the studies shown that the people who benefit from free mp3s the most are the smaller  artists it's if anybody stands to lose from from piracy it's the larger artists who really do sell  a lot but the small artists actually benefit because it gets their name out there and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  benefit from people becoming aware of them there's also services now that you can hire that will go  out there and basically scrape the p2p networks to give you the equivalent of a billboard chart  and you know if you don't think for a minute that the labels are not out there hiring people to go  and watch that stuff and if you go out and do a p2p search you know you're gonna find sure you're  gonna find some indie artists but by and large you're gonna find the big fat part of that curve  is gonna be the Britney Spears is of the world that are out there so like you know like I think  was will said the toothpaste is out of the tube at this point that's been a bad week for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  recording industry the RIAA got slapped by a judge who is going to award attorney fees to one  of the plaintiffs in a RIAA versus thief lawsuit yeah yeah thief aka grandma grandma Debbie Foster  an Oklahoma woman who said I don't know what this is all about why are you bothering me now it turns  out her daughter probably was up was up to no good and and that's what the record companies say  however when they found that out they didn't drop ms. Lee from the loss or miss foster from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the lawsuit they they kept her in judge too much too much effort to like make those changes judge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lee R West dismissed the original lawsuit and the counterclaim ruled that foster was the prevailing  party and said and you get attorneys fees so the RIAA this is they call this drift net lawsuits  because they just try to pull in everybody and they don't care who gets bit by it all right  says we respectfully believe the court got it wrong they can respectfully jump off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  marriage with the judicial system today people like that that abused the system it is inexcusable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so really the question and I think it might is is is this kind of cast some Paul on the  RIAA's techniques $50,000 in attorney's fees is in a big deal for the RIAA dropping a bucket

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for them they'll keep doing it right yeah but times that by the thousands of people that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing and it's not to get not insignificant the daughter settled what's the mom who fought on  the daughter said she well she got a default judgment let's put it that way she didn't she

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  didn't contest it I think you know I think they'll keep going with this because they figure most of  the people thereafter are guilty of something in the eyes of the law and so they'll prevail most  of the time and every once in a while they might have to drop 50k but it won't happen often enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to deter them well and it's really not the the point of it isn't the people they they pull in  in these drift nets it's to it's to send a strong message to the rest of the world hey you know you  could get in trouble for this and don't do it and I think it's you know it's the carrot and the stick  it's a reasonable stick don't you think it's they claim it's been working I don't see any evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of that well but the same side they claim that piracy is on the rise and that's why they need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to keep DRM it's working but not working too well not that well so I love this one Kodak says that  if you know I've never really done this calculation but they estimate that the cost of ink for inkjet  printers when you buy the cartridge is around four or five thousand dollars a gallon Wow that's more  expensive than Starbucks and so they're gonna charge 90 and their new printers you have to use  a Kodak printer 999 for black 1499 for color it's one way to get attention and get people to buy  your printers I don't know if they're any good printers but wow seems high five thousand a gallon  well there's not a lot of ink in those inkjet cartridges when you put it that way it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  seem like a ripoff doesn't it and especially because they lost some of them all the sort of  fancy ones that have chips in to tell you how full they are or they all tell you that they're  empty and tell you that you can't use it with there's still stuff left in there right is anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  else here buying those totally cheap off-brand hell yes I mean it's that the difference in price  is unbelievable and I don't see a bit of difference there are only two thousand I buy the off-brand

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for some printers and other printers I don't it depends on the printer what I use it for mm-hmm  yeah I was trying to get the off-brand if I can absolutely because you got how many you have to  find a good off-brand there are I mean I got it I don't know maybe it was BS but I had a lecture  at one of these Macintosh shows from one of these guys who sells off-brands and he says there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of this stuff is crap well some of the major stuff is crap I mean I don't know how many of the real  thing I've used that break or say they're empty when they're half full I mean it's kind of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  crapshoot anyway I always buy the house the label yeah but you know you got you got the money we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have to I just feel like it's just you know I don't want to deal a house and then there's of course  the the people who use the hypodermic needles to inject new ink oh man what a mess yeah that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bad goes in the life's too short column is that guy well John I think you had something in your  DRM column about how your time is worth more than it takes to go out and find DRM music it's  definitely your time is worth more than spending you know time injecting and then getting it didn't  have to clean it up ruin a good pair of pants that way it's so funny though that the the Polaroid

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  model kind of works for some kinds of things like I'm pretty addicted to a certain Gillette razor  that I wish I wasn't paying so much for but I feel like I get a lot more out of it paying 15 bucks  or 20 bucks for an ink inkjet replacement I don't get a lot of joy out of that I'm not getting value

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out of that you know I was watching the the Saturday they finally released the first year  of Saturday Night Live as a DVD it's very educational but one of the things they do in one  of the first few episodes is they mock the Gillette mock to razor the two blade razor  they with a three blade razor now this is 1974 and they just in it they get a lot of comedy value  out of the fact that no idiot would buy a three blade razor well of course we're now what is it

Transcript:  now stop that for a second so what happens whoops you got me on a loop go ahead yeah so what happens  the next day they do us they do a bit this is what's going on a lot of people seem to have missed  this because I talked to people Wagner Etzer and nobody saw this but was hilarious at the end of  the show they said yeah yesterday Bill walked off the stage and you missed the end of it and so then  they have a phony bill walking down the hallway pushing people over throwing stuff in the guy's  face and calling another guy a weasel and pushing him down let's see that also Bill can rush over  to the to the microwave and get his popcorn that is the cleaner version that we did for television

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here is what actually happened in the studio thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it Bill Gates has encountered a problem that needs to leave we're sorry for the inconvenience  that was the error message they did I guess this clip this is YouTube of course doesn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  rest of it but yeah the rest of it is actually pretty funny and it's always from the behind Bill  and actually the guy who acted the actor was resembled him enough to make the thing kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hilarious let me oh I see it's in the credits here let me play it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  seconds to go I gotta get there second to go it's almost time get the hell out of my way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  activate successful door here upgrade your shirt I got a joke for you I can smell it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  popcorn you won't laugh at me that is very funny I have to say so Leo are you playing that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube because isn't all the Viacom stuff supposed to be gone from YouTube well I get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it before it's gone now there's a story we need to discuss is Viacom that stupid that they pull  all the stuff off of YouTube when it's nothing more than free publicity I mean look what we just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  did and I'm not gonna what am I gonna go to the Viacom site and find it no I'm gonna go to YouTube  and search for Bill Gates daily show and there it is well that's what they're wanting people to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they want them to go to Comedy Central calm and get the video there and they're making it shareable  so you can cut and paste and put it on myspace so they figure they'll still get the free publicity

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but they'll be in control of it but you want a centralized place that's the whole point well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the problem of course Tom is in that situation is that yeah that's true and it might be a good  thing if you're very myopic but the fact of the matter is when you're on YouTube people might  stumble upon this when they're just doing a Bill Gates search for something else they're not gonna  do that at the other side because they're not gonna be at that other side I mean when you have  that many people that are cramped into one room which we'll call YouTube I mean you want to exploit  that if you can because there's it's like it's like and what do they lose and what do they like foot  traffic at a mall I mean you want to be where there's the most foot traffic what are these  people thinking do they even know what marketing is I agree and then what have they what have they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lost the banner ads on their on their Comedy Central page the chance that somebody might  they're all house ads pre-roll pre-roll video ads that's what they can put it in that so what they  Right and and say here you go YouTube here's our clips with our pre-roll. Yeah I think it's myopic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I guess they're thinking they'll get as much out of myspace out of YouTube but there's still  different audiences and they're just cutting one out. Yeah no it's just a blunder. They're cutting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me out because I'm too lazy to actually search for this stuff although now with Google you could  pretty much find anything you've heard about Google right? No. No what about Google? Video games!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just a joke. Wait is that a search engine? Yes exactly. Video games are good for your eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will Harris. US researchers have found that playing first-person shooters far from making  you blind will actually improve your vision. They studied people who played action games for a few  hours a day over the course of a month 20% improvement in their visual acuity. Oh I'm not buying this.  My glasses say otherwise. That's not from video games that's from something else. According to  a professor of brain look at this Daphne Baveille is a professor of brain and cognitive sciences  John. She's a professor. Daphne? Daphne she's a professor and she says action video games  games play act well she says it better than this but she's easy for you to say action video gameplay  oh there's a problem changes the way our brains process visual information these games push the  human visual system to the limits and the brain adapts to it the learning carries over to other  activities and possibly everyday life as long as you don't cross the streets in New York City. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Viva Piñata won't help but Beers of War is great for your vision. Beers of War is good for you but not Viva Piñata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still playing Half-Life 2. Is Viva Piñata that good? Everybody seems to love it I don't get it. What is Viva Piñata?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a piñata game. Oh it's like whack-a-mole. It's like Pokemon on steroids. Yeah or animal crossing. It's like an uber-uber Pokemon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So would a grown-up enjoy this game? It's alright yeah. My girlfriend loves it. Yeah mine too.  Does she beat on you with a stick?  Trying to get some comment there I guess. Okay from the Daily Mail that's from your country.  Did you see this picture of the woman from Toshiba? No self-respecting person in this country reads

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the Daily Mail. You know that's what I do every time we blog something on the dvork.org slash blog blog  that's so you can have another drink. I get more hateful email in the comments from people from  Britain saying nobody reads the Daily Mail. How do these people stay in business if nobody reads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the Daily Mail? Somebody reads it. Well okay put it put it another way. Nobody in the demographic  that's reading dvork.org slash blog is reading the Daily Mail. Oh my god Anna Nicole Smith died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh wow. I saw it on the Daily Mail. The thing is though okay so so okay this looks fake it's  probably fake but so this person has this thing on their head so why are they in front of a big  screen if they've got a wraparound tv screen inside their little toilet bowl headgear. Are  you guys on the Daily Mail side deal? Yes. Well can you describe it Leo? It looks it kind of looks  like a big black robot toilet with a big bubble on it. They say it weighs three kilograms which

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is a DailyMail.UK or what? There's a link in our delicious tags John. I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go back. One giant step for home entertainment is the title of the story. Yeah okay. Is this the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we'll be enjoying our television programs and computer games in the future? And there's  astonishing photo a model is wearing a new gadget. You're Dickensian. We'll apparently be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  enjoying them in Australia. My god. You know the beautiful part is though it only works on games.  I'm vlogging that immediately. It only works on one player games because you'll never find a second  person. You're gonna die alone with that thing on your head. Yeah from a broken neck. Help I'm stuck

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in the toilet. And you know people are listening to the show wondering what the heck. Well it sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of looks like a CRT monitor like a huge 30-inch CRT monitor with a security camera front. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If people have ever seen the protesters in the 70s where they had this giant tv set on their head

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is kind of what we're talking about. But why is she got if she sat inside this massive  immersive display why is there a tv in front of her? Why is there a screen in front of her? She appears to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  trying to look at the control through the toilet seat cover and she's manipulating the trigger  while she not watches what appears to be a desktop pattern of some kind. It looks like clouds. She's  like and there's a camera and there's a camera on her screen capturing that. You know what's odd is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there are only you're right nobody reads the Daily Mail. There are only seven comments on this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think. First post. Really one of us first post. And it was posted on October 16th. So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody does read the Daily Mail. Proof positive. No I guess they don't. Well that's where you get some

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  exclusive stuff. We need to get Alex Lindsay to get one of these. I want to see Alex. If you look at the  seven comments four of them have been taken off. There's only three on there. So it's just that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're right. You're right. The Daily Mail. Why isn't she listing the one side or another? I don't know how she keeps her head up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should have a contest. How many things are horribly horribly wrong with this photo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's done. I'm putting it on the blog now. What's wrong with this picture? You think it's photoshopped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And worst of all it's not even plugged in. So hackers attempted to bring down the internet. Did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  notice that? No. No me neither. By the way about that story Leo which is what we're talking about  for people out there who want to know is that DNS system has been under attack or was attacked  recently but according to Mark Perkel over at Seat Computer Time who's my ISP he says that this has  been continuing. This is not hasn't stopped yet and they don't and the big boys don't know quite  what to do about it. They've got it under control but you're going to get a lot of outages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually Steve Gibson has said this for some time that this is the weak link on the internet. There  are only 13 root servers. If you could attack all 13 now remember that these the DNS is cached but  it's only cached for 24 hours or so. So if you could attack all 13 bring them down for 24 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the internet would stop working. According to Mark. I have to go out and buy some really cool IP addresses. According to Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  all these attacks are coming from China, North Korea and some other Asian. Well I don't know how

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you can tell though because that's just where the zombies live. You don't know who's. Well  that's what he says. It could be coming from the White House. We don't know. We don't know where  the zombies. That's just the zombies. That's the problem with these attacks. The real problem is as  we mentioned a few weeks ago as Vince Cerf said he estimated 150 million computers. One quarter of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  computers are owned by hackers or are zombyfied. Right and we all believe that number is low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if that's the case it wouldn't take much and this is a real weak link. Now I understand they  are going to try to upgrade these but there is no solution because these are legitimate  requests. You can't refuse them or the thing won't work. I don't see why they somehow they can't track  these guys down and put them in jail. That's just kind of the nature I think of the internet. This

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is kind of. I wonder if there's a way that the ISPs could monitor traffic outbound from their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they can. In fact that's the way to stop this. It uses raw sockets so it's spoofing the IP  address. So all an ISP has to do is say hey that's not my IP address. Stop it. And by the way ISPs  could stop spam too but the cost to business is so great that they don't do either. I don't know why  maybe they ought to. How much does it cost? Well I don't think it would cost much to say if the  traffic doesn't come from my internet, my pool of IP addresses, I'm not going to pass it along.  Maybe that's why. That's probably why it's coming from China and South Korea. These are probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not well monitored. Couldn't you just force everybody to use authenticated SMTP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well for spam you could but that's another issue. That's a whole other problem.  But you're right. I think every expert I've heard from says that if the internet service  providers wanted to stop these kinds of attacks or spam they could. We don't know. I don't know.  I'm not expert enough to know that. If Veronica were here we could ask her. They're too busy raking  in the money. So what is it? Do you know anything about this quantum computing John? This D-Wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh you know this has come and gone a number of times in the media. I mean Markov  covers it every so often. It seems bogus to me. Well there's something legitimate about it but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have no idea what. In February, oh that's now. Coming up February 13th in Mountain View,  sorry the registration is closed and the 15th in Vancouver registration is closed. So maybe,  I don't know Tom can you get down there and cover this? They're going to demonstrate  these quantum computing systems. 16 bit, 16 qubit I'm sorry and that's one of the things that's  different about quantum computing. They don't use it. What's a qubit? A quantum qubit. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the way that the quantum processor stores its information. It's in a superposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It means that they're going to show off this demo that they'll show off. We'll do two to the 16th  calculations simultaneously. So 64,000 calculations a cycle and I don't know how fast these computers  are but that's a lot. You know that's a lot. That's going to be a heck of a zombie. Well you know the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  one that's the hot, the real hot story this week is the, well whoops but never mind. Oh wait a  minute we can do, when is this running by the way because I have on Sunday. Can you tell, I can,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't talk about till Monday. Monday what time, midnight? Midnight yeah. All right this will

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  release at 1201 Monday morning. Intel's rolling out a demo of for their, you know this week is  the week that the Silicon Computer Conference, you know the big chip conference in San Francisco  takes place, the IASCC whatever, where everybody gets to show off their hot, you know hot hottest  things they've developed and Intel's got a demonstration chip that they've developed which  is a teraflop. Whoa. And it's, and they have a whole bunch of new technologies that are involved  with this thing that include you know 80 cores and a networking subsystem that lists the cores  talk to each other. It's quite interesting but anyway it comes out, it goes public on Sunday night  at midnight. And so it's okay for us to talk about it now. Yeah as long as you don't run the  story until Sunday night at midnight. 1201. And you know 1201 or whatever and yeah and it's pretty,  they had a press conference today about it and it's, there's a lot of new technologies that  they're trying to get to because what they determined, at least what they show on their  slides, is that once you get this normally get to 16 cores you have diminishing returns with any more  cores than that. If you get to 32 you actually the performance goes down and then because there's  so much overhead for these things to talk to each other. So they, so Intel's come up with basically  essentially a router that lets these things talk to each other along with some other software  and they can now stack the things. So you have memory stacked on top of memory stacked on top  of processors in these in a very small package with almost no wattage. It's astonishingly low powered.  It's a very interesting breakthrough and I think that's going to be the news next week  from that chip show because Intel's gotten really into a massive publicity mode. John I think this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is a red letter day, the first time you've ever revealed something in twit, a scoop if you  will. So thank you. I appreciate that. They'll be on the blog too at the same time. Teraflops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's amazing. Yeah it's a teraflop. They figured they got it. By the way it's a teraflop for 65 watts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa now see that's significant. That's huge. Now I'm interested because before I didn't want to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to plug that in. Well apparently it's basically you know they say they had it they did a teraflot  machine once before in the like 95 or something like that and it was 500 kilowatts and it was a  whole like a half a football field full of machines and that was big parallel system and there's a  picture of it's called code red or something. I can't quite remember the name of it but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh that's kind of what this is is kind of cluster giant cluster computing on a chip. Yeah except

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there's a thumbnail size chip you know as opposed to a room full of machines and that was only in 95  or so so it's not even that far off. Ray Kurzweil was right. About 10 years from now you're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be able to get a machine that's smarter than you are for a thousand dollars. Well it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it is pretty exciting to see this quantum computer demonstrated. I don't think I've seen anything with  even pretending to be commercial applications before that was having quantum computing. Tom go  down you've got to cover it. Well there's there's been a lot of demonstrations of the ability to  store data and run it in a lab situation but I almost hesitate to believe these guys. I'm  interested to see what their their demonstration ends up being because if you could actually run  some applications and they only claim to have two that they can run it's just a big step. Doesn't  mean they're going to go to market anytime soon with anything. But this is a company it's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  re this is not a university research project. D-Wave is a company presumably wanting to make  money on this thing. They're in British Columbia they're in the Burnby Burnaby.  So interesting. I you know I'm very very interested to see what happens.  One more one more story I don't know whether to applaud the EFF or laugh at them. They're  apparently suing the Department of Defense demanding information on how the army monitors  soldier blogs. For some reason they think soldiers rights to free speech are being infringed.  And don't you think the military should be monitoring blogs from active duty servicemen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well from what I understand of this what they're suing for is for the military to release  the guidelines under which they remove information. They don't actually want them to stop  necessarily. They just want the public to know what kinds of things the military are removing.  So are they removing legitimate security violations confidential information or are they just censoring  saying we don't like those opinions and we don't want people to say it. I don't know I mean I you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know it's from day you know World War II remember they draw you don't remember but I remember. Oh I  remember. They draw black lines. You remember you weren't even alive in World War II. I've seen all those movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember John Wayne storming Normandy. They draw the lines through them. You were saying the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all that stuff Lincoln did during the Civil War. You're a good deal younger. Merlin you're just stirring up stuff by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sending out these FARC pictures in the middle of the night. I just want to say nobody is now thinking about the  mill blogs. They're looking at me. What is this? Well I like the Easter Island one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo you're famous. I'm blogging that one. It's the latest the latest Photoshop contest on FARC is Photoshopped Leo in the port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a picture of Leo apparently. Leo on the set of call for help. He's on the set of call for help looking at his Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ironically it is funny. I am in fact. Which is your favorite? I like the one where I was saying  dear penthouse I never thought this would happen to me. This girl I anyway. The best one actually is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Easter Island one in terms of award-winning. Where's the Easter Island one? It's way down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the idea of you in a pool full of swimming pools full of frolicking people and you're there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the edge playing with your Blackberry. Exactly. With a shirt on. With a shirt on.  George Jetson. It looks like a is that a what kind of marsupial is eating my head there? I don't know.  I think that's stretching the contest a little far right. Well the Leo there instead of us dwelling on  this we should put a link on the website. We will. You'll be able to you'll be able to see it all. I'm  still looking for oh the Easter Island that's good I like it. My head on a statue.  Anyway sorry but I but I was a little distracted by Merlin's shenanigans. That was Will sir.  That was not me. Oh Will did that? Oh yeah thank you. I take no responsibility. See Will's the kid in the class who looks good you know he's got that British accent he looks like he's paying attention.  He's in fact getting Merlin in trouble and Merlin's the kid in class who's like making the jokes and  the teacher gets mad at you right? Dude that is totally my MO. I know it is I can tell.  I can tell and Merlin that's you isn't it that's your life story right there. It is it is you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  English people love spanking that's what it comes down to. This is really well documented. It's known

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a known fact. The whole culture is actually built around that. Many people don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gmail is now a public it's now no longer in beta. I think it's still in beta. Oh it's still in beta but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just now you don't have to be invited. You can get your own damn invitation. I guess they got enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  server capacity now so they can do it. It's a yeah right they never had enough before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But actually that's an interesting thing that happened with Yahoo pipes the first couple of  days you couldn't get on it was so popular. They underestimated the popularity of pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's funny to talk to guys at these companies because they'll tell you that there's  pretty much no way you can really prepare for what's going to happen. My gosh you think Yahoo  once you put it out. There's all kinds of things that just and when you're doing software there's  no way to know what's really going to happen until you throw some users at it and I know  that happens apparently happens a lot at Google with people just being terrified that their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  product will ever appear on the home page. Think secret says look for Leopard, iLife07 and iWork07  by March. This really is more for Mac Break Weekly but I'm sure to stories.  What Leopard by March? Yeah I don't think that's right. Wow. It's ambitious.  From what I've seen of Leopard it's going to be June at the earliest but maybe who knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo I put some some stuff in the for twit basket. Let me check the for twit basket see what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  see what our troublemaker has come up with. If there's Fark links in here you're in deep  trouble. You know we used to have Drew from Fark on the screensavers all the time. Oh yeah.  That site is now huge. Yeah he was just starting out back then. Yeah I think we put him on the map.  Maybe not I don't know. All right what you pick one that you I'm looking at them Will but what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wouldn't you like? Well I quite like from a sort of slightly more geek out perspective the  Nvidia Vista driver stuff because that's affecting a lot of people who have spent real money right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there are not good drivers for Nvidia cards. Oh it's so much worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only are there not good drivers but they're focusing on getting the drivers out for the stuff  for the really high end stuff for the games that aren't even coming out till like March or April.  So if you bought a high end Nvidia product like three or four months ago maybe four months ago  you're not going to get an SLI driver or even a proper driver for gaming in vista until like  April May at the earliest. Oh. And I mean if you've just spent 400, 300 quid you know hundreds of  dollars on one of these cards you've got to be pretty sick right now. And it's not like... Does it work in Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just doesn't work well in Vista. Does it still work? Well it works if you wanted to work like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100 dollar graphics card rather than a 400 dollar graphics card. I've got a laptop that's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that because it doesn't have a proper driver in Vista so when it runs it runs like you know  generic graphics card which means media center doesn't work.  Yeah. Videos don't stream like right I can't output it to an HDTV anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem is that... Is it the DRM? Is that what's causing these issues?  No it's with the Nvidia ones it's their previous top end card was like a match of two cards on one  board which used SLI. It was like SLI on a single card but they haven't managed to get SLI working  properly in Vista so that high end card basically doesn't work. Well this is going to happen with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a new operating system right? Sure that's why you shouldn't get it. You should hold off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like Vista a lot better than XP. You can't even get these hybrid hard disks for another six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now see I'm trying to remember back to XP and back farther and this is pretty normal right? It

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  takes a little while for everything to catch up. You always jump on board before what else anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing works. Yeah just wait for XP. It looks like the speech recognition is working in Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually that works pretty nicely. Did you see the flaw? What's that? Have you seen the flaw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the flaw? What happens? You can send somebody an audio file. Oh yeah yeah yeah. What  happened? Apparently didn't confirm. Well yeah actually you probably know more about it than I  do but just reading a couple stories here that apparently you can send an audio file that will  allow you to execute commands over a speech recognition. Oh great! If somebody has their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  speech recognition on and the mic is active and near the speakers, you can totally take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can take over the machine. There's a fix Leo. You turn off your speakers. Turn off your speakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or turn off your mic. Closed. Bug closed. Speakers closed. That bug has been closed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're in an office for me, could you yell real loud erase C star dot you know or  somebody was suggesting going to the white phone in the airport

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and paging reset. Reset. Reset. Will reset. Paging RM star RM star. RM star. That's funny. But what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  command really could you issue? You know open browser go to dvorak.org slash blog. Well that's  not a bad idea. You may take a format C code on backstache. Exactly. But then it gives you all these  could you just now that's a question. Does the voice recognition allow you to say yes okay okay.  Oh yeah yeah yeah. So you'd have to say a few okays. And the irony is it has apparently gotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a lot better right? Right it works. Oh man they can't buy a break. Is any of the group here

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actually using that or are you just the speech recognition? I played around with it. If I had RSI

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know I had bad wrists I could probably get by with it. It wasn't perfect but you could actually  it could actually recognize you and if you had a good mic and a set of headphones for security  reasons then you know you could probably make do with it because it did work. I did a video on it  and and I was able to make it open the calculator close the calculator write some stuff that I said  down you know. So you could do dictation with it. Oh yeah. Who was it that was in our on our web

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  team who had RSI would use the dragon to dictate? Lewis Wallace. He was the home page editor. Yeah  and there was a woman I can't remember her name darn it and I'm embarrassed. You know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing you know these things are sketchy because I for example have had nothing but trouble and  I've looked at these things since the earliest ones because you know if your voice isn't it  if you don't have the right tones in your voice and I have like a voice that lacks a lot of lower  mid-range and I mean I have to tell you that John. I have notes below it and above it but there's  a huge missing area and these things are looking for mostly like kind of screechy mid-range type

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  voices. Try out this to speech recognition. I'd be interested to see if you have the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well there's also the issue in an office environment this woman who was using it to do her articles  for the tech TV website somebody I can't remember who some wag snuck up behind her with one of those  paddle ball things went pop pop pop pop pop pop and kept putting periods in her.  It sounds like a good story.  I saw it happen I know it's here. So Arthur Oakes Salzberger chairman owner and publisher of the  New York Times was at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland. You should have done twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from there. Wouldn't that have been great? We'll go next year. It wouldn't be great it's a long way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to drive. I don't think you can drive there. And it's cold. So he says it I don't know whether  we'll be printing the Times in five years. He says you know what I don't care either he says.  The internet is a wonderful place to be. How old is this guy? This guy's not as old as you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean I don't know what he's thinking. You know you get yeah the internet's a great place but I  mean if you got a newspaper that's so dominant like that it's not like they're you know I mean  he's equating his online viewership to a to his print viewership. Listen he says he says he has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one and a half million people a day reading the online site compared to 1.1 million reading the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  print edition. Yeah but the print edition is like a hundred page views or actually if you looked at  each article individually maybe a thousand or two thousand page views if you wanted to equate it to  the internet and when you go on the internet the average user hits maybe four or five on the outs  like Yahoo they hit maybe eight pages. That's like like I mean this is a minuscule total compared  to what you get in terms of pure content delivery on on a big newspaper like that. The guy's he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's clinically insane. He doesn't like spending the money on the news print I'm sure. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what it is but it's eluded because I mean there's no comparison. I mean you can't the numbers aren't  even the same it's just yeah sure you got a million you know so what I mean PC Magazine we  get like a million a day. It's not the same as the New York Times and we don't have the same kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of income. Right maybe he's an investor in E Ink. He says if you want to read the New York Times online

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you will have to pay so maybe that's his. The worst of both worlds. Yeah he's just he's  gonna ruin it. He's got quite a business model going there. He's gonna ruin it. I'll give up my newspaper when I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ubiquitous internet and a device that doesn't require a backlight to read. Yeah good point. And then  I could just download it immediately and have the pretty much the same experience holding something  in my hand. I could just read by natural light. Yeah if that if that five-year plan includes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ubiquitous wireless and the ability to have some kind of subscription based on something like say  pipes to bring it back around. Yeah yeah. That's a different thing and if it's a reader that you  can take on for me like take on Calchow or Meade. You know even so it's a different medium. I mean this is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah but don't you think he's saying that the media the print medium is in trouble and dying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not due to new. That's what he apparently that's what he's saying but I'm not you know I think this  is you know. He doesn't believe he has a choice it sounds like. Yeah well he's obviously lost it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because I mean it makes no sense. So they get they get a larger registration base let's say they charge  a little bit less than they're charging right now they get a lot more people signed up. They're going  to be able to use all that demographic information to push out much more targeted ads get a higher cpm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh and great dream of the crazy advertising world. Well you know the numbers don't like being targeted  to that extreme. I mean there's a there's going to be a backlash against this sort of thing.  I don't like people's hey John hey or something we think you'd be interested in. 90 percent of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the time they're wrong anyway. I don't know. I know I think the people I think research shows people will  tolerate ads if it's something they're interested in buying or want to know more about much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than they'll tell them. Well more importantly people will pay a lot. There's a reason there's  ads for golf stuff on airplane. And that's you know the kind of audience that they know they  can reach. And I don't know I just I think that as that stuff gets a little a little smarter that  there's going to be a good deal more money there. But what I know it's fun is reading the Sunday

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  paper. You know the thing is that yeah this all sounds good on paper but I think Tom would test  at this because CNET has been in the forefront of advertising online from the beginning and they have  to keep up in the ante. They got to go to the big ad in the middle and then they have to do this. I  mean people will get yeah maybe those targeted ads look good on paper for now but then after a while  people get used to them and then they stop seeing them and so the next thing comes along.  And then there's something else and then there's something else because you know you have to keep  it's almost like an addiction yet and you have to keep up in the dose and then pretty soon people  say hey this sucks these ads there's too many of them. I'd rather have something with no ads. So if

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you if you were a Salzburger would you be going with a pay model or with a more ad-centric model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'd go with a pay model? I'd never go with a pay model. I mean the Wall Street Journal. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to like pay their employees with confederate script and hard candies or how would they in in  terms of getting into more of an e-based or you know an online format? I wouldn't I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the entire strategy is crazy. I mean I don't know what he's thinking. It baffles me. I mean  they've done a wonderful job of getting the print version of the newspaper  delivered in Albany, California for god's sake. I mean they never just have anything like that before.  I mean it's unbelievable that he's even thinking of backtracking. I think the key would be to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  create LED based electronic devices that they could float down the Charles River. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to change the business model entirely. Or some way to push out the content that you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's relevant to you if it could be pushed. But short of the whole point of a newspaper is that like  you glance over the stuff that isn't relevant to you and in the fact you might find it of interest.  I'm worried that in this sort of you know an age of targeted everything like you know I'd only want  these kind of news stories and you lose all your context of the world and in the end all you end up  reading about is like the same thing over and over and over again. No I'm in total agreement with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the newspaper is like lots of discovery things you didn't know you wanted to read about  kind of interesting things from you know different perspectives. You guys sound like old farts now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That still happens on the web. I mean how many people use the default settings on a MyYahoo or  or a MyGoogle page because you know or they they pull in stuff that's recommended or you know people  still do that even on the web. I think the only thing that's going to replace the newspaper though  is something that works like the newspaper and it'll just be the electronic version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And also there is there's still a lot of discoverability because I subscribe to a lot of  RSS feeds and I'll follow stuff and I'll follow other people's links to things. So I mean you know  maybe I'm not going to learn something in a language I don't speak or something but I do find  there is still a lot of discoverability out there. I think it's a little bit of a strongman

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to say that goes away completely but I think it's generational. I mean I think my kids  are never going to use print. You know I mean they're going to they're going to it's all they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  live on screen. They don't even use an email anymore. People are treating their MySpace pages  like email now. I mean it's this is all evolving so fast. You know a lot of the reasons these

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  newspapers are having trouble. They mean they moan and groan about this and that. One thing they  never paid much attention to the fact that you have a Craigslist in the world that's going to  give away classifieds so they never adjusted to that and they knew 20 years ago this was going  to happen. And then the other thing is their product stinks. Has anybody looked at some of  these newspapers and compared them to some of the newspapers of like 50 years ago? Oh yeah.  They're just it's just ridiculously crappy. These products are so costly. Yeah they can't pay the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  reporters anymore. The good ones anyway. Very costly. Well maybe if they. Let's use the Wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Street Journal. I like the Wall Street Journal. The print edition is great. I subscribe to both  the print and the online edition and I use both frequently. It's a pretty dense. It's a good example

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  of a fairly dense. That's a good paper. Okay but also look who they're targeting. And getting a  little lightweight with these features which I think is what's killing newspapers to begin with.  A newspaper is supposed to be about news. It's not supposed to be about features. These long-winded  features about hemlines or something that's got nothing to do with anything. Or so should we all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steamer arrivals and criminal reports? What about Newsweek this week? Newsweek had a cover. The  cover on Newsweek is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. When's the last time you even saw a steamer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  arrival mentioned? I mean where is it? I was going back a little farther I guess. Why not? I think  it'd be cool to see. I mean I didn't know the Queen Mary was coming into town. It wasn't in the paper.  I read it in the paper. That's how I found out. I saw it on the SFGate site. Yeah no that was all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  over the place. All right whatever. That's a steamer coming in town. There you go. Here's a good example of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mediocre. Here's you have SFGate. I was looking at this the other day because I know the guys at  SFGate are trying to up you know fix their product a little bit. So I'm looking at the front page of  this thing and there's this big the graphic or the picture that they show that the photograph  is a big pitcher you know like a you know that like a milk pitcher that's filled with about halfway up  with honey or maple syrup or something and it's shot in one of these little cubes that photographers  use to shoot food pictures and that's the picture that's supposed to be a grab your interest. It's a  big jar. Everything's coming up syrup. I mean what is this? I mean look at this thing. How boring can  these people be? Could you be any more boring? I mean you I can't imagine. Gate is the website of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the San Francisco Chronicle which is the primary newspaper in San Francisco just for those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  who don't you know if you're going to bore the public to death with the product and you wonder  why your cert goes down. Hey look to you look look within. Look within look within my soul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grasshopper. Your inner syrup. I was a little I was a little miffed at Newsweek for putting  Britney Spears and Paris Hilton on the cover and saying girls gone wild. That didn't seem like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hot news. You know right and this is this a little bit of my first rat hole. This is but I've watched  this happen with CNN in particular the CNN site where it is increasingly that little kind of  bulleted side rail they've got. It's just getting more and more asinine and you know you remember  after 9-11. Hey everything's no more celebrity worship. It's all going to be about you know  hard news and it's always yeah it's like always like you know is Lindsay Lohan coked up you know.  Yeah that's what they want. Anna Nicole Smith. But this but you know what this this goes straight  to the point I was making badly though which is that it's really hard to please everybody  with especially with a print edition and in this case they're they're trying to they're trying to  split their attention in all these different ways and like like good old salon they end up  doing a whole bunch of wire stuff. I mean god how much wire stuff do you see now on things like  SFK? I think it comes down to it's very very costly to do. A lot of bureaus have closed in the last 25 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can't afford their reporters. Well they can afford the reporters but they can sure afford to  pay the executives big bonuses but you can't afford the reporters. So in some you know in other words  some guy that doesn't really do much a vice president gets you know half a million a year  but you can't afford the reporters. I mean this just can't afford the reporters thing is is out  of control. The other thing is where how much does it cost to be running wire service stuff all the  time? They don't can't afford the reporters. They don't even bother. That's just something to hang out on. They just run a bunch of AP stories or these little  papers around here run New York Times stories from the syndicate. I mean it's just they're they  will do everything on the cheap. They don't pay for anything and then they one they produce a crappy  product that anyone can produce who subscribes to the AP feed or UPI and then they have a crappy  product and people start to say I don't know I'm not interested they don't want to resubscribe. I've had  people they offer free subscriptions you can get it for a month or a year and I say no I don't want it.  You know I just as soon go online and get my news. You guys the paper stinks. Well now you're now you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  am I making myself clear? Yeah you're proving our point online. You just said you went online.  Yeah I went online. You just said you agree with Arthur Salzberger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because no but it's not for the same reasons. I mean I'm only in agreement because if the product was good  I would have a newspaper come into the house. So they can go online and produce a crappy product  and everybody else. Well you know what I don't read the local I mean my wife reads SFGate a lot  and once in a while she finds some good stories but generally speaking I go to like I internationalize

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  myself. I go all over the place. I use RSS feeds and I just scan a bunch of feeds. Or you go to Google News.  Yeah or go to Google you don't go to sites anymore you don't go to individual sites anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one thing that I think is going to this is just a super quickie but I think the thing that's  really killing discoverability and I'm getting this firsthand is all of the top N sites. You know  what I mean? Well so like even something like dig which is a site that I enjoy or something like  Yahoo most popular and you end up just seeing I think that's the part that kills discoverability  is when you're constantly just getting the hive only the hive mind idea of what's out there.  That's right that's a site like arts and letters. You're getting exposed to a lot of stuff from dig.  Well you know it's it's uh it's always the same 10 stories. That's why to me to find out it's great  to find a few sites that you're very excited about. For me it might be something like obscure  store or uh you know something like arts and letters daily or something but some place where  somebody's out there doing what amounts to exactly bubbling up interesting content. Well that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bloggers do. Yeah exactly. I mean that's our job. I mean that story about Salzberger himself that  which I blogged that story was pretty obscure. That was out in some guy who had been to Davos  and happened to be having a chat with him and then it went up on this uh very you know rare

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  blog and then it just started to trickle into the system. Well that may be an argument why uh  people's sites democratic sites like dig aren't as good as uh as actual journalists or actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know editorial types. Although those sites wouldn't work if there weren't people out there  discovering things on their own because nothing would ever bubble up. There's a big controversy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going on over dig you know in fact we should really get Kevin on it to address it although  I don't know. What's the controversy? Yeah he blogged it. Yeah but well so the point is I guess  that they've changed. Can you explain what's going on Will? They've changed how the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the the top bloggers work or something. Well they took away the the list that says the top 10 or  the top 100 users and of course all these all these guys that were posting like crazy  um you know they'll want recognition of being in the top 100. Well some of them have left some of  them have stuck around and Kevin said in his blog that he'd that they'd consulted with the top guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I got an email from one of the top guys I'll leave his name out who says uh that the  Wall Street Journal has been interviewing the top guys planning on a piece talking about you know  this abandonment of dig or what's going on with dig. Um I mean that's true the only reason you  do this is for the the recognition right? It's a lot of work. So what the theory goes that dig is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so big now that the top contributors are far less important than the masses. Well I think what dig's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  trying to do is to is is absolutely to downplay those guys because they are so important they  dominate so much they do in fact completely create the character of dig don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know enough about the that's interesting the raw numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is interesting. It is a bit of a controversy. Just in in prepping for uh the the five minutes  I take to prepare for Mac Break Weekly each week I watch some of the popular Mac stories and Apple  stories and there are a few usernames that come up a lot when you watch like the upcoming stories  or the top Apple stories and I assume that that's happening still across I guess Will would know  more than I do but uh that's you're still seeing a lot of the same because that's who's being watched  you can almost think of them as quote unquote A-list bloggers right? Right. The people are  watching the same thing you know Cory posts something and everybody links to it and that's  how the blog works well on dig if a popular poster a popular digger um you know adds that  link then a lot it's going to get picked up by that person's following so I mean I guess it's  just working we're just working like blogs. It is much like blogging isn't it without all the work  of actually writing anything. But I'm with you on the reputation part I mean it's there's something  that's kind of ineffable about being the first person to link something and I think there's a  lot of people who are kind of it's a good feeling you know it's a there's a reason people do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over? Yeah I guess. I don't know if it's a big story although I have to say that Business Week  I'm just looking at a article in Business Week today's Business Week that features Kevin Rose.  Oh brother. He's sure getting a lot of press from the web now just for you. New online tools it's  like they just discovered this. New online tools offer personalized recommendations to help users

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  find what they like. This week is so far behind the curve consistently it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're covering search engines next week? Yes next week search engines on they're talking about  it's really interesting um but they interview they interview Kevin on this dig a popular  bookmarking site okay. Yeah journalism. Okay that enables users to link to web pages Katherine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hollahan. How much is how much is Kevin worth this week according to Business Week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a good question I'm looking for that here they don't say later this year dig will  launch a recommendation tool able to expose members wow that doesn't seem like a good idea  to fellow to fellow diggers who appear to have several similar interests says Rose. Dig will  be smart enough to know what interests you this is what John this is what you were looking for  the site will identify those with like interests in part by the previous stories they've dug and  buried you know actually this is something I thought dig should do a long time ago.  You know I don't care about everybody who posts to dig there's certain people I'm interested in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  then it's just like a you can get it just like a blog you just you're making sub blogs from dig  right it's friends yeah I like that feature scene it's kind of like the you're like your delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  network I like I like that a lot. Tom are you back? Yeah I'm here. Okay I think we lost you briefly
