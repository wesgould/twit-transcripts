This Week in Tech, the show that covers all the tech news of the week gone by.  Well, at least the stuff that I think is interesting or maybe that I just happen to notice in passing.  Joining us today in studio, very glad to have an old colleague.  She's young, but she's been with us a long time.  Former web producer for Call for Help Tech TV employee now.  Intern.  Intern?  You were an intern?  I was an intern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You never got paid?  I got paid, but not very much.  25 a day.  Enough to pay for a bus.  We bought you lunch and a bus fare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  An actual employee at CNET.  What's your title at CNET?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an associate editor.  I review cell phones and Bluetooth hitsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she was just in the area and I said, Nicole, you're going on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we need some female pulchritude to balance out John C. Dvorak and Dwight Silverman.  Dwight Silverman, of course, from the Houston Chronicle.  And a great friend of the show and actually somebody who does some work, unlike me, and  found all the stories you're going to hear today on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just drag and drop.  That's all I do, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blogs.cron.com slash tech.  Is that right?  Tech blog.  Tech blog.  And I actually, even when you're not on the show, I'm going to, shameful secret I'm going  to reveal here.  I always go to your link blog because you basically linked to all the best stories of  the week.  So I just copy everything there.  I do it for you, Leo.  Thank you.  I knew you did.  Also here, John C. Dvorak.  Couldn't do the show without him at Channel Dvorak.  Is that a contract you want me to sign, John?  You're holding up a dummy contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd have it made if you signed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd own me, baby.  We're good to have all of you aboard.  We're going to talk about the week's tech news starting with, I don't know if you saw  it yesterday on Google, the flying saucer on the Google logo.  I love those Google doodles that they do.  But yesterday-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you noticed they're doing more than before?  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are.  I saw the Michael Jackson one when it was his birthday.  They did his shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was doing like the moonwalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know, there's some controversy because Google, you know, chooses to honor some things  but not other things.  That's true, too.  People say, well, why aren't you on?  I don't know.  I can't remember what they don't honor.  But why aren't you honor Ramadan but not Martin Luther King's birthday or whatever it is.  But this one was just weird.  It was a UFO and it was beaming up the O in Google, in the Google logo.  And then on the, I think it was a Google blog or it was a Google Twitter.  No, it was a Google Twitter, twitter.com slash Google.  They had a very cryptic numeric sequence, which was obviously encoded.  Twitter.com slash Google.  And you go back a little ways, you'll see this 1.12.12, 25.15.21.18.  I mean, they're giving it away.  They're even giving you the word, the word things.  And then they have a link to a twit pic, which might be a little bit of a hint.  Oh, it's a no, it's a twit pic of the Google Doodle.  Of the logo, right?  Of the logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's just, that's grade school cryptography.  That was, it was the letters of the alphabet.  Yeah, it's just number and letter substitution.  Did you figure it out, Dwight?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Grade School Crypto.  It said Microsoft sucks.  It said, Lotus ain't done.  Windows ain't done till Lotus won't run is what it said.  It said, all your O's are belong to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is in reference to the, all your base are belong to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  And finally, after, you know, it took a while because there was a lot of speculation.  In fact, if you click the, if you click the link, you know, because always those doodles  have a link.  It searched, it did a Google search on unexplained phenomenon.  It really didn't.  And of course, the first, the first item on unexplained phenomena was a article about  the mysterious Google Doodle and what could it possibly mean?  So it wasn't very helpful.  I'm kind of roundabout.  It turns out, I don't know why Google honored this.  It is the 20th anniversary of that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The game where the all your base are belong to us game.  This is so strange.  At least, I like it.  It's kind of nerdy in a way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should do a daily thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Daily mystery.  Daily mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh.  Go ahead, Dwight.  I don't know if I, you know, Google hadn't confirmed this.  The article that, that pulls the zero wing theory comes out of the Telegraph UK and they  don't, they don't talk to anybody who says, yeah, that's what it was.  It has to be though.  They're just guessing.  But it has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else could it be?  So, you know, in 1989, zero wing comes out.  The Twitter has to be.  But what I like is the playfulness here.  It's not tied to any big holiday.  Who wants to commemorate the 20th anniversary of zero wing after all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to see.  I love all your base.  So if that's what it is, I'm glad they did it.  But until they say it, I'm, I'm skeptical.  It's a very, so you don't think it's that?  Well, it may be that, but I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they should say it.  They should, they should leave us like, they should leave it a mystery.  Never tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the end of The Sopranos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what did, what the hell was all of that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't know themselves.  They just finished it.  I said, we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're done.  You figure it out.  Whatever you think.  And now Matt Weiner, who was a writer at Nonstop's last couple of seasons, is writing that show  Mad Men, which I love.  But it pretty much every scene in Mad Men ends like the last scene in The Sopranos.  Somebody wanders off.  Even every episode.  Every, no, every scene.  The show is the most cryptic show in history.  It is cryptic.  It's like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it must be a style that I just didn't know.  I'm not seeing this season's admin as good as the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  I'm a Mad Men fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I like it because I like the, you know, the imagery and the references.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The period is what I like.  They do such detail.  The style is also very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've reproduced the periods with such detail.  Yeah, but I think the story's going nowhere this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the style.  It usually starts out slow.  Mad Men starts out kind of, you know, you're always going, where is this going?  And then by about mid-season it picks up.  Last year, a lot of people had the same complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where did you first hear of Mad Men, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why.  I actually heard about it from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like everyone, all my friends were talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything now.  The first time you hear about it, well, maybe just you and me, Nicole, but the first thing  I hear about anything is on Twitter.  In fact, if I want to know what's going on in the world, it used to be I would wake up  to my clock radio set to KCBS, the news channel in San Francisco.  And that's how I would know.  In fact, 1010wins used to say that.  Remember in New York City, they'd say, give us 20 minutes, we'll give you the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would never have heard of Mad Men otherwise because it's on AMC, which I've never watched.  Right, never watched.  Probably wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because HBO didn't pick it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably why.  Which was nuts.  HBO made a big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they walked away from it.  Yeah.  Which is weird because they got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got True Blood.  That's good.  Don't you like fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch one of these things every season and that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vampires, they're the hot thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're so hot, man.  They're so hot.  Speaking of hot, did you see the viral video stealing 23 MacBook Pros, 14 iPhones, 9 iPods?  Oh yes, I saw this.  31 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that was well planned.  Very well planned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess they must have known that there was a camera.  They must have known about the cameras.  They're wearing hoods and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that bugged me about it was they got no power adapters.  They took all these devices and fire.  And I kept going, get the adapters.  Get the adapters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're watching carefully, you know, it's funny.  The video that's on YouTube is from Channel 6 ABC.  They make two and a half minutes out of this 31 second video.  But you see the guard walking around, you know, typical Apple store.  Guard's walking around.  It's quiet.  Guys throw a brick through the window.  It must have been planned.  I mean, they were good.  They, oh man, they're making a whole story out of this.  This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Local news.  Local news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exclusive Apple store theft.  There's never any other robberies in the world.  Look at this.  Well, it's because they got this great video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reporter gets more and more breathless and outrageous as it goes on.  I mean, by the end of it, he's on galley.  The way he tells us is like a Law and Order heist or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are about to witness exclusive first-hand surveillance footage of the spectacular Smash  and Grab.  The same, the Apple computer store as the Promenade shopping center in Evesham.  It's after closing and the security guard is seen making his rounds in the store.  But at 2 0 5 a.m. thieves hit the store's plain glass door with a blunt object.  Oh, they're good.  Like crows, they bring it shattering down with one strike.  Then, with precision timing, the five males enter the store and clean house like there's  no tomorrow.  Each one went in different directions.  Get the adapters.  Get the adapters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't realize that the adapters cost more than the machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all in 31 seconds flat.  Later, the security guard is seen running in after the thief's approach.  Oh, good job.  Whoa, brother.  Hey, what happened?  He's hiking up his pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you doing, dude?  What were you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So apparently, the security guard was on his pee break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They timed it really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess they must have scoped that out.  He's probably consistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either that or he's in on the internet deal.  Either that or he always goes on the pee break at the exact same time.  Yeah, he's like, you know, that was well done.  And they were covered.  They must have known there were cameras in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it would have been better if they were wearing Nixon masks.  That's still my favorite outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good outfit when you're going to steal something wearing Nixon masks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is there any news this week at all?  It seemed kind of dull this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've done two whole stories.  All right, here's another one.  Microsoft gets to continue to sell Microsoft Word.  That's a big story.  Yeah, I guess.  God, John, you're just hard to please this week.  You're a tough audience.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I guess that's news.  Gmail fails for two hours.  That was big breaking news.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you follow what Nicole was saying, that Twitter is your source of news, then  that was the biggest story of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of annoying, though, after an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw people saying, shut up already.  I know Gmail's down.  Well, it was down only for a month.  Say again?  It wasn't as though it was down for a month.  Let me do that again.  Say again?  One, two, three.  Okay, Dwight, you first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was down only if you had the web version.  If you were looking at the iPhone or on a client, and IMAP or POP, it worked fine.  It's if you were trying to use the web version that it was down.  Right.  So some people didn't know.  Some people said, oh my, Gmail's not down.  Okay, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't get worked up about the story.  I just thought that we went down for a couple of hours.  I mean, I've had my email go up and down occasionally.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not abnormal for email servers to go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's only big news if you were a company and you relied on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But companies, it happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of stupid if you're a company and you've outsourced all.  Do companies do that?  They say, oh, yeah, we don't need to use email.  We'll just use Gmail.  We don't have to have a mail server.  Let's just run Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it only Gmail?  Did Google Docs work fine?  Google Docs worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything else worked fine.  Okay.  Google, I thought, handled it pretty well.  They have a status page and they were very quick to put on the status page.  We know it's down.  We're working on it.  We should have it up in a couple of hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does make me wonder, how wide is Gmail used?  How many users do Gmail actually have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's 149 million users.  It's the number two or three after Yahoo and number three after Hotmail, Yahoo, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not as big as Yahoo or Hotmail, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo's one.  Yahoo's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet if Yahoo went down for 100 minutes, would it be the biggest story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody would talk about it.  It would be like a big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point.  I wonder if this even happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Earlier this week, Yahoo mail went down for five days.  No one noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No one knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the geeks use Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  I wonder what the percentage of Gmail users on Twitter is compared to the rest of the  world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're probably more likely to be on Gmail than they are on Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Hotmail's right at...  No geek, self-respecting geek would be sexygeek123 at hotmail.com.  That's just not a good title.  Unless it's your spam email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Don't follow your spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I mention that Microsoft Word can be sold again?  Did I mention that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got one.  Here's a story that's kind of amusing.  Microsoft calling on thousands to host their own Windows 7 parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so ridiculous.  Go to houseparty.com.  And apparently, Microsoft isn't the only company that uses...  This is a service.  Other groups like the Mexican avocado growers use houseparty.com to create...  I don't know why you would do this.  Maybe there's a whole subculture of people holding house parties for commercial product  releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ford Taurus has a game day house party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ford Taurus game day house party sponsored by Ford.  So here it is.  Windows 7 launch party global sponsored by Microsoft.  Apply now.  And you go in here and you sign up and look at the prize.  You could win a $750 computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sucks.  I'm going to throw a party.  I want to like hit the brand and I'll throw a party.  What they should do...  Microsoft, if they had any brains, which apparently they don't anymore, they would say, look,  you throw a party and you get at least 40 people or whatever and you document the party  and send us the invoice and we'll send you the 30, 40 bucks a head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well they do send the host a copy of Windows.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Invite at Costco.  For less money it's going to cost you to throw a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I wonder, what is the requirement?  Do you have to have a certain number of people show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, can you invite your mom and that be a party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm having my mom over and we're going to have a party.  I'm going to have a party in my pants.  Exactly.  You'll be assisted by House Party, the world's leading party organizer.

You could just have a party in your pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't say that you have to, you know, how to enter during the entry period, go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the host section, drawing, they're going to have a drawing, which means one person gets  a $750 computer.  Oh no, 64 people are potential prize winners from all the eligible entries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is a $750 computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, tell us what it is.  Don't just say it's a PC that's worth $750.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it running an Atom chip in Unix?  That's probably a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Publicity, general conditions.  It doesn't say you actually have to have anybody show up at the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a party, but nobody showed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  All hosts will receive one limited signature edition Windows 7 Ultimate, one deck of playing  cards with a Windows 7 desktop design.  Wow.  Sign me up.  One puzzle with Windows 7 desktop design, one poster with the Windows 7 desktop design,  10 tote bags.  You get 10 tote bags also included in the USA party packs.  One package of streamers for decoration, one package of balloons for decoration, one tabletop  center piece. I'm having a party.  I'm going to do this.  We'll have it right here.  Oh, we'll have it right here.  The Twit Cottage, one package of Windows 7 napkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Now you're convincing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm joining.  I'm doing this.  We're going to have a party right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a coffee shop in Houston that's kind of gotten a lot of notoriety for being kind  of the Web 2.0 central coffee grounds.  They've actually been written up in a few stories about businesses using Twitter.  The guy who runs it has applied to do one of these, and he wants to make a big deal  out of it.  So there are businesses who are actually taking this seriously.  Yeah, I want to do it just to get the napkins.  I don't want the napkins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows 7 napkins.  I'm signing up right now.  Oh, I can use Facebook Connect to do it.  That simplifies.  I've read and agreed to the terms and conditions.  I'm reading and agreeing to the terms and conditions.  And now I guess it's probably going to spam my Facebook account right now.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't sign up your Windows Live account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All events from Houseparty.com will be able to create and modify Facebook events on your  behalf without your approval each time.  Sure, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only Facebook.  Do you have to be a Facebook person to do this?

Transcript:  No, it's just to allow RSVPs.  It's just a quick and easy way to do it.  Let me see if you other ways to do it.  Facebook Connect.  I want the Windows 7 party.  This is it.  I'm getting the Windows 7 party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting one too, because I need those napkins.  I want streamers.

Transcript:  I want balloons.  I was going to say that they have special themes they want you to do.  Oh.  And you can choose from one of four.  Photo Palooza, Media Mania, Setting Up With Ease, that's mine, and Family Friendly Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Oh, here's the party address.  I'm going to put in my address here.  Cannot ship to a PO box.  OK, I'll put in this studio address.  Oh, this is so exciting.  When should we have?  I guess we should do it on Twitter.  We'll do it on a Twitter for that week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to do it sometime between October 22nd and 29th.  So it would have to be.  Oh, yeah, that'd be great.  Sunday for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have all updated.  We are all. Yeah, I didn't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, don't announce that.  I'm sorry. Big deal.  In fact, Scoble was was furious because, well, he hadn't updated WordPress.  He was a couple of versions back.  There's a very big bug in WordPress that lets bad guys get in,  spam your account, create phony administrator accounts so they can come back later.  Yeah, really delete data, trash it.  I mean, just he says, I don't feel safe with WordPress.  Hackers broke in and took things.  He says it feels to him like it did when he was a kid and his house got broken into.  And I can I think that that's probably his house.  I've had my I've had sites hacked before.  It does feel pretty awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you got it.  Here's a guy who is a he works for Rackspace, you know, which is a  a service that lets you, you know, host your website and,  you know, presumably you can do they they want you to do backups.  And he didn't have a backup for any of his  any of his blogs, which he said he's not going to do again.  But, you know, you think Rackspace would have backed him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to throw stones because I'm on soft layer.  And I had Evolved, which is a backup technique, and I had all the stuff.  And it's just something had gone wrong and hadn't backed up.  So when a bad guy put a PHP script on my site,  I created the whole, by the way, foolishly, I allowed uploads  to an open directory, bad mistakes.  So he uploaded a script, which I later found and I have  called, I warn you, Dwight, I have it called C9.php.  There was a really interesting script.  So if you upload it, he could then execute it.  It does a lot of very clever things, looks through my sequel for passwords and stuff.  So he got in and he deleted a forum site.  He deleted a couple of things. He deleted a blog.  We had cached, you know, Google caches this stuff.  So we had Google. We were able to get everything back.  The forum, we were not able to.  I had to go back to my last backup, which was a couple of weeks.  But this is bad when this happens. It's really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So who was this person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. He sent me a note.  He was from, gosh, I can't remember what country he was from.  He didn't know who I was.  He just sent me a note saying, hey, I found a hole on your site  and I've trashed everything.  Just thought I'd let you know.  It was nice of him. So I sent him a note back.  So what did you do that for? He said, well, you know,  you know, I just because I could.  He wasn't like a bad person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, he was just clearly insane.  He just took your site.  He's not a bad person. He trashed it pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was just like somebody walking in your door, throwing the garbage around,  you know, kicking over some chairs and leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then calling you later and saying, hey, I did it.  I did this to your house.  You should probably take better care of it.  Exactly. Like what kind of person does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. He said, you know, it's like saying, hey, you left the back window open.  So I crawled in and trashed your house.  It's a warning. That doesn't.  I learned my lesson. But I have the script still, which is very interesting.  One of these days, I kind of thought maybe I'd go through it  and show people how hackers work.  It's a script kitty. It's not a hacker, obviously.  But 2.8.4. Make sure your WordPress is updated.  If you use WordPress.com, this is kind of interesting.  Matt Mullenweg.  Who was a I believe created WordPress.  Yes. Yeah, he created it.  Said, I am not.  I do not own WordPress.  It is an open source project.  I'm not responsible for WordPress.  My company, Automatic, runs WordPress.com.  We never had the problem there.  It's kind of interesting.  It's almost he almost disavowed.  He said WordPress.org is an open source project.  A lot of people work on it.  WordPress.com is safe.  So I thought that was kind of an interesting point of view to take on.  I always consider him the guy who created WordPress.  Anyway, if you have an updated do update,  and these things happen all the time,  although it seems like I update.  One of the reasons WordPress is at 2.8.4  is because they do frequent security updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. At least they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you update?  I mean, do you know the new WordPress, if you've upgraded to 2.8,  it will say there's a new version and it's a very one button upgrade.  It's actually very easy to upgrade.  You just click one button and it will do it for you.  Yeah. So you should be doing it.  You should be doing it.  Google has patented his home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? What? What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Google's home page.  It's so patentable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently.  Well, somebody thinks it is.  It filed a patent application in March 2004.  It was approved on September 1st.  It's the patent is for the simplicity of the home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then let's go back into the late 90s and take a look at that Yahoo page,  which was pretty simple as prior art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Graphical user US United States patent  599372 graphical user interface  for a display screen of a communications terminal.  I love the archaic language they use in this stuff claim.  The ornamental design for a graphical user interface  for a display screen of a commercial terminal as shown and described.  Approved. Approved.  Now, I got to say, you're right.  I mean, it seems like there'd be prior art to a simple white page.  It looks like the page of my novel.  I wonder if this has to do with Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, but Microsoft's MSN live search was very simple, too.  So Bing is Bing is actually complicated by comparison because it has the big photo.  Maybe Microsoft can patent the photo.  I know I have to say, I kind of like that photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then and you hover the mouse over different parts of it and there's little searches.  And I kind of like that.  It's their response to the Google Doodle, I think is something, you know.  So you go to that page, otherwise you would have no reason to go to that page.  You just use the search bar and it changes daily.  Right. Yeah.  Bing. There's got to be I think there's going to be a little maybe a war  to get people to go to the page as opposed to just use the search bar.  Because nowadays nobody ever uses a search bar.  Right. The little search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right.  So today, I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very close up.  Looks like an electron microscope photo.  But then if you move stuff around.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, behold, one of the most pervasive life forms on earth.  Can you guess what it is?  This makes it kind of fun. You want to go there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, you said you don't think people use the little search bar on the browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think they do, is what I'm saying.  Instead of going to the web page.  You can now go back and see home page images and hotspots from the past week  with our new home page archive.  However, you need to install Microsoft Silverlight to see.  And that's talking about a gratuitous requirement.  Well, if you install Silverlight, maybe we'll let you see our previous home pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do people still use the I'm feeling lucky button?  This seems so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, is it still on there?  Yeah, it's still on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because nobody goes to the Google front page anymore. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use I use Google toolbar and  I've started using Safari a lot more and I'm bummed that there's no Google  toolbar for Safari.  But the thing I like in Google toolbar is there's a button for searching  just the site you're on at the time, which is really useful.  And I would love to have that button, you know, in the in the little search  area on, say, Firefox or Safari.  That's one of the most useful buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, you know, I just use site colon in the site name,  but that's a lot of extra typing.  That's all it's doing, essentially. Right. Right.  It does that for you. Yeah. I'm lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google quick search, the little what do you call it?  A utility. You can install the little application.  It's kind of like Quicksilver for the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was written by Alcor. Oh, yeah.  It was the guy who wrote Quicksilver.  He now works at Google and he wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I use quick search. Do you like it?  Mm hmm. I quite like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's basically like Quicksilver,  although not quite as feature rich yet.  I have a feeling that's, you know, Alcor no longer  develops new features on Quicksilver.  I think he's put all of his energies into that.  Good. Now I've installed while we've been talking, I've installed Silverlight.  Ooh, ooh.  Why not you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I can see. She'll never run fast again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many anybody upgrade to Snow Leopard in the in the group here?  Yeah, yes. Yes.  Dwight, now, did you did you upgrade your flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes, I did it the other day after I saw that story that there's a  they shipped it with an old version that had a downgrade at the flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the big thing.  I mean, it's not unusual.  And, you know, in Apple's defense,  they went gold just like a week or two after Flash was updated.  So I understand why they wouldn't want to include the new version  in the gold master because they had a time to test it.  But it's kind of unheard of to downgrade somebody's.  Stuff to a less secure version and not tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anybody who's using Snow Leopard out there.  Reason like is that because they because the exploit was discovered  and patched just two weeks before they went to Gold Master.  So in Apple, again, in Apple's defense, I could see why they might not include it.  But it is a little bit bad behavior to downgrade somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, in Snow Leopard, the the web browser Safari runs into 64.  It's a 64 bit application.  Yeah, that's true.  And so if they're replacing the 32 bit in Leopard, when you do the upgrade,  they might strip out all the plugins.  But here's something interesting.  There's no 64 bit version of Flash. Right.  And so how are they running a 32 bit version of Flash inside a 64 bit  operating system and a 64 bit application?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft has that exact problem with Windows.  If you write 64 bit Windows, you cannot run 64 bit IE if you want Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You can't install the 32 bit plugin for Flash. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to get this call all the time because it's really confuses  end users who, you know, they shouldn't have to know 32 from 64.  But nowadays, everybody is selling 64 bit Windows.  That's kind of the default preinstalled.  And they try to run Internet Explorer and Flash won't install.  They go, I don't know. Huh? Huh? What's going on here?  So this may be I don't know if this is related.  I think Apple has figured out a way to run a 32 bit plugin within a 64 bit browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're running a 32 bit kernel in a lot on most of these.  That's the default default. Right. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is your you know, we talked about this last week,  and I've kind of beaten this dead horse.  I'm not going to beat it anymore.  But just we haven't I haven't talked to you about this.  What's your one more whack at the horse?  Well, it's a leopard, not a horse leopard.  I was a little perturbed by the general media and all the Mac media,  but even some of the general media like David Pogue and Walt Mossberg.  David Pogue said this is a must have upgrade.  Everybody ought to run out and do it.  And I thought and even said anybody who says this is a,  you know, a service pack is a hater.  And I thought, David, you know, I don't think this is something  everybody should run out and upgrade to.  And this is just one more reason why it was a bad idea to run out and upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was he doing a vocal imitation of George Bush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gonna run out, gotta install it. Must install it.  That's the other George Bush.  I don't do George W. Bush. You see, you gotta say the dub.  Do you do a George W. Bush? No.  You might, Dwight. You're from the same area, the same neck of the woods.  I'm not going to touch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it might.  Mine would be a version of John Stewart's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he did. John Stewart is a fantastic George.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But it just seems like, you know, you're the force  or against this kind of thing with a comment like that.  Yeah. I found it very disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this this brings us to a story because the New York Times ombudsman,  they have an ethicist.  Is this typical of papers? Does the Chronicle have somebody like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. But some papers have had to do it because they're so influential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Houston Chronicle doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a we had for a while a reader rep.  We are now kind of farming out questions to individual editors whose whose area falls in.  And then you would publish a story or.  Yeah. So you would publish if there were if you found a reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you felt there were a conflict, you would publish a story explaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had a blog and we would deal with it often in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The New York Times calls it their public editor.  I don't does this appear in the print edition or is it only online?  I think it's in the print edition. Yeah, it is.  So the story is it's Clark Hoyt, the public editor.  The story is he works for the Times, too.  And apparently, there were some complaints  David Pogue, who was writing and reviewing Snow Leopard in a glowing fashion,  by the way, happens to also write  manuals and has a missing manual for Snow Leopard coming out soon.  And that seems to be a pretty apparent conflict of interest because I'd say  certainly he has some interest in Snow Leopard being a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have that.  You know, I don't have a problem with the conflict.  The interesting to a point with the guy who writes books about a topic,  and he's really in love with the with the product,  except for the fact that the New York Times in particular,  I mean, Pogue, if he was writing for a computer magazine,  you know, it would be so so what.  But the New York Times is so, you know, so, you know,  incredibly snooty about having these all these ethical,  you know, checklists that the fact that Pogue gets away with this is amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He writes, but it creates a tricky ethical terrain.  No Times journalist is in quite the same position as Pogue reviewing products  and simultaneously writing guides to them.  He said he makes more money from the books than from the Times, as if that just.  Oh, that's OK, then. Well, all right.  Oh, yeah. OK, fine. OK, then keep doing that.  Pogue and his editors say they talk more money as a hooker.  I make more money selling cocaine, but that doesn't stop me from doing  this show every darn Sunday.  But Nicole, if you if you want me to hook you up just on the way out.  OK. Pogue is in his Pogue and his editors say they talk frequently  about how to deal with his varied interests.  And the editors praised him as a straight shooter.  And that's true. He points out that he was he says, quote,  savaged Apple's iMovie 08 in his Times blog blog,  even as he was writing a missing manual for it.  Ultimately, they decided this is not an issue, but they have said in future  they probably should say something about it in the article.  And and and and they also say it's good the Times addressed the issue now.  Windows 7 is being released within a month.  Pogue is planning to review it.  The missing manual is already for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also he actually started the missing manual series.  Right. It's grown into quite an empire.  And he also does the he does Windows 7.  I've got copies of his stuff here.  He does OS 10.  He does whenever there's a new one of those, he did Leopard.  He's done a switching to the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't a lot of tech journalists do books on the side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you do, Dwight, don't you? I do.  I've written two tech books.  I've done one, a book with Windows with Larry Magid on Windows Vista.  And I've written one about running Windows on the Mac that deals with  virtualization and boot camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's the issue here because Pogue is also a reviewer.  He reviews the product and he sells a book about that same product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see, I'm a reviewer, too.  Yeah. So I review them and I also write these books.  So is there a solution?  We've dealt with it the way the way we've dealt with it at the Chronicle  and the way that they are dealing with it in this case is they're  disclosing openly that he writes these books.  Right. You know, I think if you if you read his stuff,  he's pretty much an Apple fanboy, but he is a straight shooter.  He'll lay it out if he doesn't like that.  I do the same thing.  You know, you can't read any of my reviews and say that that I'm looking  at anybody's boots.  And in fact, even in the books that I've written, I will say when I think  that something, you know, is not a very good is an executed very well.  So so I think so long as as you're open about it and you're not  you know, you're being straight about it,  you know, let the readers make up their own mind.  This is we when we did the columns, when I wrote whenever I write a column  about Vista, whenever I would write about virtualization,  we would put a disclosure at the bottom that I had written this book.  You know, it was funny was that some people thought, oh, he's pimping  his book at the bottom of his column.  It does look like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a it's not a disclaimer.  It's an ad. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't I haven't made any money off those books, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you should put that available at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. In the remainder, Ben, disclaimer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is something that's going to come up more and more nowadays  because there are these lines are absolutely blurring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's over.  Everything's corrupt now, so I wouldn't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't think this is well, it's funny because in past days saying,  oh, but no, read my reviews, I've been critical.  It wasn't a defense. Right.  I mean, that's that's new that that's a defense that well,  you could read my reviews, you could see I'm independent.  I mean, I use the same defense.  But I don't but I don't, you know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's you know, here's what it is.  The guys have been pokes probably right.  He makes more money on his books.  He probably makes a fortune on his books.  Of course, he uses the New York Times to leverage book sales,  so that can't be a minor issue.  And the fact that he does that, I think the Times has a complaint that's valid.  I mean, I don't think at the same time they they'd rather pay,  you know, Pogue less money, but then they pay a regular full time reporter  and get his content for a for a discount.  Let him go make money on the side on his own dime.  That's how new media does it.  And I think, yeah, I think exactly what's happening right now.  I mean, you know, he can because these cheap bastards that run these newspapers  don't pay people enough money not to have to do books. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. David's a good friend.  I've known him for years. I know he's ethical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  So since we have Dwight here and he just told us about his two books.  So I've got this thing here in front of me.  It's a contract. It's a dummy contract.  So I have to ask Dwight, do you sign the dummy contract?  Oh, that's enough. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the dummy contract?  Maybe we should define terms. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The dummy contract is what it is.  The contract that this is in the music business, the book business,  any business that where they publish you is a contract that they throw in front of you.  That's the first contract.  So we want to do your book.  We want to, you know, here's the contract.  They give you a dummy contract, which is a contract for idiots  who've never done a book or anything before.  And they usually sign it.  And the dummy contract, of course, is called the dummy contract  because only a dummy signs it.  Anybody with any experience or as a lawyer working with them  will say, you know, we can't sign this.  And they have all these different changes.  And of course, when you do the big the big shock or the big surprise,  you discover when you're working with publishers or anybody  who throws a dummy contract out at you is the first thing they do is they don't even  flinch when you say, no, we can't do this. We can't do that.  We can't do this. No, this is different.  This should be this. This should be that.  They go, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.  And they just chain make all the changes almost like without argument,  unless you do something really crazy.  But generally speaking, there's they know what the leeway is.  And you get you get the deal. You should get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost like, oh, you caught us. Yeah. OK, we'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never signed the dummy contract.  My agent makes sure I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has. I know that's not necessary.  I don't know what to ask who your agent is, but there's at least one agent  I know of who's really popular with the publishers because he has his writers  signed the dummy contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a she. So no, I'll tell you, I never had an agent.  I had I had I signed every dummy contract they put in front of me.  As a result, made absolutely I made money on the first book  and made no money on the rest of the books.  And I'm proud of that.  I'm proud of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so one of the problems that you probably ran into,  it was just it was just one of their classic tricks,  which I think every new author gets suckered into.  It's called cross collateralization, which you've got to get out of the contract  almost immediately.  And cross collateralization is why they give you they'll give you  a big advance on the first book.  And they say, we're going to do a three book deal.  And then they say, you know, here's your money for the first book.  And then we'll give you some for the second, the third book.  But they but they've got this cross collateralization thing in there.  So in other words, if your first book doesn't pay out, which it won't,  they take the royalties from your second book and attribute it  to the first contract and put you in the hole.  And by that and then they take the third book and it goes in there  until you make up all this money that was, you know, squandered on the first book.  And you just write basically three books and you get whatever you got  for the first book. And that's it.  And the whole thing is just a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got an idea, John.  You should write a book called Dummy Contracts for Dummies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if it's time to dummy contract to get that book published.  So hey, I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's good stuff in this dummy contract.  I mean, this one is one of the it's very onerous.  For example, United States book sales, 10 percent of actual  I love the terms.  If you ever got in, Dwight knows is when you get to your publisher statement,  they send you this this computer printout that nobody can decipher.  I have no idea what it says.  United States book sales, 10 percent, which is low  of actual net, which is ridiculous,  receipts by publisher, except for special sales as specified below,  which which is actually giving you less money than this.  So in other words, they're giving you they're not even giving you  10 percent of the cover price or 10 percent of wholesale.  They're giving you 10 percent of net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is net and actual net, which is God knows what that even means.  Which means you get nothing.  You probably get it, you know, for a 10 buck book, you'd probably get like a nickel.  But this is a classic.  This dummy contracts one of the best in terms of for dummies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He saved it all these years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've got a bunch of these, but this one's actually quite good.  I may. This is from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to say who it's from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's Cybex. Cybex.  Cybex doesn't, you know, they're.  But, you know, there's like every other dummy contract.  If you want to do a deal with Cybex, you wouldn't sign this contract.  But they take it to an extreme.  I mean, if you're going to put together a dummy contract,  let's just make see how dumb you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I want to know what John's shirt says,  but I'm not going to let you know until after we come back.  So, John, if you'd like to take a break, anybody else wants to take a break?  Except for you, the listeners, you must stay here  while I tell you about go to meeting, go to meeting.

Transcript:  Oh, that down there.

Transcript:  Geek. Geek.  It's in a it's a red background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  Now, there's something about that, that the background, that shape.  It looks like a flow chart or something. Diagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says geek is from is an Intel shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like that.  Have you seen I love those Intel ads where they highlight like the inventor of USB.  Yeah. And he's like a rock star.  You cheer him on. I love those ads.  Makes me proud to be a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that ad was kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? They haven't done any others.  They did the one, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all I can remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I got like a little too much like Vivek Kundra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still got that thing for Vivek, huh?  Let me see if I can find that. I love the guy.  Something like our rock stars aren't anything like your rock stars or something like that.  And they and all the all the women are like going crazy over him.  There we go.  I love the music, too.  He does look like Vivek Kundra.  Here he comes. Oh, oh, the women are going wild.  Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of USB.  He's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thing is, you don't get what you don't really get.  This is the bottom of his pants are off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our rock stars are like your Intel.  But you know what I really like?  And actually, I watch this ad every time is that chorus going bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  I love that part because they're watch they're looking at each other.  They're just kind of talking.  We are Intel.  And then all of a sudden, they just start saying sponsors of tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think? Yeah, that's the way it is.  Or didn't tell when you go to the Santa Clara office.  Exactly what it's like.  It's just launching a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bum, bum, bum, bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't air that in Texas.  They don't. You never seen that?  They don't. No, no.  We have the commercials. They're really boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because that's right.  Texas is a home of AMD. That's right.  And Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a little Dell left.  There's a little Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a little bit of Dell left.  So actually, that raised an issue.  What was I going to?  Oh, I can't remember now.  What? I just said something that made me think of something.  And I can't remember.  It was a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I can talk about a story, Leo.  Yeah. You got a story for us.  Yeah, the Apple finally and rather AT&T finally saying that we're going to do  MMS on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Is that big news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like somebody wrote big news.  It's big news for iPhone owners, for every other like for owners of the Razer.  What? Somebody wrote welcome to 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's like big deal.  Well, you cover cell phones at CNET.  I mean, how important is it?  I don't even understand.  What is it that I can't do because I don't have MMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, a lot of phones don't get email.  And that's one of the primary ways to send pictures and video.  You know, you send it to your to your mom's cell phone, who doesn't have,  you know, email in her phone and you can send her messages,  multimedia messages, messages of your grandkids or whatever.  Right. And it's really easy.  You send it to a phone number instead of an email address, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if somebody sends me an MMS on my iPhone now, will I not get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you will get a link to a web page where...  Oh, I've seen that. I hate that.  Yeah, it's a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now I'll just so and vice versa.  If somebody, if mom has a Razer, actually, my wife has some,  you know, non-smartphone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they send if they send you an MMS and then she's never

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  she's never taken a picture on that phone in her life.  Not once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Leo, it's now called a feature phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, a dumb phone is a feature phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, if it's if it's like it's in between a smartphone and a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no way in between.  They're calling everything a feature phone, except the phones that don't actually exist.  Which is what the phones that if the phone is thing is a phone that's just a phone anymore.  They all have little features.  But it's but its features are short of being smart. Right.  Yeah. You know, it's just like it plays a couple of games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has a camera or the I don't know, Samsung Instinct or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Instinct's the smartphone, isn't it?  Wouldn't you call it a smartphone?  I don't like the LG Dare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LG Dare. There's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a smart phone.  It doesn't run like very good email, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it has to have a what does it have to have to make it smart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it has to have like, you know, a third party operating system  like Windows Mobile or the OS, iPhone OS.  Symbian, right.  Windows, Mac, BlackBerry.  Oh, it's gone again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing about this, though, is that AT&T, you know, delayed it.  They promised it at the end of summer and they're doing it.  Actually, the date falls in early fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  September 25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's only three days late.  Summer and September 22nd.  That's close.  Yeah, a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No cigar, not horseshoes.  They know I'm going to defend AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  This is something you've never heard from my lips before.  Oh, let's record this.  I want to defend AT&T.  I thought their explanation was pretty good.  In fact, and I put a link to it in our in our list.  There's something to be said for the fact that poor.  Oh, boy, I never thought I'd say poor AT&T.  Poor AT&T.  Well, I've got a new book coming out, by the way.  AT&T for Dummies.  No, poor AT&T didn't know what it was biting off when it got the iPhone.  Yeah, the iPhone's been fantastic for AT&T.  Tens of how many millions?  Ten million more.  Phones have been sold.  A third of all new iPhone owners are new to AT&T.  So it's been a boon for them getting new owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what they have more people that hate them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true, too.  What they underestimated is that iPhone users and I'm one of them.  You do way more with our phones in terms of sending pictures, sending videos.  I mean, we're using a bandwidth like nobody's business.  And so AT&T, I think, was taken off guard a little bit by this.  And they've been upgrading the network.  They said, look, we didn't want to release MMS until we could support it.  But we know that you iPhone people are going to send pictures like crazy.  So we had to upgrade.  I think, am I crazy?  But I think that in their defense, that kind of makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I disagree, because I think, I mean, if you can have MMS on a regular,  like a Razer, like you said, why?  I mean, every other smartphone on the market has MMS from the get go.  Why do we have to wait three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we use so much more bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iPhone users use a lot more.  But they wouldn't have known that at the beginning, what she's saying.  They knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they didn't know that last year.  But the iPhone couldn't do MMS last year, could only start doing MMS with the 3GS.  It wasn't even capable of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, why was that? Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Apple didn't build it.  I'll tell you why that is, because Steve Jobs said, what are you talking about?  We gave you email. What do you want MMS for?  Steve didn't get it.  So only the 3GS did MMS.  At that point, you know, when Apple goes to AT&T, it says,  we're going to put MMS in the thing.  AT&T says, we're already choking.  And everybody in San Francisco, bitches, about AT&T,  because there are more iPhone users per square inch than in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just really funny when they had that announcement at WWDC.  And when they had the list of carriers up on the screen,  you could see Vodafone on there, you could see like Orange UK on there.  But you couldn't see AT&T.  And there was a collective gasp of horror.  Yeah, all the developers.  Yeah. They said, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even your US carrier is not going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that you're probably right, Leo.  Wow. Wow.  Normally, I hope I'm recording this.  They're recording this. Yeah.  I usually have an alternative theory that's a little more interesting,  but I can't argue with the theory.  You're probably exactly right.  The sequence makes nothing but sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just I mean, I kind of feel sorry for them.  You don't have to milk it now.  OK, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You win.  Here in Houston, AT&T announced last week that  they spent 30 million dollars to upgrade the network here alone.  They doubled the backhaul capacity and they added the 850 megahertz spectrum  and they tied it to the MMS.  I mean, they essentially said that this that this will help with that issue.  And MMS, MMS is like SMS.  It works on the control channel, right?  Oh, doesn't actually use.  It's not data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It uses the text messaging plan, whatever you signed up on, like a 200 plan or a.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't actually use the data network per se.  So it does, but they don't list it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't bill you that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. So here's a question.  If it actually does, it uses a separate control channel.  If you look, if you go look up how SMS works and MMS works,  it uses it uses a different network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because these technologies are older SMS and MMS are older than data  itself, the GPRS.  So they had to do something that a regular phone on a regular cell  network could send this data. Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yes. And here's the question.  If you instead now have the option to use a different data  stream for sending a picture, you're not going to use email.  You're going to use MMS.  Could it possibly take a load off of AT&T's 3G network?  Could it end up distributing the data so that it's not such not so choked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they probably had to upgrade this control channel because this control  channel never was designed with this kind of traffic in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, on this real interesting topic, can we try to get,  does anybody there want to just make a short,  some short predictions about Steve Jobs on the September 9th announcement,  whether it's going to be there and what the announcement might be.  I think we speculated on this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So September 9th, Wednesday, Apple will be at the Urbibuenes Center for the Arts,  which they've used before for iPod launches. It's a very nice spot.  The event email that was sent out, the invitation, which I didn't get,  but others, did you get one Nicole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My colleague, Donald Bell, I've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get one John?  I didn't get one either.  Did you get one Dwight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  So we're all losers.  It makes sense.  So anyway, this invite, which I didn't get, but I noticed in GadgetCuts,  so I went to a Gadget page, has a woman dancing around a typical iPod ad fashion,  you know, the silhouette with the white headphones. And it says it's only,  it's still rock and roll to me.  It's only rock and roll or something.  Which by the way, is a Rolling Stones lyric.  I thought 9909 was all about the Beatles.  So anyway, we know it's going to be, it's going to be an iPod announcement.  Prediction, no way Steve Jobs shows up for an iPod announcement.  I agree.  You agree, Nicole? You're nodding your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree, but I would be a little disappointed, I think,  I think because we're all waiting to see Steve Jobs show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't invited. I'm going to be sitting outside.  Saying, Hey, did Steve, Hey Steve, did Steve show up? Hey, were you in there?  Was there, was Steve Jobs in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do agree though, that they're saving Steve for the yet unknown tablet announcement.  Maybe, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one of the things that they had, they have to concern themselves with.  They, you know, unless Steve bulks up a little bit,  Steve himself will distract from the announcement.  That's true.  Because all you're going to get is speculation about his health again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you may not want to even show up at the tablet announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless he bulks up. I mean, you know,  maybe they could shoot him up with something and make some kind of chubby for  a day or two and he'd go in there, come on there and pump it up.  You know, something could happen.  I mean, it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Steve Jobs is healthy and well and working on this new tablet from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, you know, that would probably invite even more, you know,  that whatever Steve did, because he's been away so long,  even if he comes back looking great,  that's going to create a whole nother buzz about Steve.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're smart, you, you, you show up as Steve Jobs at somebody else's event.  You show up at the Windows 7 launch and steal the thunder from Windows 7.  He could come to my house party. Steve, Steve, you're invited.  Come to my house party. We'll serve chopped liver. We'll serve liver pet.  No, no, no, he won't eat liver. Oh, wait a minute. What kind of a joke is that?  It's awful. That was awful. Who told that was terrible?  No, no, he's a vegetarian. We'll serve all. He's a vegan. Yeah.  Let's get it right. He's from Vegas. We'll serve all.  All Vegas food all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is mostly shrimp from what I can tell. Really? Vegan is not shrimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shrimp has a face. Oh, Vegas is shrimp. Yeah.  Vegas is shrimp and beef. So Dwight, you didn't weigh in on this.  Will Jobs show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that I don't think he will. But with one caveat, you know,  this is kind of a, in terms of Apple's products, it's a light event.  You know, it's not a Mac. It's not a, it's not the tablet.  It's not the iPhone. And maybe if they like, don't want to stress him out too much,  they might, you know, bring him out for this. Or even possibly. Right, right.  This would be easy.  All right. I'm going to ask the chat room. This is our,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is our famous chat room poll where the chat room gets to tell us yes or no.  Will Steve Jobs show up on 9909 for the big,  what we presume is an iPod announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what you mean by show up is going to show up on the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. Not just in the back of the room. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, he will. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes. Yes. Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no. Unless the Beatles come. This is funny to watch.  Now here's an interesting 42. Somebody said 42. Don't care is another one.  Now here's an interesting question.  If there is a chance he would show up if it's a Beatles announcement and Ringo  and Paul show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Paul's a vegan.  That's right. He doesn't need anything with a face either.  So, uh, that's an interesting speculation. Okay. So this is my speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is it. 9909 Beatles, right? Number nine, number nine.  It's the day the Beatles rock band comes out.  It's the day the mono remixes of the Beatles CDs come out.  It is, uh,  Beatles iPod.  Well, if the Beatles have never been available on digital download,  what if Apple says we have an exclusive digital download exclusive,  uh, on iTunes for through the rest of the year,  the only place you'll be able to digital download these remixes of the new of the  Beatles stuff. And ladies and gentlemen, to tell us all about it,  Paul and Ringo and Steve.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that just about a month ago, didn't a month ago, didn't we,  didn't the Beatles say that the, uh,  negotiations for digital rights are still ongoing.  They were ongoing. Yeah. So I don't think,  I think that that was a signal that it's not, it's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. That was a, that was a red herring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you not? What, what negotiations for crying out loud,  release the damn things. Everybody's downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the fact that they haven't announced it yet.  You can say they're ongoing when in fact it's been a done deal,  but it hasn't been announced. So it's still something is still ongoing.  I think it's just weasel words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, John, not John, no, John didn't show up anywhere.  Paul and Ringo showed up, Paul and Ringo showed up at a Microsoft event at  E3, remember to announce Beatles rock band.  So that's not unheard of that if Microsoft could afford him,  that he might show up at another event. They might show up in an event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the question is whether they're going to even release the Beatles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  digitally, right? Right. That's what we were saying is that that deal has not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have it on pretty good authority that the Beatles stuff is going to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's gotta be the case. And now if you're Steve jobs,  you want to show up for that and you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if John, you're right. If Paul McCartney and Ringo and got, you know,  maybe, uh, you know, what if Yoko shows?  Well, then it's, there you go. Steve's got a Marrior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yoko shows. I'm not going. That's why they didn't invite me.  Cause Yoko was going to be there. You know,  I would then be really hurt if that I didn't get invited. If the Beatles,  the remaining Beatles showed up, I would, I'm now going to be hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Although would they show up at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts?  It is a smaller venue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They showed up at E freaking three, talk about a small venue.  It was in an aircraft hangar. Now here's my theory. I think,  I think this is taken off of what, what was it John who said this,  that Steve does not want to make his appearance be the story.  He's not going to be, he's going to have to show up somewhere where it's not,  it doesn't matter if his, if, if his health overshadows the story,  the iPods absolutely are that kind of announcement, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The announcement has to be big enough to overshadow it. I guess.  It has to be a big enough announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It won't overshadow it, but it's not the end of the world. Even if it does it.  Right. So what? There's new iPods. Big deal. What? That's not a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Steve could get a hold of,  remember the talking heads in that one video they did where we were that big  giant suit. Yeah.  Cause Steve could get a hold of that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop making sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have some.  That's bulking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  No, that makes anybody look skinny. If I'd look like I was dying in that suit,  the giant suit. Let me see if I can find that. Stop making, I think I've,  I think it's here.  Doesn't look that giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a big giant suit. I think it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that maybe he wasn't wearing a suit.  Type in giant suit for the.  What am I going to get if I do a search for giant suit?  What kind of weird stuff am I going to get? Giant suit.  Let me look. Giant suit. I'll do talking. Hey, oh no, David Byrne,  giant suit, right? David Byrne, giant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just hoping people tag things properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just pray. Here it is.  A giant Japanese armored mech.  No, nothing. I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat room must have a link to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they'll send us something. It has to be from the concert, right?  Cause that's where he was. No, it was the movie. It was in the movie.  Yeah, who cares? I'm done. I'm over it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're done. What's the next story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the next story? Moving on.  Moving on.  Moving on.  Let's see.  Did I mention that Microsoft's going to be able to sell Microsoft Word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you did. You mentioned that. That's the one, two, three, four times so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spider-Man is now a Disney property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody but me, can I do a little editorializing here?  Yes.  So, you know, Disney used to be the family friendly and all this other kind of  thing. And then some years ago they changed Tomorrowland from kind of a  looking forward, kind of a cool place with the Monsanto House of the Future,  you know, which today would be, you know, some sort of roundup thing.  And then kind of a bright, cheery future.  And then they changed it in the Disneyland and Anaheim to this kind of  grim, kind of dysfunctional looking dystopia, kind of creepy, you know,  based on, you know, things like Mad Max, you know, or thing, you know,  that kind of grim future.  And now instead of these happy characters, which we've all been used to seeing,  you know, the dwarves running around and they, you know,  the crazy mad hatter and all this stuff.  Now we've got these incredibly creepy adult cartoon characters,  which basically would scare little kids.  Spider-Man?  No, Spider-Man.  Well, Spider-Man is kind of creepy, but the rest of them, you know, the big,  these are not things that little kids are going to warm up to.  They're not warm and it's not Bambi we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, two words.  Yeah.  Mickey Hulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh, he's green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But doesn't Disney own Miramax and like Pixar?  I mean, Miramax is fairly adult.  That's true.  Pixar is not adult per se, but you know, he has pretty good content.  It's not necessarily just for kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're saying it's smart diversification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Marvel, they spent four billion in stocking cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, seems a little bit overvalued.  Four billion dollars is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how much movie do these, how much money these Marvel movies make?  They're doing very, very well.  Aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.  What do they make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The X-Men movies, X-Men, Hulk, Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, all of these are doing  that really, really well, I think.  I don't know if four billion dollars well, but that's what, I mean, Disney's  a movie company nowadays.  It really, if you think about Pixar, Miramax, Disney has really become a movie company.  And if you're a movie company owning the rights to all those Marvel characters, we  seem to have an insatiable appetite for superhero movies.  It's getting to be that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, are you losing weight, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just wasting, wasting away.  Why do I look thinner?  Do you say, I think I look thinner.  Do you think I look good?  Yeah.  It's, you know, maybe I'm, I don't know.  I don't think I'm actually losing weight.  I just think I'm getting old.  You know how you get old and drawn and everything starts?  I've heard of it.  Yeah.  You think so?  Oh gosh, I'm liking this.  We're going to have you guys back.  So I know what I was thinking of when you were talking about Anna and an  anniversary or a date, there is a debate and I'm very curious what you guys  think about some media outlets were saying, in fact, my wife came to me on  Wednesday. She said, you know, it's the 40th anniversary of the Internet.  I said, what?  Yeah, that's a good story.  How did I miss that?  Well, it isn't.  That's how I missed it.  That is why you didn't miss it.  It isn't.  For some reason, I guess because Symantec did a press release or something.  Media outlets have decided September 2nd is the 40th anniversary of the day the  Internet was invented.  In fact, not even close.  Leonard Kleinrock, who ought to know better, says on his site it was October 29th,  1969, when that famous first message was transmitted to SRI from two computers in  SRI in Menlo Park.  Yeah, but wait.  But wait, there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the first use of what was already in place, which had to be in place before  that message was sent.  And before it was in place, it had to have been conceived and invented.  Thus, the Internet itself in terms of the way it was conceived, is that the...  This is like being born.  You know, if you're being born, your birthday is not when you first start crying or  when you say, mom, it's when you were born.  Is that really the date of the Internet's birth?  Well...  We should be celebrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, here's the thing.  We're talking about conception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, come on now, let's not get in that debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other debate are we going to get in?  Concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Internet was conceived.  On Kleinrock's website, he says that they were using ARPANET.  Now, do you consider ARPANET the birth of the Internet?  Because ARPANET is even older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But did ARPANET use TCPIP, which is the protocol for the Internet?  He says on September 2nd, 1969, his team exchanged meaningless data over the ARPANET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing has changed.  It's just like they do today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We sent a Viagra ad.  It's YouTube.  Yeah.  It's been 40 years.  Oh, it's Twitter account, the first Twitter.  I had pancakes for breakfast.  But on October 29th, they sent an actual message.  Why did it take so long?  I mean, that's two months later, practically.  Because they didn't know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, the guy sitting right across the room, hey, can I send you a message?  What?  You just tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the first message message, according to this, they were trying to log in to one  computer from the other, but they only got the first two letters, L-O, and then the  system crashed.  So the first...  Sounds like a joke there somewhere.  It sounds like Windows.  So the first message on the Internet was L-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Low.  Low.  Low.  Low.  Low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then we were able to do a log in an hour later.  So what is the official birthday of the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to have to do a poll.  We're going to have to talk to Vansurf and all these other Internet old timers.  No.  And they're all going to give us different dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, who's definitive on this?  The Wikipedia.  Let's ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikipedia will know.  Wikipedia.  They'll know.  Yeah, that'll give us a ballpark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Wikipedia.  First two nodes that would become the ARPAnet were interconnected between UCLA and  SRI, UCLA and of course, in Los Angeles, SRI in Menlo Park, California, October  29th, 1969.  That was the first connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So would that be the first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not the conception, John C. Devorak.org slash blog.  It's just the first connection.  But that's even wrong according to Kleinrock, because they sent data two  months earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well then we're being scammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to know when to get the cake.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the 29th.  I'd vote for the 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we just do the whole year as the Internet year.  It is the Internet year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the 40th Internet year.  So we got Woodstock.  It's interesting, isn't it?  Woodstock and the Internet, the same age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's an it is an interesting coincidence.  Really?  What else was taking place then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  1969, Richard M.  Nixon was inaugurated a president in 1969.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sixty nine, sixty nine.  What a great year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you doing?  The Manson murders.  The Manson murders.  There you go.  What were you doing, John, in 1969?  Were you at Cal then?  It's hard to say.  He doesn't want to admit it.  You'd graduated already, I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me think.  Were you working?  It was kind of a blur.  I so long ago.  I was lucky to be alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was in I think I was in eighth or ninth grade in 1969.  I was 13.  Yeah, we're the same age, Dwight.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apollo 11 returned from the first successful moon landing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because the moon landing.  That's right. The moon landing.  Moon landing was a nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the moon.  There's a lot of things that happened in 69.  Who knew it was such a great year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think anybody, including Kleinrock, Vint Cerf, Bob Metcalf,  all the people involved in this these early days of the Internet  had any idea what they were creating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, of course not.  No idea.  No, they're just having fun.  They have a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lick lighter was working at the Pentagon and he  his issue, as I remember from and by the way, Katie,  Katie Hafner has a great book where wizards stay up late.  That talks about all this.  You know, I have that book.  I should see what she says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But she talks about, you know, what that does is she probably give you another date.  She probably would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She probably would.  But she talks about the fact that was it.  I think it was like lighter who was in a Pentagon office  and he had two computers right next to each other.  They could talk to each other.  And he said, we ought to spend some money  figuring a way that two different makes of computers could talk to one another.  And they went to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then he went to lap link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, lap link.  I had one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Al Gore was not there at any time.  No, no.  I don't know what Al was doing at the time.  Big VMware conference was this week.  In fact, we've had a couple of visitors who were there at the VMware conference.  And it's interesting because on on one hand,  the New York Times says that VMware is maybe Microsoft's top rival after Google.  On the other hand, Paul Therotte was saying, boy, I mean, these are  this is a company that just that the lights are out.  They just haven't realized it yet.  You know, it often happens in technology that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're talking about VMware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. He thinks that Microsoft's Hyper-V is just going to, you know, steamroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody I, you know, I've gotten both sides of that argument,  but most of the people I talk to that seem to be in the know  say that the VMware code is at least two to three years ahead of anything  Microsoft's doing in Microsoft's the company that's clueless.  And if history proves us correct, I would take that bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But remember, Paul Maritz is is the CEO at VMware,  former senior executive at Microsoft, who was actually the number three guy there.  And he also lured away another Microsoft guy, Todd Nielsen.  He's the CEO.  What do you think Simon's here for the VMware?  He's from London. What do you think, Simon, Microsoft or VMware?  Who's going to win this one in virtualization?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Enterprise level, VMware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says enterprise level VMware all the way.  SMB market.  Hyper-V is going to going to be a good contender there.  So it's a horse race, in other words, is a very close horse race.  Interesting.  OK, well, now that I put everybody to sleep, I think maybe we should.  That would do it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  VMware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you saved that one for last so that you'd all have a good night's sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talk about the intricacies of PHP next.  Coming right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Dane, my my wonderful right hand here and my left hand, really.  I mean, the guy really.  What are you doing with your own hands?  Oh, you know, keep them busy.  He he says we should do a web design show.  And I keep saying, Dane, you know, I just don't.  I don't think the intricacies of PHP are really ready for prime time.  I just can't. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to get four columns with CSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  I don't think that's going to be a good podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can call it this week.  Barely a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week, Thwip Thwip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Skype was sold.  Anybody care eBay?  But here's a here's an example of just corporate malfeasance.  Every time Meg Whitman came on, stumping for  Senator McCain.  I thought this is not the person you bring on  to say what great executive abilities John McCain has.  This woman.  But look what she did with eBay.  She spent three point one billion dollars on Skype and didn't.  Wasn't she gone by the time she got on?  All right. So I won't give her.  I think so. Whoever did it, whoever was running eBay,  but bought Skype for three point one billion and talk about dummy contract.  The Skype guys who are obviously brilliant said, well, yeah, we'll sell you the company.  We just won't sell you the core technology of Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do it in Swedish. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on. They're not Swedish.  They're from Holland.  So they said, it's very similar.  We will sell you the core technology of Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually pretty good for three point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for three. I'll tell you what.  For Dutch and the Dutch, by the way, it's kind of got a little German.  Yeah, it's a little German Scandinavian mix.  I'll tell you what, the Dutch are the best businessmen in the world, I think.  They're very sharp business, but they invented the stock market  in like the 1600s.  Yeah, for tulips, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't even live on any real land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't. They borrowed their land from the sea.  And they still aren't giving it back anyway.  So the Dutch, she said to Skype, well, we could sell you Skype to eBay.  We just have your Skype.  But for five billion dollars, you get everything.  And in eBay, well, no, that's a little that's a little high.  Well, for three point one billion, we give you everything  except for this little tiny bit here, this stuff.  This is just code. You don't need this.  OK, we'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty much the deal in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the deal, man.  We get everything except that little ball of code.  Yes, you get everything. OK.  So they give them three point one billion dollars.  Now, a couple of years later, the founders of Skype are saying,  you guys are stupid.  We want we're not going to let you do this anymore.  We're going to get our code back.  We don't you know, you can't operate it without this little ball of code.  And we're taking a ball and we're going  and basically jeopardizing Skype unless you let us buy it back.  So they got an investment company to buy back.  Skype, one point nine billion in cash.  eBay keeps 35 percent.  That values the company at two point seven five billion.  So, hey, you know, three hundred million here, their big deal.  And this invention, this investment group,  which reminds me this reminds me a lot, John, of when Ziff Davis  was sold to Forstman Little.  These guys, these investment groups don't want to hold it, right?  They're going to pass it along, make a little money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just jugglers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It includes the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.  Mark Andreessen's new startup, this guy who wrote Netscape, Andreessen Horowitz,  Silver Lake and Index Ventures.  They put in that one point nine billion dollars in cash.  I think this is preparatory, don't you think, to passing it on  to the Skype founders originally, and they're going to get it back.  They'll get to keep 500 million, you know, half a billion here or there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big deal. And now they're happy.  Does the presence of Andreessen mean anything in this?  I mean, he might he do anything more interesting with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has such a, you know, this is diluted amongst all these guys.  You think he has? Yeah.  It's just money for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole thing is weird.  Yeah. I mean, so I ran into  Meg Whitman's campaign manager yesterday.  She's running for governor, isn't she?  Yes, she is. Yeah.  And of course, she got into trouble by praising that guy  that just quit the Obama administration.  So they put out a bunch of fires about that.  But they're very serious.  Really? I don't think I don't see anybody beating Jerry Brown, but, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry, you think Jerry Brown is going to make it as governor again?  Yeah. The real question is, why would anybody want to be governor of California?  It's the worst job in the world. You have no power.  Everybody blames you for everything, even though you can do nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But Jerry Brown seems to relish that sort of thing.  He was also the mayor of Oakland, as you recall.  Oh, another bad. Same kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, he she she.  I mean, he has nothing to lose.  I mean, he's already she was CEO of eBay through March 2008.  I think she did preside over the she did do that.  She did do this guy.  She did really. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, you have a point then.  Yeah. I mean, that's not what I would call a good executive.  She bought the dummy contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. OK.  Title for this episode, Leo, the dummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
