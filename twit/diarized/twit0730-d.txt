I don't know what pronoun they use  We'll let you know about that, but we're really excited so thank you everybody for putting up with a little bit of inside  twit as we get under  Way, I don't know what to talk about today  Apple's third quarter results they made some money shocking big surprise  I love what Jason Snell does and he always  Does these color graphs?  Total app and revenue now you see that drop, but you also see it's a spiky thing and in fact the revenue isn't bad considering  It's a what Apple calls QQ 3 I think  Their big quarter is of course in September it'll be next quarter when the iPhone comes out  So this is this is the quarter before the iPhone  I think the big story is service revenue, which we knew was going up went up a lot  It's now 21% in fact if you look at this pie chart  What's really interesting is the iPhone for the first time in a long time is less than half of Apple's total revenue

Start time: 373.90
End time: 411.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a that's a pretty big deal  So long and that is of course what folks who were looking for a story kind of latched on to here  I mean that is a big deal and  It kind of speaks to what we've seen as the narrative of Apple going forward where we're not seeing as much money from the iPhone  Where we're having a look into in other places Apple has been saying services services services  Non-stop in their earnings reports for quite some time now  And so it's no surprise to me that we're seeing 21% of the revenue coming from that  But I think that the bigger story here and the thing that other people were kind of paying attention to is

Start time: 411.64
End time: 425.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wearables accounts for quite a bit. It's now wearables for Apple is not just wearables. It's the home  Home pod. It's the air pod  It's a bunch of it's kind of a catch-all for it's almost should be called other rather. Yeah, I think so

Start time: 425.72
End time: 456.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what's interesting? Yeah, what's interesting about wearables is these are accessories to iPhone?  so they they've monetized the heck out of iPhones they they made you know, they  Apple is what it is today because of iPhones and now as iPhones kind of plateau and even decline a little bit the  Accessories to iPhones are doing great stuff for them  And then the next big thing I think which is gonna be way huger than people think is the Apple credit card  Which it's not going to services services, but I think the potential there is gigantic. Yeah, I don't think it's next month

Start time: 456.30
End time: 471.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's soon. I think it's any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but it's but it's not just for the iPhone. I think that's Mac too. Well, no, no, I don't even mean  It's not just Apple stuff. That's the one thing is that we cease we see Siri  We see Apple kind of diversifying here where they are reaching out to sort of offer their services on third parties  So we've got these smart TVs now that work with with  Home kit that work with airplay to and have Apple TV  They'll have Apple TV app built-in Apple is no longer. Well in in some cases  It's no longer especially with its services trying to play in this walled garden  And I think that's because the company kind of knows hey, we've got to look at other ways to make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so they don't think this a  Cyclical effect with the hardware because I want to say about three years ago  We were saying that about the iPad and we were it was dying right, you know, but now  Phones are a little more more robust now and you have a lot more longevity  So why do you have to spend a thousand dollars every two years four years aunt?

End time: 639.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which really pisses me off the pixel four isn't gonna have the dedicated wide-angle lens either  But it'll have solely which is kind of cool  Soly tell me that's soly what's soly is radar that shoots out from the top of the phone that enables in-the-air gestures and  Also face recognition. So unlike the iPhone which when you swipe it it recognize your face and turns on the pixel four  You just pick it up and it turns on you don't have to swipe anything. So it's way easier

Start time: 640.42
End time: 652.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No more swiping allegedly, but but it also this is the one where we're gonna look like idiots going like this  We are we are Leo to our phones. We are waving and we're dancing semaphores  I

Start time: 678.56
End time: 700.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's cool about solely is we've seen a lot of technologies that come out for in-the-air gestures they haven't really taken off  Some have been sort of built into laptops. Some have been, you know standalone devices magic leap one of those companies  Yeah, not magically, but there's another one. I forgot what it's called. It's leap motion or something  Leap motion is the one Apple bought that does hand gestures didn't really come take off because it didn't come from Apple or Google

Start time: 700.78
End time: 714.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have one in my closet. It's like I never used it was dopey. Yeah, I know motion. Yeah, no the  See, this is the confusing there's the leap  Magic leap is the one you wear in your eyes  The leap motion is that little lozenge you put between your keyboard and the screen

Start time: 723.18
End time: 739.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say one thing that's interesting is is Google apparently and they've been pretty open about the pixel for this time around  Isn't gonna use a notch. You're just gonna have a fairly big bezel up at the top  Like all these cameras there's multiple cameras there's solely there's the projector for the face recognition

Start time: 739.14
End time: 749.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're gonna put a lot of stuff a lot there, but not a wide-angle lens  So they're gonna do the wide angle sort of in software. It's gonna be slightly wider  The selfie cameras can be slightly wider than the one in the front

Start time: 749.62
End time: 765.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm like the current pixel Google is proven proven is pretty strong when it comes to to computational photography  So I don't mind that they're not putting that extra lens in there if they can figure out from an AI  Stand a lot with a single lens in the pixel 3. That's that's what you use right? Yeah, that's a great camera

Start time: 765.78
End time: 807.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was pleasantly surprised. I was visiting the Google campus in San Francisco  One of my friends works there and she took some photos of us, you know, just what their phone  And yeah, I didn't say the name yeah, you know why  And I she sent me the Google Photos library link or whatever and those photos looked incredible and  I don't know. There's just something about being able to snap and boop and be done with it versus with my iPhone  Yes, it might make the more accurate photo  But I'm not necessarily after the accurate photo because I'm gonna end up hitting that edit do this this this and this right into it  I kind of like the computational if it's gonna give me a photo that I'd like to share immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what the pixel. Yeah, I have to say we we went to the  Peruvian the Inca ruins Machu Picchu a couple of years ago and I brought a 360 degree camera  I brought my Canon with mark 4  With all the lenses I brought all this stuff. We got up at sunrise  You carried all that heavy stuff all right the one best picture I got was a pixel 2. Yeah, it was  Far and away the best picture of Machu Picchu. Well, here's the other thing

Start time: 884.92
End time: 901.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the killer feature of the pixel 3 is the  The ability to take pictures when people smile or do things like that  So one of the things I do is we do as we're traveling around  We do a lot of things with various people who are cooking and make stuff like that  I just set it up and get it going and forget about it right after we're done

Start time: 901.86
End time: 910.99

I want them to frown

Start time: 937.06
End time: 961.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing. I mean, I think the point is because I carry a Sony a7 III as well  Sometimes a high-end cameras takes a better shot and sometimes the phone takes a better shot depends on the light the context their situation  You can whip a phone out and take a picture just like that  Whereas you can't get your regular camera out fast enough, right?  So I use both all the time and sometimes the better shot is one and sometimes it's the other. Yeah, gotta have both

Start time: 962.40

Transcript:  Yeah, I thought the most interesting number Tim Cook or Tim Apple is Tim Apple  Tim Apple brought up at the quarterly event is the R&D spending  Which is through the roof Apple's been criticized for years for not spending enough on R&D  They are spending enough for R&D the largest proportion of revenue and R&D since 2003. It's an all-time high  They spent four point two billion dollars in the quarter  Seven point nine percent of its total revenue and they're on pace to spend sixteen billion dollars this year sixteen billion  What are they spending it on?

Transcript:  One of the interesting think a lot of this the bulk of this is Apple saying we're gonna make all our chips  We're gonna do arm chips. We're gonna do 5g radios. We're gonna do it all that's got to be expensive  Is that what most of this money's being I do and I think I think the larger theme is that they're trying to do things

Transcript:  That other companies can't do because they've they've learned that you know, they come out these laptops  Trust Intel and  Let them down it's so that's exactly true and and it's so difficult for them to differentiate in this market because the copycats  Coming out of China and elsewhere are really just sort of muddy the waters in terms of you know  And so they want to be able to do by the way, not just for Apple for every business. That's right in America  That's true  But they want to do they want to be able to differentiate in a way that's really clear  And so the way to do that is through technology one one interesting thing about  R&D spending that I love mentioning because it's always a shocker to people the number one spender on R&D is  Amazon by far they spend far more than Apple. Yeah, you think wow, what's a bookstore?  Do you know obviously they're doing more than a bookstore?

I love this guy euro euro is the solution to your Wi-Fi  Woes if you're thinking about Wi-Fi at all, you're thinking too much Wi-Fi should just work  You should just open up your breakfast computer and you're online  Right you head to the job and you're using your bathroom computer. You're online  The problem is we're we're asking so much more of Wi-Fi now because we have all these devices Internet of Things devices  We've got neighbors with Wi-Fi causing interference. It used to be Wi-Fi would just work of late  Wi-Fi has been a hassle. That's when euro came along and I just love it  They created the whole concept of a mesh system for your home  fast reliable Wi-Fi eliminating poor coverage eliminating dead spots  Eliminating buffering you'll have a strong signal whenever you need it one of the things euro does that's so interesting  It's is the bandwidth shaping so if it says oh, you're watching Netflix in the bedroom  You're gonna need those packets in sequence  But the kid is only reading email or he's playing fortnight  It actually shapes your bandwidth no more complaints of the Xbox not getting a signal that your security cameras offline when you need it and  It's so easy to set up now  We've got we've had mesh systems and enterprise for a long time  But it took an IT professional to set them up to configure my know and you've done that. It's a we're using  Stuff here that you've got a I mean, it's crazy requires Java to set up. It's crazy  Euro you get a great euro app you plug in the euro base unit  You put the beacons where you think the Apple say no no closer farther  It'll help you set it up  And then the app is also great too because you can manage your Wi-Fi you can see what has happening  You see how many devices are on your network?  I have Nero set up that when a new device joins my network I get a ping  So I'll see a new Apple devices just join the network and I can see if that's what's supposed to be or not  It's yeah, they're in the house. You could pause the Wi-Fi. We do this  I assign every unit that comes into our house to  Either Lisa or me or our kid Michael and if I want I can even do this with Amazon's echo  I could say echo pause Michaels Wi-Fi and then we wait and we hear  It's great, it's so satisfying  What that's power maybe that's power  You can share your Wi-Fi very easily with a QR code  It has a guest network and the other thing I really like about the euro is euro plus when you buy the euro you get  a I think you get a year as part of your deal  but I pay for I just renewed it because  Euro plus does so many things you can have a block ads block malware  You know, this is a really something every house should have email with attachments malware attachments. They get blocked  We have family safe browsing so I could say Michaels devices. No adult sites. No violent sites. No gambling sites  This is really high quality scanning. It does a great job  It also secures the traffic with encryption when WPA 3 comes out euros already said we're gonna support it  You're never gonna get complaints about the Wi-Fi again. You won't have to think about the Wi-Fi again. That's why we use zero  That's why I set my mom up with the euro. I can even monitor her network from my phone here  So if mom has problems, I can go see her Wi-Fi network and say mom you got to move that device or whatever  No more gambling sites for you mom  never think about Wi-Fi again and get yours fixed as soon as  Tomorrow go I know you want it  So now go to e er o.com euro comm slash twit if you use the offer go twit at checkout  You'll get free overnight shipping with your order  Eero dot com slash twit and enter twit at checkout to get your euro delivered with free overnight shipping. We love euro  You will to euro dot com  Slash twit we thank them so much for making our show possible. Thank you euro  While we're talking about those voice assistants there was some actually good news  It's kind of funny because you and I were talking about this on iOS today, Micah  It came out first that Amazon if you use the echo  Third party people might be listening and it turns out this is what every voice assistant does  Because this is how they improve it right they take a percentage a small percentage of the recordings and have humans say well  Does that match have to train it you have to train it. So then we heard Google  Oh, yeah, we do it too. And then recently Apple came out  Although you say that the original article named Apple, but nobody paid attention to the Guardian wrote an article about it  Like three weeks later, but then they paid attention. Well now Apple Google and Amazon have all said, okay  We're gonna give you ways to turn it off apples actually said we're no longer gonna use humans to grade  And the reason that was an issue  I think it's not unreasonable to think that they're gonna do that for training but the reason  It was an issue is this ever had you use voice assistants?  I do every now and then well, and is every now and then one of them wake up for no apparent reason true  My Siri does my home hub is always talking. Yeah, and the problem is that means it heard something it thought was hey shlomo  all right, hey  you know who and  Started recording and sending it back and then try to interpret it that  Those are some of the recordings that might be sent to humans. Yeah, and who knows what that heard right like a passionate tryst. I

So and and it's and it's true of all of them and the fix is very simple  They just make it opt-in if you want, you know  As you're setting it up or whatever they're gonna say  Do you mind if we do this XYZ some browsers already do that and you just choose yes or no and that's the end  Of it and it'll be fine

Okay, III's remove the file, but the data is still  circulating  Capital one they caught the woman who did it and what's still unknown is exactly what she did  It looks like from the indictment  she had somehow got an account a  service account for capital one and  so  That means and so this is the question capital one says no, no, no, we encrypt all that data but  Yes, what was it 200,000 credit cards? I mean social security numbers were were late something like that  Well, how did they have the social security numbers? Well, this is the question  I've been reading up a little bit from different security experts and their guesses one way a lot of companies in  Quote and I'm gonna put this in air quotes encrypt. They do a hard drive encryption  But if you have an account if you have a customer service account, you're in it's not encrypted  Exfiltrate the whole thing and it's thought maybe that's what happened. Yeah what they're supposed to do what they should do, but it's hard  It's complex. It slows down. Everything is end-to-end encryption  individual encryption of every bit of data

It should not have been permitted to run  Including talking to the metadata data. That's where she got credentials once. She got the credentials.

Yeah, but as a result  Many of our devices are just saying hey, I'm here. What you hey hello. Hello. We should try I should try it right now  It actually made it really hard to pair my helmet phone I couldn't even find a list was so long  So here's the issue according to hex way  If you have an appropriate software to take a look at what's going on an attacker  Could they're they're only gonna initially get some limited information about your phone number  But they could if they see your phone number more than once and get that hash more than once recover the phone number  They can get other information your iPhone talks about what operating system the phone status  Wi-Fi status in there too not the IMEI.

It's a developer  Feature and it's an app that you can get in the app store that sets up  Helps you go around and set up beacons in a place so they have not get gotten rid of that  It's just sort of been buried  I think for a little while while they were getting all this figured out because even in this article it talks about how  Older devices do not do this. No, this is modern. Yeah, and so this is a convenience  Yes, exactly that the batteries can finally kind of take it the Bluetooth version that they have etc  But beacons are I think we're going to continue to see more of those especially as these indoor maps  Continue to yeah different places.

There's a UK company called AI bar  That when you walk into the bar  I guess the idea is they're gonna they're gonna paint a strip on the floor or something that says stand  Here if you want to be recognized  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well if you don't well the point is if you didn't want to you could stand outside that zone  But you're ain't gonna get served because the way this works is the AI bar  Recognizes your face and adds you to the queue. Oh, here comes Micah  And if it knows your drink again, it will have you drink ready again. That's good  It will charge you automatically the bartender can change it  If you want you want to you could say remove me from your database the bartender could do that  But the idea and honestly, this is what a good bartender does right recognizes you says I'll have you makes you feel good  He keeps track. He's been a lot of money. Yeah  Lot of money a survey commissioned by data spark as 2,000 drinkers  A lot of money what their biggest complaint is about bars. What do you think?

Transcript:  All right, so that's I think that's I don't think this is a problematic use of face recognition  The company says we don't store these more than 24 hours  That would be potentially a problem like well  We see Leo at the bar every night and that gets sent to the insurance company. That's not good

Start time: 3701.56
End time: 3728.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this this actually mirrors another company that I'm writing about for face for for fast company actually  Called patron scans one of the companies I'm writing about  And what they do is they they card your card when you walk in they can recognize hundreds of different IDs  They can tell if you're old enough or the fake ID whether it's been used before  But you can be blacklisted by the bar and when you're blacklisted by the bar, you're blacklisted by all the bars  Whoa, you know, they use patron scan and they got into trouble in California

It's actually a Canadian company in there in the UK US and Australia  If you're banned in Detroit, you can't get a drink in the UK because it's part of the system  No, I got no problem with that  Okay, but but somebody has a bad breakup and they put their girlfriend on the on the list  Well, that would be blacklisted for life from all bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So positive ID is going to be trivially easy  but recently wrote a column about this because there's a lot of confusion in the enterprise space about whether  companies should embrace face recognition for authentication and  Authorization and my take is yes all these controversies about the consumer use of with controls  Well, there's a difference between so that people are like San Francisco and three other cities have banned face recognition by the police  And it's because face recognition is biased basically it it it it

Start time: 3844.32
End time: 3904.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly and and companies are coming along with that and there's a  Woman who's been driving this and her research?  I think she's in the UK has been influencing companies like Microsoft and Apple and Google not Amazon  but  This is a totally separate discussion from whether this is good authentication technology within an enterprise for access to various areas for  Digital access to to certain databases, etc. It's a totally separate thing  So I say if you're in the enterprise space, which I know a lot of the listeners are and a lot of viewers are  Go for it these these these controversies aren't you worried about consumer backlash? There is a consumer backlash  But again, I think the consumer backlash is about  Bias, it's about harvesting people people's faces without their permission  It's not about employees working in sensitive with sensitive business data  We're trying to get access to like the clean room, etc. Etc. That's a totally separate thing  And I think that's a legitimate and valuable use for face recognition  So that's my two cents. You got a separate.

Start time: 6499.50
End time: 6657.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all I don't know squat one password your last pass password and it does the rest effect. It generates long strong  Unique passwords for every time you sign it's the first thing I install on any new phone any new laptop any new computer. It's  Kind of the key to my whole life  The number one most preferred password manager at home and work and they are now doing something really exciting  They're they're kind of thinking about the future of authentication  Right pass. Well, look first of all passwords terrible idea  Nobody watch crazy, right?  Part of the reason we have problems with passwords is because everybody has to remember a whole bunch  You got to make them easy to remember, but then they're not secure  It's just crazy. They use the same one over and over. Let's get rid of passwords  So last pass is now they're introducing this in their enterprise app  you guys by the way, because you're now twit employees you'll be using the  Last pass enterprise and you'll see these new features before you see a pretty seem in the rest of the versions  I think it's really exciting. It's a new business lineup. Nice. So one thing you do a single sign-on  So here's the challenge for our IT department for administrators for the boss of any business is  You want to make your stuff more secure?  You're giving employees the keys to the kingdom the keys to the bank accounts the websites everything  So you want to make it secure? You don't want them to put it on a post-it note on them on the monitor  But at the same time employees resist because it's less convenient. It's a pain in the butt  That's right. Wouldn't it be cool if you could make it more secure and more convenient and that's where single sign-on is really  cool last pass enterprise is going to include single sign-on for  1200 plus  Integrated apps SAML integrated apps and more coming all the time each with its own getting started guide  So it'll be very easy for your employees  Single sign-on means they don't even need a password anymore  That they go to a site they log in or start the process it pops up on their phone. They say yes  That's me. They're in that's more secure than a password  They're also adding  Multi-factor authentication, we know two factors great MFAs even better because it not only leverages  you know a second factor maybe an authenticator, but it actually leverages your biometrics like your face your fingerprint and  Contextual factors your location your IP address  So it can verify with a variety of signals that you really are who you say you are and again no  Trouble to the user. It's convenient  It's great for admins they get a easy to manage dashboard that lets you know who's using what apps what logins there are  It is this is kind of the holy grail which is both more secure and more convenient

Well. That's one of the reasons we use last pass enterprise at twit  The other one is because we had an engineer who posted all the passwords on a website, but that's a story  I don't want to I don't want to get into it this time.
