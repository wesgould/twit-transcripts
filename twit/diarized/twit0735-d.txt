Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, let's talk security since we have Seth here.  Alex Stamos on Twitter this week.  Apple posted a response to,  I guess we should go back in time and talk about Google's zero-day blog,  publishing the story of an exploit, an iOS exploit,  that they uncovered in February, responsibly notified Apple about.  Apple fixed within a week.  Back in February, Google was a little coy in their original post.  They said they wouldn't say who the exploit took advantage of,  but they called it a mass exploit because it took advantage of a variety.  It was really a complex attack that took advantage of a variety of zero days in iOS 10, 11, 12,  four years worth of IOSs and was on websites.  So everybody who visited the website potentially with an iPhone was potentially hacked.  This Project Zero blog talked about how anybody in a sensitive subgroup  that might be under attack from a government would be a serious cause for concern.  Google was not saying who it was, but shortly thereafter, TechCrunch came out with a story.  I suspect they got briefed by Google that it was the Uighurs, Muslim majority in China.  It was the Chinese government that had perpetrated the track,  which kind of makes sense because it's such a complicated attack.  It's usually nation states.  And usually nation states use these zero days, which are very millions of dollars often to get.  They use them in targeted attacks on dissidents and individuals.  But in a way, this was a targeted attack.  It was on eight different sites that were Uighur news, sites that Uighurs would be likely to visit,  although anybody who visited them from anywhere in the world would have been open to this attack.  Apple wrote a response kind of slamming Google saying it wasn't an on mass attack.  So now that you know the background, let me read you the response,  the Twitter response from Alex Stamos, his former security officer at Yahoo, then at Facebook.  He now teaches security at Stanford.  He says he's a recovered CSO.  Apple's response to the worst known iOS attack in history should be graded somewhere between disappointing and disgusting.  First off, disputing Google's correct use of indiscriminate when describing a watering hole attack,  that is an attack on websites that attacks anybody who visits the website, smacks of, well, it's OK.  It didn't hit white people.  That might be going a little far.  The use of multiple exploits against an oppressed minority in an authoritarian state makes the likely outcomes terrible.  It's possible this data contributed to real people being re-educated or even executed.  Even if we accept Apple's framing that exploiting Uighurs isn't as big a deal as Google makes it out to be,  they have no idea whether these exploits were used by the People's Republic of China in more targeted situations.  Dismissing such a possibility out of hand is extremely risky.  The Uighursky then accuses Apple of not mentioning China because of the leverage China has over the world's most valuable public company.  To be fair, Google's post also didn't mention China.  But finally, the pivot to Apple's arrogant marketing is not only tone deaf, but really rings hollow to the security community.  When Google did all the heavy lifting here, I'm guessing we won't hear Tim talk about how they're going to do better on stage next week.  Since you cover security, we'll start with you Seth.  That was a lot of facts.  Yes, there's a lot in there.  Now I want to know what you think about it.  First of all, was Alex right?

Start time: 444.96
End time: 513.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I think Alex is right in this case? Absolutely.  I think security often winds up being sort of the brakes on a car for tech.  Security plays this role where it can allow tech to proceed even faster in some cases, but you still have to understand how to use the brakes.  I think it's long overdue that companies like Apple and Google, of course, have their sort of come to the guru moment and start taking this stuff more seriously.  One of the challenges is that it requires the security teams from these different companies to interact more and better.  In a situation like this where Google has an in-house sort of skunkworks team that has been for years finding zero days and giving the organizations that own those zero days relatively short amount of time to fix them.  90 days in most cases I think.

Start time: 513.00
End time: 515.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the normal time though. That's what they call responsible disclosure.

Start time: 516.04
End time: 521.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little bit faster and it sort of depends on really what it is that's being disclosed.

Start time: 521.00
End time: 524.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sometimes it's not easy to fix in 90 days. Exactly.  In this case, seven days, Apple fixed it.

Start time: 525.04
End time: 561.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple did fix it, which is great.  But having more transparency about the process and having more awareness among the people who are potentially being targeted.  I think one of the points that Alex makes that's really key here is that this is thought to have been used against the Uyghurs, who are for one thing being shuttled off into concentration camps in China right now.  It's a nasty situation.  Which is very bad.  Because of their religion basically.  Sure.  We don't know where else China has been using this exploit.  We don't know if anyone else has been using them either.

Start time: 562.46
End time: 566.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did Apple downplay the seriousness of this exploit?

Start time: 567.59
End time: 569.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From their statement, it looks like they did.  Yeah.

Start time: 571.04
End time: 606.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things they were upset about is that Google implied that, they said Google's post issued six months after Iowa's patches were released creates the false impression of mass exploitation to monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time.  This was never the case.  I think Apple was at great pains to tell the world, you're not being attacked.  Which I understand, but at the same time downplaying the real genuine danger to the people who were being attacked.  Harry?  Yeah, I mean, while Apple has a huge amount.  Put the microphone in front.  Yes, good idea.  I'm going to get you on mic.

Start time: 606.06
End time: 636.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple has a huge amount riding on the notion that the iPhone takes privacy more seriously than any other platform.  Yeah, they're the ones who are saying we're the most secure platform.  They literally run ads about this stuff and so they're not surprisingly really sensitive about stuff that might lead average consumers to believe that they aren't taking this seriously or asleep at the wheel.  I mean, it feels like you can read that into the comments they put out.

Start time: 637.06
End time: 642.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple accused Google of stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices have been compromised.  This was never the case.

Start time: 643.34
End time: 677.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's possible for something to be really serious even if it is likely that average consumers in the US were never targeted.  And I think also the fact that it's Google who discovered this and told the world about it probably plays a part.  This was discovered by Apple's principal competitor.  And there's absolutely no reason to think that the people at Google who discovered this have any vested interest in making Apple look bad.  But I imagine that played into Apple's reaction to it as well.  Yeah.

Start time: 678.46
End time: 692.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in fact, on MacBreak Weekly, we talked about it and Renee Richie said this is an attack by Google.  They conspicuously admit other Google vulnerabilities.  But this wasn't about that.  This was a standard kind of blog post about an exploit.

Start time: 693.00
End time: 724.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then another thing is the fact that this involves China, this incredibly important market for Apple.  But this all boils down to a human rights issue.  And I would have liked to see Apple acknowledge that in this response and having acknowledged that.  They could point out that this was pretty much targeted and does not mean that the iPhone is broken as a platform security wise.

Start time: 724.30
End time: 762.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's a pretty far bridge to take.  iPhone security is broken.  But for consumers to think that whether you're consumers in first world countries or whether you're consumers using third hand iPhones,  to think that because you're on an iPhone, you're secure is also nonsense.  And the marketing of security at Apple has been this is because we're privacy forward, we're also security forward.  And that hasn't always been the case.  And it's misleading to consumers.

Start time: 764.00
End time: 778.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would be more accurate for Apple and everybody else to say if you're a target, especially if you're a target of a nation state,  you're pretty vulnerable no matter what device you're using.  You shouldn't say, oh, I'm just going to use an iPhone and I don't have to worry. Right, Jason?

Start time: 779.96
End time: 785.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, certainly. This is also a similar argument like with Mac.  There are a lot of people that went.

Start time: 785.36
End time: 788.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use a Mac. I don't have to worry about viruses. I don't have to worry about malware.

Start time: 789.64
End time: 833.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. If you are targeted, you are vulnerable.  All of these platforms have zero days. They all have vulnerabilities.  And now the level of attacks that can access devices and target people are so sophisticated and so powerful that  it's a very vulnerable place to be for all of us.  And journalists, I want to point out, too, are increasingly being targeted for these kinds of things.  And so it's that does make it a scary time and a time where you have to be more careful than ever and more thoughtful than ever.

Start time: 834.00
End time: 846.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about Alex's, Stamos's implication, Jason, that Apple downplayed it because they have to be careful with China,  which is a very important market for them. Do you think that's the case?

Start time: 846.02
End time: 854.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. It's so hard to say. There's a lot of he said, I guess he said, she said, they said, they said.

Start time: 855.30
End time: 856.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no women involved at all.

Start time: 857.00
End time: 865.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. A lot of they said, they said in this.  You know, it's hard to find people's motivations and there's not a whole lot of breadcrumbs that lead us to one.

Start time: 867.34
End time: 888.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fair. I wouldn't want to impugn Project Zero's motivations, but I wouldn't want to impugn Apple's either.  I think Apple's real point with this release was to reassure the general public that you're not being attacked.  But it was a little tone deaf because a minority was being attacked and life was at risk.  And I think Stamos does have a good point in that regard.

Start time: 888.10
End time: 903.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't seem like Apple has been disingenuous or that they don't have.  They weren't underplaying it.  But it does kind of it is a good example of how security and marketing are all mashed together and difficult to separate.

Start time: 904.16
End time: 912.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that was actually Stamos's original point, which is don't let your MarCom guys undermine the good work your security guys are doing.

Start time: 912.35
End time: 912.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 914.49
End time: 929.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Melanie Ensign tweeted in response to something that Stamos had wrote.  Stamos said, I've worked for companies that took too long to publicly address their responsibilities.  This is not the path you want to take.

Start time: 930.42
End time: 932.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook. That's why he left Facebook.

Start time: 933.93
End time: 994.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also Yahoo.  And Yahoo. That's right.  And he left Yahoo for very similar reasons.  He says Apple does some incredible security work, but this kind of legal comms driven response can undermine that work.  Right. And he's saying this to Apple employees, demand better.  And I think that's a really important point that, for one thing, there's not going to be a lot of external forces, I think, that are going to be able to change how companies operate in this instance.  It has to be coming from the inside and it has to be coming from the security teams saying to the rest of the company, hey, stop screwing us.  And then Melanie, who worked at Facebook with Alex and I think she's now at Uber, is a great security comms person, said the problem in Facebook's case was that the legal comms response was actually a policy political response.  Right.  And I think that's what's happening here.  That's what's happening at Apple as well.  It's policy political and it's concern about legal issues, not about the security issues that are really at stake here.

Start time: 995.82
End time: 1010.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the takeaway for everybody who uses iPhones?  Throw them out.  That's exactly what Apple is worried that you might sell.  No, it's no different. Your security is no less than it was before this happened.  Right. It's.

Start time: 1011.12
End time: 1079.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Be more careful than ever.  Right. Two factor authentication.  Be real mindful about apps that you install.  Look at the permissions that those apps are taking.  Some of them are pretty egregious.  And the scary thing is some of them are apps that are supposed to help you with security.  We just published an article this past week about five reasons why you should never use a free VPN.  A lot of the free VPN apps out there that people are downloading, right, to help protect their security, are they can end up getting you infected with malware and spyware and tracking software and all kinds of things.  So unfortunately, it's a tough time to be a consumer and to have to deal with all of the security and privacy issues out there.  And this is going to continue to multiply over the next few years.  So all of us have an important job to do and help in whatever ways we can to inform the public, to help them find easy ways and on ramps to to protect themselves in ways that aren't going to be too onerous.  Because we know if it's the thing with security, if it's too onerous, people just opt out and they won't do it and then they end up vulnerable.

Start time: 1079.24
End time: 1091.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to ask Seth, you cover security, honestly.  Yeah, a little.  Is it even if you really wanted to be secure and private, you probably wouldn't use a smartphone at all.

Start time: 1092.73
End time: 1096.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's a you wouldn't use any of this stuff.  No, you wouldn't be on the Internet.

Start time: 1097.46
End time: 1117.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, so Steve Gibson always says if you want a private conversation, go out in a field.  In fact, both of you should be stripped naked and whisper into one another's ear.  It doesn't sound like fun.  Were you at Burning Man last week?  Yeah, right. Sounds like Burning Man.  But it's true.  That's I mean, the only real private communication is one that is so.

Start time: 1119.29
End time: 1151.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is actually a real the others.  The flip side of this issue in in talking about security is how do we minimize FUD?  How do we talk about these issues in ways that are serious and invaluable, but do not spread unnecessary fear and uncertainty and doubt.  I like to think of it as doom, but that's that's just me.  Dooms good, too.  So so in so in in educating the public about what's happening with security and privacy and what they need to know and not spreading FUD is a very fine line to to tread.

Start time: 1151.94
End time: 1156.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and reasonable parties could disagree about what is absolutely fun and what's not sure.

Start time: 1156.51
End time: 1200.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Right.  But, you know, one of the things that we talk a lot about in in security is your personal threat model.  And we talked a little bit about this earlier, how journalists have to be they have to really start thinking about their threat models, not only in terms of some nation state hacking them, but perhaps government surveillance, perhaps there are companies that don't like their reporting.  And so it's really important for journalists to think about this, no matter what level of journalists you are.  And then beyond that, what is your you know, what's your personal threat model?  Who do you think is actually going to be attacking you?  You know, where are you using your credit cards?  Are you using tap to pay instead of swipe?  You know, all these different things.

Start time: 1200.56
End time: 1211.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Apple's pretty good about giving us technologies that allow us easily to do things like that.  Right.  Apple Pay and the Apple credit card is a more private kind of credit card.  Right. Absolutely.

Start time: 1211.28
End time: 1240.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we're even using your fingerprint to log in.  I have issues with Face ID, but but Touch ID was revolutionary, not in the not in the sense that it was technologically revolutionary.  We've had fingerprint logins for devices for decades.  But to be able to log into your phone and suddenly have everybody using iPhones because so many people upgrade to new iPhones so rapidly to be able to do that, dramatically increase the security of the device.  And that's the kind of thing that people need to understand.  Built-in encryption.  Built-in encryption.

Start time: 1241.00
End time: 1245.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google and Apple have both done that now with their phones.  It comes encrypted out of the box.

Start time: 1246.06
End time: 1264.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's efforts to do HTTPS.  There's a lot going on.  But at the same time, if you're in a minority, if you're a minority in a country, you're targeted, you're out of luck.  If a nation state wants you.  You're not out of luck.  But there are things that you can do to make sure that you're being more secure when you do have to use your devices.  Yeah.

Start time: 1266.72
End time: 1294.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a thread on Reddit on the privacy tools thread.  What does Edward Snowden do?  And it's generally agreed after some back and forth conversations.  Edward Snowden has recommended Signal and Cubes OS and so forth.  But it was generally agreed at this point, both the US and Russia know exactly where Edward Snowden is.  They're probably monitoring all his communications.  If you're really the target of this kind of surveillance, it's going to be pretty hard to avoid.  So this is actually a really interesting thing.

Start time: 1295.04
End time: 1352.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A couple of years ago, I did a story on traveling internationally and how to be secure when you travel internationally.  And one person I spoke with for the story said that if you are, for example, an activist in Syria, right, you know that you're going to be surveyed.  There's no question that governments are watching you.  The question is which governments are watching you.  And it's you're probably better off having the US spying on you than you are having Lebanon,  which amazingly because of the decrease in cost of tools is now spying on people than having Lebanon spying you.  And so the source said if you know you're you're being watched, it's a good idea to use Skype and you do be out in the open,  be out in the open about your verbal conversation, but they're probably not observing the video.  And so you can use signs.  You can use the video or you can use prearranged signals to communicate in ways that are nonverbal.

Start time: 1353.36
End time: 1355.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what you need, though. You need a further encryption technology.

Start time: 1357.08
End time: 1361.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But sometimes knowing that you're being watched is safer in the sense that you know how to deal with it.

Start time: 1362.12
End time: 1379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Assume you're being watched and deal with it.  Yeah.  What a world we live in.  You said an interesting thing, Seth, which is that the costs have gone down to be a surveillance state.  So, you know, you can pretty much assume any interested party has the tools or at least has some tools.

Start time: 1379.48
End time: 1380.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yikes.

Start time: 1381.54
End time: 1405.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seth's point, too, is really good in that there's a lot of misinformation about security, the fact that that we are vulnerable.  Marketing, we talked about earlier, sort of there are marketing companies that market their products that try to take advantage of the fear and say scary things.  And so it's also our job to debunk some of those and make sure that people understand.  Yeah.

Start time: 1406.48
End time: 1430.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's possible either to be not scared enough or too scared about a lot of the stuff or to be too scared about the wrong things.  I mean, I think about all my friends who are not terribly technically savvy, who whenever anything goes wrong with any other devices, the first thing that comes to mind is they have a virus.  Yeah.  And in fact, seventy five percent of the time it's user error or random normal technology going bad kinds of stuff.  Yeah.

Start time: 1431.00
End time: 1438.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or, you know, earlier before we got on the air, you were talking about how you use a VPN all the time.  Yeah, that surprised me. This is something new you do.

Start time: 1438.00
End time: 1441.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's relatively recent, yeah.  And that's not always the best thing to do.

Start time: 1442.00
End time: 1444.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1450.00
End time: 1455.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because VPNs are used, they're double edged sword.  They're used by bad guys also to obscure their identity.

Start time: 1455.02
End time: 1462.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So maybe I need to.  I mean, why did you start using a VPN everywhere?  It's not a general paranoia, probably.  Well, it's like me.

Start time: 1463.04
End time: 1500.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stopped using Chrome.  I started using Firefox because Firefox, especially the new Firefox sixty nine, has really good anti-fingerprint tracking, anti-tracking technologies.  And Google has basically indicated its desire to kind of preserve cookie tracking and other kinds of tracking.  They need it.  It's their business model.  And while I love Chrome, you know, I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't be using it.  Firefox is a very capable, good browser.  We need, by the way, we also don't want a monoculture.

And now I'm now I'm debating.  Can I respond now?  Yes.  Yeah.  And just say, I'm really sorry.  This went slip through the cracks.  Or do I pretend it didn't get here?

If anybody sent me email that I haven't responded to, I'm sure I just missed it.  Sometimes I actually I confess.  Sometimes I'll read an email and go, that's too much work to answer right now.

Now it's come out that they have put 419 million phone numbers in Facebook.  They have put 419 million phone numbers on in a database in public without password access.  Just anybody could see it.

Anyone could find it and access it.  It included Facebook IDs, names, genders, countries and phone numbers for 133 million US-based users, 18 million UK users, 50 million Vietnamese users.  300 million people total.

Transcript:  Well, also, remember, if it's linked to more than just a phone number, it's not just a random list of phone numbers.  If it's linked to additional information, that's not good, Karsten.  It's not that individual piece that's bad.  But the problem is, and this is the big problem in general, is the aggregation of multiple data sources into one giant dossier.  It's just somebody could.  Yeah, sorry.  Go ahead, Leo.  It's just another piece of information about you that shouldn't be in public unless you want it to be.  And the fact that you get here's the real offensive part.  The fact that people gave these numbers to Facebook, assuming that they would be protected and not be and were used for two factor or other legitimate reasons and not be used for marketing purposes.  And that Facebook cavalierly just puts this database online with no security is offensive.  Whether it really is a bad thing, I mean, my phone number is out in the public.  I don't care about that.  I just don't answer the phone anymore.

Start time: 1882.22
End time: 1895.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's a big part of the issue, I think, is that Facebook has proven to be extremely cavalier.  That's just cavalier.  That's exactly what I was going to use.  Exactly.  With their user data, despite their assurances that only they exploit it.

Start time: 1898.46

Jack Dorsey, of course, the CEO of Twitter, whose account was hacked because he had signed up for a company that Twitter bought that allowed you to text message.  A tweet without any authentication.  And if Twitter said, oh, that came from your phone number, must be you.  So that they've turned that off at least temporarily.  All right.  Apple has an event.  There's a happy Apple story.  We're going to get to the happy Apple story.  Happy Apple story in just a little bit.  By the way, Facebook spokesperson Jan Nancarrow said the data had been scraped before Facebook cut off access to user phone numbers.  So it's OK.  It's OK.  This was old data.  This was back when we allowed that.

I just love it.  For 300 bucks a year, I get 12 gigabytes of data a month, unlimited text and phone numbers.  It's literally the least expensive service I have.  Because Mint Mobile runs on T-Mobile, they're what we call an MVNO.  They use T-Mobile's towers.  I get the same great service I get on my other phones for a whole lot less.  If you're still using one of the big wireless providers in 2019, really, you are overpaying.  And part of it is because you have to pay for those expensive retail stores, inflated prices, hidden fees.  They know you'll pay.  Most people don't even know they have a choice.  Enter Mint Mobile, the same premium network coverage you're used to,  but at a fraction of the cost because they don't have stores.  It's all online.  No retail locations.  That overhead is just gone and they pass those savings on to you.  Your wireless bill could be as little as $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan.  Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide text and talk.  And you don't pay for data you'll never use.  What you do is you look at your phone bill and say, how much data do I use?  Three, eight, 12 gigabytes of LTE data a month.  Then you pick the plan that's right for you.  I picked the 12 gig plan because I know I'll never use more than 12 gigs.  That's actually more than I use.  But boy, the price was so good, I thought this is great.  And I paid for a year.  That got the price way, way down.  $300 a year for 12 gigabytes.  But they have plans as little as $15 a month for three gigabytes.  You figure out how much data you need.  You bring your own phone if you want.  You can even port your number so you keep the same phone number.  All your contacts.  People will still know how to reach you.  All your ditching is their old wireless bill.  Start saving with Mint Mobile at mintmobile.com slash twit  to get your new wireless plan just $15 a month with their three month introductory plan  and get it all shipped to your door for free.  Go to mintmobile.com slash twit.  I love the Fox.  I've been very happy with the Fox.  So much so that I just really want to move all my phones over to Mint Mobile  because unfortunately I have way too many.  If you saw my mobile bills, way too many.  Way too many accounts, way too many phones.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  You're going to love it.  Mint Mobile.  Highly recommend it.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  So this is an expensive time of year for me.  The new iPhone will be out.  The new Apple Watch will be out.  The new Pixel 4 will be out.  There's a bunch of phones at IFA.  Ay, ay, ay.  Let's start with Tuesday.  Apple's buy innovation only event.  There's the invitation, which I did not get.  Harry, you surely got it.  I will be there.  You'll be going.

And Apple, for the first time, is going to stream this on YouTube,  which might explain why Apple keeps taking us down on YouTube  when we do our streaming coverage of their events.  Maybe they thought, you know,  we don't want anybody to think that this is the only way you can watch it.  I don't know.  Anyway, Apple will stream on YouTube.  We will not, because we don't want to get taken down.  When they take us down, it's 12 weeks or so before we get back up,  so that's not worth it for us.  But we will put it in other places.  I'll leave it to you to figure out where.  I don't want the Apple lawyers to know.  And you can watch live or you can watch after the fact.  It's always fun.  It's really almost, at least it started in 2007 as a religious holiday.  You know, the Apple acolytes gathering to hear the great,  the one, the only, the Steve, you know, dispense his wisdom.  And in the early days of the iPhone, it was a big deal.  Every year there was something new and amazing.  There was Gaspworthy, One More Things, and bands and so forth.  It's hard for Apple, though, to keep doing that year after year.  Here we are in what is it, year 12 of the iPhone.

End time: 2407.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be fair.  It is spin, but it's fun to see.  And often, you know, ultimately, you do not buy a new phone for speeds and feeds.  You buy it because of the new things it will let you do.  Are you an iPad user?  At the moment, I'm an iPad user and a Pixel 3 user.  And, you know, on Tuesday, I'll decide whether my next phone is going to be an iPhone or a Pixel 4.

Start time: 2408.48
End time: 2411.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2412.14
End time: 2429.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know a little bit more than we might have because when Google was faced with the Pixel 4 leaks,  it decided to say yes.  They took the bull by the horns.  That's true about the cameras.  I like to jump back and forth.  I mean, both platforms are cool.  And if you write about this stuff, it's useful to know both of them.  I usually carry both.

I'll let you play with mine for a little bit.  You can see how you feel about it.  Are you going to unlock your phone for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I heard somebody say something which seems to me to be true, which is Pixel phones are  a little bit like a Windows PC 10 years ago, where if you use them for six months, they  become progressively...  Bit rot.  We called it bit rot.  Bit rot.  They become progressively less reliable and a little wonkier, and Google Assistant doesn't  always work for me right now, and I'm not entirely sure why.

Start time: 2517.00
End time: 2525.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2533.16
End time: 2564.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It's got edge lighting.  Yeah.  I've got little edge menus so I can swipe through the edge menu.  Yeah.  This is not using Samsung's launcher.  I'm using an action launcher, but I think it's a very nice phone.  I love the cameras.  In fact, I'm really pleased.  I think Samsung was the first to...  Maybe not even the first actually.  Maybe Huawei or OnePlus was the first to use multiple lenses, but Apple apparently will  now have at least two, maybe three lenses on their phone.  Three.  They've got two now, right?

Start time: 2564.80
End time: 2565.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So three.

Start time: 2565.86
End time: 2581.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Likely three.  That's what Samsung does.  Now, is Apple going to do the same thing that Samsung does with the three lenses?  You've got a telephoto, you've got a normal, and you've got a wide angle?  Or is Apple going to do what other companies do, which is combine data from three lenses  to make a super photo?  Do we know?

Start time: 2582.92
End time: 2636.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be.  So there's reports that the latter is true in that you will take that photo and you will  have that sort of super photo, as you called it.  And so afterwards, say you cut somebody's arm off or something, right?  Which is easy to do.  And when you're using your phone and taking it real quick, you'll be able to zoom out  on that photo afterwards, right?  So that's one of the reports of the ways that they're going to do that.  That would be pretty neat, you know, to say like, oh, I shot this just a little bit wrong,  which I gave some more headroom or whatever.  And so that would be pretty cool, pretty spectacular.  But yeah, the idea is that it's likely three camera lens with the sort of what we think  of as a standard camera, which is a wide basic wide angle, an ultra wide angle.  So a zoom out and then of course the telephoto, which is a zoom in.

Start time: 2636.68

Google with their software and then Huawei with their hardware, they're so far head and  shoulders above everybody else with low light photography.

It's remarkable what they've done with one lens and the fact that they're going to go  with multiple lenses.  They obviously have really smart people that really care about this and are doing good  stuff.  I think with that thing going to multiple lenses, they've got a lot of potential to  really set a new bar.

The worst thing is, and I've mentioned this before, so forgive me for repeating, but  it still bugs the hell out of me because I'm an old man, is when you see people down at  the front of the Massive Attack show, they're in the front row, they should be enjoying  the music.  Instead, they're turning around and shooting a selfie with the band behind them.  And it's clear there's really only one intent to show your friends what a great life you  have.

What if he gets the wrong phone back?  Yeah, because he just takes the picture and then throws it back out.  It seems like a dumb thing to do.

Transcript:  It does.  And you know, the interesting thing, like Harry, I was wanting to track this because  I was knowing that I was not getting enough sleep and I wanted to really put some data  behind it.  And I was really worried about the charging thing.  I've never run out of battery on my watch.  I charge it like for if I'm going to about to go to bed and I've only got 50% power because  the four has great battery life.  Let's say I'll get it at the end of the day and it's 50% power.  I'll put it on the charger for 20 minutes.  And while I'm reading before I go to bed, put it on.  It's like it's 78%, 85%.  It's plenty to sleep through the night and get through the full next day.

Start time: 3148.24
End time: 3155.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  So years ago, when the first health trackers came out, I remember reading the story about  this guy who had collected months and months and months of his pulse data and stuff and  took it to a doctor and had printed out these reams of data and said to the doctor, what  do you think of this?  And he looks at him and he takes his pulse and he says, you're fine.  We may know down to the nanosecond how much sleep we're getting per night.

Start time: 3188.02
End time: 3205.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what do you do?  How does it help?  Look, I have a sleep screen.  So I don't wear a watch to bed.  I have like a porn star.  I have paddles under my bed like a normal person.  They're in between my mattress and my box spring.  And they measure it.  This is from Sleep Tracker.  And I now know...  I tried that too.

Start time: 3223.52
End time: 3243.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A D in sleep.  I mean, to me, it's the same reason that tracking steps is worthwhile.  The fact I know I'm tracking them makes me more likely to walk more.  And if I'm tracking my sleep, I'm more likely to sleep on a more normal schedule.  It's not that I don't get enough sleep.  I'm all over the board in terms of whether I go to bed early or late.

Transcript:  The thing is, when I tracked it, because I did try some of the other ways to do it, especially  the under mattress thing, it was wildly inaccurate.  Oh, okay.  So maybe I won't use that.

Start time: 3276.44
End time: 3280.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Is the one you're using now accurate?  How do you know if it's accurate?

Start time: 3281.70
End time: 3387.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I start to track when I actually fall asleep and when I get up and then I see is  it actually doing it.  It's been accurate.  I've only found since June, like two times where I thought that it wasn't quite accurate.  It makes more sense.  It's on your body, it's sensing your heart rate, it's sensing your movement.  It's not a surprise that it's more accurate.  I do think what it's been useful for me is it's actually told me that when I actually  get sleep, when I do it, my sleep actually is very efficient.  A lot of people find I was worried that maybe that wasn't the case.  I stopped worrying this, but to kind of set the point, it was like your sleep is fine,  so don't stress out about it.  But to Harry's point, it has made me more aware of the fact of actually making sure  I'm getting enough sleep.  The same way tracking your steps does, the same way tracking your meals.  When you observe the behavior, you change the behavior by the very nature of it, which  social scientists have said for a long time.  It's more in that vein.  I think what Apple's going to do, I doubt that Apple's going to do anything as involved  as what SleepWatch is.  SleepWatch gives you some amazing data.  I think Apple's going to give a basic set of data.  It's going to do probably a few smarter things that will make all these other apps, because  there's other apps that do this too for the watch.  It's going to do things like the reports are.  It's going to remind you if you're at less than 50% before you go to bed and you're usually  tracking your sleep, it'll say, hey, put your watch on the charger for 20 minutes so that  you get enough of a charge to get through the night and start your day tomorrow.

It may just be a Series 4 with new finishes and sleep tracking, which is really just an  app.  And then of course with WatchOS, remember, is getting its own apps.  We learned about that at WWDC.  So Watch does have a few software upgrades.  But the hardware, the reports are the latest reports are that they may call it Series  You never know.  That's a marketing decision.  They may also just call it Series 4 with new finishes and maybe a little bit more of a  price drop.  I don't know about that because they're already just cleaning up with the smartwatch market.  They're just owning it.  So I don't know if maybe they have some data that they could go this much further and sell  them to these many more people if the price was just a bracket lower or something.

Transcript:  I don't care what my Apple Watch says.  I don't care if I got a failing grade in sleep.  I've got a Casper, which means every minute I spend in bed, I feel good.  Casper is an amazing sleep brand that just has revolutionized the mattress industry by  eliminating the most costly part of the mattress industry.  It's not the expense of making the mattress.  It's not the high quality materials they use.  It's that silly store that you go to so you can lie on a mattress for a minute or two  and decide which mattress you want.  The store doubles the cost of the mattress.  So Casper said, what if we didn't do that?  What if we let people take their mattress delivery right to their house and sleep on  it for a hundred nights and if at any time in that first hundred nights they say, this  is not for me, they can send it back, get every penny back, no cost.  Casper is improving all the time.  They've done so much research on mattresses.  They now have a new hybrid mattress.  I just got it.  It features their award-winning foam layers they're famous for, but also springs.  But it still comes in that surprisingly compact box.  Why would you want springs?  Well, a couple of reasons.  It offers luxurious comfort, but also resilient support, elevated lift for active support,  durability for all body types, increased airflow within the spring network.  It's always important to sleep cool and those springs help with that.  And this actually is the reason I love my new Casper, the hybrid mattress, because it's  got an enhanced edge support.  As you're getting in and out of bed, it's easier because it supports you a little bit  better and I just love that.  I think the Casper mattresses are the best in the business.  You're going to want to try it and it's easy to do.  Casper offers free delivery and painless returns in the US and Canada, a 100-night risk-free  sleep on it trial and they still come.  There's the box.  This is the new one with the springs.  I'm going to open up this box.  One of the best things about the Casper mattress is you don't have to air it out.  It is fresh as a daisy right out of the box.  I can't say that.  I bought some in the past.  I've bought such very expensive mattresses that you didn't want to sleep on for a week  because they had to air out, not the Casper.  And watch this, as soon as you take it out of its vacuum-sealed bag, it goes and expands  to size and suddenly you've got the most comfortable night's sleep.  Watch, watch, watch.  Oh, it's, oh, that is a comfy mattress.  I love my Casper.  And by the way, so do our pets.  Get a Casper mattress today.

There is at least some information in the Apple source code for iOS 13 that they're  going to do a Bluetooth tracker, a competitor to Tile and Tracker.  Yep.

These are not in-app purchases.  You just get to play the game and you get new games every month.  Games go on.  Games go off.  I think that is a very big market for Apple.  I think of everything Apple might announce on Tuesday, that will be the one.  And if that ships, at least for me, I would buy it.  Wouldn't you pay five bucks a month and just know that you're going to have a bunch of  interesting games?  Maybe you play them.  Maybe you won't, but you got them.

I think Apple Arcade may be the surprise hit of it.  And I think Apple TV Plus is going down.  Have you watched, anybody watched any of the trailers?

You also have the fact that remember the most well-known thing about that March event was  what?  It was Oprah's line, a billion pockets, y'all.  So clearly Apple sold Oprah on the idea that this was going to be access to a billion pockets.  How do you get to a billion pockets?  Not by charging 10 bucks.  You get to a billion pockets by making it free to everybody that has the most like the  current version of iOS.  That's how you get to a billion pockets.

They're going to stop allowing VoIP apps to function in the background on the iPhone,  which means that if you're using WhatsApp or if you're using...

Well, it was on some list of possibilities I saw, although it seems more likely they'll  have a more Mac-centric event in a few weeks.  It sounds like it's the first new MacBook in a while that's an all-new MacBook given  that the last major new one was the MacBook Air and the whole idea behind that was that  it was an old design.  And there are so many reasons why Apple does need a new laptop design these days starting  with the keyboard.

There will be a 5G option.  They say they fixed the Fold problems.  have sort of concierge repair service, specialized customer care service to reassure you, including  one-on-one access to Samsung experts and a 24-7 support hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a very similar approach.  And we like the possibilities.  We're not going to recommend this device to many people to get.  But it is a tantalizing look at the future.  And it certainly holds some interesting possibilities.  That folding that screen, you know, I really have some questions in terms of long-term  durability to be able to do that.  But it is an interesting idea.  I think Samsung's version is a little bit nicer than Huawei's.  The one that could be the dark horse is actually the Motorola Razr, interestingly enough.  People love that form factor.  It's a flip phone still?  It's a flip phone.  And both sides are a display.  So I think that that one could be the dark horse of being the most useful of this first  round of these devices.  Samsung, as Harry said, really wants to be in this for the display business, if nothing  else, right?  That is what they do.  And it's a big part of the future from their perspective.

Start time: 4565.58
End time: 4575.66

This was widely mocked, but I thought since I have such smart people on the panel, I'd  ask you guys.  Seth, Harry, Jason.  Allen Institute, which is the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Paul Allen, I presume,  since it's in Seattle, unveiled a new AI that passed an eighth grade science test.  I actually did better on an eighth grade scientist that I did on my sleep test.  In fact...  That's a low bar.  I know, I know.  Maybe let's give you some sample questions.  See if you can do as well as Aristotel.  Which cell structure do nutrients pass through to enter a cell?  The membrane, chloroplast, cytoplasm, or nucleus.  I'm going to say cell membrane.  Correct.  Aristotel got that as well.  Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper?  That's going to come in handy.  Magnet, filter paper, triple beam balancer, voltmeter.  A magnet?  Magnet.  When food is being mechanically...  This is...  You know what?  Okay, an eighth grader, I could see this is a good test, but this is impressive for an  AI to know this, right?  When food is being mechanically digested, whatever that is, it's being changed into another  substance, it's being made smaller in size, being converted into energy, it's being excreted  from the body.  I have no idea.

End time: 4905.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why he went to Harvard.  This system, this question is the only one Aristotel missed, it gets converted into energy.  According to New York State, which should know, it's made smaller in size.  In New York State, speaking of which, there is a greater chance of precipitation falling  as snow in January than in March because January in the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward  the sun where temperatures are warmer, toward the sun where temperatures are colder, away  from the sun and temperatures are warmer, away from the sun and temperatures are colder.  One would think it's colder, right?  So we've got to eliminate warmer, away from the sun and temperatures are colder.  Yes, Aristotel got that right and so did you.  You're so smart.  The movement of the liquid in a thermometer shows changes in the temperature.  An increase in temperature indicates the molecule in the liquid moved slower and closer together.  This is an increase in temperature.  Moved faster and spread farther apart.  Contracted in size when heated, expanded in size when heated.  Well moved faster and spread farther apart, right?  Well, I almost passed.  Aristotel got that right.  So is this impressive or is this just more Jim Crackery like IBM's Deep Blue?  Are you impressed?  It seems to me those are hard questions for an AI because they imply an understanding  of a physical universe the AI doesn't even exist in.

But it is good at understanding the question and synthesizing enough information to get  it right, which is valuable long term.  It seems like there's a huge business opportunity in computers synthesizing vast amounts of  information and grinding them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Engineer in our chat room says it isn't in fact a better understanding of the physical  world but it's better language models driven by neural networks.  Aristotel is actually based on a neural network technology called BERT that was created by  Google and it was instructed to read thousands of articles and books through which it learned  about the patterns.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it's really the training, right?  The important thing here is that they figured out how to build AI better, not so much its  answers.  The answers are important because they indicate how the machine learning has been trained  but without being able to apply that elsewhere, then it's not really going to have much of  an impact.  But if they figured out how to take the way that they've trained this particular AI to  apply to other machine learning instances, then they'll have something that's, quote  unquote, smarter but shows that we've grown in how we're building AIs.  Because we don't want them to identify, to do all the racist stuff that the Google AI  was doing with photos and all these other bias mistakes.

Transcript:  Right.  It's very good.  What AI is really good at and far better than humans is pattern recognition.  So things like this, it can do far better.  It's really good at enhancing humans.  Not so good at replacing for many things where you have gray areas where you need to understand  context, where you need to understand and make judgment call on ambiguity.  One of the dirty little secrets about big data is a lot of companies that are working  on it the most are hiring armies of humans to do all of that sorting and collecting and  deciding on the ambiguities, deciding on the gray areas, making those decisions because  the computers aren't very good at it.  They sort and organize the data and then you have the AI crunch it.  It's super fast at those things.  So yes, some of these AI is going to replace certain types of work that involve where you  have some of that basic crunching because it's faster.  It's also going to create more different kinds of jobs.  And that's a lot of what this discussion almost always seems to boil down to is like, when  is the AI going to take my job?  And so I think that's the thing to understand about it.  AI still is not good and in our lifetime is not likely to be very good at understanding  ambiguity, understanding context.  And that's where, interestingly enough, people who can mix liberal arts, which is all about  those things, with some types of data science and that type of work have become extremely  valuable.

And these are people with brains.  Yeah, I think when you read stuff like this, you don't get over optimistic about the future  of AI.  And by the way, at the end of the article, the New York Times clearly put this in to  make you all feel better.  They said the same researchers tried to teach artificial intelligence to pass the graduate  record exam, which is the exam to get in graduate school, and they just couldn't do  it.  So no AI's in graduate school.  But maybe ninth grade.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Our show today brought, actually, before we do the ad, let's do the promo.  We have a little video we made.  Because I know a lot of you listen to this show, but maybe not know about all the other  shows we do here on the Twitter network.  The new show's coming along with Micah Sargent.  He's developing some shows.  Ant, you're going to be doing a...  Well, I won't say, but I'm excited about the show Ant's Pruitt's working on.  Here's what you missed this week.  We had some fun on Twitter.  Previously on Twitter.  It uses...  Wait a minute.  This isn't a battery.  Wait one minute.  It looks like a top of the ROM.  It's like an E-Prom or something.  It's a write ROM.  Oh, a literal ROM.  Do you think it was CMOS yet?  Or was it...  What was before CMOS?  RecCon says CMOS was preceded by NoMOS.  Security Now.

Hey, by the way, Steve Gibson, you saw a little bit of Steve Gibson security now.  We are going to Boston.  We're going to do an event for LastPass.  Steve and I will be joined by Bill Cheswick.  Ches, who is the guy who invented the firewall at Bell Labs.  He's a really great security researcher.  Jerry Buchelt, who is the CISO of LogMeIn.  We're going to do an event in Boston on October 3rd at 3.45 in the afternoon at the Intercontinental  Hotel.  If you'd like to go, it is free.  In fact, everybody who attends will get a $100 token to donate to the charity of your  choice, which is really, really cool.  Our topic, authentication, passwords and why they're so bad and what's coming next.  Cybersecurity and identity trends unlocked.  If you want to sign up, there is some limited space, but I wanted to announce it on this  show so that you have a chance to go.  You got to be in Boston October 3rd, so don't sign up if you're not going to be in Boston.  Twitter.to, that's our URL shortener, twitter.to slash unlocked.  If you're interested, we will have, we still have some seats left at that event.  Thursday, October 3rd at the Intercontinental Hotel in Boston.  Steve will be talking no doubt about Squirrel, his authentication platform.  Ches just wrote a great piece on why passwords suck.  I think it's going to be really interesting.  What's next for authentication?  Our show today brought to you by the cloud, the hot cloud, the Wasabi hot cloud storage.  We were talking about this last night.  We were talking about my two buddies, Jeff Flowers and David Friend.  They founded Carbonite.  Jeff's the CTO, David's the CEO.  Jeff had patented, actually together they'd patented a really interesting way of writing  data to disks sequentially instead of block by block, which makes it so much faster, so  much more efficient.  That's what was kind of the foundational technology of Carbonite.  They've now created a new cloud storage company called Wasabi that is doing amazing things.  The problem is everybody knows Amazon and Google and Microsoft.  Nobody's ever heard of Wasabi.  So I really want to get the word out about this.  Wasabi is a fifth the cost of Amazon's S3, one fifth the cost and is up to six times  faster.  That's thanks to this revolutionary patented technology they're using.  It's also as secure as you can get, 11 nines of data durability.  They have data integrity checking so you never lose a bit.  They also have a feature I think is really important that you can set some or all of  your data as immutable.  That means it can't be modified by ransomware or fumble fingered employees.  So you can say this data is sacred, it's sacrosanct.  It can only be changed if I say it can be changed.  This is really important.  Being able to efficiently and affordably store data in the cloud is important for so many  businesses.  Everybody's moving to the cloud.  Of course nobody ever get fired by using one of the big three.  But honestly take the boss this information because I think when you say boss you could  save 80 percent, it'll be six times faster.  There's no hidden fees for egress or API usage.  That by itself is going to save you a ton of money.  It supports the Amazon S3 API so you already know how to use it.  Yes, it's more secure than your on-premises storage.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant.  Look at the companies that are starting to use it.  I think this is really exciting.  You calculate the savings for yourself and if you want to bang on it, you can get unlimited  storage for a month.  If you go to wassabi.com and click the free trial link but use the offer code TWIT that  way you will get an unlimited free trial for 30 days.  So you can really put data on there.  You can try to change it.  You can see how fast it is.  You can really see what it can do.  Join the movement.  Migrate your data to the cloud.  Do it with confidence and be one of the smart ones.  This is a disruptor in this industry and from guys who really know what it's all about wassabi.com  offer code TWIT.  Thank you wassabi.  David and Jeff have been great supporters of TWIT all along and I love to support them  back.  We talked I think a couple of weeks ago about a conundrum facing our network.  We had booked an interview with Joey Itcho who was the director of the MIT Media Lab.  He has a new book out.  Denise Howell was going to interview him.  And then it started to come out that Joey had solicited and taken contributions from  a former convicted child molester, Jeffrey Epstein.  And we were now really conflicted about this interview.  Fortunately, I told Denise, I said if he comes on, you're going to have to ask him the hard  questions.  We don't normally do that at TWIT.  We don't want to get in confrontational interviews.  But if we're going to interview Joey Itcho, who by the way I've known for years and have  great respect for, you're going to have to ask him the tough questions.  Why did you take money from Jeffrey Epstein?  Well a couple of days ago, Ronan Farrow, who's been doing such amazing work for the New Yorker,  published an article based on documents they got from MIT that showed A, that MIT had said  we cannot take any more donations from this guy.  He's a child molester.  And that B, Joey Itcho took steps and it's in writing, it's in emails to hide the fact  that the money was coming from Jeffrey Epstein.  They said any Jeffrey Epstein donation has to be designated anonymous.  They didn't use his name.  They only used initials in meetings.  It was a smoking gun.  And within a few hours of the release of that article, Joey Itcho resigned as director of  MIT Media Lab.  A lot of people had, at least two people had left before that.  But that is quite a shocker.  And I think one of the questions we would have asked Itcho is why?  Is money so tight that you have to take money from a source like Epstein?  Apparently, according to the Farrow article in the New Yorker, Epstein went to Bill Gates  and said give money to Media Lab.  He was an intermediary and Bill Gates gave money to Media Lab as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is somewhat mystifying because it's not like Bill Gates didn't know these guys  in the first place.  So it's not entirely clear why Jeffrey Epstein needed to be a middleman in this case.

Start time: 5710.80
End time: 5749.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is the subtext of this, that Epstein was using all of this influence and  all of these relationships to kind of scrub his record.  And so that makes complicit in Epstein's attempt to kind of rejuvenate his reputation, an attempt  that failed.  I guess there's nothing more to say about it.  Jason?  It's just a bad...  And you know, again, I think Joey's done great work at Media Lab.  And I had a lot of respect for him and I'm just disappointed and shocked, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like at the moment it is somewhat unclear what was going on with Gates and this  stuff.

Transcript:  I saw a lot of ads on the Thursday night game for Verizon rolling out 5G into 13 NFL stadiums.  Then I read this VentureBeat article by Jeremy Horowitz.  Verizon's bizarre rollout, 5G rollout, now covers some seats in 13 NFL stadiums.  They don't actually identify...  They identify all but one of the stadiums.  A 5G will be concentrated in parts of the seating areas but could be available in other  locations in and around the stadium as well.  This is not the impression one would have gotten from the ad.  If you have a 5G phone, I mean, my thought originally was, oh great, I'll go watch a  football game.  But you have to be in the right seat at certain stadiums and maybe it won't be on the whole  time and this is just more 5G foot.

End time: 6189.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not that.  It's just that it's not built out.  What we think of as 5G, we really think of as millimeter wave and that to your point  Leo, you have to have a ton of access points everywhere, all over the place.  And then the 5G light is the version that is about half as fast but acts in a towered  scenario much similar to like 4G today.  And it's still super fast, right?  We're still talking 400 megabits.

Transcript:  Yeah, Sub-6 is the one that...  That one, right?  Sub-6 is a big upgrade from 4G LTE networks, although some of those networks are already  pushing up there, right?  It's just going to take that more consistent.  But millimeter wave is a much more extensive build out and it's only going to make sense  where there's a lot of density, population density, right?  So it just takes time and it's going to take a lot more time than sort of these early ones  are like, here's one corner where you can go and try out the millimeter wave just to  see what it's going to be like.  But as soon as you move across the street, you'll lose your connection in many cases.

It's low latency.  If your equipment on your factory floor can be streaming data with low latency and tell  you when it's about to break down before it has, that kind of stuff is super valuable.

Transcript:  So more nodes connecting to the network.  So to your point, Seth, there is a lot of really good enterprise applications where  you're going to have a lot more things connect to the network, from stoplights to water,  to meters, to power meters, all kinds of stuff.  So it's going to have a big use for that.  I think in consumer where you're going to see the most interest in it is mobile gaming.  So the timing on something like Apple Arcade and Google Stadia is going to be pretty good  because those things are 5G.

Start time: 6347.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love that about Arcade.  I didn't mention that.  That's smart.  This story, I'm a fan of the idea of gun control, but this is going, I think, a little too far.  According to Forbes, Thomas Brewster at Forbes, the feds have demanded that Apple and Google  hand over the names, phone numbers and other data of people who have downloaded an app,  an app that's designed to tune up a gun scope.  It's the ATN Obsidian 4 application.  You have to have a scope manufactured by the company and then you can use it to get streaming  video from the scope, but you can also use it to calibrate the scope.  According to the Play Store, 10,000 users, at least 10,000 users have downloaded the  app.  On September 5th, the DOJ requested information.  Actually, that's called Obsidian 4 from American Technologies Network.  They asked for information by everybody who downloaded it.  10,000 people on Google Play.  Apple doesn't provide download numbers, so it's not clear how many iPhone people.  The court has yet to approve the demand.  I hope they don't.  This is, to me, the kind of scary, terrifying fishing expedition.  If the government starts saying, I want to know everybody who downloaded that app, that's  a real problem.

Start time: 6454.60

Start time: 6461.08
End time: 6507.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we'll watch to see what the court says in response to this application.  It's a little disturbing that the DOJ even asked for it, but let's hope the court holds  strong.  Then, of course, the question if the courts say, okay, what will Apple and Google do?  If the court signs off on the order, Apple and Google will be told to hand over not just  the names of anyone who's downloaded the app since 2017, but their telephone numbers and  their IP addresses.  They also want to know what users were operating the app.  Now, perhaps this gun site was used in some crime.  We don't even know that, but certainly not all of the tens of thousands of people downloaded  the app are criminals.

Start time: 6508.87
End time: 6517.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  This has happened before with other governments.  An unnamed government asked Apple for data for 58 million users of a single app.  They were trying to trace a terrorist cell.  Apple said no and was not compelled to do so, but this is a little different.  It's a US court.  It's the US Department of Justice.  That would be hard for Apple to say no, I think.  There is another flaw in the super micro.  We never did hear whether Bloomberg nailed it with the super micro flaw last year.  Everybody denied it and Bloomberg never really proved it.  I'm going to have to assume that that story was an error, but this is a new one.  This is from Wired.  A newly discovered vulnerability in super micro hardware brings the threat of malicious  USBs to corporate servers.  Seth, it sounds like you can, in effect, mount a USB drive remotely over the internet using  this flaw.  Yes.  That's bizarre.  That's what it sounds like.  Plug in a virtual thumb drive.

Transcript:  I do want to throw in though that this is very, very different from Bloomberg's super micro  story.  Yes, that was a little bit of hardware.  Don't want people conflating those two.  No, no, no, no, no.  Even if Bloomberg's big picture for that story was wrong, there's a lot of parts of it that  may have been correct.  Anyway.  Sounds like you have some information on this Bloomberg story.  Do you want to talk about it?  Nothing that I can say at this point.  I'll say that it's been very hard for, I think, everybody who's looked at last year's super  micro story to verify what Bloomberg wrote as they wrote it.

Your power bill would cost so much.  You need a nuclear power plant.  Yeah.  Huawei says, oh, this Huawei story is a gift that just keeps on giving, that the US, by  the way, there was no evidence offered, has been pressuring its employees.  The government has pressured the company's employees to turn against it.  Turn against Huawei.  And has used cyber attacks to infiltrate the firm's computer systems in recent months.  I have to say, I'm a little sympathetic to Huawei because we've never seen any real evidence.  It felt like Huawei was just a scapegoat for a trade war.  But on the other hand, maybe, and we've also heard bad things about Huawei from others.

Yeah, that's what they've consistently said for a long time.  It's a presumed problem.  Huawei hasn't necessarily denied that, but they've denied that the Chinese government  has, you know, is running the company.  And that this is an overreaction to what's there.  That said, we know that there is cyber warfare going on between China and the US.  It has been for a long time.

Transcript:  And if FBI agents are posing as Huawei employees, would you be surprised?  I wouldn't be.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll wrap this thing up.  OK, I'm just looking at some headlines to see biohackers chase Johnny Mnemonic with  peg leg implanted hard drive.  Well, let Seth explain that was Seth's idea.  I don't I don't even know what those words mean.  I know what each individual word means, but I don't know what the guy was.  A pretty crazy story.  All right, we'll talk about that in just a second.  But first, I have a very happy story.  We we hired the new guy.  Just the other day, we hired a production assistant.  He's working out, right?  He's good. I like the guy. I like the kid.  Right. You guys all went out drinking with him, right?  He gets your vote of confidence.  You know how we found him?  Zip recruiter. Love the zip recruiter.  Man, if you are doing hiring for a company, you know that that is a tough job.  But it's also I mean, I'll give you a lot of credit.  It's an important job. Any company, our company is made up of employees.  Good employees can help that company soar.  A bad employee could just drag you right down.  It's important.  This is not a but it's a tough job because your phone lights up, your inbox is jammed.  And you don't know how to figure the right persons out there somewhere.  But how do you reach them? There's so many job boards.  I got to tell you, we have just keep going back to zip recruiter.  And it is the best way to hire.  First of all, one post on zip recruiter goes to 100 plus job boards.  One click of the mouse, including Facebook and Twitter.  I mean, just everywhere.  So you are getting you're getting out to the widest possible audience.  But that's not all. That's not all.  As applications come in, you can have screening questions.  Yes, no, true, false, even essay questions and AI couldn't answer.  And you can screen out people who aren't right for the job, narrow it down.  They don't come to your phone or your inbox.  They all go to the zip recruiter interface.  And then there's this new thing that I just love.  Zip recruiter has powerful matching technology that scans the resumes  they already have on file to find people with the right experience  and then invite them to apply to your job.  They also analyze each one and they and they spotlight the top candidates  right to the top so you don't miss a great match.  This works so well.  Zip recruiter says with four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter,  they're going to get a quality candidate within the first day.  In our experience, it's often within an hour.  It's kind of an amazing thing.  We'll post at breakfast before lunch.  We've got three great candidates thanks to zip recruiter.  I just love zip recruiter. You will, too.  Right now, you could try it free, get a sense of how it'll work for you  at ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  This is literally the smartest way to hire.  It's going to save you a lot of time and get you a great employee.  Zip recruiter dot com slash twit, zip recruiter dot com slash twit.  The smartest way to hire.  Thank you, zip recruiter, for supporting twit.  All right. Biohackers.  I know what that is.  It's like those guys who who put stuff in their arm.  Chase, Johnny Mnemonic, I know what that is.  That's the William Gibson novel and movie of the same name.  Short story and movie, the same name with.  And this is in quotes, pegged leg.  Don't know what that is, but I know what a peg leg is,  but I don't know what peg leg is. Implanted hard drive.  And here's a picture of them.  Doing it.  So what this guy got a hard drive implanted in his leg. Yep.  Why? Yep.  First of all, is it a spinning drive or a solid state?

Start time: 7025.77
End time: 7046.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's a solid state.  OK, good. That's a start.  So in the story, I detail what he upgraded to 100 gig drive in a year.  But it's the fascinating thing about it is that it's it's in a it's a  customized version of a Raspberry Pi.  So the size of the drive is limited only by your budget for a micro SD card.

Start time: 7047.58
End time: 7050.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 7050.74
End time: 7118.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want that.  It's about the size of a mini candy bar, right?  Inch and a half like the one you hand out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's the Pi zero.  Yeah, it's the Pi zero. So it's smaller.  They coated in a bio safe acrylic resin.  He is smiling. Yeah.  And then without getting too graphic,  made a subcutaneous pocket between the skin and the muscle.  Shove the thing in and then sewed it up.  Isn't this illegal?  Like that's practicing medicine without a license.  Not if you're doing it to yourself.  You could do it to yourself.  So the guy in the picture  with the face mask on is the surgeon who did it to himself.  And then Michael Laufer, who is on the table with his leg wrapped,  also had one done.  So they call this implant a peg leg.  Yes, because it's the part of the pirate that's left over.  And what can you do with it?  You can put data on it.  It's a it's not connected to the Internet.  It's a mesh network connected device.  So you can put whatever data you want, stream data from it  as long as the devices are connected directly to it.

Start time: 7126.62
End time: 7214.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same idea, except that this is a substantial piece of hardware.  And the Johnny Mnemonic story was using human wetware.  Right. Right.  But the ideas that were, you know, that were in Johnny Mnemonic  40 years ago, almost 40 years ago, are now, you know,  starting to leak out into the real world.  And what we've seen is two things.  One, we've seen when we when there's large innovations like this.  The very first peg leg was early, was done earlier this year and was giant.  And it was about the size of the guys, of the recipients  bicep. And it's huge.  And I've seen photos and it's quite gory.  These things get smaller.  So a few months later, they've already made one that is less than half the size.  I presume they're working on version three.  And the other thing we've seen is, is that if these guys are doing something like this,  you can rest assured that tech companies that are investing in  biotechnology are looking at how to do similar things.  And we've seen it with contact lenses.  We've seen it, you know, with with all kinds of things.  So were you at this event?  I I hesitate to call it an event.  But in the middle, in the middle of Black Hat,  we got into a car and drove from Vegas to Hatchipi.  Yeah. And I saw this happen.  Did he have anesthesia?

Start time: 7216.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no. So so love for who's the bearded guy on the table.  He had it done to him.  He had it done to the surgeon, did it to himself first.  First. Yeah.  And the surgeon is a guy named  sorry, Jeff Tibbetts.  He runs an event called Grindfest,  which is not about schlocky movies, but the the sort of nom de guerre  of this community are grinders.  They're people who do self insertions or or other insertions of  biotechnology, a lot of it's out electromagnets and fingertips.  This is probably the most substantial implant ever done.

Start time: 7335.20
End time: 7365.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, there's one of the interesting things about the biohacking  movement is that it encompasses a very wide range of technology  that people are not necessarily being given access to.  They know that the technology exists to help them.  And one of the most apparent ways that this is coming across is  is literally building artificial pancreases.  That's cool. Out of insulin pumps.  See, that's great.  Well, they think this is great.  I mean, it's you know, it's it's an interesting idea.

And so when it's called a peg leg, because it's in the leg, right,  right, right below your charging, right below your pocket.  And when you have the battery in your pocket, it turns on.  You don't want someone to see the device.

Start time: 7398.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so a lot of what he does with his with his four thieves,  vinegar collective is demonstrate the possibilities of technology,  put the instructions out there for him.  And then, you know, theoretically, people will will take advantage of it.  There, I think, were they to become more popular,  there would be, I think, some ethical concerns that would have to be discussed.

Immigration and all these issues that intersect with technology.  And it's actually a surprisingly good read.  You would kind of expect that something by the president of a large tech company  would be boilerplate.

One of the authors, the very famous authors of the Clutrain Manifesto.  He's written a new book called Everyday Chaos, Technology, Complexity  and How We're Thriving in the New World of Possibility.  And Ant, who saw the show, said it was really good.  So it's on my list of much must watched episodes of triangulation.  You might want to catch it at twit.tv slash T.R.I.  We do twit every Sunday afternoon, right after the radio show.  That's usually around two thirty Pacific, five thirty Eastern, twenty one thirty UTC.  If you want to be in studio, just email tickets at twit.tv.  Tony came and visit us. Nice to have you, Tony.  Some guy named Ant's here. He's kind of bigger than an ant.  Misnamed. I always love having you in studio.  Just email tickets at twit.tv so we can make sure we got a seat for you.  You can also watch the live stream from wherever you are, anywhere in the world.  Tweet.tv slash live. Listen to we've got audio and video streams at twit.tv slash live.  If you're doing that, the chat room is the place to be.  It's right here in my thigh.  Just got it on a hard drive in my thigh.  Just go to. But you don't have to show.  You don't have to plug into my thigh.  You just go to IRC.  To it, Todd TV and join us because it's a lot of fun.  It's family friendly.  It's a great place to hang out.  Some nice people in there.  On demand versions of everything we do available at the website,  twit.tv or, you know, ask your Amazon Echo or your Google Assistant, say, hey, Echo,  listen to this week in tech or play this week in tech.  And you can get the most recent episode.  In many cases, it'll also play the live stream.  So you can say Echo play twit live and it will play the live stream  so you can listen in wherever you are.  And you can also download copies of the episode by subscribing.  That's probably the best way to do it.  And your Apple podcast, your Google podcast, subscribe on YouTube,  wherever you get your podcast, podcasts.  If you subscribe, we'll be sure to get it right into your device.
