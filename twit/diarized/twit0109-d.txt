Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go ahead, adjust your microphone. No, I'm now having that whole like, what's the movie,  the baseball movie? The natural? No, after the Susan Srander. And Tim Robbins. Bull Durham.  Yeah, in the whole baseball. Kevin Costner. Yeah. There's a whole. That's right, there's 108.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stitches in a baseball, absolutely. And 108 beads in a rosary. In a rosary. And. Coincidence,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think not. And that's when I decided to give Coliseum a chance, or however that speech is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? No, I have to go back and watch that. Patrick is in studio, which is cool. You also  hear Tom Merritt via Skype. He is the head honcho at Buzz Out Loud, bol.cnet.com. Don't say that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll get in trouble with Molly. Molly's the. Co-honchos. She's the head honch-ess. The hest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go. So you're the honcho, she's the honch-ee. No, that doesn't work at all. Molly.  Honch-off. Molly can now beat me up. She'll beat us both up. From Oxford, England, with one hand  tie behind her back. I think she can. From Oxford, England, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Will Harris.  Hello, good evening. We'll let him announce this, but something new and exciting. Are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gonna announce it on the show today? Well, there's not much to announce yet. We have a couple of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weeks. Okay, so we'll just kind of, veiled illusions. We'll just be content with those.  What's up with that? Well, speaking of veiled illusions, Mr. Patrick Norton. So you told the  world on the last DLTV that you were leaving. Well, a couple episodes ago. Yeah, I guess it  more since then. I don't know. I haven't watched again. Oh, I'm so sorry and sad. Nice tone in that  voice. Poor Robert Heron and Roger Chang have to go all alone without Pat. They will carry it mightily  upon their shoulders. And you also announced that you're with Childe. Yes. Which is great.  Congratulations. I thought it was his wife. It is his wife. Well, she is with Childe, though.  We as a household are with Childe. They'll be with Childe soon enough. She's due soon. Yes,  mid October. And I forgot, do you know if it's a boy or girl or do you care? We're doing it old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  school. We're keeping it completely surprise. You'll check when it arrives? Yeah. We're just  looking for like a clean bill of parts. That's right. Just a good APCAR score is all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whack. It all begins with the APCAR score and then for the rest of your life, it's test scores all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the way. Actually, we're thinking about getting them into the union training program for painting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in San Francisco. Good money. It'd be amazing money. Did you just have your apartment painted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that why you're thinking that? No, I just was looking at career options and thinking,  if I just become a union electrician, I'd be retired in like five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good point. It's sad for those of us who labor in the ink stained fields.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also just one of the running jokes. And I know you've had this feeling when you've  looked around and Tom, you've had this feeling too where you look around and you go, so  when did the little thing in our palm turn silver and everybody in television and print  and audio like radio explodes? Because there's like nobody over the age of 50 and there's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  three 50 year olds. I just heard that the Chronicle is laying off more than a quarter of its staff,  over a hundred staffers. Bad time to be in print media. Bad time to be in print media. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's been rough actually across magazines and newspapers. I'm hoping for a return to patronage

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  where you can just, you could just have, you know, a very rich person just pay you to,  you know, write stuff for the rest of your life. We tried that at tech TV. It was awkward. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we did have a patron. That's a very good point. Paul Allen was our, was our Medici.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. I didn't even think of that. Well, if we'd done it more directly to satisfy the  Paul Allen needs, I think it might've been more successful. I think you're exactly right. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  maybe one of the flaws of tech TV was it didn't serve the patron. Yeah. Unless the billionaire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tells you what the billionaire wants. Well, we all empty billionaire. Right. It's hard to serve

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the billionaire market because he did. He wanted eight hours of live news programming and a Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show. And he changed his mind then right after that. He said, no, I don't think so. I made a  mistake. So Patrick, I would be remiss if I didn't say, where are you going? Are you going to get  another job? Are you going to stay at home? What are you planning? Everybody's saying, you know,  he's going to revision three, but I keep telling him that was the Valley wag. There's no confirmation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's, there's no confirmation of that. I'll actually be able to talk about it. I think next  week. So look for an announcement next week. East meets West. Yeah. On East. Yeah. I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  promised East meets West and exclusive. Wait a minute. No, no, no. I've been, that's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. I've just been working very hard to promote East meets West. The fabulous podcast done  by Roger Chang and Tom Merritt. It primarily covers international relations and, and, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who's East and West? Primarily doesn't do nothing. Well, I'm really glad to have you all on board.  John C. Dvorak says he can't be here today because he's in the North country, which sounds like,  I don't know. It sounds like a Bob Dylan tune. He's a sad eyed man of the North country. But there  are lots of things to talk about. I hardly know where to start. I guess we should start with  DEFCON because that's where you were last week, Patrick Norton. Did you go to Black Hat too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or just DEFCON? Just DEFCON. Basically got into DEFCON on Friday. And it's, I mean, for those of  you who don't know, DEFCON is sort of the rowdy little brother of Black Hat. Black Hat's one of  the more famous security conferences for people who research security flaws or try to protect  their networks or, you know, pretty much anything. But then they hang around. You get a lot of the  same presentations. For a hundred bucks, you get a lot of the same presentations that cost you a few  thousand bucks at Black Hat. You just have to deal with larger crowds, less seating, and, you know.  Dateline NBC, Dateline reporters. Oh, that was absolutely brilliant. What was it? Did you see it?  No, actually, I was actually on the phone with somebody when it happened. What was really funny  is the Dateline reporters- We all saw it on YouTube. I should say there's a good video of it.  Well, there's a good, one of the videos on YouTube has my friend Grant from the nerds list. And  there's sort of, the nerds list is this listserv of a bunch of people who are kind of geeky.  And we've basically gotten almost everybody together at Def Con. And we do a dinner on  Friday night. We talk about the sessions and actually get to see these because we, you know,  the listserv on a good day is like two emails and on a bad day is like 200 emails if the arguments  kind of get frothing. And so Grant turns out to be friends with this Dateline reporter. He knows her?  He knows her. All right. And is walking into the building as she is sprinting out of the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of felt bad after watching that video. I felt like she was really being almost harassed.  Well, here's the thing, right?  Just explain the story is that she was an associate producer of Dateline NBC doing the traditional-  Probably still is.  Yeah, probably is. Doing the traditional Dateline NBC secret cam thing, the pinhole cam,  to catch a hacker, to catch a predator. But she had refused press credentials and snuck in,  essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, here's the thing. I don't want to take, you know,  sympathy away from an intrepid reporter, but here's the deal is they basically pitched that  they were going to, they basically pitched her, there's layers to this story of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know more than others, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've, you know, people get intoxicated. I'm sober. I remember what they say.  But let's just put it this way. She was offered press credentials several times,  at least twice is my understanding before DEFCON. And she was offered press credentials a couple  times at DEFCON. Now, this is important because DEFCON is a gathering of not just, you know,  hackers, but also security researchers and also a lot of people who work in federal government.  And a lot of these people do not like to be photographed, period. And part of the reason,  part of the deal with being press at DEFCON is the only way you're supposed to, you know,  you're, the terms of entrance is that if you're press, you wear a press badge and you get  permission before you photograph anybody or videotape anybody.  Perfectly reasonable.  Yeah, it's really simple. And, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if she didn't want to do that, she wanted to catch hackers on tape saying,  and then we're going to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's much more obnoxious than that. She wanted to catch a hacker doing something  illegal in front of a Fed to show how federal agents are complicit.  Oh, God.  Yeah, because, you know, and there's, you know, there's been some really good writing on this,  but essentially she wanted to expose federal agents letting illegal things happen at DEFCON.  And so she's, you know, it's, and it's like, it's, it's classic sleazy,  let's grab attention headline reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how Dateline works. What makes me sad is it's also how just in general technology coverage  on the networks is it's all about sensationalism and not about,  Is your computer going to die?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I thought as they followed her out to the parking lot, that they definitely walked the line,  but people didn't try to obstruct her. They didn't touch her. They merely taunted her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were verbally abusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And mostly what they were saying was, we just want to ask you some questions. We just want to ask you  some questions, which is exactly what the Dateline reporters do when they're hounding somebody. So,  yeah, it probably was verbally abusive, but there, there's certainly some irony there of somebody who  makes their living running after people getting run after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the funny part was also is it's been interesting as there's been more and more,  there's a classic DEFCON game, which is called Spot the Fed. And the idea is you look for some,  and there's a lot of feds that go to DEFCON from-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they know that this is going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're invited. Matter of fact, they do a panel that's like Meet the Fed.  And some pretty high level people come out and they spend a lot of time talking to people  during their panels and then after their panels. It's pretty cool to see this interaction between  sort of the hacker community, the security researchers, and the people who are sort of  enforcing the law for the FBI, the DOJ. And so the opening of the Meet the Fed panel,  which is unfortunate, I was like dealing with a deadline and I would have loved to have seen  the guy that runs the conference standing up there and going, instead of doing Spot the Fed,  we're going to do something a little interesting, it's Spot the Embedded Reporter.  That's what he said. Yeah.  At which point the Embedded Reporter stood up and sprinted out of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She knew what was coming. They didn't even get to show her picture. That was the next thing  they were going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's funny. You can get into the hole like, well, it's against the first amendment to  restrict people.  Yeah, I know, but it's like you can't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a private meeting. And I think that there were ground rules and she didn't follow the  ground rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And they offered her, they said, if you'd like to register, you can stay. They said that-  They didn't even chase her out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they said, come get your press credentials. She just wanted to, she had this agenda and-  Yeah.  Date line, I shouldn't even say she, Dateline had this agenda.  Let's blame Dateline because I don't think it's necessarily her fault.  Unless she pitched the story and I mean, we don't know who pitched the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Either way, do yourself a favor if you're going to Defcon as a reporter, be open and up front  about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't think there'll be repercussions for her. You don't think they'll hack her and try to mess  with her and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she took her Facebook page down. I know that much.  Did she?  Yeah.  Smart move.  Yeah. But it's, I mean, it's an interesting thought, right? I don't think anybody, I don't,  yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are enough childish people that, I shouldn't say this.  There's enough childish people in the universe.  In the universe that somebody could decide, hey, I'm going to make an example of this girl.  And certainly, or this woman and certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or twit.tv for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why I shouldn't be saying this.  Anything else interesting at Defcon?  Did you see any presentations you thought were compelling or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing. It's not going to make me sound like I'm waving the fear, uncertainty and doubt flag.  Couple interesting presentations vis-a-vis using, basically exploiting some holes in the way  browsers work to allow you access to secured networks.  And I'm not going to even get into that because I'll screw up explaining it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crashed the passport RFID readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a magnificent presentation because what the guy's done, he's basically,  I wish I could think of his name. And it was an amazing presentation because he basically  built a bespoke box that if he hooks it into a card reader, basically unscrew the, you know,  he's like, are you being protected by a piece of plastic and two screws was kind of the theme.  And he basically did the underlying technology of all the existing pass card readers and  which ones were grossly useless and sort of going up through the level of security.  But he goes up to the one of the more secure kind of passes, which it's not an RFID tag,  but it's a similar piece of technology. But what was interesting is he basically built  a piece of electronics that patches into the line. And then he can program that little  IC and PCB board to allow to either clone somebody's pass or to clone the last pass  that comes through or to deny anyone access to that room. And then he sort of has  stages of developments of this and like stage four will be with a GSM module. So he'll be able  to track who's going in and out of a building anywhere in the world. Very Tom Cruise. I like  it. Well, it's really interesting. And it's physical security has been something it's been  something people have seriously been looking at in the past few years, the bump, the bump keys,  and just lockpicking before that and understanding that physical security, it's much easier to hack  a network if you are inside the building. And a lot of physical security is kind of like,  you're being protected by a lock that says secure. Well, those Medco locks, I thought that was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting. They made a bump key for the Medco supposedly. Yeah, Medcos are pretty badass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The scary lockpicking people usually say the best things, Medcos. We'll stay away from those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MySpace kind of little slap to a security researcher disclosed security vulnerabilities  in the MySpace site. So they yanked his profile. He was speaking at Defcon. Rick Deacon, I don't  know if you saw it, it was a cross site scripting attack that uses JavaScript,  iframes and a separate web server. It's a pretty nasty hack. What all you have to do is get the  MySpace user to click a bogus link and you can copy their session cookies and their log data  or actually modify their MySpace session cookies and log data. MySpace apparently knew about the  talking, sent a terms of service violation notice to him and kicked him off MySpace.  They also fixed it. Did they fix it? That's the main thing. I think I read somewhere that they  actually took his research and then fixed it. I would hope so. Yeah, apparently MySpace, this is  according to TG Daily, MySpace apparently fixed the vulnerability a short time later and Deacon's  attack now redirects to a Google page. I guess in a way when you do that kind of thing, you are  violating the terms of service. That is a violation, but if you're doing it publicly  and telling people about it, you're doing them a favor. Did you see the Facebook source code  leak? I thought that was interesting. There's apparently some sort of flaw in PHP and the  source code for Facebook's main index page has leaked. It's been posted on a blog called,  it's really a one time only blog, an anonymous blog called Facebook Secrets.  And the thinking is that it's a well known hole in a PHP, but this is out there and almost everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  agrees it's the real deal. Just put it out under the GPL. Yeah, there you go, open source it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say, oh, we meant to do it. It's not like Facebook source code has got magnificent industry secrets,  like they're fantastically efficient friend adding technology or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what they say. They say it was a misconfigured server. It was our source code.  It's not a security breach, doesn't compromise user data in any way. And however, the reprinting of  the code violates laws and we ask that you don't repeat it. So it's useless, but please don't hand  it out. Sorry. This just has me all excited about SCO finally getting slapped to the ground.  And yeah, it's over our long national nightmare. Well, it's almost over.  SCO sues in 2003, sues IBM and ultimately Novell over SCO for lack of any viable business model  decides to sue large company computing. It was real good for their stock for a while,  but it dragged on and on. The stock came back down and now a judge this week says that the  trademark Linux or Unix and the rights to Unix are legally officially part of Novell. They've got it  legitimately. SCO has no rights to this. And the good news is I think that that means the IBM case,  which is still hanging out, which is supposed to be decided at the end of the month will probably  go the same way. I mean, it's hard to imagine it going a different way after this. So it's over.  We've been talking about it since day one on Twitter. So I'm glad we can finally close the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  book on this one. Pre-date Twitter even? Yeah, predates Twitter by a couple of years. IBM case

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does, I think, right? SCO sued IBM in 2003. Yeah. So predates us considerably. But I remember you  talking about it back then. On tech TV, we probably talked about it. So anyway, it's over. Thank  goodness. Even Moglen, who I really like even, we interviewed him for Floss Weekly. He's the guy who  did GPL3. He's at the Software Freedom Law Center. He said it was argued that this was supposed to  suggest riskiness in open source. It turns out the open source world was rock solid from the beginning.  So a big, big victory for open source. Maybe SCO can go partner with Perfect 10 now.  They're going, Perfect 10 sues Microsoft. They lost against Google, the thumbnail image issue.  They're a porno site. Google was in there. Microsoft have bigger thumbnails or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's an argument about that. We're going to talk about the guy who now has smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thumbnails a little bit. Which one is the biggest? Is it Microsoft or Google?  According to Perfect 10, they sued Google. They sued Amazon. They're appealing the decision.  They claim the MSN search engine can find passwords that have been improperly posted  on other websites and enable access. So now it's not thumbnails. It's illegally posted passwords

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to Perfect 10. That's just web pages, isn't it? That's like saying Microsoft finds information  posted on the internet. It's quite a shocker because that Microsoft search engine can find  anything. It's pretty impressive. But you went away and sued Google for the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. It seems like... Isn't the code to be able to detect multiple logins from different  IPs across the same password pretty rock solid at this point? Couldn't they just kick these people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out? They claim they're losing $4 million a month. That's pretty bogus. And if they win this case,  of course, search engines go out of business. What are you going to say? Well, we've got to see what  we're indexing. Is it a password? It better not. I just have a feeling they thought Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably didn't have it together as Google, which is silly. Of course, Microsoft has a very  good team of lawyers. Why you go after them next, I don't understand. There's plenty of smaller  search engines they could have gone after. It's probably just pure publicity, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's that short guy at the bar that goes from fight to fight to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's the next biggest bully? I'll tell you who does have smaller thumbnails. The North Denver fella.  I don't... This does not ring true to me. Thomas Martel, he's actually in Bonnie Bray, Colorado,  had his thumb surgically altered to work better on his iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to be a legit story. It's certainly being reported everywhere.  Whittling. His thumbs were whittled down. He said he's a heavy PDA user and he's always been  frustrated that his thumbs were too big to properly operate PDA keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't seem like this should even be legal. The procedure involved making a small incision

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  into the thumbs and shaving down the bone. That's gotta hurt. He says he has no problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lifting anything. He's surprised by the fact that he can't open spaghetti sauce jars as well as he

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  used to. I wish we had pictures. I'm glad we don't actually. Apparently his thumbs now are kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out of proportion to the rest of his hand. I have this vision of a six foot eight contractor dude  who can pick up a four by four with little tiny thumbs. You got girl thumbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God. Back to security. The open BSD team mocked at the first ever,  now do we pronounce this pony awards? Yes. Were you at the ponies? Oh my God, ponies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you at the ponies? I often get emails criticizing me for saying pwned instead of  owned. Instead of owned? Yeah. Yeah. I owned your box. You could say owned but then. I know that's  what you're saying but there's a P there and it's much more fun to say pwn. Yeah. Plus it makes you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  feel like you're an LOL cat. Exactly. I can has whatever I want. I can has pwns. I has your power  supplies. What is it with the LOL cats? It just makes me so. We should put a link to the LOL cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't be cute cats. You like them Will Harris? Oh come on everybody likes them. Your girlfriend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  likes them. This is just a way for you to continue to have sex isn't it? Admit it.  Yeah listen to that laugh. He's guilty. Some cat. Yeah I know that there are people who like  LOL cats. It's beyond me what the cuteness is. I love the LOL cats. You love them too? I also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wear a skirt on national television so apparently my masculinity is suspect. No it's not. It's not  suspect. Very comfortable with it. Anyhow I can has a cheeseburger dot com. C-H-E-E-Z burger dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's not spread this meme. It's already spread. It's already spread. The cat's out of the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently intelligent people like Veronica are doing this and now I hear that Patrick and Will.  Yeah it's bad enough. You've never made one though have you? It's bad as the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  delete expletives. The dumb delete expletives are doing it but Veronica Belmont a sensible intelligent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  human being. Clearly I'm missing something here. It's sort of a twisted like hang in there. You  know that old poster with the cat? Yeah it's just sort of a twisted version of that. How long before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we had poker playing dogs saying cute slogans? You just invented the next meme. Check your boards  Leo they're showing up now. What are they doing in Britain? Is it different? Is there cultural? Is  there at least somewhere preserving somehow this great Anglo-Saxon culture of ours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on how can you not laugh at that? Okay my ears. As much as anybody else. Backordered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Backordered. My ears backordered. Oh he doesn't have any ears. A little kitty in a box without  any ears. My ears backordered. Who was it wrote an entire linguistic analysis of the LOL cats?  Oh yeah I remember seeing that too. Somebody intelligent. Like a grammar of LOL cats. A grammar.  LOL cats grammar. Yeah he even told you how you should be writing these from now on.  So if you oh Aneel Dash that's right of six apart. Oh Patrick's looking at LOL cats and laughing.  Okay there's a cat looking. I'm looking down verbing your. Cat with really big eyes saying.  What is he saying? Another Red Bull thanks. Aneel Dash. Eye has idiosyncratic conjugation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you know there's a controversy on what to call them too. There are some people I know.  Ryan Block from Engadget for one much prefers to not call them LOL cats. He calls them something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh kitten something. Kitten captions. Kitten captions. He's just going for the alliteration

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  obviously. No it's not that. It's some sort of alternate name for them. Well you know it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually predate the cats. It's this image macro capability right. Oh kitten macros. Cat macros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's I guess technically what they are. Well I guess it's but you're always going to be  annoyed with some memes that come around the internet. These amuse me at least. Hey if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  keep doing this I'm going to start singing chocolate rain. I gotta warn you. Chocolate rain.  You don't know about that? Apparently not. Uh oh we're going to leave that alone because  otherwise we'll have no more listeners. Obviously Tom knows what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about that? I haven't actually. I've refrained from going and watching it. I've heard enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people imitate it. That's enough for me. You have to. I don't want to get into it. For more  on chocolate rain check your local library. Go to MacBreak Weekly 51. I believe we spent many many  minutes playing the song, dissecting the song. Anyway back to the uh the ponies.  There are little gold ponies by the way. Can you bet on the ponies? No it's a P.O. which by the way  would if they really are if this is just uh uh something that the the ZDNet blogs put in there  to give it a graphic touch but there's a little gold pony. If it is the in fact have a little gold  pony award. I think we've conclusively proven it should be pronounced pony. There you go. The Open  BSD team won the award for the most spectacular mishandling of a critical security vulnerability  instead of acknowledging it as a problem they and fixing it. Uh they they uh just downgraded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good way to handle it. It just goes to show that open source doesn't even mean doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  always mean clever. Have you been watching this Mike Shaver uh little mimosilla fricca? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is also at uh you know I heard about it but it went right over my head. So I mean I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if it's really a big deal but uh uh somebody uh Mike Shaver who is uh you know kind of one of the  product guys at Mozilla. Nice guy. We've interviewed him many times on a net at night. Um uh handed his  card to uh some security guy who apparently had been releasing Mozilla flaws and and and with a  little bravado I think implying that uh you know the thing the good thing about Mozilla is any flaw  we will fix it we'll fix it quickly we'll fix it right away. We'll patch flaws in 10 days.  He wrote it in a little more aggressive way. He gave him his card and said 10 effing days on the  card and I think that uh so this has gone on it's been blogged and now the Mozilla people are  saying well you know we don't want to make light of of security flaws and we can't guarantee 10  days we're not making a promise here we'll do them as fast as we can but 10 days you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  always say 10 days. Yeah well there's a they released a nice quote on it. I think it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't bug me. Anyway that just one more little security issue. Best server side bug Solaris.  Best client side bug uh on Windows of Vulnerability. The Pony for Mass Ownage  won by the unknown hacker who found the WMF flaw which was massively massively used.  They estimate a million people got hacked on MySpace by that one. The Vulnerability deserves an  award for its obviousness ease of exploitation and high impact. I like these awards. This must  have been a fun event. I'm sorry you missed this. It needs one like style as well. Style.  Best Easter egg in Vulnerability. Most over hyped bug I agree with is the MacBook  Wi-Fi Vulnerability. Yeah. From last year's Black Hat. Although they did patch it. Did they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  most anticipated hack iPhone unlocking. Oh yeah that's just a matter of time. Sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think? You think not? I don't know. It's RSA it's pretty strong. It'll be a while. Well somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  can unlock it. I thought somebody had gotten close to unlocking it already. There's all sorts of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hacks. I just saw somebody's doing an NES emulator on the iPhone. They're able to put applications

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on there. Yeah that one is really fun because you get the controller actually up on the screen. The  old NES controller shows up as a touch screen. Not that that's ergonomic or anything but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  certainly cool. Cool. There are apparently in iTunes or maybe on the iPhone. I guess it's on  the iPhone strings about games. So it can only be a matter of time. I mean why wouldn't Apple?  They're already selling games on the video. Yeah but the fastest way to make sure the iPhone gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  completely unlocked in the next seven days is for me to say something like you know I can stand  outside a federal bank and it's just like I almost broke in. Okay say it. We want you to say it. I  want him to crack it. I just did. There you go. You can do it in seven days. It'll be broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With SIM cards you can like cloak two different SIM cards into one special silver SIM card and  then you can sort of get a service. Will is watching this with great interest. Wave it in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right direction on a windy day. I like the fact that somebody came up with the installer.app to  make it easier to install these different tweaks and hacks. People are coming out for the iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OS. You'd think Apple would be watching this and saying gosh I guess they want third-party applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the iPhone dev wiki guys. I think they're working on unlocking it too. Yes I'm sure they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are. I'm sure they are. Speaking of unlocking. Yes. Universal music. Do we care? Huge. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First of all EMI of course the first to do it. They did it on iTunes and if you look at sales  while CD sales still going down their online sales went up in some cases by several hundred percent  on like dark side of the moon in the first couple of days. They tripled their album sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only reason I didn't buy dark side of the moon is I own it on vinyl and it's the one thing  that it's motivating me to go and digitize all my albums one of these days. I own it on vinyl. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  own it on CD and I still bought the 256 kilobit uncopy protected on iTunes. I'm proud to say I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  own it in none of these formats but now I know where to go next time. You can borrow mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next time you want to watch Wizard of Oz. Somebody sent me when we worked at tech tv  somebody sent me a dvd with dark side of the moon and Wizard of Oz perfectly matched. I'll find that.  It's somewhere in the shelving here if you'd like to take it home with you Patrick. I'm good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the moment. Thank you. A fine parting gift. Oh yeah. Me and my pregnant wife watching the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dark side of the moon sinker. The interesting thing about the Universal thing is that they are  not going to sell on DRM music through Apple through iTunes. Well yes and I think that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  little slap at Apple. Remember Universal is the one that said we're going month to month with Apple.  Where it's really interesting is on Rhapsody because Rhapsody is going to sell.  Now I use an iPod. I couldn't download anything from Rhapsody in the past. They're going to sell  unprotected Universal music at 256 kilobits. So it's going to be good quality. I'm excited.  Is it going to be AAC or WMB? I think they use Windows Media. I imagine they'll do WMA.  But you can drag WMA into iTunes and if it's not protected and iTunes will turn it into MP3.  So this is Universal looking at what happened for EMI I think and saying hmm do you think this is  the beginning of the end? I mean we're starting to see the failure of DRM if it works for Universal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even if it's not on iTunes. Well I guess the $64,000 question is what's the revenue stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that replaces the quote lost revenue unquote. That's the thing though in my opinion there isn't  any lost revenue. The only lost revenue they have is from people not wanting to buy the songs like  me because they don't want the DRM on them. I think you see increased revenue. Yes I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the biggest DRM thing this week has to be the Google thing though surely where people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just losing their videos. Pissing people off. I mean that is just crazy. How can they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you bought a video. It's like walking into your house taking back DVDs. Explain this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you bought a video with DRM from the Google store can you know that they should turn off the  server? You can no longer play it? It won't authenticate. Yeah so you can no longer watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the video that you paid for to buy. Oh that can't be. Yeah because every time you watch a Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  video it authenticates with the Google server and they sent me a very nice email on Friday  that said hey you know August 15th we're getting out of this business because we bought YouTube so  we're shutting it all off. You won't be able to authenticate anymore but here is a credit for  Google checkout that you can use for the amount of what you paid for the movie that you thought you  owned so you can still give us some business that way and get the money back. But you get a credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so you're giving you a refund for the movie. They're trying to do the right thing but it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what are you going to do? Like if you bought a single episode of Star Trek on Google video. Which  is exactly what I did. Where are you going to go and get it? Oh well you're going to go. You got  five dollars on Google checkout. Well great that's five dollars towards like the 50 dollars for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Star Trek season or something. Which expires hard. Pirates by AR. I got two dollars credit with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  checkout. What are we going to do with that? Oh I should be getting one of those emails. I bought a  call for help episode. So that's really annoying. Hard to believe and frankly counterproductive in  terms of DRM because it is. All it's going to do is people aren't going to buy DRM stuff anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And maybe that's why Google's doing it. Although the problem is not that many people bought any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of the Google video stuff to begin with. We tried to sell our show on there and nobody wanted it.  I don't know if that's DRM, Google or me but. I bought one episode of Deep Space Nine just to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  check it out and I was really upset that I had to be connected to the internet to watch anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's also how Movie Link and the other downloadable feature movie sites  all started out. You had to be connected to the authentication and it was a big step when you could  actually view the stuff you had purchased or rented while not being connected on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a big warning to people who are buying this kind of stuff is that there's no guarantee  that this is going to be good a year from now. It seems unthinkable but Apple could turn off your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  entire music collection if you bought all your stuff from iTunes. They could do it. Well wait a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  minute. Is that true? Does iTunes go out and check to make sure I can play that song every time I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  play it? Not every time you play it but when you've authenticated it to a computer. They could  go in when you're logged in sometime and they could trip it off. What's interesting thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens if one of these companies goes out of business? Now granted if you burned it to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CD or something then you're safe. That's the way to back it up. But any kind of DRM can be turned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  off at some point. Or let me think about all the people who paid the $200 a year or two year deal  or whatever it was at Sunrocket. Sunrocket goes out of business and all of a sudden all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people that prepaid for the VoIP system are SOL. Which is why I think it's going to be hard for  UMA to convince people to pay $300 for this hardware because right after Sunrocket goes out  of business they come along with the same model. Or not the same model, a worse model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even worse. A very confusing model at least. But a great name. And who's doing their marketing?  Gary Coleman? Somebody. I can't remember. I confuse them. Time Warner admits or maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it seems to be admits that they're going to be doing some traffic shaping. This is  to bolster the arguments for net neutrality. FCC said well and Ted Stevens,  soon to be the Thelonious Ted Stevens say well no there's no problem. We'll wait until there's  a problem to pass a law. Well there's a problem now. Time Warner says they're going to implement  traffic shaping. And if you're a World of Warcraft player you may not want to be on Time Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does that traffic shaping actually mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Time Warner let me read it to you. This is the email that Time Warner sent out. Time Warner  today implemented a network management tool to improve the operation of the network for all  subscribers. As a result a small minority of users may experience slower speeds during peak hours  when using certain applications that consume lots of bandwidth. Basically every major ISP

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at the you know usually at least at the regional level if not the national level is using  either customized versions of squid or specific tools boxes such as packet here that is doing  packet shaping based on deep analysis of traffic. So anything into the content looking deep not just  the port. That was one of the things the guy was talking about earlier Kaminsky who was looking at  basically you know taking advantage of frames inside of a browser to you know penetrate networks  and set up a VPN inside of somebody's network. He was also talking about how frustrated he is that  the ISPs are doing some pretty deep and kind of nasty analysis of traffic. He finds it offensive.  So you think they are doing this now? No I know they are doing this now. One of the things we  one of the things we ran into at DLTV and a lot of people who are doing large amounts of bandwidth  distribution is you find you know customers suddenly go from you know folks that are watching  the show suddenly go from a megabit download to 50k downloads. Right. And it's not the end of the  month therefore they haven't hit their bandwidth cap or something like that. But there's there's  are networks commonly frequently and totally used tools that monitor bandwidth across customers  across the network across specific protocols and you know the the folks at BitTorrent are in sort  of a sort of a running you know dodging battle. Who is like oh I've encrypted my packets no one  will be able to tell I'm using a peer-to-peer you know tool now. Well no actually peer-to-peer has  a very significant excuse me a very predictable traffic signature. So if they can't. So it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  merely the content they're looking at what your patterns. They're looking at the patterns and how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the data moves and how the connections are moving and it's it's it's it's very serious stuff because  you know on one hand yeah you know what I don't want the kid down the street that's you know  exchanging 400 terabytes of movies every day of his life to you know screw up my ability to have  a VoIP call. On the flip side I don't want to you know something I'm targeted to be nowhere near the  capacity of my network because they don't like video moving across their network. I mean that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the thing I've been told over and over by people in the networking business that you have to shape  traffic and I don't know if that's true but they they seem very insistent that they're that everybody  does it you can't get around it. No argument. There's just not enough bandwidth to go around.  That makes sense to me. But it's what you're shaping right and it's like who gets to decide

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how it gets allocated. Well and if you shape Skype because you have your own voice over internet  you know business that's pretty awful and that's just anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know it could be let's let's brazenly assume and it may be a pretty brazen assumption  that none of the major ISPs are targeting shaping against competitive products to what they offer.  You know maybe they're giving a little preferential treatment to their own  packets but let's let's just take the great furry assumption that they're not you know.  You're going to be benign. You're going to be very positive.  You'll be very positive about this. The flip side of that is you know what you just said Tom is  they've basically been selling all of us the idea that we're paying for five megabits of access and  the truth is the truth is is they're perfectly willing to give me five megabits of access for  my fifty dollars a month as long as we do it for maybe 100k 250k maybe a half of you know 500k at  a pop max. Right. And as soon as I get to the point where I want my five megabits per second  you know for a 200 megabyte download they go no no no no no no no no no you don't understand. You  see if you had a commercial account which would be 900 dollars a month we could actually give you  what we promise. Is it that it's what you think you purchase is it the amount of total amount

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of data they're looking at or the throughput that they're looking at. They're looking at they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  looking at all of it. I mean basically they're looking at they're going to be looking across  individual accounts right. They're going to be looking to target problem users right and by that  they're going to be associating you know your IP address with the volume of data you consume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time Warner denies that they ever sent this email out. Although many World of Warcraft  users in Rochester New York and other areas are saying you know all of a sudden we can't you know  we're getting lag latency freezing. Time Warner says it's not us and it's hard to prove that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the real problem. Well that's what's really like the guys that we had a chance to interview some  of one of the guys from Packeteer and they're like look you know we work really hard to leave  no fingerprint on the packets. You know the flip side is you know if there's always going to be  something to blame. The other thing like one of the things I've learned in the last two years  moving so much video across the web is that boy you know it's really easy to you know if you have  anything that's you know where latency is critical or a high bandwidth flow is critical you know it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really easy to break your tubes. Right. But is there really a bandwidth crunch because that's  usually the cry that they say when they're like well I know we're saying five megabytes but we  can't allow that to people because we just don't have enough bandwidth. Well what's interesting is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe think about it this way what's the maximum capacity for a cable node right and then remember  that a cable node is essentially operating let's pull a number a random number let's call it a  your local cable node is effectively a 10 megabit per second you know ethernet system for your  entire neighborhood. Now if your entire neighborhood is in squeed on can the entire town is 3000 people  and you've got like six nodes it's probably not that big a deal if you're living like you do in  Oakland or I do in San Francisco where there may be you know 40,000 people you know what I mean  it's just you know the more people you throw on the node isn't there all this dark fiber and I mean  isn't there really a lot of dark fiber doesn't help a lot in the last mile. Well it's dark right  now. Well last mile you're saying that's one thing. Dark fiber is great so you know Google can light  up their their backbone system but the dark fiber doesn't mean squat when you're talking about your  local DSL provider or cable provider or microwave provider where they have a finite amount of  bandwidth for the given equipment that they own and upgrading that equipment may not be something  they want to do because you know if you upgrade your equipment you're taking away from the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  line of profits. My idyllic dream that I know is just pie in the sky is that the dark fiber gets  hooked to... Wait a minute we can't hear because of your idyllic music go ahead what's your idyllic  dream? That the dark fiber gets hooked up to the Ymax and then yeah and then that's the last mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Ymax has the same congestion issues. Yeah the problem is Ymax is a lot like EVDO in the sense  that the more people that have sharing it the less bandwidth to go around. Right right. You just need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  more repeaters and then it ends up being the same problem as Wi-Fi. Same issue. What comes after

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gigabit? Terabit? Terabit we need petabit we need like petabit you know we need petabit transmission

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  capabilities. They're talking about terabit routers I mean they're talking about getting this kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  capability built. Yeah I mean basically we all need to pony up and and cut giant checks to get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  internet 2 working. Yeah baby. Well and then the other thing you hear and I don't know if it's  true but we have a lot of listeners for instance in Sweden where they all say oh baby we have a  hundred megabits up and a hundred megabits down. Yeah and you've got nine million people and almost  all of them are in urban areas. You know what great so you know let's wire Connecticut. But I love them.  I love them too. And they're happy. I wonder if Sigrid needs a roommate.  The Broadcom is one in this Qualcomm baton fight in fact the federal government  upheld a ban by the USITC on the importation of smartphones containing the Qualcomm chipsets  because of this battery saving patent tentative award for 40 million dollars in damages. The judge  said you know it's not there's a spectrum of improper conduct he said and Qualcomm's conduct  was not at the most egregious end of the spectrum. However damages are due and more than the damages  it really worries me about what kinds of smartphones are going to get in the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah this is starting to look bad. I really thought there would be some sort of settlement  yeah between Broadcom and Qualcomm and they're nobody's blinking. What phones have these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Qualcomm chipsets in them anybody know? I mean what phones are we not I think there's some of  the a lot of the HTC phones will not be entering the country. I just I've it's all so confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the majority of 3G phones use the Qualcomm almost all of them yeah so it essentially and I don't  think it's 100% true but essentially if you can't have any Qualcomm chips then you don't have any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  new 3G phones. I'm telling you that edge on my iPhone is looking better all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The wi-fi looks fine yeah the wi-fi is okay. I'm just glad I'm not the only person on this podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that hasn't invested in an iPhone. We can arrange you we can arrange an iPhone for you. Let's get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick an iPhone. Will do you have an iPhone? No you don't right? Yeah I have one. He bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am the only one without one. I love his blog post his blog post is hey I was in New York and  I got an iPhone and I also got engaged but I got an iPhone. Nice priorities there Will. Are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  still engaged after that post? Was it an engagement iPhone? It was actually yeah there you go which

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was awesome. It was rocking. Did she get an iPhone? No she got the ring. Well I bet it was a good ring.  I bet it was a ring tone. There you go. Ring ring tone. There is a new application I haven't tried  I just downloaded it supposedly lets you put ring tones on the iPhone I don't know how hard that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah iPhone-tastic yeah I haven't tried it yet either because I'm afraid. I'm afraid I don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to I'm not going to mess with this thing. I'm not going to mess with this. Now I have totally given

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up on my old iPod now and I've turned it into a rock box and I wiped it off and tried to install  OS X on it and I'm abusing it now because I have the iPhone. Isn't that funny eight gigs isn't much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it wasn't it's enough and I and that's all I've been listening to all my books on tape are on the  iPhone I guess they're not on tape they're on bits my books on bits on the iPhone. Hey speaking  of which we got it's time for our audible commercial I'm just going to throw this in here slip this  in so nobody will notice as as always audible.com sponsoring many of the podcasts on to it we're  really grateful to have them aboard and there is a special deal if you go to audible.com slash  twit you can sign up for an audible account and get a credit for a free book if you decide not to  stick around no charge no obligation and we've got the book for you don't we Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes ladies and gentlemen today we'd like to offer you a fine chance to. Where's your book it's the  new Steven Gibson here I'll hold it up for everybody watching William Gibson.  William Gibson's Spook Country. Oh I can't wait to read it. His latest fantastic gathering of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  memes and social interaction. He's doing it old school he's actually reading the print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I got my text issues I was in green apple books and spotted it. How is it? It's if you  liked pattern recognition you'll like this if you hated pattern recognition you won't like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really I love that who didn't like pattern were there people who wanted Neuromancer is that what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the issue was you know the more you know seamless eyeglass implants and strange karate internet  battles which hey I love you look don't get me wrong you know burning glasses burning excuse me  burning chrome actually is one of my favorite I love sure story of all time yeah I really love

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that but so it is it is it cyberpunk or is it the end of cyberpunk no it's it's a it's very similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a similar universe to the one that takes place in pattern recognition where it's it's  contemporary it's kind of you know elite hipster people chasing ephemeral trends in society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love to pattern recognition was about somebody who had a sensitivity to trends brand brands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually so the stronger the stronger a brand logo was the more likely she was to sort of puke in her

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  own shoes yeah it's great I just love that. I think we interviewed William Gibson right after  that came out and we did I remember talking to him big fan of his stuff I love pattern recognition  Spook Country is just out in hardcover but you can get it at audible.com as well and I'm sure it's a  great listen I'm sorry it's on my my next listen that's one of the things I like about audible it's  a cue just like Netflix where you queue up your next book and then automatically every month I get  a new book and I just I cannot wait Spook Country by William Gibson that's our pick for the week  one of many many many books you can get at audible.com slash  twit we really encourage you if you haven't yet signed up for audible.com  to to take advantage of that offer audible.com slash twit and if you are already an audible  member and I know most of our listeners now are all audible members nice this is a good one Spook  Country from William Gibson you know I have we have I got an email from Christopher Moore  who wrote a series of just great vampire books you suck is his latest  and he just sent me all his stuff and it's all on audible.com and I didn't know but he's a fan of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  twit very cool I like the the title the stupidest angel oh yeah baby yeah his titles are fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't wait to read one of those he's a twit fan I had no idea a longtime tech tv viewer he sent  me a great note and a bunch of audio books so Chris it's good to meet you we'll get you we're  gonna get him on Mac break weekly because apparently he's making the move to to Mac from  PC and he's he's using parallels to make it easier for him very nice so there's another one  actually we'll add that make a secondary book that's also on audible you suck by Christopher

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moore Chris can he separate the numinous from the quotidian we're talking about a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  little log rolling on the back of the William Gibson book by was it the San Francisco Chronicle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reviewer no actually I think that was the that was the Washington Post book world  a writer who can conjure the numinous out of the quotidian I just love that yeah that's that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I plan to you know what when I get home tonight I'm gonna conjure the numinous out of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quotidian yeah well you know you still won't be the great poet of crowds which is what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle said great poet of crowds I have to think about that one  yeah I'm not sure what that means exactly not sure I guess if you can have the wisdom of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crowds you can have the poetry of the crowd yeah sure sure that wouldn't be an author that would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just go to the madness of crowds is a great read by the way the madness of crowds is the opposite  of the wisdom of crowds yes yeah who wrote that's the idiocy of an Italian fellow yeah I remember  that computer problem strands 25 this is why you don't want to fly into Los Angeles International  Airport Will Harris computer problem strands 2500 international passengers for five hours Saturday  at LAX because the customs computer was broke oops it was broke you would they actually started

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rerouting flights to other airports now this wasn't because that was one of the things that  came out at Black Hat as researchers have figured out how to crash passport RFID right right they  believe that's the that's kind of like once you can show it a malformed jpeg and it goes  and they feel that's kind of like the the baby step towards being able to actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hack the passport if you can cross a buffer overflow now you just have to figure out where to insert

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know it was called aluminum foil aluminum foil yeah I can imagine like it was hard enough  for me to get into Canada when I went up to Vancouver yes did you get a question what you  had a bunch of electronics with you yeah I had a couple yeah I had two hundred dollar camcorders  with me oh there you go it's slagged out of line I guess it wasn't carrying enough luggage and I was  only in town for 24 hours ergo I must be a security I gotta say if I see Patrick Norton coming into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's up to no good there's no question about it yeah that'd be a lot funnier if it wasn't me we  were talking about were you wearing your kilt too no I was I was looking very much like an upstanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  citizen actually in Canada you could have worn your kilt you might have gotten through no problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that was the problem yeah yeah I don't know I I don't know what we love that we love the guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and kilt stuff in Canada oh yeah we do a judge has overturned that big patent judgment against  Microsoft from Alcatel Lucent this is you know I tell you this patent situation is just a mess  the judge said Microsoft did not violate the patent after all and said one of the two patents  and says the second one's on shaky ground that was the biggest award in history remember it was a  1.52 billion dollar award it's a mp3 compression patent lucent got the technology Alcatel bought  the technology from Fraunhofer or I don't know that we tried to describe it last time and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  never got got it right well eventually the judge decided that actually Fraunhofer did they licensed  it own part of the technology so they were capable of licensing it so Microsoft had obtained it  legally so in actual fact there was no case to answer I think ours I mean that's great for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody else I think ours Tectica had the first almost lucid explanation of this the underlying  technology was developed that's high praise and Fraunhofer together Bellabs became lucent  and so they both own it yes you own this half you own the other half and that's why they're at odds  over it because they both think they have the patent so I actually ordered the new mac the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like but as soon as the apple store opened it's so pretty it looks just like my iPhone only 24

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  inches you got the 24 inch one yeah with the extreme am I crazy I don't know I think the 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inch one looks huge well 24 it's gonna be like yeah I like those 24 inch screens I got the Dell  24 in there I love it so those of you who aren't staring at Leo's desk with the pathetic 19 inch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  samsung monitor next to the what 39 inch apple monitor it's just 30 inch apple monitor where are  you going to put where's the 20 inch oh that's 24 inch 24 I'll put it right here and then I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be like uh I don't know I won't I won't have any more children that's for sure yeah wrap things  with tin foil and the new and actually there's a lot of controversy over the new iLife because  apple completely wrote iphone and took out a lot of the capabilities of uh I'm not iphone did I say  iPhone iMovie and took out a lot of the capabilities of iMovie no plugins although they added a  capability that I think is very interesting a direct post to YouTube and in fact Google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all over this new release I just realized I'm on camera sorry no no that's okay is that being

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  broadcast no no it's just on I'm just taping it for the lawsuit later uh the uh the iWeb their  web application has built-in Google AdSense I think this nexus between Apple and Google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  getting clearer and clearer what's I mean what's going on with the features they removed from  iMovie is that because they want to push people to that to final cut express I think what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what's going on because they rewrote it from the ground up it's like and it wasn't that great to  begin with honestly but then then why start totally over I mean iMovie is iMovie is a really nice tool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it gets the job done if you want it basically if you want to hack together some video really fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  iMovie is great well you'll like it what they should have done is renamed it they should have  said it's not iMovie it's home movie because you'll like this because it's great for banging stuff  out it just has fewer there's no plugins it's a shame that they know themes there's far fewer  transitions far fewer titling capabilities but it has this really cool thing which you will love  called skimming in fact it's all over iLife where you can live preview any thumbnail just by dragging  the mouse over and seeing it you got to see it it's a it's really quite impressive I mean it's  also fully real-time rendering you throw a transition in it's there it's already there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah because it's there's a miserable it's a miserable climb up to go from iMovie to it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cut express I agree I'm an I'm I like iMovie and I don't want final cut it's too much for me  not merely in price expresses 300 bucks but but complexity yeah they've gotten rid of the timeline  it's gone there's no audio separate audio track the audio mixing is gone it's it's a very different  program the story that Apple's giving out is that one of their video engineers came back from a trip  tried to make a movie with iMovie so this is too complicated and wrote a much simpler version  that's why iLife was delayed by a year they didn't they skipped a whole release so all I have to do  is not upgrade iLife and I'll well it's interesting when you install it the old iMovie stays there  and you can still download iMovie if you have iLife 08 and you want iMovie you can download it so  Apple realizes that there's a little issue here at least until they close that loophole right get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it while you can I think I think the rest of the rest of the whole like Mac software update was a  bit of a a bit of a squib I mean certainly the updates to .mac were 10 gigabytes instead of one  they needed to do that yeah but it's nowhere near enough I mean Google is already giving you you know  goodness knows how much storage for nothing you know you've got to pay a hundred dollars a year  just to get 10 gigabytes and you're thinking you're gonna pay double that if you want to go up to 30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gigabytes right I'm happy with the 10 I mean I I just have some special stuff there mostly I use  .mac for the synchronization some new features in GarageBand you get the capability of  kind of they call it magic GarageBand back creating backing tracks that's good for a musician if you  wanted to you know create a quick backing track and play to it it's easier to do you know Magic  GarageBand seems redundant you know I think the most interesting thing is numbers which is the  spreadsheet that's now part of iWork they always had a presentation manager and a word processor  those are both considerably improved but numbers is a pretty it's not excel I mean it's not going  to be for the office but for home users who are doing you know dinner I know a friend of mine does  dinner party planning with excel he does seating charts in excel this would be a much better I know  this would be a much better choice or the kids baseball schedule or the kinds of stuff  that home users do this is a really nice I think a beautiful job could they have just done this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  whole announcement with a press release though yeah but they're only 200 people there was telling me  she was like you know I she went she's like I don't really feel like I had to be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh it's so cute to see Molly finally getting bitter about wasting time she hates the Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  she hates the Mac let's be honest she doesn't like the Mac and the PC though  she and Linux well as long as she's an equal opportunity hey what a great choice for tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  correspond actually that that makes her just fearfully honest about makes it like Dvorak is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what it makes her different a female Dvorak cranky but I did I did feel like when I was  following along on the live blog I was like there's really not much that I'm getting excited  about it's like the spreadsheet was the biggest news like oh they finally got you know right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they've got numbers that's great well the other thing I think is interesting and I talked a little  bit about this on the radio show that we're already seeing benchmark numbers of the new  IMAX are not particularly faster they're very small percentage faster it's really a what it  really is is a Detroit style new model year right it's a way to get people to buy new computers and  well what's interesting I don't need to anymore they push the prices down a little bit a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bit less expensive if you look at the refurbished 20 inches of the old model it's it's it's only  like 500 you know right you're only saving like less than a thousand over the new model right it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's yeah you can go you can go crazy sorry you can go crazy upgrading them too you know you can  get up to a terabyte and four gigs of ram and they're pretty powerful machines they're beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  machines but again I think it's really all about saying to people you don't want that old design  you want the new design because there's no other compelling reason for most people to upgrade a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  computer yeah because the other thing to look at is like if you look at the same the equivalent  power for you know a Dell desktop it's pretty awe-inspiring to realize how much that fabulous  new design is costing you yeah you know notebooks they're very competitive in price but the desktops  they're starting they're starting to be a bit of a lag yeah but you can you put four gigs in that  Dell desktop of ram can you put four gigabytes of ram I mean look two gigabytes is a lot for most

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people you do if you want to run windows and mac at the same time yeah and I guess that kind of  you're right that kind of I don't know I think for people who use photoshop this is going to be a  nice photoshop but tool if you're doing a lot of music and garage band or something more powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more the only downer is the graphics cards they put in it the radian 2000 series is pretty lame

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very odd that they chose such a low-end it's a 99 buck graphics card basically well I'm pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sure ati is giving it to them for you know pennies on the dollar for the sake of you know just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  shifting some cards these this is they're using the radion hd 2400 and 2600 and you have the  benchmarks I've seen it's not an impressive card at all there were much better choices from nvidia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for instance well yes maybe they want you to buy the big expensive box oh the mac pro I see what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're saying yeah yeah maybe maybe well we're going to wrap this up unless you want to talk  about the eight million year old bacteria or frightening quake con did you have anything to  talk about with quake con I know you're a quake fan I mean there's a couple of good cons last
