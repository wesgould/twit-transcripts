I want to talk about me  Do you mind I?  Was in New Orleans as you know John I heard this on Sunday  And I wish I had read this from the Times picky you in a little column  By Jeff Duncan a visitor's guide to the new improved New Orleans for Super Bowl  2013 a lot of really nice tips about things, you know to know about and so forth  And here's the tip that I really should you know don't drink primary colored drinks for instance like this red wine  Like well a hurricane, right?  Don't drink primary color drinks. Don't panic if a chicken guy in a chicken soup plops down in a barstool next to you  He's probably the corner attorney go to tip a Tina's rub  Professor long hairs bust but this is the one I should have paid more attention to  Don't answer if someone in the quarter who tells you they know where you got dem shoes  Just keep walking you'll thank me later now had I read that  When the guy walked up to me and said I bet you I know where you got them shoes. I  Wouldn't have shaken his hand and said I bet you don't  But I did  And what happens he says you got them on your feet  That'll be $20, please  There's some guy going around town with that gag apparently not so much so that there's it's in the newspaper  If I'd only read that anyways a lot of fun got them on your feet  Would you have fallen for that? No, he then shined my sneakers, which I thought I'm gonna pay him $20 not to do  But I felt he probably felt he should give me something of value for my money

End time: 434.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was invited to that but then they actually Microsoft wound up  Canceling an event that they were going to have for their MVP's there because of because of Nemo  Yeah, and Nemo and if you know so the surface RT launch and then Sandy  The surface Pro launch and then Nemo say if you know when it comes to Europe if you're in London  You know batten down the hatches check the weather forecast because there will be a storm there. No, I didn't I didn't stay up late  I did get up early the next morning and checked and discovered that  The one that I would have considered ordering was already sold out everywhere

End time: 459.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the 128 gigabyte version correct. Yeah, they okay. So it launched February 9th  They were not taking pre-orders unlike the ours  I bought the surface RT the tablet version of this by pre-ordering and got it day and day, but they weren't doing that  So people had to go to a store  Very few surface Pro 128 were available. In fact, in some cases not even many 64 gigs. What's the story?

Start time: 461.98
End time: 538.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know  I've done a little bit of talking to people about this and it appears that there were an average of  somewhere between three to five units at  the Best Buy and staple stores in this country and there were as many as  Between 20 and 50 per store at the Microsoft stores. Of course, there's far fewer of those  So, you know if you do the math there  I  Figured there were probably in the range that you know  There could have been maybe fifteen thousand of them in the channel  Yeah, you know, it's interesting because if people talk about well Microsoft made a big mistake by by under supplying these but remember  Both Best Buy and staples were the ones who would have had to buy these and then sell them through  So it strikes me that they they they bet conservatively  And then you know the Microsoft stores they they they stocked up  I don't know, you know for a product planner for this  I'm not sure what I would have done the reviews were lukewarm for the device the demand for the Windows RT one  Wasn't wasn't all that great. So, you know, they

End time: 580.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, or is it fifty thousand or two hundred thousand or or probably?  750,000 or so the Windows RT units and I would imagine that they're planning to make  You know somewhere between  One million  Maybe two million maybe more of the surface pros this year. Will they sell that many you think you've reviewed it

Transcript:  It seems that there are better Windows 8 tablet choices seems that there are I mean that's that's the thing is it's fascinating to watch  Microsoft and wonder what they're doing strategically but as a product, you know, there's some interesting innovative things about it  But I know that you know  John Phillips the editor at PC world spent a lot of time with it and he said, you know, it's not that great a  Tablet it's a it's a better laptop, but there are other really good options for Windows 8 yoga

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's put but let's put things into perspective here  If you talk about 1 million or 2 million there are going to be 240 million  at least  Windows 8 devices sold this year. That's you know, that's a drop in the bucket. That's one half of one percent of  the PC market and and it is at two pounds with  the with the type covers and with  You know the kickstand and all of that it is an innovative device. I'm not aware  the only other device that I'm aware of that has similar specs is the  Acer Iconia 700 that's a beautiful notebook. That's a beautiful little machine or a tablet. I should say it's not a notebook  Well, you know, it's sort of it's it's one of those hybrid devices because you can you know  You slap it into this little frame there and then it has a keyboard that goes with it  But that makes it primarily a tablet. It makes it very hard to be a mobile device. This thing is  Is an extremely portable device here. You asked me there it is. He got it out of the box

Start time: 679.66
End time: 681.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a review unit that was going back

Start time: 682.44
End time: 826.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's and so here I'll do the I'll do the  And I have dropped it several times from 39 inches by accident onto a hard surface and it still works  Here's the click in can I step on it?  That's what mr. Sonoff's that's right he did that so here's the you know, there's the  there's that and then there's the you know, there's the type cover but  Really, I'm not aware of any device that has this much PC power in it that weighs this little so you recommend it  As I said in my review  There is a class of person who will really really really gravitate towards this device because it is  Extremely mobile and everything and and all of the devices that are coming out here have have  Compromises of one sort or another with them  You know this so you can have light or you can have powerful or you can have  Tablet or you can have the you know, and everything  You can't have it all. Yeah, and  You know, and so this one I think is going to appeal to people who are first of all Microsoft centric  So if you're in an organization that is you know exchange and SharePoint  You're gonna you know, you're probably going to find this very  Friendly towards that and and it also I think is is good because the battery life is is ultra book class  You know at at roughly four hours  Right, I mean you would like to see more you would like to see more if you're going to be completely mobile with the device  But if you're in and if your primary work situation is you're in a corporate office  Where you're going from room to room where there's you know, there's power and there's Wi-Fi  And and such and so you're never going to be using it for more than an hour or two without having an outlet nearby  the the  Continuous availability of power isn't that big a deal?  So, you know again all of those things when you take it they narrow down the potential market for this  To a relatively small number but a relatively small percentage of the Windows 8 market is still a  A  Large number in absolute terms and so I think you know 1 million to 2 million is not an unreasonable number

Start time: 831.90
End time: 850.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think part of it is to be is to be a  Hero device a flagship device to sort of set this it's not a reference design. It's a hero  Is that a different they call it a stage for Windows?  So basically this device has no crap wear on it right none

Transcript:  So I have nobody will do it. I have in my office which I'm going to be reviewing this week three  Alternative devices that are similar  hybrid  Type devices and you know, I'm not going to name any names right now  I will later but one of them has so much  Junk on it both on the desktop side and on the on the Windows 8 tile side  You know, you just look at it and you want to cry and so part part of it is that part of it is the build  Quality of this device, you know Jason I know you can your reviewer  no doubt had problems with things like battery life and  And things like maybe the camera quality and such but nobody who has picked up this device that I've given it to  Has has said anything except Wow when it comes to the build quality feels really well built device

Start time: 908.84
End time: 919.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't feel cheap at all  It feels really nice and there's no doubt about it  And I think it's great that Microsoft built this because they are saying  This is what a Windows 8 device can be in a Windows 8 tablet can be how much is it 64 gigs is how much?

Start time: 919.80
End time: 921.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 925.04
End time: 929.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  999 so it's a little pricey wonder if they're making any money on it. I bet they're not making you think they're not making money

Start time: 929.38
End time: 967.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so. I don't know. I've seen I've seen some breakdowns which show they're getting you know a  fairly standard PC industry  Margin on it, which is low  But this is actually this is fairly competitive with this class of device  That's it's it I don't I don't consider this pricey the devices that are competitive with it cost around a thousand dollars  Remember it has 1920 by 1080 resolution and a digitizer in it is very high res  You are not going to find those features in a device that costs less than a thousand dollars

Start time: 969.20
End time: 990.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's bring up something here, which is Leo's question about why are they doing this in the first place?  I'm gonna just bring up again my point  Which is that they're doing it for their stores because they have to have something to sell and they intend to follow Apple's strategy  of having a you know three four hundred stores around and they need to put something in there, that's why it will I  Will suggest they will also bring out of a tower

Start time: 990.80
End time: 998.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1007.16
End time: 1015.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean they're much better than that, but they need they look just like Apple's  Which by the way Apple has trademarked the trade dress now of the Apple Store

Start time: 1015.68
End time: 1027.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Probably, you know Apple has the most sales per square foot of any retail operation in the not just computing or retail including Tiffany's  Yeah, and at and Microsoft took one look at that and said why aren't we doing this?

Start time: 1027.72
End time: 1053.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm trying to buy it's only a hundred bucks more for the 128 gig service Pro  I'm trying to buy it out of stock. It won't even let and this is at the Microsoft online store  It won't even let me select the radio button. It's like not only out of stock, but you can't even  Pre-order this for some state in the future like all the radio may never make the radio buttons are sold out as well as maybe  There's made one run. I mean, why would you do that? You made one run Apple actually or Microsoft actually?

Start time: 1054.14
End time: 1061.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Underestimated demand for their own computer. That's a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs for the rest of that's easy industry

Transcript:  Nerv asked a great question in the chat room. Why is Microsoft so bearish on its own hardware?  Shouldn't they be?

Start time: 1068.88
End time: 1074.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because this is just a dry run for something they're gonna bring out later  And they don't want to just get everyone caught up on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I take a chance and by the way, I see RT and the pro are not the real versions that there will be a

Start time: 1080.12
End time: 1094.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Real version soon. I wouldn't be surprised but you have to remember when IBM was doing its think pads  They will would do one run of every day would estimate how many people are gonna buy and they do one run and go under  The next model and this may be the policy. That's it. They're not gonna make any more right? That's it

Start time: 1095.20
End time: 1115.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably I have to buy now  Here's the question and Ed you respond to this a little bit a  significant amount around 30 to 40 gigs of space is taken up by the operating system the restore partition and so forth so  People are complaining especially on the 64. Hey, we're not getting a whole lot of free space on here and  Ed you responded to this of course saying it's not just  Microsoft

Start time: 1117.52
End time: 1170.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, yeah the the MacBook Air and  the surface Pro are  Are almost twins when it comes to the amount of free space that's left  after you after you configure the 128 gigabyte device and then  Especially if you use the built-in utility in Windows 8 and copy the recovery partition to  USB flash drive so you can have that eight gigabytes back when you do that they both have  Somewhere and again and now you have to you now you have to compare them using the same terms  So if you use Apple's measurements  you have somewhere between  104 and  106 gigabytes of free space on a device that is advertised with  128 that's not bad

Start time: 1171.98
End time: 1175.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At all I mean on the 64 gig though, it's a it looks a little light on

Start time: 1177.06
End time: 1197.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 64 gig it again if you measure it using 64 gigs is in decimal  So if you measure it in decimal what you have is 32 gigabytes of free space  And then you have the 8 gigabyte recovery  So I can get 40 gigs which you can remove so you get 40 gigs not a MacBook Air. It's around 45. I believe

Start time: 1199.42
End time: 1207.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so the thing is so so there's one difference which is I can get a bigger drive in my air  I at this point can only get 64 gigs in a surface Pro

Start time: 1209.06
End time: 1239.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Period that yeah, that's true. And so right there. So there's a customization option that's available for Microsoft in the future  I think I actually they ought to feel  pretty  Optimistic about the response from this weekend, and maybe they'll ramp up production. Maybe they know this was you know this was  better to  have  you know better better to sell out and  And then be able to deliver on it later  Then to have stores filled filled with palettes of

Start time: 1240.88
End time: 1247.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Merchandise that just sits there for weeks and theater monkey does have a very good point  There is an SD card slot in the Microsoft surface

Start time: 1247.38
End time: 1323.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an SD card slot in there that you can put 64 gigabytes in there now and you'll be able to put  128 gigabytes in there next week  But look so question that people have been asking me all week is why do Apple and Microsoft even sell the 64 gigabyte?  Models and and and this is you know, and I've been thinking about this and there's actually a really good answer to this two years ago  64 gigabyte device was a terrible idea  Today because especially next year and the year after that and the year after that  It's going to be this is basically going to be what the Chromebook should be  And anybody who likes the Chromebook but objects to the fact that they can't run, you know  They can't put things that don't run in a browser on it should say well, okay  This is this is not a bad thing at all  In a cloud in a world where you're going to have most of your stuff in the cloud anyway  And it's a companion device that you're going to  You know you're going to use and then you're going to bring it back to your home or your office or whatever and sync it  up with the cloud  64 gigs  Seems basically okay. Maybe another reason Dan Ariely talks be okay for us  It's not gonna be for anyone in this room because we're all

Start time: 1324.48
End time: 1342.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe another reason Dan Ariely and predictably irrational calls get the decoy effect and it's often used in pricing where you do three prices  You do a low price that nobody wants but it makes the middle price look better the monster cable effect  Yeah, yeah, and it could be that except there's a flaw in this which is you don't have any 128 gig surface pros

Start time: 1343.52
End time: 1369.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're stuck with the decoy. I think it's important to I mean Ed's whole approach this week  Which is right on to say that if you compare it to the MacBook Air it has similar storage characteristics  I think what's interesting is people have to think of this as a PC and not as an iPad because the storage  Math is different when you're not a tablet right and it's not it's a PC  It's a Windows 8 PC and it behaves very much like the MacBook Air does in terms of how it handles storage with a

I like it a lot for two reasons number one  Two reasons number one the performance improvements over any previous version of Windows are just worth it  And number two the ability to sync all of your settings and files and apps and stuff across multiple devices  So when I set up a new device boom all of my stuff is there  I have very very little work that I need to do to get it working.

I want to give Sam  Sam who's the author of that?  I want to give him a plug here and everyone should go out and buy that app because it's a it's a great Google reader  client  And and so you can you know have your have your Google reader feed  RSS feeds in a in a metro style app. That's a really good one  There you know the the news apps that come with Windows 8 the Bing apps news and sports those are those are great  You know, they're really they're really well designed  But there aren't it's but I spent probably I'd say 70 to 80 percent of my time in the Windows desktop  You know because that's where you know, that's where office is

There's there's there's there's like 15 different  Desktop style file explorers out there if you want if you want that capability  One thing that I like  One thing that I really appreciate that they've done with Windows 8 is to not do the click a checkbox and have one  Four different out here.

It works pretty well  I also have a couple of touchscreen laptops here and those work really really well the you know the  I wrote a post  About a month ago  About this whole gorilla arm thing  And i'll tell you if you use windows 8 on a touchscreen laptop  the  The amount of space between the keyboard and the screen is about  Here this much  It's you know, maybe maybe three or four inches  Uh that you can reach out and do things and so what i've discovered in using  Maybe eight or ten different devices  Which have touchscreens?  touch enabled  track pads  With that support gestures and such keyboards and mice is that you wind up using all of those input things  The mistake that people tend to make is that they think a touch screen is the only way to interact with windows 8  No, it's another way to interact with it.

This is transitional. Yeah, I think it is transitional. I I I don't think  Um, you know certainly apple doesn't seem to believe the touch screen is is the dominant  Interaction, although the the track pad has a lot of the same gestures same thing where you can sweep, you know  But as an additional gesture  It's not you know  Not unreasonable at all because I know having seen that in my own house that it's true people  Once you get used to the swiping and tapping like that you want to you want to do it on the screen

There's a major new wave of it where you get new features  So if you compare sky drive today to what it was six months ago a year ago 18 months ago the the the uh,  progression has been profound well

They just don't do ads they do it for spam and other reasons  Everybody goes if you have anti-spam on an email system, it's got to go through your email. Yeah, it's not a human reading the email  It's a computer algorithm  Looking for keywords whether they target ads or not

Well, look it had  every email system has to go through and it has to process the uh,  The server that it came from and the address that it came that it came from to display that to you  There's there's certain things that any web-based service has to do  But then it it does it it it makes a decision  It takes an action and then it moves on without storing that  That's that's the difference. Look this campaign. That's not what this campaign says

End time: 3322.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is true. It's a legitimate issue. It's a corny  It's a cornball campaign, but the underlying issue is real  look google's  Advert Google's revenue stream is advertising right they they get between 94 and 97 percent of their revenues from  Advertising and they get it from gmail  That's one of the services that they get it from they want you to use their services because they want to collect the data  Uh and use it to build a profile of you that they can use to make more effective advertising one of the fact  That's a real issue.

Oh nice  Yeah, so if you go to grc.com slash shields up Steve is still doing the great shields up  Router tester and he's added the capability of testing your router for this vulnerability  Would certainly be prudent to turn off universal plug-and-play anyway. It's a feature. No one needs really  And if you do and then you know test your router after  You turn it off and if and with any luck you will not you know you'll get the message that says you're not responding to my  Pings if it does respond and by the way since he put this up last week  1363 users have had positive results that means those people are really vulnerable to hacks from outside  I'll check it out. Yeah, it's worth. It's worth running  Grc.com sash shields up or listen to security now from last week.
