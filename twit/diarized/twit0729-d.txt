It's hot, it's humid, and the wind that blows comes over Africa, so it's sandy.  So you get like sandy grit in your hair.  Everyone just decides that this is when they're going to take that away.  That's the Chiraco.  The Chiraco wins, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like it's the first draft of tech journalism history, to be honest,  because it's the intersection of so many different industries and technology,  and you get a chance to see how these technologies are changing the way people do their jobs,  people work, and how businesses and societies are structured as a whole.  Preach!  Preach!

Transcript:  If you think about cloud, that started first in enterprise, right?  Yes, that was about 2006, 2007.  So I guess I see what you're saying.  You're kind of the leading edge of stuff that will eventually become consumer tech.

Start time: 219.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think another good example that's happening right now is IBM and other companies are keeping  an eye on global supply chains, and their idea is to help streamline and to make more efficient  the movement of, say, lettuce from the field to a Walmart shelf.  This will affect so many different industries in so many different ways.  It's not just a matter of being able to tag ahead of lettuce and know what farm it comes from.  You're also now affecting the way things are harvested, the way food is processed,  the way it's shipped, the way it gets onto shelves, how it's tracked, how it's regulated.  And so when you see these technologies being rolled out, there's just so many stories you can follow on it.

Transcript:  So big story of the week. The DOJ says yes to the Sprint T-Mobile merger.  It's not completely over. FCC said yes.  DOJ had a lot of restrictions and caveats and requirements. Looks like they're on board now.  Now it's just down to a handful, maybe a dozen or so state attorneys general who have been suing  because as everybody was concerned, the lack of competition, losing an entire carrier.  But that's what makes this deal I think the most interesting.  The requirement of the Department of Justice was that Sprint and T-Mobile give their businesses  Boost Mobile and Metro PCS to Dish. The Dish network, yeah, the satellite company.  Dish has been over the last 10 years buying and not using Spectrum.  Charlie Ergen, who runs Dish, is quite an iconoclast. Fascinating guy.  There was a great piece in the Wall Street Journal this week about Charlie.  He was a professional poker player and in fact so good at card counting  that he was banned from many Vegas consinos they wouldn't let him play blackjack.  It's not illegal. But they don't like it.  He then partnered with his buddy. They put in $60,000 in 1980 to create a big satellite dish  company, a 10-foot dish satellite company in Denver. Eventually came up with these smaller  hubcap size dishes. The Dish network, they launched satellites competing with cable operators.  Successfully, his $60,000 investment is now worth $9 billion. He's a very wealthy fellow.  I've always thought the poker player tells you a lot about who Charlie Ergen is.  I met him when we were doing Tech TV because he invited me to Denver to do it. He has a show on  Dish called Charlie Chat. At least he did. I don't know if he still does. I met him and I was really  impressed. Here's the thing I kind of come away with, especially after reading this piece and  what I know about Charlie. We are lucky. We live in a world where there are these kind of crazy  guys like Elon Musk. Maybe Jeff Bezos would be one of those who are willing to bet the farm,  go all in, to use a poker term, push the chips all in on something that is really a risky bet.  This is exactly what Dish is about to do, to launch a new cell phone network in 2019.  What do you think, Lexi?

Start time: 465.34
End time: 481.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the T-Mobile and Sprint merger has been one of those will-they-won't-they romances.  This is the third time, right?  This is literally the third time that this has tried to go through. To actually see it come to  fruition, I think this is probably going to be the final one and hopefully it is going to actually  come to bear fruit.

Start time: 482.52
End time: 486.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it's a good thing for people or do you think competition will be suffered?

Start time: 487.16
End time: 529.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a really interesting one because if you look at the history of Sprint and its decisions  and how it got to this point so far, it's made a lot of missteps along the way.  I think this had to happen in order to-  It's a very kind way of putting it.  Oh yeah, well missteps, exactly. This really had to happen. T-Mobile obviously is very,  very aggressive in how it's trying to garner customers. It is a partnership that I guess  is really going to work out well because Sprint has what T-Mobile needs in terms of a spectrum.  They're really going to complement each other in this way.  I think it is going to be a formidable force to the big two if it's done correctly and if they can  attract new customers rather than just keep the existing base that they already have.

Start time: 529.46
End time: 534.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will make the merged companies as big as roughly as AT&T and Verizon will have three big carriers.

Start time: 534.74
End time: 573.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On paper though, that's on paper. What T-Mobile gets out of this deal is they get spectrum.  They've been hurting for spectrum. The problem is it's not all the right spectrum. Sprint owns a lot  of spectrum throughout the country, but a lot of it was from that failed pseudo 4G rollout.  Which works well, but it uses up a ton of power. It does not penetrate buildings.  Yes, you're picking up a big pile of spectrum. Not all of it is going to be usable by every device.  Like you said, they have to do this very carefully. They cannot pitch themselves as,  hey, we're just like AT&T and Verizon now. It has to be, no, we're still a disruptive player.

Start time: 573.88
End time: 615.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just bigger combined. I'd like to know how they're going to handle  customer expectations because you've got two things going on. You're going to have people who  use the merger as any excuse to get mad at the company because, well, when I was with T-Mobile,  this is what happened. Since they've merged, they've been unresponsive.  So that's going to be a merger is a great engine for customer dissatisfaction. And the second big  thing is 5G is rolling out. So they're going to be tasked with trying to merge two organizations,  keep their customers going, please their investors and figure out how to position themselves in a  market where customers are already saying, I'm not really happy. We're all moving to 5G anyway.  Let's in it for me to stay with you. So the big winner, if you ask me, is Dish.

Start time: 617.00
End time: 662.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, this is a gamble of a lifetime. I mean, this is going to cost him $10 billion to  do the build out that he needs, but he has this spectrum. He's been kind of quietly and not always  to the delight of the FCC or the other carriers buying up this spectrum. He owns some very juicy  spectrum. He, the opportunity, he was, in a sense, in fact, there's a great quote from him in this  Wall Street Journal piece. He said, I wasn't going to build an LTE network because I'd have to tear  it down in a year. It's much better to start at 5G. And so that's kind of what he's getting to do.  And isn't it historically, isn't it always better to not have legacy,  but to be able to start with a clean slate, doing a new technology. We saw that in Africa

Start time: 663.08
End time: 686.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  when they started doing the rollout in several generations past what we did. We've seen that in  a large part of Asia. And what Dish gets here is yes, they've already built up their spectrum,  but just like Sprint and T-Mobile, it's spotty. But since T-Mobile is going to have to sell over  their smaller, their MVNOs, what Dish will get is the ability to put those patches together

Start time: 686.58
End time: 737.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  through other carriers' networks. I don't think Dish even wants the MVNOs. They're doing this to  satisfy the requirements of the FCC and the DOJ said, you've got to have a cell carrier up and  running next year. Otherwise there's a big fine. So they're going to, this is kind of a stop gap.  I don't think they care about boost. I don't think they care about a Metro. They really  care about 5G. In fact, Ergun says wireless pricing is broken. US carriers have people  paying for unlimited data plans they don't need. He says that's just like the cable companies that  we disintermediated, forcing subscribers to pay for bundles of TV channels. He says this is deja  vu for us all over again. One of the things he wants to do is, and this is, so Dish is going to  be the scrappy underdog that T-Mobile was. And one of the things he's going to do is for instance,  offer lower cost data at night in the middle of the night when nobody else is using it.

Start time: 737.92
End time: 741.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We live in a 24-7 world. How is that pricing going to work out? Are they going to tie it

Start time: 741.26
End time: 780.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to your location? Yeah, I guess so. I mean, that's, you could do that technologically.  He's going to focus on businesses. So if you're like a telecommuter who's home base is in another  country, this is sweet for you. I think it really is more for businesses who might have a lot of  connectivity they want to do. Just as right now, if you're charging an electric car, you charge  in the middle of the night, right? So you might be, if there's a lot of data you need to download,  you might do that in the middle of the night. The other thing he says is he sees automotive  as a huge business. 5G, all the cars, new cars are going to have 5G built in. It's how autonomous  vehicles are going to communicate with one another. I think there's a big opportunity for him. Yes,

Start time: 780.66
End time: 795.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a big risk, but he's gambling. That's a fixed wireless play because fixed wireless, you can  make it work at the times that you want it to work. Both of us are from the enterprise world.  There's times when you need massive amounts of bandwidth and that normally happens off hours.

Start time: 795.64
End time: 816.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I'm thinking is another one of the enterprise lessons that I've had is the person who establishes  how things are done is the one who gets to effectively dictate the terms of the industry.  If he establishes the customer and the user experience for a brand new sector, 5G.  Yes, exactly. Then everybody else has. We've seen this with smartphones. We've seen this with cloud

Start time: 816.54
End time: 826.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  based apps. Look how Apple's dominated because in 2007 they said this is what a smartphone is.  This is how smartphones should work. I love Google apps and they use them a lot, but you have to

Start time: 829.08
End time: 837.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  admit that most of the metaphors that started with Apple. They actually start with Microsoft too.  Microsoft, Excel, Google Sheets. They've done so well in mobile.

Start time: 837.48
End time: 853.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's neither here nor there.  Is this going to be as somebody buying, should I now say I'm going to look at Dish as my next carrier  or if I'm a T-Mobile customer should I worry if I'm a Sprint customer?

Start time: 853.52
End time: 900.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is going to be interesting to see the incentives that these carriers are going to offer  to both keep existing customers and then also to entice new people to switch. T-Mobile and Sprint  have both been really aggressive in terms of packaging deals such as free Netflix subscriptions  as a sweetener, lots of bundles, cheaper rates. I think Dish is in a really unique position here  to do one of two things. To either go, yes, we're going to offer bundles. We're going to offer lots  of discounts and try to entice you over or they're going to go completely the other way  and just really be incredibly aggressive in trying to get new customers and just  make it exactly as we were talking about like having discounted rates off hours.  Really things that the other carriers aren't doing to really differentiate themselves and  really give themselves a reason for people to switch over to them.

Start time: 900.92
End time: 934.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That can also be bad though because we're starting to see the start of carriers that are also  vertically integrated with distribution companies slash content companies that are leveraging that  vertical integration to say, hey, if you're on our network, you get X, Y and Z for free.  We know you like Game of Thrones or you like whatever's going to come after Game of Thrones,  you get that free through our bandwidth versus Dish. Dish is going to say, well, we've got  agreements with so, so and so who have these shows that you love. I hate this idea of fragmenting  content just because the carriers want a reason why you signed with them.

Start time: 935.92
End time: 944.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're seeing that with podcasts, with Spotify saying, we're going to have exclusives,  Apple now, we're going to have exclusives. That's bad for everybody. That helps the companies maybe,

Start time: 944.46
End time: 974.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it doesn't help listeners at all. There has to be a tipping point though,  because we sort of saw this with streaming services maybe five, six years ago when we had all of the  competitors come out. We had the Arduos, we had Pandora's, obviously Spotify, the big players,  and then the smaller streaming companies. They have to consolidate. There was a shakeout,  wasn't there? There was a huge shakeout. There is a tipping point. Unfortunately, I think we just  have to go through that moment until we find the big players that come out because we can't have  feasibly all of these. I mean, if you just think about how many subscriptions that you have now to

Start time: 974.38
End time: 990.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  streaming services in general, I can't even count it on one hand. What's interesting is it's becoming  a growing topic of conversation among people where they talk about how many streaming services, and  now they're starting to ask more, well, we're looking at which ones to get rid of.

Transcript:  interesting is they were talking about the Disney Plus streaming service, which is going to come out,  and all of these people to a person were saying, well, I'm having a discussion now. Do we drop  Netflix or do we drop Hulu? If you have kids, it's different because the kids are going to watch it.  Yeah, exactly. And the Marvel stuff is moving over to Disney Plus and so is Star Wars, so that's  potent. But we're going to see a lot of shakeouts based on who's got the most money. I'm not killing

Transcript:  Whatever they got, I'll watch that, whatever that is. Or like you make a New Year's resolution or a  ... For example, I have a friend who every ... I guess you have to make that decision though.  Every Black Friday, my friend goes through her inbox and sees which vendors have sent her sale  emails and then she just hits unsubscribe. That's her little post Thanksgiving ritual is to do that.  And maybe there are people where their New Year's resolution will be, okay, let's review all of the  streaming and subscription services I belong to and get out. Maybe we'll get to that point,  but I'm more inclined to believe that we'll get to another point where people start saying,  do I really want to pay for the streaming service where all it is is British detective shows?  By the way, I would pay for that service. Do I really want to pay for this hyper niche?  Isn't that BritBox? Have you subscribed to BritBox?  Or Acorn or ... They'll consolidate. They'll bundle the same way cable will. It's going to be  like a beautiful circle of content length. It's a circle because you get this unbundling

Start time: 1099.20
End time: 1159.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then you get bundling because people don't want the unbundling. All of a sudden,  we thought that was a good idea and it's not. I have to say, I think in the long run,  this is going to be good for competition. I think in the short run, as you point out,  it's not necessarily good for competition. I'm going to subscribe to Charlie Ergen's  Twitter feed because I think he's the next Elon Musk. I love getting one more iconoclastic  wild man in the mix. These people inspire me. They're willing to take big, risky gambles  and they can change the world or they can crash and burn, but either way, it's a fun show.  Sure is. Just wait until it's ... More crashing than changing,  but that's how it's always been. Look at Elon. I think Elon Starlink. Forget going to Mars.  Forget even Tesla. Starlink has bid to put these low earth orbit satellites up and give gigabit  internet service to every corner of the world. That could be the final play that makes T-Mobile,  AT&T, Sprint and Verizon completely useless. The one world network run by one guy who ...

There was an episode of The  Outer Limits where a priest goes off because he finds a signal from a supernova, shows up there,  light years away, and finds out that the entire civilization was devastated by the explosion of  the nearby sun. And that happened to be the light that was seen during the birth of Christ.  It was an Outer Limits episode way, way back.  That's heavy.  And that was a Jesuit.  That's heavy.

Transcript:  Very serious about enterprise technology.  Great to have Lexi also with us from CNET, Father Robert from the Vatican. I like saying that.  Our show today brought to you quite literally by Cashfly. If you subscribe to any Twitch podcast,  if you download it from our website, you're actually downloading it through our content  delivery network. We have the best Cashfly. If you deliver content or apps to customers over  the internet, a CDN can make such a difference. Give your customers a seamless experience they  want. Power your site or app with the Cashfly CDN. You'll be 30% faster than the competition  and it will cost you less. No matter what business you're in, if your website's tied to company  revenue, give your customers the fast downloads they need with Cashfly. Media rich content,  10 times faster than delivery, traditional delivery methods, up to 30% faster than the  other guys, the other CDNs. And because Cashfly has servers all over the world,  they can offer a 100% SLA. I'm not talking 11 nines, I'm talking 100%. That's an infinite number of  nines. Perfect reliability. That means I never get a call at three in the morning saying the  server's down. Cashfly guarantees the best user experience for all your customers no matter what  or where they are. Join the thousands of others who trust Cashfly's reliable networks, not just us,  LG, Microsoft, Adobe, ours technical, all use Cashfly. And the other thing I really like,  I don't get billing spikes because Cashfly works with you on your yearly usage. We have very spiky,  as you might imagine, bandwidth needs. Sunday night, Monday morning when everybody downloads  Twitter, that's when we get a big spike and then it's quiet for a little while and then I get  another spike with Mac break weekly. And that, if I had to constantly log in and make sure we hadn't  exceeded our monthly quotas, would be nightmarish. But I don't because I have a custom plan. In fact,  customers who switch to Cashfly save more than 20% on average. Right now you get a complementary  detail analysis, no pressure, no sales. They'll just tell you, they'll look at your CDN bill,  they'll look at your usage trends and they'll tell you if they can save you 20% or more at Cashfly.  I bet they can. Take advantage of this. Twit.cashfly.com. We thank you, Cashfly,  for bringing Twit to our listeners painlessly for me, painlessly for them. Twit.cashfly.com.  And I have to say, if you can get a podcast three seconds faster, you're probably gonna listen to it  more. No, I'm making that up. That's actually not far from the truth though. Well, if I have to wait,  I might switch. I might go to another one. I don't like to wait. No one likes to wait.  Hey, so you guys with surprising alacrity got through the Sprint T-Mobile discussion. That was  quite good. I'm excited. Are you T-Mobile, Lexi? No, I am on Verizon. Verizon? Same. Also on Verizon.

Transcript:  Oh, man. Five euros a month? And you have... Because the EU, you have... You're roaming, right?  So that was one of the requirements. I can't get my order history so I can come up with my...  You don't want to know. Trust me. You don't want to know. So Apple's spending a billion dollars.  They can afford it. Of course. To buy Intel's smartphone business. We knew this would be the  upshot, right? So the timeline of this is hysterical. So Apple sues Qualcomm saying,  you don't license the stuff to us cheaply enough. They were gonna pay a billion dollars to Qualcomm.  They stopped payment. Qualcomm countersues. This goes on for years. All of a sudden.  Meanwhile, by the way, I forgot to mention this part. Apple calls up... I think Jeff Williams at  Apple calls up the CEO of Intel and says, you have to make 5G modems for us. You have to. You  have to. Intel says, we don't want to. We don't want to. You have to. So Intel goes, okay. They  drag their feet. They really don't want to make these. Apple, I think at some point there must  have been an internal memo. This is the smoking gun we haven't seen where Intel says, yeah,  we're probably not going to have those till 2022 or 2023. We're having some trouble making them.  So boom, all of a sudden Apple says to Qualcomm, you know, forget it. Here's your money. We  promise we're going to license through 2025. We're going to be using your 5G modems. Thank you.  The next day Intel says, and we're out of the business. That's it. We didn't want to do it in  the first place, but they have a lot of patents. 2200 Intel employees will go over to Apple. Those  are the engineers working on this ill-fated 5G effort. 17,000 patents. 17,000 patents will go  over. Intel will retain the ability to develop modems for non-smartphone applications like PCs,  internet of things devices and autonomous vehicles to which Intel probably says, yeah,  but don't count on it. And Apple is going to start working on their own 5G stuff for the phones.  Billion dollars. This kind of had to be the final piece in that puzzle, right?

Start time: 1628.04
End time: 1645.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Apple has always had the philosophy of owning the core technology. And the processor  has been a sore spot for that because they're always licensing it out. Now they own not just  the technology, but they've got all those patents. So they've got a war chest, which means even if  they choose to use non-vertical technologies. Well, because it's all the way from design to

Transcript:  the retail experience, there is no part of that experience where they're vulnerable to outside  forces anymore. And from a business perspective, that's great for them. However, there is one

Start time: 1657.80
End time: 1685.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing, which is Intel didn't want to work on this, not just because they were being mean.  It was because all of their testing showed that the current 5G standards that are out there,  they suck power. They are horrible for power. So how do you squeeze a 5G radio into a device  that's already very power rooted? Qualcomm has something that they're calling 5G. It's not  really the same. I mean, Qualcomm's big tagline at CES was true 5G. What does that actually mean?

Start time: 1686.10
End time: 1711.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't actually know what that means. I think we'll find out like in December,  they usually do a really big meet and greet for people who are in mobile in December in Hawaii.  My sense is that they're probably going to queue up whatever they've got going there. So we'll find  out by the end of the year. But it's a good point about power suck because phones are now people's  primary computing devices. And if you're like, well, good news, you have 5G, bad news, you have  to recharge every eight hours. They were seeing a 2 to 300% power spike at maximum 5G bandwidth. So

End time: 1802.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  must be using, are they using their own Exynos platform? I doubt it. They're using Qualcomm?  One of the most unstable pieces of silicon on the market. I don't have a 5G phone because we  don't have 5G carriers, but do people who have 5G phones and 5G carriers complain about battery life?  Yes. They do. It's a huge deal. So this is maybe pointless, this whole thing. 5G really makes sense

Start time: 1817.34

Transcript:  That's not a great value proposition. So why is Apple spending a billion dollars?

Start time: 1821.18
End time: 1854.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because 5G is bigger than 4G. It's one more. One more G. Is it too fast? Maybe it's also just,  they enjoy, not enjoy, but it's a core business value to bring everything in house as much as  possible and reassert control. Since they're already dominating the mobile experience,  for them perhaps this is them saying, all right, we've eliminated all possible variables where  another company can hose our product cycle. They were mad at Intel. They've been mad at Intel for  generations. Yeah. I mean, Intel's been kind of screwing the pooch on this since 2016. But at the

Start time: 1854.54
End time: 1872.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  same time, it feels like maybe we're rushing this whole 5G thing. And Apple has never been,  another core value of Apple has not been to be the first with any new technology, but to wait.  It's to establish the user experience. Yes. And when 5G is ready, video on mobile pushed 4G.

Transcript:  Android major manufacturers have 5G plans or have 5G phones available and will do by the end of this  year. So Apple obviously won't have a 5G phone this year. We don't think we sort of have rumors  that there will be a 2020 5G phone. And so I think from the Apple perspective for both investors and  consumers, if they don't have a 5G plan in place, they're going to see as being behind the curve.  They'll look laggard. Absolutely. So they have to have that in store.

Start time: 1906.96

Transcript:  The other thing I'd like to bring up is we're talking about a really US centric perspective  when it comes to 5G and killer apps and user experiences and things like that. And Utah's  decided to comment earlier talking about how Africa effectively leapfrogged broadband bandwidth  and went straight to mobile experience. We don't know that Apple's not doing this because this  helps them to position their products more effectively in the Asian markets where they have  a much different mobile user experience than the US has. We have to stop assuming that the US is the

Start time: 1938.64
End time: 1945.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1946.14
End time: 1965.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are betting a lot on China in the future though. And I would be willing to speculate  that they're probably also taking a look at how they can position a 5G or 5G adjacent phone in  countries where Apple is not embraced to the same extent as Samsung or other Android-based phones.

Transcript:  Who is the number one manufacturer of 5G network infrastructure? Huawei. China Mobile apparently  has big plans for 5G. Commercial rollout is October 1st. They expect 5G, I didn't know,  I was curious when you said that, they expect China to be the leading 5G market very, very quickly  in the next few years. So for whatever reason, maybe because they don't have all the LTE  infrastructure in place and they can leapfrog, I don't know. They also have super dense cities

For  example, the last time I was at CES, I pretty much used my iPad exclusively.  Interesting.  But I will also add, I was lucky enough to go to Microsoft for like three days

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we had room, they gave us lots of room. A lot of people use Macs at Microsoft. They don't  care anymore. Well, it was nice because they gave me a Surface as a loaner too. So I was able to  move back and forth. Microsoft is a cloud company. They're a services company.  That's right. But the fact that Microsoft was like, here, have a Surface and try out and see  how you like this tablet experience. I was like, this is where we're going.  Surface is nice.  You know, it spoiled me because it's such a great quasi-laptop experience and I liked being able to  drop and drag with my fingers and pinch in and zoom out. And then I went back to my Macbook and

Start time: 2199.26
End time: 2234.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  did that and was like, what in the? But that's what the touch bar is supposed to be for.  Don't get me started on the touch bar.  I noticed you're saddled with the touch bar.  I am saddled with the touch bar. To my chagrin, it doesn't do anything that I need it to do. The  touch bar has been one of those big things for the Macbook. I've added the keyboard.  Do you like the keyboard?  So for me, I haven't experienced any problems that people have reported with the functionality.  It's fine. So someone commented that I'm a very loud typer in the middle of a keynote.  And I didn't feel like this was actually at an Apple event. I was sitting there in the keynote

Transcript:  Boy, that design language. Apple started that, didn't they? So that actually raises an interesting  issue. Apple is kind of in a intermediary state where they're making this issue of, well, Intel's  been a problem partner for us. They've slowed down development of new Macintosh computers.  The general consensus is they're going to make their own A whatever chips for desktop computing.  Jean-Louis Gasse, who used to be an Apple vice president, he was with B. Remember,  he went out to start BOS and writes, I think, some really good opinion pieces in his Monday note.  He's been thinking about this and he says, after last week's thought experiment on the Mac's future,  I realized leaving the x86 processor family makes little sense. A pleasing fantasy,  but too complicated. He says, honestly, as long as Apple makes Macs, it's going to have to use  Intel chips. But that doesn't mean Apple's future lies with Intel because of the iPad OS fork.  I have always thought this, where Apple's heart lies.  He says it's just not going to make sense for Apple to abandon Intel. How are you going to make  a Mac Pro with 32 cores or an iMac Pro with 10 cores out of an ARM chip? There's no point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think risk is necessarily not as good. It's just that ARM isn't focused on these fast,  big pipelines. It's focused on low power and other things. He says there is a fork in the iOS  world, which is the iOS versus iPad OS. He says, as iPad OS lets iPads gain more use cases,  especially in the realm of productivity, iPhones will stay in the mainstream of iOS.  That's what he sees. He sees, really, Apple doesn't want to support two platforms, ARM and Intel,  but they're actually going to have to support three.

Start time: 2396.80
End time: 2417.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It makes sense to do that because the user base for the x86 Apple users is actually quite small.  It's even smaller when you look at where the profit comes from. For them, it's not really  worth the pain to try to migrate everything over, encourage all the developers to redevelop their  applications. For a tiny, tiny market.  Yeah. No, don't do that.

Start time: 2508.10
End time: 2535.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's supposedly the 5G. So what we do know about this year's iPhone is that it  will probably be very similar to what we already know. So there'll be three models.  There'll be one to replace the XS, the XS Max, and the XR. Hopefully,  they'll change it to iPhone 11 rather than XI.  I'm so, so tired of this.  The number of times I go and people are like, oh, what do you think of the XS? And I was like,  the discord in my brain because I have to say it the way that Apple says it, the XS. And I'm like,  oh, yeah, that's what you mean.

End time: 2617.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. So there's no signs that it's USB-C, like the iPad.  The screens don't seem that they're going to get a significant bump if they need  all resolution. The most interesting thing, though, is the cameras on the new iPhones because  Apple has made leaps and bounds, I think over the past year at least, with their move to  computational photography with the iPhone. And it's something that we're going to see potentially  three cameras on the back of the new iPhone. So there'll be the regular wide telephoto lens  like the iPhones already have, except for the XR, which only has that single lens.  But there's going to be likely a third lens, which is an ultra wide angle lens.  And this is really interesting.  I love that on my X10 Plus.  X10 on the P30 Pro.  I use that all the time.  It's a really, once you have it, you don't realize how much you were missing out on before.  So what we're probably going to see on the iPhone, at least from the rumors,  is that this ultra wide angle lens is potentially going to be able to capture  more detail than is actually presented in the frame to the user. And then you can  basically go in and choose to have that extra data presented in a wider frame if you want to.  Oh, that's interesting.  And then throw away that extra information afterwards.

Transcript:  I love you.  The low light on the P30 is pretty incredible.  The low light on the P30 is incredible. And that's where Apple really needs to play catch up,  I think. The low light and the ultra wide angle. Because Apple has always been king of video,  absolutely. Like you shoot video 4K on the iPhone, we put it side by side with stuff that we shoot  on our production cameras. It's seen it and it looks very similar. It's amazing.

The Huawei does an incredible job and you can literally see things in the dark.  I did a lot of test shots. It's creepy how well it sees in the dark. But Apple phones don't care  well in the dark.

And he did it on air during a show.  The story was everybody was saying, don't put it in backwards. It'll break it.  Okay.  Really?  It will. Yeah.  And then I thought I brought it to T-Mobile.

Start time: 2804.50
End time: 2865.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should work better.  Did you guys get the fold?  Yes. So we had the fold. We were one of the few outlets that didn't experience any issues.  Well, yeah, well, we didn't peel the protective film off, but we didn't have any issues with it  at all. But other people absolutely did. And this was the reason why they had to go back  to the drawing board and recraft it. And I was wondering, you know, for everybody that had a  pre-order for the fold, you know, there was such a... I was actually one of those people.  I did pre-order it.  I did too.  Yeah. And it was just like this endless delay of, will I get an email saying my  pre-order has been cancelled? And then I'll get an email.  It's like, click here to make sure that you still want the fold. And I thought,  okay, it's been, you know, 50 days, 60 days, 70 days.  It took them that long?  I think it's been 89 days since, you know, since the first issue that they actually made  the announcement. And so, yes, the pre-orders are still active if you got it from Samsung.  Yes, I checked because I got the email that says your pre-order is still active.  And I was like, great, 89 days later you got it.  That's a problem for future Lexi to look after.

Start time: 2871.70
End time: 2888.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe it's going to come out. But the real question is who is going to buy it?  $2,000. They stretched the coating around more so you wouldn't be tempted to peel it off.  They put some bumpers on the ends of the hinges so  stuff couldn't get into it as it did with the verges. Do you think that's enough?

Start time: 2889.44
End time: 2941.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to be. They cannot afford another issue because you look at the Note 7 with two recalls.  They can't afford that.  That was the battery.  Yeah, that was the battery. So Samsung has to get it right this time because  Samsung is a brand that has so many devoted followers. If you look at the people that love  the Note line, Samsung acknowledges how dedicated this user base is. And I think it has to be  similar with the fold. People that are willing to hand over $2,000 on this new phone, they're  so interested in having the latest and greatest. And this is a radical new category. We haven't  seen anything this crazy in terms of phone design for at least 10 plus years. We're so used to just  the straight design that we see iPhone, Samsung's every other phone with. So for Samsung, this is a  huge deal. And I hope it works because I even though I played with the fold a little bit.

But when I started flipping between views of, okay, I had a nice big map open on when I  had the phone unfolded, and I flipped it back and then I had a smaller view, it just made sense.  But again, I only spent I literally spent 15 minutes with it. So I didn't have the full use  of it. But there is so much potential there. And I will have future Lexi on with her galaxy.  Lexi will come on with the fold. Show you if I agree with past Lexi.

So Apple has, or at least after the first  big theft where six years ago warehouse employee at one of Apple's top suppliers, Jabil, stole  thousands of iPhone 5C casings, boy was he sorry, from a factory in China before the product was  announced with the help from a security guard, falsified documents and avoided security cameras  as he drove a truck filled with candy colored shells out of the gates. After that incident,  Apple formed something called NPS, the New Product Security Team. And you can only imagine what these  people look like dressed like. They're probably very scary people. However, it's gotten better.  Last year, Apple began to trim the team and is now working, moving some of the work to contractors.  The real problem now is electronics leak schematics. In fact, what we're seeing is 3D  renders. The cases for the new iPhone that leaked out are actually 3D printed from schematics that  leaked out that kind of thing. It's a great story if you get a chance to read the information.  A woman at Jabil once hid dozens of glass screens in her bra but was caught by security guards

You know, it's because if you've got a huge financial incentive to steal the stuff and get  it out there, cracking down on security is one way to address the issue. But I can't help but think  perhaps there are other creative solutions Apple could come up with so that their employees are  not so strongly incentivized to do this. Maybe pay them better. Right?

And the card is  just a nice incentive to have in your wallet to show off to people because it's a nice, beautiful  design titanium card. And also if you don't have the ability to use Apple Pay wherever you might  be, because a lot of retailers in the U S still don't have it. Smaller retailers specifically,  I mean, the cost to deploy, you know, a contactless system is substantial. And you will look at the  retailers that have done it, you know, like Walgreens was one of the first, you've got massive  resources there to deploy, you know, targets taken a long time to get there, but finally they have.  They did. Are companies like Square making this happen a little faster? For smaller retailers,  yes. I mean, you know, you go to like food trucks or you go to smaller.

Transcript:  using them as your first line of commerce. Yeah. And this isn't the first time we've seen, you know,  a company like Apple to incentivize a reason to use a mobile wallet. I mean, Samsung for a very  long time with Samsung Pay has had a lot of rewards built in. So you the more transactions you make,  the more points you get and you can redeem those points for things. I think Google Pay has had  something similar in the past. But in terms of just getting people to use it, I mean, I still  think a lot of people outside of people who are very tech savvy are probably a little reluctant  to use mobile payments and don't quite get why they would do it if they can just carry a credit  card. So a lot of the times I talk to people, I'm like, oh, I don't bring my wallet at all.

Yes, exactly. So I always put it into my bank account. But Venmo now charges if you put a  credit card, I think. So if you have a debit transaction, it's okay. There's a lot of like  different stipulations that each of these services have. So you have to do a lot of  due diligence to make sure that you're not getting charged all of these fees or that you don't have.  Like someone I spoke to the other day had like, I think maybe almost a thousand dollars sitting  in their Venmo account. I was like, don't! Please put it in the bank. Please just take it out of

And I think we've created a society where people who are doing, I mean, we run ads. This is a  reasonable way to monetize, but people, it's almost an ethical thing. Like I'm not going to  look at that ad. I'm not going to give Venmo any, I'm not going to give them their VIG,  but you're getting a free service. Yeah, that's true.

We have no idea  how they're logging that data, how they're bundling that data to sell, who they're selling it to,  or what that data is being used for. I'd love to see more transparency in that. At least with cash,  when I hand $5 to somebody, they don't know where I live. They don't know what else I've been spending  my money on. They don't know my name. They don't know my age. They don't know what else I might  want to spend my money on. So there's a certain appeal there because my activities are not going  to be packaged and monetized for someone else's profit.

Chris Hughes, who was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate and helped create Facebook,  is now working with the feds. He's actually going to meetings with the Federal Trade Commission,  trying to figure out ways to break Facebook up.  Oh, good.  He has been a strong critic of Facebook. Now, of course,  it's after he made his billions of dollars on Facebook.  But apparently, he has joined two leading antitrust academics, Tim Wu. We know him from the  master switch. Scott Hemple of New York University in meetings with the FTC  and the Justice Department and State Attorneys General. They're laying out a potential antitrust  case against his company. He's no longer there, but the company he helped found  Facebook. If I were Mark, I would be so hurt.  What did Mark Zuckerberg do?  I think Mark is beyond hurt at this point.

Google, by the way,  has banned this is angering, fix it ads. They have banned ads for repair experts who can fix  electronics, search for MacBook repair, cell phone repair, broken cell phone screen, and there are no  advertisements. And this is an open letter to the Federal Trade Commission from Kyle Weins of,  of I fix actually Kevin Purdy, who's now working for I fix it. Good for you, Kevin,  about Google's ban of repair business ads. In October 2018, Google updated its other restricted  business policies and banned technical support by third party providers for consumer technology  products and online services. I fix it's been a real champion for the right to repair movement.  We have a right to repair, we own this technology. And it seems wrong for Google to carry water for  Apple, John Deere and other companies who say, No, no, no, you better bring your stuff into us,  only we can fix it. Maybe Google was just trying to ban spam. Maybe that was the point. Bing has  not done this. Although there is, you know, dubious search results from Bing, if you search  for computer repair, some of them are maybe not the best tools. I thought we had gone past this.

And the federal government stepped in and said, No, wait a minute, these people have bought it.  This is their car. That's a service station that deserves the right to have the same  manuals and they as the authorized service station. And at that point, it should have killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to this piece from I fix it. Although I fix it has pointed out that a lot of independent repair shops,  even some of those authorized by Apple are because they can't advertise on Google losing a lot of  business. And there's a serious concern about losing these small shops, these mom and pop shops,  because they can't get the word out. Well, there's currently 20 states considering right

Yeah, I would not be I'm not sure it's necessarily  a bunch of constituents who contacted their legislators and said, I'm really angry about  phones. I think one of the things that's been perking along in agricultural tech for the last  decade or so is a really nasty fight over whether or not farmers are allowed to repair their own  John Deere tractors, right?

So I think this is something that we're actually going to see a lot of in the  political campaigns in 2020 as well. And it'll be interesting to see when and how quickly  Google either pivots on their position or modifies it so that they don't come off looking like the  bad guys and somebody stump ad because harsh this for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the probes that have become politicized. It's highly politicized. There was a really Elizabeth  Warren. There was a great slash terrifying Bloomberg article this last week talking about  the future of a Pentagon cloud contract. Jedi. Yeah, Amazon was presumably on the fast track  until the president decided that Jeff Bezos should should why should Jeff Bezos get that business?  Well, but the worst part was it was Oracle that lost the contract. Is it hasn't ended the White  House though. And so she was able to press her case. It was an Oracle memo saying there's no way

Start time: 5697.24
End time: 5708.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5708.42
End time: 5712.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 5712.44
End time: 5720.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5720.16
End time: 5755.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  got four data centers a piece that are in Northern Virginia alone specifically designed for this kind  of work. The infrastructure in place already. But the broader point to the Bloomberg article was  that the government procurement process, which has historically been protected by courts and has  historically been practiced in such a way to take the politics out of it directly, that's been  pretty severely disrupted over the last year or so. And it may be part of a larger politics,  politicization of regulation in this country. When it comes to tech, you're going to have to  look really carefully at who's being targeted company wise, who's going after them and what the

Start time: 5756.50

And it's extremely cynical, if you ask me  for Katz, to put this together, make sure it gets to the president's eyes, knowing that really it's  propaganda targeted at one person. And it worked. And it worked. And it absolutely worked. Because

Start time: 5806.44
End time: 5826.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now there's an investigation. Again, the Bloomberg piece was great. It dropped last Thursday or  Friday. I'd urge people to go look for it. It's about 1800 words long. And it lays out in detail  exactly how this whole bid process has just gotten derailed in ways that are not typical to this kind

Start time: 5826.96
End time: 5851.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of procurement for defense contracts. Oracle, when they lost the round and were eliminated from the  bidding, sued. They alleged that the rivals had an unfair advantage due to Amazon's close relationships  inside the Department of Defense. Maybe it's justified. I don't know. But I just, it's a  fascinating story. And I think probably not the end of this kind of attempt at manipulation.

Start time: 5851.74
End time: 5888.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, something that you have to remember about this is Oracle, they were specifically kicked out  of the contract bidding process because they couldn't meet the requirement. They couldn't do  it. They couldn't do it. So what Oracle is saying here is not, well, we could do it instead of them.  We want you to break it up. We want you to have... We want you to change the requirements so that we  qualify. We can do it. Which is, again, from an IT standpoint, is not a great idea. I don't want  multiple vendors to be able to blame each other for when my system goes down, especially if it's  mission critical to the safety of the United States. But that's just me. And again, a lot of

Start time: 5888.72
End time: 5893.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 5893.62
End time: 5907.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and Amazon has that at this point too. Google is not in the running because they withdrew from it.  This is the contract, the Jedi contract that Google's employees, their engineers said,  we don't want to be doing this kind of defense work. And honestly, Google wasn't well suited for this.

And look, you can just like,  in an ideal world, even if the person who can yay or nay this dislikes the company or the CEO,  what they can also do is say, this is an area where they already have the depth of expertise that you  need. The security clearances are already in place. The infrastructure's in place. It will be  fewer man hours and fewer resources to get us what we want. It's good for the government.

Transcript:  Infrastructure, J E D I. So imagine some of the problems that we've had with data leakages over  the past 20 years where you've got independent contractors who keep a little data silo and then  someone breaches that and suddenly China has all the data about the F-35 fighter. Jedi is designed  to put all of that into a secure enclave that is controlled by a set of rules that works for  everybody. So it's a Pentagon cloud, specific cloud. So rather than every contractor rolling  their own, they will be required to use Jedi, which means all the people accessing it will  need to work according to the security policies of Jedi. So in theory, it is a really good idea.

Transcript:  It's a, I've talked to security pros who work in the defense sector around the area and this is  something they all want because in addition to the technical considerations you've outlined,  it also makes it easier for people to understand security and to work in a way where they reduce  the risk of human error in the security process. And it keeps people from doing something like,

Transcript:  sit on the sideline for this one. Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio have also written letters to the  Pentagon raising concerns. It is a shame when you start to politicize technical stuff like this.  On the same token, I think it should be fair. Look, tech is inherently political in a lot of

Start time: 6067.84
End time: 6113.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ways because either it can introduce, perpetuate or exacerbate power imbalances that are there  already or economic imbalances that are there already. We had a really good comment in the  chat room earlier when we were talking about Apple Pay and things saying that a cashless  life is in many ways an economic privilege because not everybody has access to the tech  or the infrastructure. So again, tech is inherently political. What the question should be right now  is when the US government starts looking at antitrust cases or anti-competitiveness cases,  what are the motivations for bringing those cases to the investigatory stage? What are they hoping  to get out of it? Who's driving this? Why are they driving this? There is pressure from

This is Texas Representative Mac Thornberry who wrote a letter to the president  urging him to move forward as quickly as possible with the award. Our committee has conducted  oversight of this contract from the beginning. As you know, the courts have upheld the DOD's  handling of the competition. While it's understandable that some of the companies competing  for the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of the finalists, further delays  will only damage our security and increase the cost of the contract. That's a Republican,

And the things that she told me about  the protocol she had to put down were by the end of her tenure, she was checking for thumb drive.  She had to confiscate smartphones. Can you imagine? People came in. It's just, and people who worked,  people who in theory design weapons and are very smart, literally like she had to have a talk with  one guy repeatedly as to why he couldn't watch porn at work and click on banners.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology, WWT and their ATC there. I like  these. This is enterprise, right? It's all acronyms, right? ATC is their advanced technology center.  This is so, so cool. I remember years ago, Jim Latterback and Patrick Norton and I spent some  time in Ziff Davis's labs in Foster City. You remember those days where they had these great  labs and they taste test stuff? And those days are long gone, but thank goodness WWT has effectively  created an even better lab in their headquarters or world headquarters in St. Louis, half a billion  dollars in equipment from all the big OEMs and the little ones too. You've got Dell EMC, you've got  VMware, you've got Intel, you've got disruptors, new companies like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.  And the thing is when you're buying enterprise technology, you've got to know it's all going to  integrate with your existing technologies. You've got to know how it's going to integrate, how it's  going to work. WWT is your trusted partner. They've been with you over the years. They're  going to stay with you. In fact, many customers have been with WWT for over 10 years because they  know that's where they can go get the answers they need to make sure their business is run right.  WWT's engineers use this lab every day, beta testing new equipment, building reference  architectures, custom integrations so they can help customers make the right decisions,  see results faster with much less investment. But here's the best part, you can use it too.  The ATC is an incubator for IT innovation and offers end users, people like you,  hundreds of on-demand integrated solutions at labs representing the newest advances in everything  from flash storage, hyper converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud and analytics, infrastructure  automation, data protection, all the things that are so complicated to integrate in and so important  to your business. You've got to learn about these things before you launch and this is where you can  spin up proofs of concept. You can pilot programs. You can use their sandbox so you can choose the  right solution. Reduce concept time from months to weeks. Get into the market. Get your stuff running  and this is all available as a lab as a service, a dedicated lab space within the ATC for you,  the customers, so you can perform programmatic testing using all of those amazing tools that  vast technology ecosystem WWT's put together. Half a billion dollars in equipment. A little later  this summer they're going to launch a new digital platform with hands-on access to more than 200 lab  environments. You can get early access right now pre-launch access if you go to www.wwt.com  slash twit. They're amazing advanced technology center. They built it for you and you can use it.  You can even get pre-launch access if you go to www.wwt.com slash twit. WWT simplifies the complex.  WWT.com slash twit delivering business and technology outcomes around the world and I'm  really pleased to have them as a sponsor of this show. See I told you I don't know anything about  enterprise but we have a lot of people a lot of enterprise listeners. Enterprise is the future.

Start time: 6574.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the consumer market. Yeah yeah we're gonna have twit Jedi soon. Twed I. Twed I. Do not.  You know I think this is kind of a standard thing. If a company comes along and says would you like  to install our app on your phone that because we'd like to know more about what you think and what  you do. Do not. Comscore. Familiar with comscore. They are a useful company for a lot of people  trying to know how their websites are used. They do analytics. They have a product for mac os called  Premiere Opinion. Voice five distributes it. An Aero security company published this article  saying it's man in the middle proxy software installs this you'd appreciate this father  Robert. Oh my goodness. A proxy on ports 8888 8443 8254 captures all the machines SSL and TLS  traffic. All of your traffic. All of your traffic. It's a bundled application that's offered along  with the installation flow of other software products. It's one of those where you go hey use  our downloader when you're downloading this. Oh and it's going to install this fabulous Premiere  Opinion. It installs its own local system certificate with any application that automatically trusts it  at this point with all user traffic going through its proxy. Premiere Opinion decrypts all the SSL  traffic in the proxy so that even if you think you're secure they could see everything you're  doing including emails banking information governmental websites. This is why you need  Jedi by the way and potentially beyond. So just a little I thought I'd pass along this warning.  This is kind of like maybe a little bit like Lenovo's Superfish.  That kind of it's a it's a it's been around for decades. Superfish broke SSL. This looks like it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay no see this company must be destroyed. Yeah but the real warning is it may not seem to be  coming from com score. It's being distributed for instance if you use a BitTorrent product called  BitLord okay when you download it you'll there's a little thing here it says oh look we're going to  premiere opinions part of an online market research community two million members worldwide.  It's voluntary but if you want to accept this you can download it while you download BitLord.  Yeah this is why we can't have nice things. Just I thought I'd pass it along. I think our audience is

You know what this  computer is for? It's for solitaire. That's it. That's it. That's all it does. The house Wednesday  passed a measure banning robocalls. This it's nice when you hear the house voting for something  429 to 3. I wanted who are the three? Who are those three? Who likes robocalls?  How would you justify to your constituency voting against the stopping bad robocalls act?

Start time: 6784.70

They passed that  97 to 1. I'm surprised they don't have shield yet. They have shaken and stir. You don't know  about shaken and stir. Isn't that great? Those are the anti-robocall protocols. Shaken and stirred.  Authentication protocols. In fact I think T-Mobile has already started to use it.  It'll provide authentication for this call came from our network from one of our subscribers.  I think I can't remember which does which. Which one's the shaken? Which one's the stir?  Shaken stands for secure handling of asserted information using tokens. Oh naturally yeah.

I think now I it's  been a long time since I changed the diaper but I think you pretty much usually know when they're  full. I think you have a sixth sense as apparent. Right Liza? Am I wrong? Can I tell a quick CES

Start time: 6911.14
End time: 6939.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  story? Yes. Because I read so a few years ago when I was at CES I was talking to somebody who  had a little sensor you were to clip into the child's diaper and then when the child's diaper  got wet the sensor would ping the smartphone and then tell you and then tell oh the baby's wet time  to change the diaper and I said that's great. How many users does it ping at this too? And they said  oh just one and I said so what you've done is you've created a device that guarantees one person is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is again is the relationship going to be just one person gets alerts? No that would be foolish. Or are  they going to recognize that many children are raised in a household with more than one

End time: 6998.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  adult who's responsible for them? The alert thing is the easy thing to understand what they're really  selling is they want this to be a data collection point so that you can give to your doctor this is  what my child's bowel movements look like. No that doesn't take a picture. No there are already apps

Start time: 6998.80
End time: 7019.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though where I forget the name of the app that I actually use for like the first three or four months  of my daughter's life where I logged every feeding. How often I was feeding her, how long a feeding  lasted. Why did you do that? Because I was freaked out for a second. Yeah that's right that's the real reason.  No but it was it was also useful because I did nurse and so it was a handy way to because after

Transcript:  when Jennifer was pregnant with our first Abby I handled my anxiety by writing a hypercard stack  with which to time contractions. That went out the window almost immediately. It was nice to have the data

Start time: 7040.48
End time: 7082.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  changing diapers, things like that. No actually this will do this so weirdly the one in Korea  will send you a text alert when your child has pooped.  Again something you don't really need to know. Pampers will only track urine not bowel movements  but Pampers will track sleep as well and I think that actually maybe is more useful. The Lume  by Pampers line, Pampers says there's a wait list it'll be launching in the U.S. this fall, has an  activity sensor that secures to a quote landing on the front of the baby's diaper, comes with a baby  monitor and a 10-day supply of diapers. There's also an app to log the kids pee and identify

Start time: 7082.26

Transcript:  patterns. This is really this is helicoptering parenting. One of the things I want to point out

Start time: 7088.16
End time: 7117.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is there's a real pressure in U.S. parenting right now to quote unquote sleep train to sleep train  your baby and one of the reasons there's that pressure is because an increasing number of  parents in the U.S. don't have the luxury of having somebody who can stay with the baby and not have  to go to work the next day. And so sleep training is effectively you trying to get the baby to sleep  so that workers aren't so exhausted and what this is what this tool is effectively is it's a way to  say oh you know we can reduce the baby to a set of data that has needs. Apparently this isn't the

Start time: 7117.88
End time: 7123.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  first there are connected onesies that double as sleep trackers there's a robotic crib. And there

Start time: 7123.18
End time: 7136.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are needs to track some children's sleeps especially if they're premature and they've had  breathing difficulty for example. There are mattresses for that and there are onesies for  that because some babies do have to like be taught how to breathe. The Apple display one of three

Parents Pamper spokesman told CNN business parents didn't  ask for a poo or pee alarm they wanted something more like the smart watches of today.

Transcript:  Okay but from the business side this is Pamper's starter they want because you know diapers that  make sense but you could see they want to sell you the baby monitors they want to sell you the  cameras they want to sell you the little connected temperature strips so that you can keep a running  log of your baby's temperature. They see so much money because over the last 10 years  baby tech has become its own pavilion at CES. It generates millions of dollars  and Pamper's feels left out because they've got this the old dumb Pamper's the little

Start time: 7201.32
End time: 7227.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kathy. Well the problem with Pamper's is that you don't have a lifelong customer base. Right. Your  customer base ages out of the product optimally and the funny thing is even if you have they can't  age back. But even if you have multiple children you're only going to be buying diapers for a  finite period of time but if you've got all this data on how your kid is doing then this gives them  an opportunity to spin off products that they can then use to touch the family. That's the concern

Start time: 7227.52
End time: 7246.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's the concern. CNN talked to Kathy Hirsch Pasek president of the International Society for  Infant Studies. The more we have analytics on babies the more we worry it actually matters  that we've calculated this.
