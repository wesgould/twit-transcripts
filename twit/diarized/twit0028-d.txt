Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 28 for October 30th, no, I guess 31st, Halloween 2005.  Our Halloween edition of Twit, nobody's in costume. I'm glad that Roger, you brought your gun with you.  Roger Chang from GameSpot Magazine, we'll ask him what that thing is in just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually Patrick Norton's racing shot version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am shocked. Why do you have Patrick's shot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it just migrated down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so cool, it's shiny.  It's really neat.  It's aluminum?  Aluminum, it does look like that.  Robert Heron is here from Digital Life TV, Ziff Davis from PC Magazine, also from Digital Life TV, the number one podcast in the nation on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see how long that lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, it's a good place to be. Mr. Patrick Norton wearing a kilt.  You are, he's wearing his number one kilt.  Oh, sorry, a little too much information.  A little dinner first.  Kevin Rose, the first millionaire in the group is here.  The first hundred thousand air in the group.  And also from System.org, Revision 3, TheBroken.org, Zigg.com, and all those places.  And also David Prager is here, helping him become a millionaire.  Trying.  We should start with that story.  I wanted to start with George Takei as gay, but really we should start with the fact that Kevin is now worth $2.8 million.  No, no, I'm not.  Well, somebody is.  The company is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The company in which Kevin owns majority shares has recently received an investment of $2.8 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So dig.com, dig.com, got an investment from Marc Andreessen, Pierre Omodar of eBay.  Who else?  Reid Hoffman from LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they all together or is it?  It's all together in a series A round.  And how much money did they give you?  $2.8 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you want to see the best part?  So what kind of percentage did you have to give up in the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not, I didn't give up any type of ownership, like controlling interest in the company.  You have controlling interest still?  Oh yeah, so we still have control of everything.  That was a big deal because the whole thing is we hit this kind of growth rate where we had to buy servers like every week.  And those kinds of servers are pretty pricey.  So Google AdSense does not cover like the cost of like $4,000 servers, especially when you're buying like two or three a week.  So we just decided, you know, it's time to go out and raise some money.  And so we were lucky enough to get some really good folks behind us and we got enough to last for a while now.  You're in a colo.  Yes, we have.  And how many servers do you have?  Right now we have seven.  And your own Cisco switch router?  We have our own Cisco router.  No, it's not Cisco.  Oh, I thought you were going to get a Cisco.  We do have a 7200 series, but I think we're getting rid of that one now.  We're getting a new one.  How much bandwidth do you use?  A lot.  That's amazing.  The problem is we're doing about 4 million page views a day now.  And it's pretty insane.  It's one of those things where we're hitting like walls like every week.  We're having to add more and more servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there pressure on you because right now it's tech and actually it's kind of right now it's a certain kind of tech even.  It's very distinguished kind of that G4 crowd is influencing it.  Don't you think?  I mean, it's kind of.  I'd say there's a lot of slash dot in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's the slash dot ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really?  I think it's more.  Initially, I mean, obviously.  There's a lot of case mods.  When we first started, it was just, you know, obviously I pushed the side of my own side and like you've talked about it.  We've got the people that we know.  You've got the core group.  Yeah, the core group got behind it.  But then now it's really cool because we're seeing like stories that have to do with us.  They get reported and removed from the queue because people have no idea who we are.  So it's growing above and beyond that.  So it's a new base.  Are you going to do other channels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have kind of intimated that you might do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was part of the reason that we went after the money as well.  We could have gone after a small amount just to get a few more servers and things like that and kind of keep ahead of the growth.  But we want to hire some developers as well to kind of push out new features.  That's one of the things that's been lacking on the side of the last couple months is we spend so much time like optimizing queries to make sure that we're able to do that.  We spend so much time optimizing queries to make sure that things are running fast that we've had to cut back on developing new features.  So we need some really good PHP developers.  Like we're looking for some.  So if anybody out there is a PHP developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you don't buy who was it that said PHP is bunk and probably Dvorak.  No, no, no, no, no.  Some some big developers said I don't know what they were pushing, but they didn't.  They thought PHP didn't scale very well.  Probably a Microsoft group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it probably was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody doing.  Yeah, as P.  In fact, I think you're right.  It was somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you know, when you're building a new site, it's like it's either going to be Pearl's going to be a PHP, PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Mark Andreessen likes PHP.  Oh, he does.  That's what matters.  He does indeed.  That's right.  That's good.  He's a scaling pretty well for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually we're finally starting to part of the problem is when you build a site like that, you don't really.  I mean, it was just going to be a project.  It was one of those things where the developer, my friend Owen, he's like, I'll spend two weeks developing it and then I'll move on to something else.  And so we really didn't initially write it to like scale to multiple machines.  So now we're having to go back.  You have to load balance.  Right.  That's actually tricky.  So we're writing some of that code to make sure everything load balances properly.  And we're pretty much we're pretty much there.  So it's going to take a few more weeks and some more boxes.  But it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does this mean for system in the broken though?  I mean, are you going to do less for that?  I mean, I still I spend my weekends working on that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's like we do a day job now.  That's right.  I got the nine to five.  No, it's actually put more time into it than that.  Yeah, we're actually signing a lease for some office space here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, you should just get the old tech TV space.  That's too big.  It was awful, too.  It was ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was going to.  It is a big check.  Well, the price is about the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is still empty.  It's still empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they're putting we went by there.  Now, you didn't come with me, did you?  No, I went with Dan and they're actually they're going to shoot car commercials in there and stuff.  They're a little hard thing because you know, they have that back like room in there.  We used to print cars in there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good place to put car commercials.  OK, so is George what happened with George decay?  He came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking about Sulu from Star Trek.  He came out.  Do you think he's the only gay Trekkie?  No.  Who else?  Originally, I want to hear you know, remember there was a great Phil Shatner.  Yeah, there was a great thing where Shatner and Spock were lovers.  They took clips from Star Trek and they edited them together.  It was hysterical.  Oh, my God.  This is a love that dare not say its name.  It was very it was really funny.  It was it was all real clips, but they just edited it in just in just such a way.  So I guess we don't really care what George decay sexual orientation.  You know, it's a century, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or 26, whatever century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, actually in real life right now, he came out.  Oh, I was confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought Mr. Sulu came out.  Oh, all right.  OK.  I didn't realize he was part of the internment though during World War II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  US citizens.  Yeah, he was like he's in his mid 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's 68 years old.  So the Japanese internment camps in California, a lot of Japanese Americans were put in there.  So he was one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't know that he kind of had that stigma and then the whole thing about suppressing his desires.  And finally, finally free.  So he's got his show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know that he suppressed his desires.  I probably don't think that he did.  But we don't know.  According to the article I read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it's because they didn't use his character a lot.  That was what it was really.  It was all kind of.  It was all kind of intense about that.  Leonard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mr. Sulu really should have had a bigger role in that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One person posted that they weren't they were irritated at the timing of the story of Sulu being gay because yesterday Myers, Myers withdraws and then Scooter Libby resigns and then George Piquet pushing these stories off the front page.  Did it push him off the front page?  I don't know.  That's one of these bloggers said that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's like 400 stories up on Google if you search on.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I must be looking at the wrong part of the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've all come out in like the last like 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's because the Trekkies and the sci-fi fanatics are the most the people that are pushing that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is CNET, Eonline, New York Daily News, Japan Today, Mercury News, The Sun.  And I was feeling guilty about covering it on Twitter.  I guess not.  KTVO, proud parenting.  I mean it's everyone.  Proud parenting.  UPI, CBC.  So what's your Halloween costume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you going to wear the kiln?  I think I'm going to be a sailor this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  A little sailor boy.  Really?  I'm a little sailor boy.  Little hat.  Well my wife's dressing up as Rosie the Riveter.  Oh, so you're going to do a 40s thing.  That's cool.  Robert's going to be the sailor.  I'm debating at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to a party tomorrow night.  After the latex thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he's going to wear a mullet.  I think he is wearing a mullet.  I don't want to say anything.  It's totally up to my stylist lady.  I don't tell her what to do.  They're coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to try that.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hear they're coming back.  I think it looks cute.  That's all I needed to hear.  It's a sholo.  Go, baby.  Do your thing.  I'm going to go to the party tomorrow night.  I'm going to go to the party tomorrow night.  I'm going to go to the party tomorrow night.  I was going to go with ground cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to get a bunch of leaves.  I got talked into going towards Monty Python style.  Get here with Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I called them up, and I was like, I need the guy that claps the little things.  The coconuts together.  I have the night thing.  I want you to do a Halloween costume with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If this is a group costume, I have to be the one that looks like a schmuck.  You are.  You're the coconut boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we want you to be the guy playing the coconuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going to be the guy that gets his arm chopped off, the black knight.  He has the costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awesome.  That's great.  You can buy a black knight costume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can buy a black knight costume.  So you're a knight who says knee?  No, I'm not one of the knee knights.  I'm the knight at the round table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  He's Arthur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's Arthur.  What's the answer about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is your name?  But he does have, speaking of gay, he has the gayest looking outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is rather...  Is it silly?  Do you have to wear tights?  No, no tights, but the boots are just big and I have glitter on the shoulders.  It looks like chainmail.  Where'd you go?  At some crappy costume shop.  It's a kiss concert right there.  It's a borderline kiss concert, but it was like 20 bucks and it's too small.  So are you going to go trick or treating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you guys doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to a party?  Yeah, we're going to a party tomorrow night.  I'm being John Paul II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you just ask if we were going to go trick or treating?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you be...  I don't know.  In Petaluma.  I'm going trick or treating with my kid.  I'm going to be John Paul II.  I've got the hat.  I've got white makeup, rotten teeth.  I'm in the late John Paul.  I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When do they stop trick or treating now?  Like a real time version of the Pope?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If somebody asks me, that's what I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm real time.  Only a geek says real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're a real time version of the Pope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the geekiest thing I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy from the Catholic Insider podcast.  He's going to be all over us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love him.  He sounds like this, but he's got a Dutch accent.  So it's the strangest combination.  Professional radio voice through the Dutch accent.  Yeah.  He talks like this, but then he has this Dutch accent.  He's talking like...  It's the weirdest combination.  So Google Base.  Base.Google.com.  They took it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which was up for like five minutes.  Yeah.  But enough people got screenshots.  Plenty of them.  So now, of course, everyone wants to know if they're going to take down eBay and Craigslist.  I don't think it's after eBay.  I think it's more after Craigslist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Craigslist and classified ads.  It's a database, right?  And you fill out a form.  It says, put your stuff on here.  And they mention selling your truck, but they also mention your business.  So it would be a way that people could search.  It's a website, right?  I mean, except without a website.  It's a database.  And when people search Google or search Google Base, they'll find it.  But I think it is classified.  I don't think it hurts eBay because they don't have any of the...  They don't have transactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, except for the fact that they own a huge chunk of Craigslist.  They do?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  eBay, I might be wrong.  I think 20%?  Oh, OK.  But that hurts eBay then.  I remember when eBay bought part of Craigslist, everyone was terrified that they were going  to ruin it because Craigslist is great.  They haven't had a site redesigned in forever.  It's still as funky as ever.  But it works just great.  So it makes you think, how could you take down Craigslist?  It works just great, but there's always room for improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Craigslist is taking down the newspapers.  Newspaper classified revenues down fantastically.  It's hurting them badly.  And this would just be more of the same, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine enabling better function of Google search on Craigslist, and then imagine using  Google's ability to localize stuff into it at the same time.  You don't even have to go into Google San Francisco or Google L.A.  It just knows.  You just let Google know where you are if you tell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this new or did I just notice it?  Because I signed up for...  I have a Google account.  When I do a search now, it'll tell me how many times I've been to the pages that come  up in the results.  Have you seen that?  It's like bookmarking them or letting me know.  You can save your search results.  So I do a search, and the top site is a site I've been to.  It says you've been here four times.  That's interesting.  I haven't seen that.  Is that new or is it just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to log in to your...  Search history function?  It's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's through a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It must be through a cookie.  Well, no, because I have a Google account.  So it does keep track of your searches and stuff.  I've never noticed this before, that it's keeping track of how many times I've been  to a site.  Does that scare you a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't have to log in if you know it's doing it.  I should just log out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see, that's the whole idea.  It's the AOL model.  They get you sucked in on all these servers.  Do you use the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it must be new.  I just noticed it.  Do you use the Google personalized homepage?  That's my homepage.  Okay.  So I'm always logged in to Google.  But that's right.  I've never seen it because I don't use that, which means it's got to be based on your Google  login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was back in May, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know they did the personalized search, but this is the first time I've noticed these  numbers.  And again, it could well be they've been doing it since May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, as long as they give you the ability to go in and turn that off.  Do you think it's an interesting statistic for you to see how many times you've been to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it just worries me that they know it too.  I mean, that's exactly the thing that spy...  People get upset about spyware for keeping track of where you've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a conversation we had like 10 years ago with people who were writing ISPs.  It's like my email is going to be in your server.  You look at that stuff like, no, no, no, I am a benevolent manager of the email system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gmail doesn't bother me.  And that's what the complaint was about Gmail too.  But that doesn't bother me so much.  They're aggregating more and more of what I do.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If people are worried about that stuff, they shouldn't send their photos to a 24-hour photo  development place.  That's the truth.  Because my friend used to work in one.  He says, yeah, there's some pretty...  They keep the good ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My friends had coffee book tables.  They had the albums and they used to collect the worst of it and have it laying right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People think that no one sees these photos when you send them off and there's like 20  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a friend who's a radiologist in the hospital and they also have a book which they  share of fun X-rays.  How the hell?  Exactly.  Exactly, Patrick.  Now get this.  The light bulb didn't break.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen these pictures.  They don't have to worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see it.  In a photo lab, you don't have to worry about it quite as much, but the medical malpractice  kind of did.  I'm sure you sign your life away when you go into a hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they're supposed to distribute your X-rays around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they take the name.  There's no name on it.  John Doe's.  You'd be amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all I can say.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anatomically amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it Bill Joy who said, you know, get over it?  Privacy is already dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  It wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was Scott McNeely.  Same idea, though.  Yeah, he said forget it.  But I think it's still something worth fighting for.  I'm not saying it's not worth fighting for.  You know, the only way to do it, though, is not have a credit card.  Pay cash for everything.  And of course, you'll drive everywhere because you can no longer buy an airplane ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't leave any data crumbs, but it's impossible now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's impossible in the United States without a lot of effort or really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lifestyle.  Well, you have to literally drop out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are a lot of people off the grid in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people off the grid.  A lot of people off the grid in this city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an interesting initiative.  This isn't related, but it's well, it is related in San Francisco and the surrounding counties  want to keep track of homeless people because the problem is they go from county to county,  right?  So they want to track them, which chip them.  What are they going to do?  If I deal with them?  Yeah, they're going to track them.  I think that to me, that's so you can't drop out of it, even if you're a homeless person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's been a problem for a long time, for like at least 10 years.  Floating, floating homeless.  Basically, people will sign up for services in every county and anywhere the bark goes  basically here in the Bay Area and they collect accordingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also some traditions of dumping where people from outlying counties, especially  affluent suburbs, will drive homeless people.  Get in the van.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Literally, you're going to Oakland.  And then a lot of other cities for a long time were simply saying, we'll give you a  free bus ticket to San Francisco.  Right.  And it was like.  Because they have got great services.  Yeah.  The climate's nice.  around here, how it's getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all in IPTV spaces.  Pretty much everybody is everybody here is.  That's kind of weird.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  It's all the tech TV refugees.  They didn't give us what we wanted, so we did it ourselves.  We just did it ourselves.  It's kind of I think it's kind of neat, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody made a really nice compliment.  They referred to the G4 takeover as tech TV is the spawning of the they called it the  spawning of the Xerox park of IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit nicer than we deserve.  Yeah, I agree.  But it was.  It's kind of like that.  We're all off doing our own thing.  And what's nice is we're all together.  It's coopetition.  Coopetition.  Well, I'll tell you, I don't mind what you guys I think what you guys are doing is great.  It scares me when I see the Comedy Central's got four online IPTV channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anyone can do it.  And the pros can have a lot of money.  Well, they can have a lot of money and they can probably but.  What's the story with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're the first network to do this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but there's none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's.  Go ahead.  Personally, I'm gonna say who cares?  It's just streaming content.  I mean, everyone's been doing this for a long time.  Going to MSNBC, we've seen that for like the last five years.  CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're pitching it like it's four channels, like it's a little.  Well, that's links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How are we gonna make this pop, people?  Let's get to the PR people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's like, you know, we're the firm company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's not a network.  It's basically a website with streaming content.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Prager, you don't seem to understand what we've done here with Comedy Central.  We've leveraged our extraordinary content.  But think about how do you know when it's PR?  There's leverage, there's synergy, there's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now, well, if they were to do a web page where there's four channels, you know, this  is the rough and rough stuff for over 21.  This is, you know, four different channels.  You click it and it was on all day, all night.  It was a channel that was on your computer.  That to me would be.  I mean, that's that's that's saying we don't need cable anymore.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, isn't.  CNN said that, I mean, there's a lot of money being made in cable, but CNN said a while  back, you know, much earlier this year, they're like, we're going to put whatever we want  online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Comedy Central says like they don't, they're going to put in like, you know, a lot of three  minute things.  They think that like a half an hour show is still going to be watched on normal TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's a fundamental argument right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which reminds me, this is the, we're done because we're only going to 25 minutes from  now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it means their stuff is totally different than a lot of like, digital live TV is available  streaming, but it's also available to download.  You can't download any of this stuff on Comedy Central's doing.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everyone wants to download and keep their content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a huge, I mean, that's a huge divide because there's people, I've sat in  an office and have been told, you know, there's, there's really no market for this long stuff  on the web.  People don't want it.  It's like, what?  BitTorrent?  VLC?  10 million clients in three and a half months?  What do you think they're watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you watch nerd TV?  I wouldn't want to watch that streaming.  I'd rather just download and watch it and be able to sit there and watch it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about it, they like streaming because you can't save it.  You can't distribute it yourself.  You can't take out the commercials.  And it's easier for advertising.  You can't TV it.  That's actually, that's true.  It's easier for advertising.  You have to watch the ad.  You can't skip, there's no 30 second skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's, it's not so much that they're worried, they, they can count the  ad that way.  If you download it and enter.  That's true.  It's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's better for them.  They can make more money.  It drives traffic to their website, number one.  OzR people have already recorded these shows over the air and posted them to some torrent  So why not redirect that traffic to your website and provide the downloads right there in a  format that, you know.  But you can put a streaming ad in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can have around, they're already on your website.  You can stick ads anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should see some of the, some of the new tools that are coming out for the flash, which  is what a lot of people are using.  Flash video is so easy because everybody has flash.  But they're migrating the tools across flash to other codecs and you'll be able to pick  roll-in spots for ads, lower thirds that pop in on ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's even sites now that take a stream and integrate an ad into it and then  send it out to you.  So they're on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what annoys me about regular TV is why I started downloading shows in the  first place is to avoid that you watch a show in like prime time nowadays, they'll have  a lower third pop up in like the first 10 seconds.  That show comes back from a commercial.  Then they'll have some crawl up the side for another show that may be coming up later that  evening.  Yeah.  And you can no longer, I mean, leaving like two thirds of the show being cut off due to  these ads that are now dynamically popping up.  And Teva wants to do it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Teva wants to do it in its own interface.  They're going to start doing that.  I'm already moving, putting Serenity on my iPod video so I can watch it on the plane.  I think that'll be fun, right?  What do you get?  Are you, is there any, what's the deal with iPod video encoding?  Have you guys kind of started working on that?  It's easy to do.  It's one click.  If you use the QuickTime Pro.  What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you get video for free?  Oh yeah, the aura.  Yeah, I downloaded that.  Just watch.  I mean, the only thing you have to be careful is if you're, you have to have QuickTime 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to do that.  It does it without that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not without the, you don't need the pro version.  Okay.  The biggest thing is just making sure when you're encoding that you're paying attention  whether or not your original content is an HD widescreen format or if it's 4x3.  You want 320, 320x240.  Well everything ends up being 320x240, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you can encode for 40x480 on the iPod, which would be fine if you're playing back  on a TV.  Yeah, but I mean the.  If you're doing MPEG 4, but then it screws it up on the iPod screen.  Yeah, you're either going to skinny vision it or you're going to cut it off or you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to have that little tiny, what's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yours had bars on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it all depends on how you encode it and also depends on whether you have widescreen  playback.  The other thing is you can do a pretty high resolution output, higher resolution output  from the iPod or the iPod on the new video version.  I was playing it on the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was watching Desperate to Housewise on the TV.  You can get a higher resolution like an MPSC.  Right, you get 40x480, right.  No, higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Higher than that?  Like 652.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the encoding, yeah.  It's like iPod video, click.  But the problem with that though is it's MP4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's MPEG 4.  It's not H.264.  No, it's H.264 when it does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No it's not.  It's MP4.  Really?  Why would they do that?  Why would they say output?  Well, a bunch of people were like.  Right, but why wouldn't they just do H.264?  Alex, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It takes more processor speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  H.264 is so processor intensive.  The bandwidth of the computer is 2.4.  In order for that to work on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when it creates an M4V file, it's creating a MPEG 4.  It's not using the H.264 compressor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's creating a huge file.  It's creating like a tool.  I know that.  That's the problem.  It's like 40% larger.  So Videora is the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that lets you choose...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but what Alex was saying is part of the problem is  the battery life is already miserable on it.  It's like 2.25, maybe 2.5 hours of battery life.  We've just started to do some testing over PCMag  and over Extreme iPod, but we're looking to see  what happens if we run it in H.264.  Do we lose even more battery power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You probably would because it's so intense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although often you have processor intensive  on the front end so that you can play it back easier.  It's not so bad on the other end.  Let me know what you find out.  I'm going to start encoding whatever you guys want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it's easy.  That way I don't have to do anything.  Patrick's with the work.  Patrick, how's it working, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you've saved my ass more than once.  I said, Kevin, what are we doing with this?  Why hasn't anybody sat down and explained  all the video encoding options anywhere?  Well, that's what's fun about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all figuring it out at the same time.  I think that's the best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tiki TV does a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we all love Lala.  Quick, a drool cup.  Tiki bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is this?  What is this Tiki TV?  Tiki TV.  I'll show you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As soon as the video iPod popped up to number one,  so of course all of us, or at least I did,  and Leo and Kevin are like, oh, what's this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw the first episode and then the second and third.  Red October, the last one is hysterical.  The fourth and the fifth.  Lala grows on you.  Lala is a...  I hear there's other people on there.  She does a great job.  I know that tone.  She's downloading now.  Very good talents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tiki, tiki bar.  I don't know who they are.  You and I both corresponded with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I talked to Dr. Tiki.  I asked him if they'd be on the show.  He calls himself.  He signs his emails Dr. Tiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, would you like to be on the show?  He said, only if we can stay in character.  So you guys are fanboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit.  We both wrote to the Tiki bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you guys just dress up at the time for Halloween?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I could pull that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've already invested in Pope outfits.  And he's got the gay knight thing.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm my clapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see this NTT?  NTT.  You see this NTT Docomo has created a joystick that makes  your head bob.  Why do these keep coming back?  It's it.  They've actually.  This is this is the big phone company in Japan.  So it's not like some cuckoo, you know, mad scientist  somewhere, but they put electrodes on your head.  That would be so cool.  They put electrodes on your head and they can.  And they've already steered a human through a maze using this  thing.  And the cockroaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a human remote control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have a remote control.  I put electrodes in your skull and I can steer me and the  other hope that of our producers.  You know, that's funny because you should say that because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  somebody said, oh, that's great.  We get you to be on the right camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want to see him hook up a dance dance revolution.  That's you know, that's what they're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or driving games and your head will go like this as you steer.  I'm sure that's what they're looking at.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen here in the states though,  right?  Probably couldn't do it.  Well, I don't know.  I smell big.  The game shows are crazy.  I'm trying to find what network runs that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You notice when people fall on Spike.  Yeah.  And they dub over it.  I don't like what Spike does to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to see the original.  You know, it's the same thing with Iron Chef.  Yeah, but it's like somebody making up reminds me when I was  a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Iron Chef I can get like the subtitles and Iron Chef are  great, but like the MXC watch the guy go is just like,  Bob Parvo at Guadalajara works in chewing gum removal from  shoes in Tokyo's Grand Central Station.  That's a great show.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they'll stream that.  Hey, talk about Lala.  Did you see that Microsoft got a little trouble with Judge  Cotelli, Kathleen Cotar Cotelli, whatever her name is,  for the trust settlement.  They put out a memo that said that everybody who is going to  make portable cell music and music stores had to make a  cell portable players had to ship it with Windows Media  player or else or else.  You know, you must you must use Windows Media.  And of course, that's a horrible violation of the  antitrust settlement.  And the judge was came down and she's had this happen.  Here's Microsoft's excuse.  They said, oh, we got a new guy.  He didn't know what the rules were.  Excellent.  That's awesome.  I got to remember that one.  So put on the new guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was the new guy.  And somehow, you know, he wrote this memo and it went to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  every portable music player manufacturer in the world.  So they've pulled back on that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The judge was very upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How would you have the gall to say that anyway?  If you're Microsoft, it's their place for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must include Windows Media player.  We're trying to ensure a consistent user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you're going to be part of our branded place for sure  system, you need to include blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  You're so good at that, Patrick.  You must have read far too many press releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was raised by salespeople.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been doing it.  I've been reading press releases like a thousand a  year for the last decade.  It blends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft also says, I don't know if we want to believe  this, this might be the new guy too, that software,  the software industry is ill prepared to make use of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  new dual core processors from AMD and Intel.  What they're really saying is we're not, Vista won't be  dual core.  We're not going to be dual core.  We're not going to be dual core.  Vista won't be dual core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, think about, there's just, there's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is kind of, if you think it's kind of bizarre since  they're introducing the Xbox 360 with,  with three processors.  And they already, already developed the ID and the APIs,  you know, for that system.  So it seems kind of,  I think they're just preparing us for a huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  disappointment with Vista.  That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Programmers are still getting their feet wet though,  dealing with multi-threaded, multi-core systems.  Doesn't the compiler just do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the compiler, but think about the thread we were  reading online, where the guy was sitting there and his,  his, his, he moved to a dual core system and Firefox,  just the performance went to snot and he couldn't figure  out, he couldn't figure out, he finally ended up like  reassigning it so it aligns itself with one,  it signs itself with one processor.  It wasn't threading, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instead of being threaded.  And it was affecting every other application on a system  too when he had that window open as well.  That's kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we all go out and buy dual core Pentium D's,  we might have slower machines.  Or X2 processors.  Yeah.  Wow.  Does anybody here have a dual core?  We used to do that in our gaming machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember when we...  You had to assign it to one processor.  Yeah, we had to.  We did, one processor would run the server and the other  one would run the actual game itself.  And that actually helped out.  That worked for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Strange.  Well, who was it, Carmack?  Who said that dual processors are worthless for...  Yeah, she said, apparently he said that it would probably,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would not come into its own until the next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now Microsoft's saying the same thing.  Which means, it makes me wonder, maybe I should just  hold off on an X2.  Well, in particular for the Xbox 360,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's really about X and A, the, the,  the software platform that they're using.  And hopefully maybe they can enable some tools in there  that make it simply easier to...  All the games right now.  I don't know if you can really port  for the 360.  Single threaded apps.  I think you really have to take a look  at what the application's doing overall.  Because you have to think about what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to, you know, you have a lot of  prediction you have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's played with the latest Vista?  You guys have played with it at all?  No?  Seen a little bit.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a beta.  I mean, why even bother me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going to look that way in a year, is it?  I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's going to,  I think actually the only thing  that's going to be happening is the arrow  and the glass interface.  And, you know, there's going to be  some stuff integrated in Windows Media Player 11,  which will be available for XP,  and, you know, Internet Explorer 7,  which will be available for XP.  Mac OS.  I swear I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pushing it that way.  I tell you.  So is it like at the point where

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2000 was still known as NT5?  Windows Vista, like NT,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  only prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft really needs to do,  to be honest.  What they really, really need to do  is start stealing some employees from Apple.  That's what they have to do.  I mean, that's what Google's doing to them.  I mean, they should go and just  hire some UI designers from Apple or something.  What happens if Apple employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at that level try to leave?  They must just get sued into a movie.  They're probably eliminated.  There's a bunch of assassins

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with black troll decked bunnies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With white Apple logos on their chest.  The ninjas, the Apple ninjas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a vision of like an employee agreement  where it's like if you leave Apple,  you can work in farming  as long as you don't touch your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can teach skiing.  They probably get one medical benefit  to go in for surgery.  You have this big scar on their forehead.  Actually, Apple employees leave all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as long as Steve Jobs doesn't leave.  And Jonathan Ives doesn't leave.  They're all chipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a giant bat.  Google bats.  Bill Gates says,  we do not fear Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a direct quote.  Yeah.  When you start saying things like that,  scared to death.  Shouldn't you make those comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he prefaced it by saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're a very serious big competitor.  I mean, I'm paraphrasing.  Well, it's interesting  because you would think Operating System Company  web search engine.  Web services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because web services are taking over  the roles of a lot of software.  Who needs an OS?  Who needs an OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're sitting there thinking  we have nothing to fear but fear itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just wait, man.  Google's going to get slapped

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with an NHS suit in about three years.  You think Bill Gates gets trick or treating?  Google's going to get slapped  with an NHS suit in about three years.  You think Bill Gates gets trick or treating?  Google's taking over the world.  At his house.  You think what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill Gates gets trick or treating.  You and I could go as Sergey and Larry.  Yeah, but does he have a gate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and a mile of laundry?  You probably can't get anywhere near the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you guys see that online office suite?  What is it?  It's an Excel type program.  Think free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very cool.  That's been around for a while.  It's a long time.  Cool.  That's like an example too.  And now Microsoft's saying  that we are going to support  this is the weirdest thing.  They just announced  they're going to support  the open office extensions.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  And you know who it is?  It's Ozzy.  The Lotus guy.  What's his name?  Ray Ozzy.  Really?  Who is now at Microsoft.  He's I think his CTO over there  and comes from kind of a non-Microsoft background.  And Ozzy's saying,  yeah, you know, we don't feel  the file format should be real proprietary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, wasn't that because  like wasn't it Massachusetts  or someone that said  they could take Office unless  they do the open file format  or open office format?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're moving that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which I think is very interesting.  My biggest problem with using  open office is because  is the fact that I have to save it out  as a Microsoft compatible  if I want to send it to most people  because they're using Office.  Well, ideally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and Microsoft always makes noise  that they're going to do  some sort of XML format.  I mean, ideally there would be  a kind of cross platform.  There is.  There's RTF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use RTF all the time.  Well, there are also some huge arguments  on the web talking about open office  where people are comparing  the amount of memory,  the footprint,  and the processor time it takes  for open office to say  open up a thousand table Excel spreadsheet  where it takes like  three and a half minutes  for open office versus  like fifteen seconds for Excel.  I mean, Excel has been around  a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been tuned and tuned and tuned.  I mean, what version is it?  Fifteen? Six?  I mean, it's this.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, you know,  two or three years from now  free versus, I mean,  some of these guys  at Fortune 500 are going to say,  hey, do we really want to spend  half a million dollars renewing  our Office license this year  or should we just go for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But think of all the time you'll save  when you shave three seconds off.  And I think the businesses  aren't that short-sighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they don't look at  the cost of the software.  They look at the overall cost of  maintaining it.  The company I used to work for  was busted by,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they had a disgruntled ex-employee  who called up Microsoft.  No, a couple jobs back.  But they called up Microsoft  and they came down and it turned out  there was like less than  one percent of the systems  in the company had  some version of some problem  with the software load.  Yeah, legitimate software load.  They can't just come in.  Oh yeah, the BSA.  They come in.  They essentially can.  But the thing is  that prompted the company then  to dump every piece of Windows  software in the entire company  switch it all over Linux  hire a couple of IT guys  and then they were able to  customize every load  on every desktop.  It's like, why does my account  need a web browser?  It's like, I don't want  them surfing the web.  Don't put that on here.  But now they spend next to nothing  they can keep the same old  hardware they've had forever  which is another big benefit  of using Linux.  It's a really neat solution.  It's a good example  I think for a lot of companies.  And they've been happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's worked for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Productivity is the same  and they have more control  over using desktops.  How can it work  if I can't surf up my desk?  That's a problem.  Like right now  we have aim viruses  running all over the place  at work.  I don't know how people do it.  I never seem to get any of this stuff.  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't had a virus  in what, six years.  That you know of.  Well, no.  Why have AVG?  You sure you're not rooted?  It's not.  If you had a rootkit on there  you wouldn't know.  I have firewall.  I'm good.  I'm being serious.  What you don't know  won't hurt you.  I hate how people  just freak out.  There's so much like fear  like there's a hacker  on my machine.  No, there's not.  There is a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People really do freak out.  They assume.  Anything goes wrong  they assume.  I'm hacked.  My mom calls me early.  Who's going to hack it?  You know, my CD drawer  opens all the time.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does?  Kid, press the button.  I'm like, wait a second.  Your CD drawer opens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not right.  That's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was talking to a high school kid  and his final prank  before he just graduated  high school  was to actually add to the kernel  of the Linux system  they had in their network  was to open and close  all the CD drawers  and there was just no way  to stop it.  They had to basically reload  because they actually stuck  it into the kernel itself.  I was just like, dude,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's cool.  And that is one argument  against open source  is that you've got the source.  You can recompile.  You can rebuild.  I need a new feature.  Microsoft's actually going up  against 13 spam operations  that are zombieing computers.  I mean, that I think is  there really is an argument  against Windows users  normal people using Windows  because they have a hard time securing it  and almost all the spam  that's being sent right now  is zombie PCs  running Windows  and they don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of spam  still being run by legitimate  ISPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what they do is they create  well, possibly, but what's happening  is you get these people  in Eastern Europe  and you're right, they originate the spam  but what they do is they use  these zombie computers  to distribute it all over  the United States.  The FTC is joining  with Microsoft.  They make a lot of money.  You bet.  They get like 10 cents  7 to 10 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They hired great programmers  to write good viruses  to take over systems  and cash in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They hired the Cold War  all those governments  invested heavily in  computer programming  and science.  They get a lot of Romanians

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who have no jobs.  But they all have PhDs  and FX or something.  You know, who knows?  So you think that ISPs  are still relaying spam?  I was sitting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in one of my welding classes  like six months ago  like, okay, everybody get out of your system  I'm learning how to tag weld, alright?  I have issues  it's an off road thing.  Give him that shock.  Give me my shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I heard that  I'm getting a new one in February  and will I get the chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to beat the cut if...  When do they start putting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're putting RFID in these things.  So does it go with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even like I have like  another four years left?  You won't have to get a new one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but the next one you get  but mine runs out in February  so I'm getting one  probably pretty soon.  It's all about the microwave oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said by next year  they want to do all the passports.  They're already swiping  and scanning current passports.  Yeah, I mean  it's a barcode.  There's a barcode on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After October 2006.  Oh sorry.  It just makes it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  simply harder to duplicate  another barcode  instead it just takes that  whatever that number is  and drops it into a chip  that they can scan.  Are there any safeguards  privacy stuff?  Somebody told me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're going to use  foil pages on either side of it.  They're actually going to do that  to make it so you can't read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see  what it turns out to be  when it ships.  Put in a little lid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of RFID experts have told me  they're not that readable.  You got to get pretty close.  I've seen somebody read

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  RFID tags from 60 feet away.  Six zero?  Six zero.  That was a DEF CON right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was John's crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Herring's crew.  Brian in the process.  Was that a microwave receiver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he just used a  sensitive enough receiver.  He just used a big old  honking antenna.  And so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and so it's  and so it's  And that's the fear  is that if you're carrying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a passport somebody  well of course  then they have to decode it  although presumably that  won't be so hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they do a better job  than Xerox did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in coding the  color laser.  So is it an active radio  frequency that comes out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or is he just bouncing  a radio wave  How does that work?  You bounce something off of it.  So you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can try to explain it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I'll screw it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so bad about it.  I believe you're exciting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then it simply emits  using the energy that it receives.  Just like a shock.  Exactly.  Like a shock.  Same thing as  the excited shock  and it emits.  If you love your dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find a box of Nilo Wave Tire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it always says  put it in the basket  and then you put it in  and it never registers it.  I was thinking the trick is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to just refuse to use them  and hope that they'll give up  and go back to hiring.  I think people go to the human.  I think it started out  with Walmart or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start with those.  The first one I saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was in a supermarket  actually an upscale  supermarket in San Diego.  Sometimes it works better though.  Because only the poor people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would actually have someone else.  Nobody wants to use it  because it's a little more.  I use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have any problem with it.  I mean as long as you  know exactly what to expect  it's like trying to use  a voice recognition system  and if you're standing there  in the street  you know it's not going to work  but if you know exactly  how to hold your hand over the phone  and how to nuncie it correctly  then you can fly through it.  Are the home improvement stores?  But it's  It's not beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not user friendly yet.  You can have one thing  at home and improve it  and it's a four hour experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just trying to get in and out of there.  Yeah, you set your bag here  it weighs it, you drag it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you put it in the other bag over here  it weighs it again  your money goes in here  your change comes out here  the credit card slot is here  the screen is here at an angle  you can't read  it's the worst  It's the worst design ever.  They give you 5% off if you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they?  No, I said they're nice  but they did  because you're saving their money.  Do what they use  at some supermarkets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just check me out  through a regular  and I'll bag it myself.  I want a bagger  I want a checkout clerk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want them to ask me  paper or plastic  and say have a nice day.  Do you have a guy  that takes your groceries out for you?  Yes, I do.  When you get over

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  when you get to be my age  they'll go mmmmm.  They say do you like to help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and you say yes.  Yeah, they do that to everybody  at Safeway.  But see what Kevin was saying  is the ideal situation  is you walk into the store  and you have your little  your credit card has  a little RFID type tag on it  you grab everything you want  stick it in your cart  and walk out the door  that would be cool.  That's what Walmart wants  to be probably.  How long is it going to be before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, somebody's got to probably  No, somebody's got to park  a van out front  with an antenna inside  and be like oh yeah.  I was scanning.  Why do you have that type  of cleaning van

Transcript:  Oh, you mock me  Anything else  you guys want to talk about  before we wrap this sucker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I saw a funny story  Something that's coming out  in the journal Nature, I think  It was talking about  Einstein and Darwin  and the number of letters  they receive  and the number of letters  they send out  and they said  they're very characteristic  of the way people like us  use email  and I don't know  who kept these kind of  They were like precursors  of  Einstein sent more than  14,500 letters  but he received  more than 16,200  and responded  to a quarter of them  Darwin mailed  7,500 letters  and he responded 32%  I got 1,600 letters  a day  How do they keep this data  because they're also talking  about how many of them  responded within 10 days  versus responding within  50 days  and they're talking about  like their habits  are very similar  to the type of habits  you can create an algorithm  that predicts  how many people  are going to respond  to emails  to what people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and obviously get grant money  That makes sense though  They were probably  early examples  of people who get  a lot of mail  But you have to actually  sit down and write  a freaking letter  That's a lot of work  I have shortcuts  I use Textpander  and I can type  a three letter abbreviation  for most of the stuff  that I write  So I'll open an email  and even then  I still can't answer  every email I get  but it sure saves  a lot of time  So three letters  So I'm going to type  gg4 it says  I'm giving away  my secrets now  Thank you very much  for your support  We're really glad  to be back on g4 tech TV  and we couldn't have done it  without your cards  and letters  So keep watching  and we're trying  to get a better time  And then  There's people  crying right now  They're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought I received  an email  So when I'm in the hospital

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you send me  a get well card  It was just three letters  A little rubber stamp  I do press a send button myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have an assistant  You know what  You need to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to make it  just a recursive action  Well I do  I have a number  of different boilerplates

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I can combine  But just make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an Apple script  so you can get  a list of all the names  that you have  a certain form letter  you need to send to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be nice  and if somebody  would write this  I would appreciate it  Some sort of artificial  intelligence thing  that could look at  the message  and know what my answer  would be  So I don't even have  to think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to Ars Technica  after its last look  at the DMCA  I'm just quoting  the Copyright Office  in 2003  issued a handful  of exemptions to the law  including  software protected by  dongles  in the case where the  dongle was broken or obsolete  along with video games  distributed in formats  that have become obsolete  and which require  the original media  or hardware  as a condition of access

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means  a ROM would be legal, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the distributed format  has become obsolete  It's the scariest sound  I've ever seen  and the original media  or hardware  as a condition of access

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it sounds like it  So if I had a Galaxian ROM  I can't  the hardware is obsolete

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What defines it as obsolete  does obsolete mean  you can't find the hardware  or that it's no longer  produced new anymore  I believe it's just  the new part  I'll give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't buy it  If I gave you  the whatever  the ROM chip  for a Galaxian game  and said here  I'm going to come in here  to call the copyright office
