Transcript:  And also my old friend Patrick Norton.  My former co-host at Screensaver is currently hosted at Techzilla.  With Snubs.  It's great to see you once again.  Also host of this week in computer hardware.  Yes.  I immediately sent a note to Anan Shimpey.  Saying, because did you see Anan's retiring?  32 years old and he's retiring.

Start time: 165.24
End time: 166.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Start time: 168.00
End time: 173.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they just posted this in IRC.  I figured he was going to go to Intel.  No, he is going to work at Apple.

Start time: 174.56
End time: 182.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, okay, Anan Shimpey, we knew him from when he was a high school kid.  And we started writing Anan's tech.  Pat, thank you for that.

Start time: 184.13

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Goal!

Start time: 188.22
End time: 201.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick Norton and I interviewed him many times on the screensavers.  He's one of the smartest, if not the smartest analysts out there.  His long pieces on how Intel works and stuff like that.  Just phenomenal.

Start time: 201.32
End time: 221.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he kind of also, like when solid state drives became a thing.  Anan does the homework.  Anan does the homework at an obsessive compulsive level.  And he benchmarks.  And he, well, you laugh, right?  But when you realize how much time it takes and how many product managers and engineers you have to develop relationships with to get answers like that.  And it's crazy, right?  Because, you know, he's insane.

Start time: 222.02
End time: 230.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he says he was traveling 130,000 miles a year.  I believe it.  That's how much work.  Now, the interesting thing there is Anan.

Start time: 232.42
End time: 237.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  After 17.5 years of digging, testing, analyzing and writing about the most interesting stuff in tech, it's time for a change.

Start time: 238.08
End time: 248.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was 14 years old when he started Anan's tech in 1997.  Thirty two now.  What's interesting is his blog post doesn't mention Apple.

Start time: 249.20
End time: 265.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, but it made it clear that he would be around to talk to people if they needed anything, but that he wouldn't have any editorial anything going on.  And the way it was written made me think, OK, so he got some sort of big offer from a big company.  And I just assumed Intel.  But Apple actually makes a lot of sense.

Start time: 266.50
End time: 273.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rico just posted.  That it was Apple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Interesting.

Start time: 274.18
End time: 277.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think Anan would do at Apple?  Ship research?

Start time: 278.35
End time: 296.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, probably some some probably some product design.  I mean, he's as Patrick was saying, he does his homework and he doesn't just do his homework.  He does his homework hardcore like the testing and sweets he's created are some of the best out there.  I mean, he he's one of the smartest people I've ever met and and certainly one of the favorite people I've ever had to read.  So I agree.

Start time: 297.26
End time: 300.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a loss, I feel, to to people.  The consumer.

Start time: 302.54
End time: 326.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is unless he could actually maybe have a role in building and designing the next generation of mobile phone ships or GPUs or CPUs.  I mean, he we certainly lose a huge amount, I think, from having him not writing these things.  But if he could take his knowledge and his fantastic analysis to the product design side, I mean, that could be kind of cool.  Right.

Start time: 327.71
End time: 351.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Patchkoski, as usual, with a scoop.  And he says in his article, which was posted half an hour ago, an Apple rep has confirmed that the company is hiring.  So, boy, that's an interesting, unexpected twist to that story.  Congrats, Anand.  Yeah, congrats, Anand.  I guess congrats.  I presume that in order for him to abandon a non-tech, they must have offered him a lot of money.  Don't you think?

Start time: 352.43
End time: 357.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's called it.  I think that they backed Brinks truck up.  I think that's what that's called.  Full of stock.

Start time: 357.48
End time: 368.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, or more likely they offered him a challenge that he couldn't resist.  Oh, totally.  Totally.  I don't really think Anand is motivated by money.  I'm sure he likes money, but I don't think he's really motivated by it.  Oh, sure.

Start time: 369.16
End time: 375.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now I am embarrassed because I wrote him a note saying, hey, anytime you want to come on Twitter, please do.  But I guess he's busy.  Hey, you never know.

Start time: 376.04
End time: 392.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You never know.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah, I mean, he was saying in his note that he, I can't believe he's only like a year older than I am.  And, you know, he's been doing this for almost 18 years.  That's a really long time to do something.  So I think Patrick's point about wanting to challenge that makes a lot of sense.

Start time: 392.24
End time: 408.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He might be a little tired, a little wants to relax a little bit.  Well, that brings us to Apple because apparently they're building a giant structure next to the Flint Center and something is going on.  Apple invitations have gone out.  Did you get one?  No.  Did you get one?

Start time: 409.08
End time: 409.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.

Start time: 410.14
End time: 417.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shut up.  Do you remember the thing we did where I said OS 10 wasn't that much easier than Windows?  Like, come on, Apple's not that petty.

Start time: 420.20
End time: 425.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gizmodo, Gizmodo got back, got let back in Gizmodo is going to the Apple event.

Start time: 426.04
End time: 456.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the invitation.  It says nine nine twenty fourteen.  This was the date that many had speculated.  Renee Richey said it would be this date I might point out in the spring, but only based on previous Apple announcements.  So it usually is right around the first full week of September.  It's always on a Tuesday.  Wish we could say more is the only text besides the date on the page.  I don't think you get more oblique than that.  Usually people read into these things and you can't read into that.

Start time: 456.76
End time: 469.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to Vegas and make a bet on this that you could probably get really nobody's going to take that like, oh, there's not going to be an iPhone.  There's definitely an iPhone.  So there's an iPhone 6.  Pachkoski says there's a watch.  Everybody says they're a watch.

Start time: 469.30
End time: 487.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but we didn't think that.  Well, Gruber said that they would announce it in September and then he took it back.  He said, oh, I was just joking.  But it turns out it wasn't much of a joke because he was right.  And Pachkoski has said now he's not saying watch.  Everybody's saying now wearable.  We don't want to get too boxed in.  Could be a hat.  The eye hat.

Start time: 489.06
End time: 490.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's the eyeglasses.

Start time: 491.00
End time: 499.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason Snell says a smart hat is a better idea than a smart watch.  And I kind of agree.  More people wear hats than watches nowadays, right?  I don't know.

Start time: 501.48
End time: 509.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe if it has one of those, you know, like one of those Homer Simpson hats that connects to the beer can so you can drink your beer or your apple martini through it.  What exactly?

Start time: 511.22
End time: 521.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even want to engage the concept of a smart hat because suddenly like, well, you know, I can totally see it would be better with solar cells.  It could measure your effect.

Start time: 521.22
End time: 529.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could have a little thing for your ear so it could measure more stuff like your blood sugar and your VO Max and all that.

Start time: 529.40
End time: 536.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're already putting like the little things they clip on your finger in the hospital.  I've already seen those built into a watch into actually watch band style.

Start time: 536.48
End time: 537.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you put it on your finger.

Start time: 538.54
End time: 547.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's actually embedded in the bottom of the watch face to the underside.  It actually does like VO to I am told that it's difficult to do.

Start time: 547.36
End time: 587.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do pulse, but not when you're exercising and it's difficult to do blood pressure on the wrist.  I've been told.  I don't know.  Blood pressure is pretty difficult.  I'm not a doctor.  You don't really want your watch getting really tight for a little while.  And then I'm letting it know you don't want that.  That would be weird.  It will be at the Flint Center.  This is Apple doesn't do typically doesn't do announcements in Cupertino in the past.  They've done them at the Moscone Center.  They got too big to do them because it went in for years.  Moscone West is big.  Yeah, Moscone West is big, but they haven't been four times the size.

Start time: 587.00
End time: 605.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah, this is I think it was a David Smith posted the seating capacity in Cupertino where they have the watch band.  And Cupertino where they sometimes do it on campus.  It's like that's kind of people.  Yeah, it's like seven hundred and ninety or eight hundred people at Moscone West.  And then it's twenty five hundred at the Flint Center.

Start time: 606.06
End time: 606.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not that many.

Start time: 608.36
End time: 616.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I mean, if you're talking about four times of an increase, you know, you know, you know, going from seven something to like, you know, twenty five hundred people.  I mean, that's a that's still pretty significant.

Start time: 617.10
End time: 658.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this also sounds like maybe they're going back to the old days where because one of the things that used to be amazing about going to an Apple press conference  back before I got, you know, persona non grata was, you know, they would they would they would have sort of like a layer of people who are probably going to be presenting or right.  They were heavily involved, a couple of people.  And they would bury the media a few rows back and they would put like all of everyone who worked on the project came next and everyone who.  Right. You know, I mean, they would pack the building.  It was so awesome because, you know, the media would be surrounded by people who'd be like,  you know, as soon as Steve walks on stage and something gets announced and the only time I ever heard that backfire was when they announced the Intel processors.

Start time: 659.52
End time: 662.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that Mac world literally.

Start time: 663.06
End time: 681.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The entire audience went except for like me and three other people who had actually done real benchmarks and knew that the Apple.  I was excited. Yeah.  Oh, the process is going to be faster and less expensive.  What a great idea, Steve. You're going to actually, you know, use code that can be portable across different platforms.  What a great idea, Steve.

Start time: 682.34
End time: 694.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was at WDC, right.  And that was when you have like people who've spent a decade like buying drinking the Kool-Aid that no, no, no, no.  Power PC really is better, even though we can't get a faster processor to go on a laptop because it runs so hot.

Start time: 695.36
End time: 699.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, do remember the developers disdain a little bit the x86 architecture.

Start time: 700.26
End time: 747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was there was if you had spent all your superior coders work on a risk platform because that's why it's been done in the Unix world for decades.  I mean, if you're going to go the Kray route, I mean, that's a possible upgrade.  But yeah, but I mean, you'd also be like, you know, you'd read the you'd recreate benchmarks that Apple was building ad campaigns around.  And it was like Apple's taking code that the finest engineers on the planet have combed and picked the knits out of and made amazing.  And then they'd use jank out of the box code run on an x86 platform.  They'd be like, you know, megahertz per megahertz.  We kick their ass. And it's like, OK, that's a good point.  So you take you know, you took the latest Audi diesel powered race car and put it up against like a 53 beetle.  And yes, you're faster. But that was also the Apple way.  We're not lying. We're just nuancing the truth.

Start time: 747.16
End time: 783.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a very big and I mean, big building being built next to the Flint Center that is obviously part of this Apple event.  Now, Apple, the Flint Center does have some history with Apple.  That's where the Macintosh was announced.  Remember Steve Jobs in a bow tie pulling the Mac out of the case.  This is how long I'm a Mac. Remember that?  That was at the Flint Center. In fact, they just had a an anniversary celebration a few months ago at the Flint Center for the original Macintosh, which came out in 1984.  Thirty, forty years. What? How many years? Forty years.  Wait, thirty. Yeah, thirty. OK.  OK.

Start time: 784.00
End time: 784.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank God. OK.

Start time: 787.05
End time: 794.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so that you think it's so they can have more people.  Definitely. So there would be room to invite Gizmodo and me and Patrick.

Start time: 796.99
End time: 804.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There should be. OK.  I got an invite is all I'm saying. And are you going to invite it?  We're there sitting a photographer in my place.

Start time: 804.38
End time: 808.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is crazy. So this is actually they're calling it a side stage.

Start time: 808.87
End time: 823.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the demo room, but I don't know. It's an interesting.  So Apple often at these events.  The one reason I would want to go is Apple often, as they did with the iPhone and the iPad, gives you a chance to touch it long before it's actually available.  They didn't do that with the iPhone. I take that back. But the iPad.

Start time: 823.34
End time: 828.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you read the article about the launch of the iPhone?  Yeah. Wasn't that fascinating?  They weren't actually sure the iPhone would get through the demos.

Start time: 830.04
End time: 866.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from a book, a fabulous book called Dogfight, which I loved.  And one of the scenes is one of the Apple engineers and they would take a drink each time a step of the demo got cleared without a break with it without something crashing.  And he says, by the end of it, we were very happy and very drunk because they're sitting in the audience going, I was sitting behind him.  I didn't notice all that going on.  I do think this bodes well. It means that there will be a demo room and a fairly large demo room at that for iPhones and maybe even for wearables.

Start time: 867.40
End time: 872.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, to me, the fact that they're doing it this much bigger signifies that they're announcing something else like this.

Start time: 873.44
End time: 891.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eddie Q, we might point out, at the All Things D event or I guess it was the was it recode by then at the event earlier this year?  The code conference.  The code conference earlier this year said Apple has the best product pipeline I've seen in 25 years.  It's a long time. This might be part of that product pipeline.

Start time: 892.12
End time: 899.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're going to do something that's better than the resurrection of the Macintosh brand, the resurrection of the Macintosh platform, the introduction of the next generation.  It's saying a lot.

Start time: 900.32
End time: 969.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod.  It's saying a lot.  We'll see, Eddie. It could just be marketing.  By the way, speaking of great articles, Mark Gurman, once again, 9to5Mac, a long, very well researched piece on Apple's marketing technology.  Their ability to sway the press.  It's fascinating reading, which I highly recommend and talks about the fact that, for instance, two weeks before these events, they're rehearsing,  which means right now Tim Cook is spending his Sunday afternoon inside a sealed room at Flint Center.  They are provided with white booklets for the keynote, which are shredded before the actual event.  It's a great story about the title is Seeing Through the Illusion, Understanding Apple's Mastery of the Media.  And I think here we are, three people who've covered Apple for quite some time.  I think we would have to agree that Apple, there's no one better at doing this than Apple, whether it's the keynotes, the product announcements, or just simply getting the press to go along.

Start time: 970.49
End time: 970.59
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes?

Start time: 971.44
End time: 996.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're the best, far and away. They're the best.  They're one of the only ones who, I mean, they're going to be announcing this.  Technically, some things with IFA will still be going on.  And I guarantee you that next week in Berlin, everybody's going to be talking about Apple and not about all the stuff that's happening there.  They're one of the only companies I can think of in any industry who fully dominates the conversation, no matter what's happening around them.  They are masters of that.

Start time: 997.42
End time: 1004.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many times have we been at CES in January when Apple is the topic, not there, but the topic of discussion, right?

Start time: 1006.13
End time: 1021.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've also, they dominate the industry in some very interesting ways.  I mean, it's also, I mean, think about this way, like, you know, John Gruber during Fireball, great analyst, great to read, great.  But then he became like he got on the list with, you know, who else?  Walt Mossberger, David Pogue.

Start time: 1022.28
End time: 1025.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Mossberg, Steve Jobs would actually take him for walks.  Right. And John Gruber.

Start time: 1026.40
End time: 1036.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those are the three people who get early access, who basically get to see NDA looks at Apple products.  Is there anybody else on that list?  Ed Baig from USA Today.  OK.

Start time: 1037.02
End time: 1045.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pogue now is at Yahoo.  We can presume he'll still get access.  Mossberg is now no longer at the Journal.  I wonder, I think those guys won't get that kind of access anymore.  No, they will.  Do you think so?

Start time: 1046.20
End time: 1056.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From what Mark was writing and from my own people I've talked to, I guess I should say, sources familiar with the matter.  Yeah, they tend to follow the journalist more so than the publication.

Start time: 1057.46
End time: 1063.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that would lead me to believe that it's not the clout of the journalist, but the fact that the journalist is friendly.

Start time: 1064.36
End time: 1086.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a big part of that.  So, you know, Engadget, when they got in, what happened when all of them went to the Verge, the Verge then got access.  And it took Engadget a couple more cycles to get in their good graces.  It took us, we got invited to some things and then someone who no longer works for us was rude or something.  I don't really, I'm still mad about that.

Start time: 1087.00
End time: 1087.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so easy, trust me.

Start time: 1088.22
End time: 1104.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we were put on the list of not being allowed into anything.  And it took us a few years to get back on the list.  And we're not on, I'm not sure if we're going to be getting any early access things and whatnot.  We typically are the first round of laptops, but not with phones.

Start time: 1104.54
End time: 1121.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, here's the image of the big four, the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  You got Pogue, you got, you got Baig, you got Stephen Levy.  We left him out. I don't know, Stephen, probably not as important as he used to be, although he's at Wired now.  And of course, Walt Mossberg.

Start time: 1122.06
End time: 1122.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he's going to Medium.

Start time: 1123.20
End time: 1125.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Yeah. So he hasn't been. Yeah.  And, you know, I think that was just those were the four original iPhone reviewers.  And but Mark put together this awesome spreadsheet that shows like who gets them every single time.  Right. And it's one of those funny things.  I was like, yep, you know, from people that I know at other publications and, you know, because we all have these conversations,  but none of us actually would be willing to write what Mark wrote, which is the really funny thing.  That's why it's really impressive that he wrote this because many of us know a lot of these details but don't have the balls.  Well, we don't want to talk about it because it looks like we're whining.  Well, or we just, you know, if you're like in somebody's good graces, you're like, God, I don't want to piss you off.

X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. On the other hand, David Pogue and Ed Begg, every device, every device.  Mossberg.  Let's go down to Mossberg. Yeah, every device.  So, yeah, but that is interesting.  I used to, Jason Snell, a lot of X's.  He's the editor in chief of Macworld.  Three green checks.  I used to get review devices in the era of the iPod.  I remember Jim Latterback coming back from the iPod event in 2001.  We were at Tech TV and saying, oh, Apple wanted you to have this and throwing it throwing an iPod at me.  But that's about the last time that women know.  I remember one Christmas I got a box with a red ribbon on it from Apple and had like a couple of iPods in it.  That makes one of us. Yeah.

Transcript:  The thing that makes the thing that makes Apple so good at this is is most most organizations are nervous around the media or have a large enough pool that they're not particularly concerned or they think their product has a large footprint.  I just want to be nice to everybody because you never know who the next you know,  Walt Mossberg is going to come from or where that person is going to come from.  Apple is is an extension.  Apple's PR department is this huge or traditionally or has been for the last 15 years.  This extension of Steve Jobs uttered belief in total control and paranoia.  And there's this insane security mechanism that was built or maybe I look what the man did with the stock.  I can't really question anything that's going on in Apple with any legitimacy.  But this incredible level of secrecy and this internal security system that probably isn't rivaled anywhere except for sort of the KBG in the Cold War years.

Start time: 1308.06
End time: 1322.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you look at it and it's and they've built they absolutely it's like if you if you say something it's not like if Walt Mossberg said, you know, this is a piece of crap.  He'd be X. Absolutely.  No, I take it. I think Walter said no.

Transcript:  He has. But if he were to go, I guess, totally rogue, if you were to do like more of a 180 from his typical approach, like you can be negative.  You can give something a bad review.  But if you were to start leaking things, if you were to start doing things like what Mark Gurman does, if you were to start.  Yeah, Mark's not on this list, by the way.

Start time: 1382.92
End time: 1416.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you do. But I mean, but there's also I mean, there's I think that it comes down to the journalists about  whether or not they feel like they can say anything they want.  Like I know that when I review an Apple product, I've given some things bad reviews.  I genuinely like their products and I generally like them.  But when there are things I don't like, I'll go on a tangent about it.  I mean, I wrote something when they released the iPad for a few months after the iPad 3 and I was mad.  Like I like to and the fanboys came after me, which was really funny because I'm like, OK, guys,  like they started calling me like an anti-Apple person and I started laughing.  I was like yesterday I was in their pocket today.  Like I'm not.

Start time: 1417.00
End time: 1436.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the other thing, the other negative that Apple creates by having these obvious favorites,  not merely does that bad for the favorites, but it also is bad.  It's bad in a way for everybody.  You don't you really don't want to be on this list because it means you are somehow suspicious.  Don't you think?  And I think it's bad for everybody.

Start time: 1437.10

Transcript:  No, no, no, of course.  You know, I have to say I am.  I feel very fortunate that I got to see Steve Jobs in his prime and that's the iPhone and the iPad.  Two of the most amazing events I've ever been at watching a true master of of of showman, a brilliant guy to these demos.  And I'm glad I was there.  And I and I think it's fun to go to these events.  But really, we're going to cover the event now.  So Andy and I just so our viewers know, Andy and I and Renee and Richie both did get invitations.  They will both be there.  We're going to cover it as we always do, whether there's a live stream or not.  I've been told there will be a live stream this time.  But even if not, we'd go live at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the ninth.  Mike Elgin and I will be anchoring it from here.  So if I get invited, it kind of you can't cover it if you're invited.  Right.  You have to live blog it or if you bring a laptop, just a little tip, you can turn it around and FaceTime it.  Don't do that.  Works great if you don't ever want to go to another Apple event.  But we will.  So we'll be doing that.  And then we will.  We're going to have a camera down in Cupertino because there's no way Andy and Renee can get back up here.  That's two and a half hours away.  And there will be a demo, I think.  So we'll get them in there and their initial reactions to the new iPhone.  I like the idea of being kind of off the list because I feel like it.  I don't have to tell anybody if I like it or see if you like it and you're on the people think, well, maybe.  And if you don't like it.  So I just want to be free to say what I think.

Start time: 1553.24
End time: 1586.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also I mean, I think it's safe to assume that the journalists on this list have built up so much equity with their audiences.  They're probably not concerned.  I hope so.  The truth is, you know, Christine was saying like, you know, you say something nasty about an Apple product, you immediately get dogpiled on by three thousand people who just bought it and think you're an idiot for not loving it as much as they do.  And it's just it's the reality of covering this stuff on the Internet.  It's spectacularly.  It's like talking about, you know, if you say anything bad about the Xbox one or the PlayStation four or, you know, the iPhone, you immediately get this, you know.

And I count myself amongst them, you know, but I think what's different now is that for years, you know, and I think Apple fans still see themselves as like the underdogs, you know, like when Apple was not true anymore.

Start time: 1613.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  But people still have this put upon feeling like they have to defend every aspect of the company because it's like it's still 1997 and it's about to go bankrupt.  It's like you guys, it's the biggest company in the world.  Like, it's OK.  We can criticize these things.  And it's not going to mean the end of the world is not going to mean that like the Mac won't exist anymore or that we won't have our iPhones.  But I think that a lot of fans still are in that kind of like pre, you know, 2005, 2006 Apple mentality, at least on the Internet, which is which is interesting.  But I think it's also, yeah, I mean, to Patrick's point, yeah, you build up equity with your audience.  And at least from my experience, I think Apple is a lot more concerned about people who leak things and I understand leaks rather than people who give negative reviews.

Transcript:  And even when you give a negative review, they're usually OK with it as long as you can back it up.  Right.  What they and like because I've had conversations before.  Well, yeah, I've had conversations with them about when I've been negative about certain things.  Well, what's the problem?  And I'll be very happy to enumerate the entire list and they'll go, OK, cool.  You know, but it's it's almost as if they don't just want to ad hoc.  I don't like this because it's Apple.  You know, they want to go more nuanced than that.

Start time: 1684.60
End time: 1695.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I can remember being in a conversation about a very nuanced review and basically being told that I was an idiot and shouldn't have been allowed to review the product.  I mean, so so apparently they've mellowed mellowed some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's good. I don't doubt that at all.  My experience, fortunately, hasn't been like that, but it's been more more recent.  But yeah, but I know that at the same time, when I write negative things about other companies, they might ask for some feedback so they can improve.  But it's never like an inquisition like, why did you write this?  You know what I mean?

And we're going to talk about IFA, which is in Berlin.  We've got a Motorola event coming up next week.  In fact, all the smart companies are releasing stuff now.  Because after September 9th, it's a whole new ballgame.  We'll talk more about that in just a second.  From Mashable, Christina Warren is here.  Always a pleasure to have you on the show, Film Girl.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by My Eyeglasses.  Actually, I should show the pictures of Lisa Lisa got her Warby box just the other day and she was trying on glasses.  And you found one you liked, right?  All right.  We're talking about Warby Parker.  This is a really interesting company that maybe you saw the 60 Minutes piece on Luxotica, the company that has basically taken over eyeglasses.  I don't actually have television.  This is a real Italian company that at one point said, you know, if we buy every other eyeglass frame company, we can charge an exorbitant amount of money for a cheap piece of plastic.  And they've succeeded.  But what I admire is the startup guys at Warby said, you know, there's got to be a better way to do this.  Right.  And we don't have to charge that much.  And we can make you a great pair of glasses.  Glasses at Warby Parker start at $95.  That includes the lenses.  When's the last time you got a pair of glasses?  Prescription lenses?  Prescription lenses.  That's pretty amazing.  Anti-glare coating and all.  Progressive lenses available too.  They're a little more expensive.  They start at $295, but they're using this digital free form lens.  Very advanced progressive technology.  I really like it.  That gives you a full field of vision.  So the design of very precise computer design.  So what happens?  You get the free Warby try on.  So here's what you do.  You go to Warby Parker dot com and you pick some glasses out.  You're going to pick out five of them and get they'll send you the home try on kit.  This is, you know, think about it.  One of the things with glasses, you don't want to buy them sight unseen.  You need to put them on your face.  So they'll send you five frames and then you can try them on.  Show them to your friends and family.  Oh, I like these.  What do you think?  Who is that behind those Warby's?  Not quite me.  No.  But see, this is what you do.  You get your friends.  I actually posted pictures of me on Google Plus.  Try it on.  No.  Very superstitious.  No, that's wrong.  Okay.  Let me.  Now, I like these.  See, I'm a hornbren kind of guy.  I like these.  So here's the point.  You go through these, you figure out which one you like.  They include a special box and a prepaid shipping label.  So you return it and you say, I want this one.  They'll turn it around very fast.  They'll do the prescription.  All glasses include anti-reflective and anti-glare coating, a hard case, very nice hard case,  and a cleaning cloth.  And one of the things I really like, they partner with companies like Vision Spray.  They partner with companies like Vision Springs.  For every pair of glasses you buy, they send a pair to someone in need.  So that's a good company with a really great way of doing business.  They make buying glasses fun, fast, easy, pain-free, and affordable with low price and  wide selection of styles.  You can actually, you can have your, this is what I like.  I'll have my clear glasses and I'll have my sunglasses in the car, both with my prescription  at this price.  Why not?  Give Warby Parker a try.  A stylish new pair of prescription glasses or sunglasses.  Go to Warby Parker, W-A-R-B-Y Parker, P-A-R-K-E-R dot com slash twit for the free home try on  and you'll get free three day shipping on your final frame purchase too.  They turn it around very fast.  I really am a fan.  Warby Parker dot com.  Don't settle for overpriced, bland, monopolized eyewear.  Just a few manufacturers that keep prices artificially high.  No, go to Warby.  You're doing a good thing for the planet.  Warby Parker dot com slash twit.  I, I'm, you know, so we have a bunch of events to cover.  I think we're going to do the live coverage of everything.  Why not?  I don't want to be, look like an Apple bigot.  So September 3rd, which is what?  Three days, four days from today, Samsung Unpacked.  Now, I have to say, when you've seen an Apple event, going to a Samsung event is a little bit of a step down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It worked better live than it did in person, than it did like over the web.  The idea was to create like a 50s musical sort of motif on it.  The problem, however, is that most of the audience who's watching either at home and even in the audience,  because they were at Radio City, doesn't understand like the fact that this was a theatrical event.  Right. And that it was a riff on like 50s, 60s era comedy musicals.  So it played really, really awkwardly.  And then apparently Samsung changed some lines in the script, which muffled the humor a little bit more.  And then they invited everyone, literally, and their brother, second cousin, and like, you know, my best friend's, you know, boyfriend's, girlfriend's, brother's girlfriend.  You know, it's like the Ferris Bueller line.  Like every person was there because they needed to fill up this space.  The problem was that then there was like this huge bottleneck to get into the space.  And then afterwards, you know, anybody who's wanting to look at the phones, you had to, you know, like fight with 500 people, many of whom don't speak English, which is fine.  But when you're trying to get in, be like, can I get a photo of this phone?  It's like, OK, you know what? I'm just going to leave.  It was it was chaotic, but it was also kind of amazing with the whole stage show thing.  It was poor Wolf Chase. He really tried.

Start time: 2103.00
End time: 2113.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2114.00
End time: 2130.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. I mean, right. Being there in person, it was a lot better than looking at the live stream.  But it was still there was still awkwardness.

Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. They might have an Android Wear component there, too.  I'm not really sure, but they're going to have the the new gear device, the note for.  And I would not be surprised if we saw a couple of other wearables.  And they just did their big tablet revamp.  But they might do more tablets again, because I'm going to be honest, I like the latest high end Samsung tablets.  But they have so many various models and in series, the Tab, the Note, the Tab Pro, the whatnot.  Like, I don't even know what they all are. They've got like 16 various types of devices.  Hasn't that always been, you know, that that is the difference between Samsung and Apple.

Samsung says whatever you want, we'll make it any size you want, make it any shape you want, whatever you want.  And I think those are two reasonable market strategies.  And I mean, some people want choice. Some people want to be told what to do.

Transcript:  But this is also I mean, I don't know if it's choice so much as just an overwhelming array of options.  I mean, the running joke on this week in computer hardware has been like, OK, so, you know, Asus has announced 34 motherboards this spring.  MSI has announced 34 motherboards this spring.  And it gets to the point where you're sometimes it's too much.  Well, you're trying to figure out like, why is this tablet $150 less than this tablet?  Is it the memory? Is it Wi-Fi? Is it G3? Is it always LG for?  No, it's not LG. It's and you're you're just you spend a lot of time beating your head against a wall trying to figure out which one you should actually buy.

Start time: 2441.72
End time: 2457.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was hey, that was how the first prototype for the Oculus came about was that they basically built the Google Cardboard thing and used it with an iPhone.  And that was what they did at USC. And that was like the first couple of prototypes before they built the built it into the unit for the Oculus.

Start time: 2458.62

Transcript:  This was actually a very funny slap from Google. They gave this out at the Google I.O. conference.  It was a flat piece of cardboard, which you then fold out, fold up into.  Yeah, you're right. A Viewmaster. And you can put in any Android phone in here that has the software on it.  There's some special software. And then you have a little Viewmaster button here.  And this is all like a buck fifty to make. And it does the whole.  Oh, wow. But you know, it's as good as an Oculus.  Excuse me, but it's as good as an Oculus Rift. Right. It's not bad. It's not hooked up to a game.  Right. So maybe that's the difference. Right.

Start time: 2508.22
End time: 2561.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and the new Oculus, the new one that just came out, has a little bit higher resolution screen than past ones did.  And the big thing is that this is 1080p. Well, you're right.  But it's it's going to be there's a little bit better. It's better for motion, I guess, is what I would say.  Kind of that one, you know, when you're kind of turning around and looking at things, it doesn't have that kind of depth of space where you feel like you can almost go, you know, look, turn to your left, turn to your right to kind of see things and get that kind of field of vision thing with the Oculus.  But it's not bad. I mean, I think that for a lot of people, for developers especially, it's a really good way of kind of getting a chance to try out developing for these types of headsets, which if you know everything is to be believed, it's going to become a much bigger trend.  You know, Sony's obviously getting into it with Oculus and whatnot.  I think that it's a really affordable way to have people start developing stuff for that.  So, I mean, that's that's cool. Does anybody really want this?

So we had two people like we were running around. Yes. Yes.  And it didn't make them nauseous? No, no, no. I mean, I, you know, Ryan Trout, vomit, you know, a couple of guys from every three games vomit on almost like one guy literally like put it on and literally like two minutes off and then basically drop to the floor and crawled out of the testing lab.

I think it was to get it so that it's really greatly reduced.  And I love it. I mean, I you don't get nauseous. No, not with the new one. Not at all.  I think it's awesome. In fact, all the hacks around it, if I could spend all day and unfortunately I can't because I'm supposed to do other things, but I would love to spend all day hacking stuff with the Oculus.  Like Netflix team put together something where they have like a whole interface for the Oculus.  I mean, I would just like to spend time like putting together a whole, you know, like run once sort of configuration files so that other people could easily kind of go into a loader and enjoy that sort of stuff.

I mean, and a lot of the a lot of the Android camera apps are just atrocious.  And because Apple's so far ahead.  Because when they launched the iPhone, it being a camera was a big part of it.

And the technology behind it to me is as incredible, in fact, even more makes the app that much more incredible.  All the all the really, really great tech they put into it and they want to bring it to Android.  But they're going to have to wait for core Android things to change that they can use the gyroscope if it's on the phone and have access to some of their parts.  Because it's not a matter of, oh, we want to, you know, blow off Android users.  It's a matter of, yeah, Android actually doesn't let us do this stuff that iOS does.  Because as Patrick is saying, you know, Apple's cared a lot more about the camera for a lot longer.  And Android is just now kind of, you know, getting with the program.

The idea is you can do time lapse, but it also does smoothing of bumps and bounces.  So you could walk down a street or drive down a street, do the time lapse and it would be smoothed out.  It does look great, but let's face it, it's still a one trick pony.  I mean, time lapse is nice, but you don't want to use it all the time.

Transcript:  I was actually far enough back to get the entire thing in frame.  And so I was able to get a six minute game, a six minute game, a 30 seconds.  I put it on YouTube and yes, so far the people haven't so far the US Open hasn't come down on me for it.  So we'll see. No, they won't. But no, but I mean, it was a really cool thing.  So I got to thinking, OK, how cool would this be during the World Cup or during football or during other types of sports, you know, to hyper lapse movement?  Because if you did want to go back and forth, it would smooth it out.  Yeah, here you go. And it's I mean, it's a really cool thing to kind of watch.

Start time: 3430.00
End time: 3447.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So. All right. Yeah.  And now, by the way, I'm told I believe that hyper lapse, the Instagram folks said that L, the L version of Android, which is imminent this fall, will allow them to do the stuff they need to do for hyper lapse.

Start time: 3449.00
End time: 3458.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure that that sounds about right, but I'm but I'm not sure that they just need access to the accelerometer in a way that they can.  Exactly. Right. Right. Because that's what they're doing to do the smoothing for the.

Start time: 3459.00
End time: 3464.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of interesting. So they're doing it like optical image stabilization post precisely post facto.

Start time: 3465.10
End time: 3545.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're doing it in real time. Oh, they are doing it in real time. They're doing it in real time.  And so how they're doing that is is that typically with like a study cam mount set up in like like a digital real time mount set up, what you would do is you would capture the motion of every single thing that's happening.  And that's really expensive and requires a lot of processing power.  But what they found is that if you use the gyroscope on the camera to use that and measure to take measurements from the gyroscope and then extrapolate, I guess the the movements from there, then you can apply it to an algorithm which will then let you smooth things out.  So, and it matches up really, really well. So it's, it's an incredibly smart thing. They put a post on their Instagrams and engineering blog.  Yeah, and it's super fascinating. And when you read that, you're thinking, you're right. You know, this is a one trick pony. You're right. This people are overusing this. But I feel like the technique that's in this app and the source of things that they are kind of uncovering with their cinema algorithm and with some other other things could be very, very cool for future projects.  You know, because that's the idea that you can do a, you know, a moving time lapse thing on your camera is insane. And that they're able to do it all in real time and software and then also lets you select how quickly and how slow or how slowly you want the time lapse to work.  And then they'll alter the algorithm based on what speed you select is just incredibly cool.

Transcript:  The thing that I find intriguing, and I don't know if they're related, but you know, it was only a few weeks ago, Microsoft Research showed off their first person hyperlapse videos.  And I just love this because, well, Microsoft had it in the lab, but within three weeks Instagram says, oh yeah, we can do that on a phone. And it's done.

Start time: 3563.00
End time: 3602.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've been working on it, I guess.  Is it the same people?  No, no, no, no, no, it's, but I think that what had happened, I mean, the guy that was one of the engineers at Instagram, his thesis at Stanford was around this idea of the gyroscope for doing stabilization.  So he'd actually been doing that for a while, but I think internally at Instagram, they've been working on this since February.  So it's not uncommon for people to be doing things kind of, you know, at the same time.  But the difference, I guess, is that, you know, Microsoft has one of the best research departments ever.  I think we've talked about this before, but they don't do a great job of always productizing it, whereas Instagram, you know, was able to actually put out a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's also I mean, you know, like I love the Moto G, you know, running the Google camera app is a small improvement over the native Motorola app on the camera.  But there's there's also issues, you know, some pretty serious issues with the cameras themselves.

Start time: 3629.02
End time: 3673.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That one has not as good a sensor, but I do hope that the X plus one will it will apparently be much bigger.  The last Motorola X was for seven, which is a nice size, but it was only 720p.  Some are saying rumors are it might be as big as five point two inches.  And I love this front facing speakers.  That's something the HTC one has that makes a big difference in the sound quality coming out of that phone.  I love the HTC one's front facing speakers.  So this is another one that you're going to want to look at.  The Samsung Galaxy Note four will be what?  Twelve inches, fifteen, one hundred and eight.  How big is this going to be?  That's a really good question.  The current one is what? Five, five, six, five, five, five or five, six.

Transcript:  But the problem is, is when you go back to the iPhone at this point and you're like, oh, no wonder I have you and you're sitting there and you're going like this.  And you spent two weeks not expanding every web page up or you've you've dealt with the fact there's so many like I'm so frustrated with so many of the web publishing systems that automatically generate an unflexible.  You know, we have a mobile version of the website.  I can't use it because I can't find anything or it's locked down or it's locked down with six point type and I can't read it on an iPhone.  But it was it was funny to realize I now I you know, that was one of the nice things about going to this is that a much bigger screen and suddenly a five inch screen seems really small.  A five inch screen seems really, really reasonable or a necessity for next generation.

Start time: 3755.44
End time: 3791.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's one of the reasons Apple I hope I know they're going to do a bigger screen.  I hope they will do not only a four seven four seven is like the sweet spot, but I would love to see a five and a half inch and I would be very quick to get in line for a five and a half inch.  Absolutely.  All right, so that's September 3rd is Samsung.  September 4th is Moto.  Sony is going to have announcements about a new tablet and smartphone new.  I guess they've got we know that they're here to do it.  Xperia. What is it?  Xperia X3. I don't know what their next generation is.

Transcript:  It's a great phone.  It's a fantastic phone and having the 4G version, having the 4G version meant I could also put SD cards into it, micro SD cards into it.  So I could have 64 or 32 gigabytes.  Ironically, though, it also underlined all of the problems that Android has because, well, right, because the cameras problematic.  Class 10 micro SD cards wouldn't work.  And, you know, by the time I bought it, well, you either I can either go back and try to find an older SD card.  Well, it was by the time I got through tech support, they're like, well, that's fixed.  And I'm like, great. I'm like, how is it fixed?  Well, there's a, you know, and get 4.4.4.  I'm like, great. I'm like, where do I download it? Well, AT&T is going to have to send it.  I didn't buy the phone from AT&T.  I bought the phone from you.

I missed the one that was like the Toka Moka.  There's a children's applications.  But like, you know, there are like there's two or three different companies that basically name themselves or name in their titles to try to emulate that.  But one like I was trying to find like a train simulator, one of the train simulators I download was hitting me with notices that were basically trying to get me to either do some sort of a phishing scam and or some sort of a PayPal scam.  And it's like this crap is everywhere in the Google Play Store.  And I've never as somebody who mocked Steve Jobs, you know, seems like, you know, we're not going to have what am I saying?

I know that they seem to be really serious about the Android one or one Android thing.  Maybe that's what they're going to shift their one Android to rule them all.  You know, the device focus, you know, building lower cost based devices for the rest of the world and letting other people just kind of, you know,  do maybe the Google Play editions for some of the other phones.

Micro Max may launch the very first Android One phone tomorrow, which is Monday, September 1st.  Samsung is holding a big product launch on Wednesday, September 3rd, which is taking place simultaneously in Berlin, Beijing and New York.  Everyone is expecting a Galaxy Note 4 phablet and it could also unveil their virtual reality headset, which is created in partnership with Oculus VR.  Sony is holding a press event in Berlin on Wednesday as well.  Rumors say they'll announce an Xperia Z3 flagship smartphone and other products.  Asus is expected to unveil an Android Wear smartwatch on Wednesday that's similar to the Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch, but a lot cheaper.  Motorola is planning announcements for Thursday, September 4th in Chicago.  We're expecting the Moto X Plus One, a successor to the Moto X phone, plus the official release of the Moto 360 smartwatch.  HTC should announce the world's first 64-bit Android phone called the Desire 820 on Thursday.  Huawei is rumored to be launching a new 6-inch high-resolution screen also on Thursday.  And even Dyson, the vacuum cleaner company, has an announcement Thursday, most likely a brand new vacuum cleaner robot.

And one of the reasons they're doing this in Japan is they have this aging population that either their partners have died and they want to interact with.  You're a little younger on the curve than the aging population that they're targeting.  Like Sony's targeting the robots at or Honda is, pardon me.

And the idea behind it was great, but the software was never really executed.  And then Sony eventually came out with one.  I think they called it the Dash and it was slightly better, but then that was too late.  Had that too. Yeah.  And then I like so I wonder about these things.

The thing was, a friend of mine loaned me his Google Glass, his glass, and I asked it something  and it actually responded with an answer it should have instead of going, could you repeat that?  Or telling me the population of Uzbekistan.  It's exciting, isn't it?  Or telling me what FloorWax was when it actually works.  But so few of these products have actually worked.

But once you can act, once there's utility and you can say, Hey, what appointments do I have today?  Would you read me my emails?  If I can, if I can merely listen to and respond to my email in the morning while I'm shaving,  I will that would be worth a lot to me.  See, I'm in the future already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just feel like that.  But that's what we're headed for.  And that will be very, very useful.  I've been thinking a lot about this because Larry Page said, you know, the problem we have is here's a good example.  I was talking about this on the radio show.  If you go to your Google dashboard and you look at your location history lately, people act as if they've never seen this before.  And it's been there forever.  But it'll show you where you've been.  Google dot com slash dashboard forever, because the iPhone and does this as well.  Android does it.  It's always on, always tracking you here.  I'll show you my I don't mind showing you my location history.  But people get very nervous about this thing.  Oh, my God.  Google's following you around.  I can go to any day, see where I was today.  This is how I traveled around.  I can say, show me my last five days and I can even play it back.  You know, I can go through and now and people get very nervous about this.  But of course, this is what the phone's doing.  If I show you this, this scares you.  But if, on the other hand, I say to you, you know, it's really cool.  I've got this Google now.  When I get to the airport, it pulls up my pass, my boarding ticket and puts it on the screen.  Or when I go into the grocery store, it says, oh, you know, don't forget to get milk.  You put that on your list.  Cortana does this. Siri does this. Google does this.  That's how they do it.  They follow you and they know where you are.  And they use geofencing to say, well, you're at the store now.  And if you start with I think if you start with wouldn't it be cool if your phone knew you were at the store and told you you needed milk or pulled up your boarding pass when you got to the airport?  Everybody say, yeah, that's great.  What we don't think is, well, in order to do that, it's going to have to track you all the time.  What's the problem?

Start time: 5024.46
End time: 5027.00

Start time: 5085.04
End time: 5114.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Tripit has been doing what the Google Now thing does for me for my flight stuff for years.  So, I mean, I'm less creeped out by Google now than I was like even like two months ago.  I think there's some value there.  My problem is, is like I'm looking at my location history.  I don't know what Android account all my stuff is tied to because I'm not an Android user.  I don't know what Android account all my stuff is tied to because I'm not an Android account Google account because I've got like three different Google accounts.  So what information is tracking for me is different for each one.  So it's not all consolidated. So that's well, here's an example.

Start time: 5115.00
End time: 5155.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this is my Google Now. It knows what I'm doing.  It says, oh, you're in this week in tech right now.  This is how long it's going to take to get home.  There's no traffic. Here's the weather report.  Here's my giant score. Here's some news stories.  Some products are being shipped to me.  Here's where you parked.  Now, I didn't ask it explicitly, but it just said, oh, I noticed you stopped moving so fast when you got there.  So that must be where you parked.  Here's some stories based on previous stories.  It thinks I would like to read.  And it's absolutely right.  These are these are good stories.  And then it even says, is this card useful?  Yeah, that was a good one. I like that.  I think these are this is this is the only thing wrong with this is it hasn't done enough.  I want more.  Yeah.

Start time: 5156.16

Transcript:  Well, I guess part of it's like, you know, I travel a lot in places where maybe the population is low.  Or because I'm going to a lot of places in Oakland or Richmond when I'm picking up supplies for the house.  I'm finding out that when you get into, you know, poor communities, Google Maps doesn't work very well.  Well, that might be.  Or if you're getting into places where the population is fairly low.

Start time: 5178.06

Start time: 5212.08
End time: 5256.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd go for a lot of it. I wouldn't go for maybe all of it, but I would definitely go for a lot of it.  The key is that it needs to work.  It's partially there now. I think that's why it's disconcerting when you see the other information, because there's still that disconnect between what it's trying to do and what the ideal is.  If it really would just work, then I think that the information it captures would kind of disappear in the background.  But because there's still kind of a layer you have to go over, a step you have to go over for to make it work, it makes all that information that they're collecting visible.  And that's what freaks people out. I agree.  Yeah. Yes. So I think that if it could just kind of work, then everything they're doing, it would still be creepy if you thought about it.  But because it would it would disappear into the background and you would just focus on the utility.

Start time: 5256.54
End time: 5266.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of what Larry Page was saying is if people if we make the mistake of showing them what we're collecting, what we should really show them is the value first.  And then we can just use the utility and then people won't worry about what we're collecting.

You know what I mean? It's a lot of stuff where it's like or the fact that they are, you know, Scoble is talking about it.  That's a failure. It shouldn't do that.  It shouldn't do that.

Remember, Patrick, on the screensavers, the early MP3 players.  Remember all the trouble it took to put an MP3 player in a car?  Yes. Yes, I do. It was painful.  Yes. Yes, it was.

Not too thrilled about the new cyber security czar who says I don't know anything about security, but that's good.  He's a policy wonk. And he got appointed by President Obama. His name is Michael Daniel. Comes from the policy side.  He says it doesn't matter that I don't know anything about code or security.  He says being too down in the weeds at the technical level could actually be a little bit of a distraction.  What? What? He's never been involved with cyber security. He has a strong background in policy and budgeting.  A degree in government. This is just depressing. Strong article, I thought, in Forbes by Robert M. Lee.  He's an active duty Air Force cyber warfare operations officer, co-founder of Drago Security.  He says, you know what? It kind of does matter. You ought to know a little bit about this if you're going to run the whole thing.  Just thought I'd bring it up. Another good article I enjoyed.  And this was in a source I'm not completely familiar with, but as far as I can tell is accurate.  It's the Center for Public Integrity. You ever hear about them?  Very interesting article by Alan Holmes, How Big Telecom Smothers City-Run Broadband.  And we've kind of known the outlines of this. He talks about a Republican state senator from rural Tennessee, Janice Bowling,  in her constituency, the city of Tullahoma, doesn't really have high speed Internet.  So the city put in high speed Internet right on.  And very happy they decided they wanted to expand it to just outside the city limits to encourage new buildings, new businesses.  Immediately, AT&T, by the way, the network, which offers speeds 80 times faster than AT&T and 10 times faster than charter,  is it works like a utility, like electricity. And she believes this is a right. Everybody in this town needs it.  We don't quarrel with the fact that AT&T has shareholders that it has to answer to. That's fine. I believe in capitalism and the free market.  But when they won't do it in our town, we got to do it. Well, AT&T charter and Comcast got together with state senators,  tried to convince them to kill the measure, finally threatened a lawsuit and it failed.  And this happens in every so many municipalities time and time again.  Currently, 20 states ban or restrict municipalities from offering Internet at all.

I'm like, oh, I remember reading this 10 years ago.  So basically, Verizon got so upset that Philadelphia decided to deal with the fact there was no decent Internet access in Philadelphia that they went to the state legislature and basically got a bill passed to sort of prevent that from happening.

But if it's a place where the commercial enterprises won't do it, I think it's incumbent on the government to do it because this is what keeps jobs is what keeps business.  One hundred and thirty cities offer fiber or cable Internet to their communities of those one hundred thirty eighty nine are gigabit.  And it's illegal in 20 states.

And I really kind of I think they're probably right. The last thing you want is the ham handed members of Congress who are being bought by telecoms running the Internet.  The best solution is competition. If you've got a Comcast going to be really tough in at least 20 states, it's going to be tough everywhere.  It could be tough everywhere. Unfortunately, these guys don't want competition. They want a monopoly.  All right. Enough of that. I just that was in our indignation section.  Hope you hope you all enjoyed it. Back to Google's secret drones.  Actually, it turns out you remember Amazon was talking about delivery drones.  Turns out Google's been working on this for years, according to the Atlantic in their X projects.  You know, Google X, a drone delivery system.

Well, it's funny, like I can understand from a financial perspective, I understand why they would want to do this because you look, I think there's San Francisco is ridiculous when it comes to parking tickets, right?  They make like something ridiculous, like 100 million a year in revenue of parking tickets right now.  But because there's no parking and because right. Yeah, yeah, it's insane.  You got to understand. San Francisco is only 49 square miles and most of the, you know, most of the million a year.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing. But what they do is, you know, for UPS and FedEx and DHL and whoever else is operating, they basically they don't.  They the driver takes a ticket and they they basically throw the ticket at somebody at the office or however they handle it.  But essentially they settle like like FedEx a few years ago, like they settled, you know, 19 million dollars or 10 million dollars worth of tickets for like a flat seven million dollar payment at the end of the year.

And then it goes to the peso fuerte, the Franco, the peso, the sucker on the silver standard, the sucker on the gold standard, the sucker on unconvertible paper, the sucker on the gold exchange standard, the 1932 2000 sucker and the 2000 dollars is a dollarization.  It's it's funny because we're actually well, we're really spoiled in the United States because our currency is relatively stable.  Right. That's why they use the dollar.  A friend of mine's family had kind of hopped on their way.

Start time: 6311.28
End time: 6329.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mostly Uber X, but in New York, it's different because all the drivers are licensed because that's the only way you can get in.  So if you're black car, then it's like a late model, either like a SUV or like a town car.  And then the Uber X's, you know, are like regular cars.

Start time: 6329.66
End time: 6343.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where do you come down on this?  I'm not sure what this... so Lyft says that Uber has been getting, you know, calling Ubers via phone and then canceling 5,500 cancellations in a year.

Start time: 6345.74
End time: 6384.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And so, but it's like worse than that, right?  Like really, it's this whole recruitment strategy.  So the cancellations are only because they've already tried to recruit those drivers.  That's why those rides are being canceled.  It's not to like annoy them and make it so they can't pick up other people.  What it is is that they book rides with the implicit purpose of then trying to recruit the driver to join Uber.  And so they bring, you know, like full starter packs with them.  They want to get them signed up.  I mean, that's the whole reason they're doing the call.  And then they have like a whole Google Doc or something that says this is the person I've already talked to.  No one else talked to them.  And if you call a Lyft and you get someone who's already on the list, you immediately cancel so you can try to recruit again.

Start time: 6385.40
End time: 6388.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the cancellations are a side effect of this recruitment strategy, really?

Start time: 6388.18
End time: 6410.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And really, I think that it's probably a lot more minor.  I mean, like the number is huge, but really, if you cancel within like the first 15 seconds, then it's not really going to hurt anything.  Like you're not messing anybody else up in that period of time if they're canceling immediately.  It's not like they're waiting a couple of minutes and then canceling to try to ruin somebody's day.  They're doing this as part of a hardcore recruitment strategy.

Start time: 6442.50
End time: 6506.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I at least I haven't used the New York because they were their launch year was not good.  And frankly, it really turned me off on them in a lot of ways.  Uber is pretty cocky, but I have to say Uber was not dumb enough to come to New York City  and think that they couldn't actually be part of the TLC, that they couldn't actually be licensed.  Whereas Lyft thought that they could actually somehow change the entire infrastructure.  It's like, no, that's not how this works.  Not in New York, not in one of the biggest cab markets out there.  And that's, I think, why Uber has managed to do OK in New York and hasn't had a lot of the ire from some of the cabbies.  The medallion holders might hate them, but a lot of the cabbies don't because they are at least all registered with the TLC.  The Taxi and Limo Commission.  Exactly. And so every driver who drives you is licensed.  But my experiences in San Francisco with Lyft haven't been that positive, I've got to be honest.  So I would much rather take Uber, even UberX in San Francisco, just because my experiences with Lyft have just really not been good.

Start time: 6507.10
End time: 6520.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So see, this is interesting because a lot of people read this article and said, well, that's it.  I'll never take Uber again. They're being so anti-competitive.  And as Casey points out, it is a zero sum game.  A ride that Lyft gets is one that Uber won't get and vice versa.

Start time: 6521.50
End time: 6542.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, actually, what I think it is, is it's not so much about...  It's really about what this proves, and this has been written by other people before too, is that the real currency in this market,  and this is true whether you're talking about traditional cabs, whether you're talking about traditional libraries,  or you're talking about this mix between the two with Uber and Lyft, is that the real currency is with the driver, not with the rides.

Start time: 6543.36
End time: 6574.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for now, because that's one of the big things that leaked out of Uber where they're like, well, we're going to move to Google cars as fast as we can.  And Uber's evaluation is kind of insane, right?  It is. It is.  They're valued at over $18 billion.  It's insane.  Well, I was going to say, they're pitching themselves as the drone alternative of the future, where their automated cars will deliver...  They'll have a fleet of cars, and they'll pick people up, and they'll deliver packages, and they'll move stuff around, and they'll become this insane logistics system.  It's lower than just a cab service.  Yeah.

Start time: 6575.58
End time: 6619.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their logistics are... I mean, I think that's what makes them so genius.  Interesting.  There's another company in New York called MakeSpace, which makes it really easy to do storage.  And they're also similar in that way in that they're real geniuses, their logistics end.  And so I think that Uber has a lot of opportunities it could go in.  But I think for now, you're right, the real commodity, not the real commodity, but the real currency is with the drivers, at least until we go into these drone things,  because there is a more limited supply of drivers, no genuinely.  So in San Francisco, and I know in Atlanta, most people, drivers that I talk to, drive for both Lyft and Uber.  And they just will have them both on, and whatever they get, they get.  And if Lyft comes on, they'll put on the stupid mustache.  And if it's Uber, they'll put the Uber thing in there, but they'll use both.

Start time: 6620.36

Transcript:  I will say not using a pink mustache was a genius stroke on Uber's part, because...  I think the pink mustache is brilliant.  No, my problem is, see, I drive in an area of San Francisco that has a lot of...  Because there's a whole bunch of startups and new buildings, and we're south of the ballpark.  So I know every time I get cut off by somebody who's driving for Lyft, or somebody who's running a red light.  And I will say, one of the nice things about New York is they said, hey, you have to play by adult rules in New York City.  And that may be an entrenched bureaucracy to the stifling competition, but they're also, nobody's walking into New York going,  Oh, you told the insurance company you drive 100 miles a year for recreational purposes, when in reality you're driving like 200 miles a day.  Exactly.  Faring people around commercially.  And we'll cover the difference. Oh, yeah, that's a great business model.  You'll cover the...

Start time: 6679.36
End time: 6714.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is and it's not because they've been in New York a lot longer than Lyft has.  But when they came to New York, they didn't make these mistakes.  They researched their market and they started the black car thing first.  And when they did UberX, they did it the right way, which to me says, regardless of what you think about the competition practices,  one company, I think, is the adult in this situation, to kind of go back to that analogy and actually think about what they can get away with and what markets they're in.  Whereas the other thinks they can just show up and, you know, that, oh, everybody loves us.  Give me a fist bump, bro. Like, no, like, I'm not going to do that.  You know, like, oh, you can sit in the front seat.  Like, no, I'm not going to do that either.

Now it's under Mayor de Blasio, where they have the outer boroughs where you can't do pickups for, you know, they had these green cabs, which are basically kind of like yellow cabs.  But it's kind of run more like Ubers do.  But they've got credit card machines in the back.  They will do pickups and drop offs and they'll drop you off anywhere where they can only do pickups in Queens or the Bronx or Brooklyn.  But the problem is, is that like where I live in Brooklyn, it's very rare to be able to find a cab like you might get lucky.  But if I need a car, I've got to call a car service.  The car service in most cases is going to be pretty bad.  It might be cheaper than Uber or Lyft, but it's going to be pretty bad.  I mean, I had and then what happens then is because they're really antiquated.  I've had gypsy cabs come up a number of times where they say they're from the car service they ordered from.  And then, you know, the cop pulled us over crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and was like, can I see your ID?  Can I see your ID?  And the guy's like, the guy like lied to him and then he was like gave him a ticket.  The cop was cool. He was like, it's raining.  You can go ahead and take this ride.  So your destination not going to make you get out in the rain.  I was like, thanks, dude.

Transcript:  Well, it was also OK.  But Lyft says that on average, customers cancel 16 percent of rides.  Uber said in the past. This is Nick Bilton writing in The New York Times that 10 percent of rides roughly are canceled.  Lyft found that accounts associated with people who identify themselves as Uber recruiters canceled 85 percent of the rides they call.  Yeah.  Fifty rides a day. That's a significant disruption.

Start time: 6847.36
End time: 6859.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a disruption, I think, but it depends on how quickly are you canceling.  Like if you're canceling, like I said, within like the first 15 or 30 seconds, then it might piss off a driver.  And it certainly is an annoyance, but I don't think it's going to lessen the supply that's available.

Transcript:  I mean, yeah, it is.  But I mean, you've also got to think like, you know, it is what it is.  I mean, it's a shady practice.  But I mean, I'm not like I'm not saying that it's great.  It's certainly a shady practice, but I'm not at the same time.  Maybe I'm just really jaded by knowing how completely unethical and like how the mob basically still runs the entire medallion system that I'm thinking in the green.  In the green grand scheme of things when it comes to transportation, this actually is like so benign.  It's bothersome, but it wouldn't stop me from using the service that for me is better.  Like I'm not going to not use Uber because, you know, their CEO says some questionable things and they have some shady competition practices.  It's like if that starts to impact their service, then that's one thing.  But, you know, I think that the drivers I talk to seem to really like it and which is interesting.  Lyft drivers haven't talked to as much and been able to get as much feedback, but Uber drivers, people like it a lot.  But I've also noticed now this would be interesting to see is I've noticed that regular cab drivers have told me that they get recruited a ton from Uber people.  So that is an interesting thing.

I'm just thinking I might need a job.  For people who are doing it full time.  Yeah, I mean, they can usually probably do do better or at least as well as they would with a cab, but maybe not have to deal with as much of the bureaucracy that goes on with the medallion system.  People like it because they can choose their own hours more and they can kind of pick and choose like, you know, you can get a fair and say, OK, I feel like going here.  I don't feel like going there.  You know, you don't have to say maybe the same area so you can maybe go to areas that you wouldn't otherwise think that you would be able to get fares.  You know that you can.  So I don't know.  I mean, I think that a lot of cab drivers that I've talked to a lot of drivers I've talked to have actually said, I'm looking into doing Uber or people who are doing Uber, you know, will do it along with doing private car service stuff, which is pretty lucrative for them.  So they might have, you know, personal clients, but then also do Uber if they need to fill in gaps between their schedules.  So, I don't know.  All right.

What are people been saying?  What do you do on a long flight?  I listened to audio books.  It's the best thing in the world.  In fact, I look forward.  I miss my long commute.  Used to do that all the time to tech TV.  And I started listening to audiobooks in the year 2000.  Became an Audible customer that year.  500 books later.  500 books later.

And the readers are phenomenal.  And the variety.  I just saw this.  E.E. Cummings, A Life by Susan Cheever.  Wouldn't that be a great book if you love poetry?  If you've got kids, The Wind in the Willows, narrated by Shelley Frazier.  Little Women.  Oh, I've been listening to the autobiography of Graham Nash, read by Graham Nash.  I'm loving it.  I see Neil Young's got his biography.  Who better to read Neil Young's biography than Keith Carradine?  That would be awesome.  It probably looks and sounds just like Neil Young.  This is one they keep offering me based on my Amazon purchases.  The art of fermentation and in-depth exploration and of essential concepts and processes from around the world.

We get together, Audible listeners, many of them in the chat room, and talk about all the great books you can listen to next.  Or books.  So California law requires it. Jerry Brown, the governor, signed it into law.  The kill switch.  If California makes every phone manufacturer offer a kill switch, I guess it'll be in every phone.  Because if you don't want to have two separate SKUs, one for California and one not, why not to do with automobiles?  Maybe. That's true. They do do it with emissions because their emissions control standards are so high.  Yes. But I don't think they do that with phones. It's so easy to put them in.  Apple already has a kill switch on all the iPhones, right?  The Android device manager is a free download. It comes on many Android phones, but you can also get it for free from Google.  And that does the same thing.  And I don't know about Windows Phone if they have a kill switch, but I think that would be an easy thing to implement.

Transcript:  So this is what was interesting is this actually didn't pass earlier this year in the California Senate.  And then George Gascon was the DA for San Francisco and New York's Attorney General got together.  And the reason they're doing this is because smartphone theft is the crime of choice in New York City and San Francisco.  And I presume a lot of other larger metropolises because there's a huge market there.  Basically, it's really easy to crack a phone, wipe a phone, and they're really easy to turn over.

Start time: 7365.06
End time: 7375.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does the kill switch mean you can't resell it? Like it just it's no longer useful?  The kill switch means it's dead.  It's dead dead.  Yeah. Yeah.  So does iPhone have that? I think you do have to sign into your lock.

And, you know, the idea of being able to either shut down the radio, the interface or something else like that should not be that technologically difficult to implement.

Start time: 7441.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the truly paranoid. I think we can dismiss this off on the face of it, but the truly paranoid.  I've seen articles to this effect say that it's not such a good idea because the government could also use it to silence protests.  After all, in the Arab Spring and in Tahrir Square in Istanbul, smartphones were used to organize.

Start time: 7460.72
End time: 7475.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But as the resident paranoid, if they wanted to shut down, they would.  It's easy enough to just call a phone company.  Just call a phone company and shut down the towers.  All right. You're right.  You know what I mean? Like, this is me talking. You're Mr. Paranoid.  But it's like if they want to shut down communications.  They can still do it.

Start time: 7475.16
End time: 7509.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. They can do it in a much in a way that would be much more effective than right than having to manually go through each phone.  Yeah. No, I mean, I think as a theft deterrent, it can be really strong.  I guess, you know, the question is going to be, you know, when this goes into effect, how much time manufacturers have to do this and then how long before there are enough phones with this feature seeded into the ecosystem for it to have any impact, you know, on the theft rate, if it does at all, you know, in California.  Right. And then I guess there will be the cat and mouse game between people who are trying to figure out how to, you know, reverse the kill switch.

Start time: 7509.54
End time: 7556.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting. There's a again in that information week article, which is California smartphone kill switch law.  What does it means? So where did it go? So they put the activation lock in iOS seven.  Quote, the technology has already had a positive effect on iPhone theft in the first five months of 2014.  Shortly after Apple introduced activation lock, the theft of Apple devices fell by 17 percent in New York City, while thefts of Samsung products increased by 51 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.  So positive. I mean, because my understanding from from from having talked to some some people on the sort of law enforcement side of things is smartphones are kind of an ATM for anybody.  It's willing to steal one. Right. Because there's just a lot of people that want these phones, you know, and are willing to pay considerably less for them and not be particularly worried about the provenance of the phone.

Transcript:  No, I don't know if it would be a DMCA violation, but it would still be a violation of basic.  It's a convention. Right.  Exactly. Because I'm thinking back to Nintendo versus Atari.  The case that like went on for forever in the 80s was around the variation that Nintendo didn't want anybody else making cartridges that would work for the NES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 7691.93
End time: 7700.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  So if you can't copyright a coffee pod, then it's not circumvention because it's not a copyrighted work.

Start time: 7704.04
End time: 7716.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7717.62
End time: 7721.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but in this case, I mean, with Nintendo, it was more that the connector was what was copyright.

Start time: 7722.50
End time: 7736.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I agree. They circumvented the copy protection, but it has to be to with an end to getting to the copyrighted materials.  No, that you're right. That was different because it was a Bible. Right. Right. Exactly.

Start time: 7736.00
End time: 7758.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, this these were the Atari made the stuff and what it but Nintendo wouldn't approve it.  They didn't want to pay Nintendo's rates to get Nintendo's approval.  They just wanted the game to be able to play on the NES.  So they reverse engineered the design so that you could put the cartridge in.  So it's a similar thing with this is.  So I'm guessing that they could probably just do a circumvention thing and the DMCA wouldn't have to be involved at all.  This is from this is from Boing Boing.

Start time: 7912.24
End time: 8011.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am. Yeah. I think it makes sense in the sense that they are looking at...  There are a bunch of companies that are really betting on the future of video.  You have people like Netflix. You have more traditional content companies like HBO GOES and different models with that.  You have Hulu. You have Amazon. Obviously, you have YouTube.  Then you have Twitch. Amazon has been making a really big push into original video.  They haven't been that successful with their original productions, but they've been trying to build more and more value into their prime video ecosystem.  I think having this as a cornerstone of that, they're hoping will turn Prime into an Amazon, by extension, into a destination for all of this content.  They're saying there's already this huge audience here.  We can help integrate that audience into our existing stuff and then do what Google did with YouTube, where maybe it's slow to make money for a period of time.  Although in this case, I actually think there are a lot of synergies for Amazon to make money off of Twitch in a way that maybe there wouldn't even be with Google.  Then there's a way for them to build up their brand of their original video.  I think it makes sense on that level, even though it isn't as perfectly synergistic as a YouTube acquisition.  I also feel like that's probably why Twitch sold Amazon is because they don't just want to become a division underneath somebody at YouTube.  They want to be able to continue to build their own brand.  Amazon will certainly not be doing anything to dilute the existing Twitch brand.  If anything, they're probably going to promote more and more Twitch stuff across their other products and on their homepage to try to build awareness to that stuff.

Transcript:  Well, that's what the other guy says in our chat room. That would be one way to monetize it.  You're watching League of Legends. Now would you like to buy it?

Start time: 8024.04
End time: 8062.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Monetizing Twitch isn't a problem. The whole reason YouTube was looking at Twitch is because it was a competitor to YouTube's advertising environment.  It's a very passionate. Somebody who's going to watch gameplay for three hours is a pretty hardcore consumer of content.  It's a pretty huge network. There's a lot of eyeballs out there watching the videos.  So, yeah, as for a company that's kind of like they've started to move in the content direction, you know, like Netflix, they're looking at opportunities for gaming on the Fire TV and on the other portable devices.  Oh, Fire TV. I didn't even think of that.

Transcript:  There's actually a really great Twitch app. It came out, I guess, in June for Fire TV. And it's quite good.  But what I can't wait for, you know, is that maybe the next Fire TV or maybe they can release an update, but you'd be able to automatically stream your Fire TV gameplay to Twitch.

Start time: 8080.86
End time: 8132.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And you can buy like a capture. A number of companies make little capture things so that you can connect it to a Fire TV or something else and stream it.  But I think that having it built into the box could be cool.  And the reason I say that is that, you know, the games that are on Fire TV, they have a couple of originals, but most of them are Android games.  And that is a market, I think, that is really ripe for, you know, let's play and for kind of, you know, shared gaming stuff that a lot of people haven't done because it's complicated to, you know, connect your, you know, your Android or your iPhone and stream live.  So I think that if Amazon could get in early with that and have it built into their box, that could be a potential, you know, draw for people to especially then, you know, and at that point, it's not that far away to go from, you know, watching people play to then being able to maybe take place in exhibition matches, you know, with multiplayer gaming and that sort of thing across the network.  I don't know.
