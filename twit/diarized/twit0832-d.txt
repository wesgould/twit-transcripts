Transcript:  Welcome back to Twit. This week in tech, I am not Leo Laporte. I'm Jason Snell sitting in for Leo  Laporte, who is on assignment. I think we crossed planes. I just got back from Hawaii and he has  gone to Hawaii, but I'm going to take care of you for this episode. It's all going to be good.  And the reason it's going to be good, it's not about me. It's about these three wonderful people  who are joining me on this week's episode. To my left, he was my counterpart for many years at  PC World when I worked at Mac World. It's Harry McCracken from Fast Company. Harry, thank you for  being here. Hey, Jason, welcome back to the mainland. Thank you very much. It's good to be  back. I can say that I was there long enough that I had a good vacation and I still felt like  it was fine to return to the mainland from the land of the trade winds. Oh, okay. I take it back.  More pineapple on pizza. Maybe. Also here, Rosemary Orchard, who is the host of among other things,  the Automators podcast on Relay FM, one of my favorites. Rose, welcome.

And also I think you're really  throwing off anybody who was, you know how like there's always those times where there's one  person in the comic book who wonders, gee, isn't it weird that both Batman and Bruce Wayne are both  in Central City at the same time? So the fact that you and Leo Laporte happened to be in Hawaii  at the last time, that could have provoked some people to wonder if actually we've blown someone's  secret identity. Don't know which one it was, but by putting your LMD double back in Hawaii and  coming back here, I think that that's going to really extend your secret identity another 20 years.

Transcript:  Well done. It's a beautiful place. Hawaii and Tahiti are both beautiful places. Anyway,  we passed the tech podcasting baton temporarily. And so thank you to Leo for inviting me back on.  Now when we do these tech podcasts, I got to be honest, I have two impulses. One of them is  to talk about the stories that suggest that technology is terrible and ruining the world.  And the other one is like, oh, fun gadgets. It's wacky. We're going to have a little bit of both,  but I want to start with a story that broke today. Just want to talk about it a little bit.  Broke in the Washington Post a bunch of different news entities behind this. And it is the revelation  that the targets of a bunch of really nasty spyware in smartphones have been unveiled.  It includes people from this basically a long list of phone numbers of people who has have had  their phones hacked. Supposedly this report suggests that the largest number of phones  being hacked was in Mexico, also in the Middle East, including Qatar and Bahrain and Yemen and  the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but also in India and in Hungary, where the regime is fairly authoritarian.  Apparently journalists who were questioning the Hungarian authorities had their names added to  this list. The idea here is that there's this company, they are Israeli, they're called NSO  group. They've got a bunch of hacks that they have said I think publicly are only supposed to be used  for good, which is an interesting like, okay, no, we won't sell it to anyone bad. We'll only  sell it to people who are good. But now these journalists have come up with a very long list  of the people who are apparently on this firm's log that have potentially been hacked and had  their smartphone hacked. So this is an interesting story because it isn't about the details of the  hack as much as it is about the targets and who apparently mostly nations have targeted. And  surprisingly, it is politicians, government officials, human rights activists, business  executives, and journalists. So this is awful. Hey, panel, what do you think?

Transcript:  Welcome to 2021. We got rid of COVID with abounding 49% of the population. And we feel as  though we're ready to move on to the next catastrophe. Yeah, that's it's just another  indication of exactly how bad and prevalent spyware is because it's no longer when we when  we were young, Jason, we spyware was like a Matthew Matthew Broderick sort of type of person who's  trying to like steal $1,000 $2,000. But now it is an operation. It is a business and it's an  enterprise. And it is worse than that. It's a weapon that can be purchased and targeted by a lot  of very, very bad people operating in a lot of very repressive governments. I mean, just  last month or last week, two executives at a French spyware company were actually indicted  by the French courts on crimes against humanity because they had sold spyware tools to Egypt and  Egypt and Libya. And knowing full well that this these tools could be used to round up people and  torture them and and make them lead to a very, very terrible, terrible end. So given that they  knew what these tools are going to be used for, now we're sort of the fact that we are elevating  spyware to the level of you can be accused and tried for crimes against humanity by creating and  providing these tools to someone who then uses it for murder and torture. That is exactly how weird

It's unclear whether he was,  and of course he was then assassinated in the Saudi embassy in Turkey. Like there are some real,  if you connect the dots to what has already been disclosed, it's a pretty serious list of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who are being surveilled, apparently. Yes, and I think it's more evidence that while being randomly  hacked is scary, a lot of the really scary stuff involves very precision hacking and people are  really going after somebody in particular. Unfortunately journalists sometimes end up on those lists.  There are a lot of people who want to keep tabs on them, including authoritarian governments.  The company behind this, I mean it's not a hacking group, it's a company that sells products  allegedly for use and things that might be reasonable. They have guidelines about how  they want their software used, but it's really hard to ensure that when you come up with tools  like these that they will only be used for applications that everybody can agree might

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be a reasonable thing to do. Yeah, one of the things I hear is you don't want to necessarily  close exploits in smartphone software because it's used by intelligence agencies to gather  information about the bad guys. But this is an interesting case where this is a company,  they're known, we've known that they've had these tools for a while now, for several years,  but when you see how it's used it does make you realize that a lot of these arguments about,  oh well these security holes we can use them for good, that's a questionable argument.

Start time: 575.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, any hack is a bad hack. We've said this before whenever governments have said, you know,  we want a back door but it's only for us. Any back door that's only for the good guys is also  going to be used by the bad guys. And any software that's released have only used this  against bad people. Good and white tend to be shades of grey. There's way more than 50 out there  but you can never say that every time that this particular incident happens it's always for bad  reasons or for good reasons. I think at the end of the day this is more terrifying than random hacks.  It's because, you know, people are very much targeted and they can, you know, you can see now  an entire list of people who may have known that they were targeted or maybe this has just come out  of nowhere for them and they're now questioning a whole bunch of other things that have happened  because they've realized that they were being targeted for this. It's, you know, like when  scammers get a hold of your phone number and you fall for one scam, every other phone call you get  from then on is going to be a scam caller. So yeah, I think there's never a good hack  for things like this. Unfortunately, you know, there's always things that, you know,  can be used against people in ways that they did not expect and that is a shame

Transcript:  when it's the technology they trust. Yeah, this is why Apple and Google always say,  well look, we're going to close any hole we can find because we can't control who uses this.  And they may have some awareness of who, you know, what nations are acting and intelligence  services are acting in certain ways, but their goal as the platform owners is to close it up.  And these are scary too. Again, you've probably heard about these hacks before because  this has been reported before. It's just who was on this list that is new and the Guardian  in the UK reported that they'll be rolling out names. All of these journalistic organizations  that are part of this story are going to be rolling out details of who was targeted over  this next week. So you'll hear more about it, but we have heard some of this before. The idea here  is a text message or an iMessage in the case of iPhones is sent. Sometimes you have to click on  a link. There are some exploits that actually don't even require you to click on a link,  just receive the message. It's received silently and that's all that's required,  which is terrifying. And you know, many of these have been plugged, but the idea is there are always  more holes out there. And yeah, it's pretty terrifying. Especially if it's completely silent

Start time: 726.44
End time: 744.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because you know, I feel like I'm smart enough. I'm not going to click on any dangerous links,  which is probably not true in itself, but at least I have some ability to protect myself. And if all  that has to happen is that I receive a message, then I'm defenseless. Yeah. Also when you consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that oftentimes the purpose of this is to identify people that are next to be shot,  repatriated and disappeared. And that's absolutely no joke. I mean, you don't,  it's not just targeting activists. It's targeting activists to find out who they're messaging with,  who they're making contact with. It's not just journalists. It's who are in their circle, who  can we bring in on any sort of pretext. It's simple things like who is actually in our country  right now that we can nab just to simply send a message and just simply act tough.  And again, this is not a case of harassment. This is not a case of, oh, well, you know,  thousands send a 0.01 Bitcoin to this address or else you get your files back. It is people just  simply disappear because of intelligence like this. And this is why this is, again, you started off  with a real doozy. This is why this is such a damn scary piece of news. Yeah. And you can think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about journalists also having being threatened into silence is another thing, even if they're  not going to be assassinated. And in some of some of these countries, the journalists have been  killed. But in other cases, you may have a journalist who is silenced because they're  blackmailed or something like that. Yeah, it's a fun story. Yeah, a lot of fun. My understanding is  that Apple and Google have one of the shocker, one of the recent frontiers of security,  operating system security has been how incoming text messages are processed, right? Obviously,  they look at this, both of these operating systems, both Android and iOS hit by similar  kinds of bugs. And I'm sure that over the last few years, Google and Apple have put a lot of  time and effort into kind of sandboxing as much as possible the input from text messages. Of course,  that is the last war. And who knows if Apple and Google know, they're probably not talking about it  because they don't want them to know that they know but like, there will be a next war, another  corner, a soft corner, a soft underbelly of a mobile operating system that will be the locus for  even more attacks. And that's going to keep happening. So I guess throw your phone in the  water and walk away. I don't know. It's a difficult thing because we all rely on our,  our phones and on our communication networks. But scary to see this and how it's being put into use,  right? That's the real scary thing this time. I want to shift gears slightly, but only slightly.  I swear I have some fun stories to talk about too, but I want to talk about something that Andy  sent to me earlier this week. So maybe Andy, you can get us started. The story here, this in  particular is from the verge is a retail stores packed with unchecked facial recognition. And the  idea here is there's a campaign called Ban Facial Recognitions in Stores that have identified a whole  bunch of stores that are using facial recognition technology on their customers when they're in the  stores, including Apple. And yes, you go into that Apple store and your face is getting scanned  and using AI to scan faces is, you know, it's been a trend, but it is also makes you think makes you  have some privacy concerns. Andy, you sent this article to me. What do you think about it?

Transcript:  It's just a, it's just an indication of exactly how dangerous this technology is,  how easy it is to use this technology to abuse the power of people who already have a little bit too  much power over people who can be victimized without ever, ever finding out about it. And finally,  it's part of, do we really want to develop into a society where we assume that anytime that we leave  the house and even sometimes when we are just walking through a store, walking through a bank,  going through our lives, that we are being, we're taking part in some sort of a perp walk.  I mean, I can't, it's the thing is facial recognition. It's one of those really,  really delicious sounding technologies where, hey, a camera can simply identify people,  which means that if there's someone that has been causing problems at your bar, it'll identify them  as soon as he steps in or even before they step in or we'll be able to catch that person who  committed that crime because a security camera will be able to provide a match from that face  to a database that we have somewhere. And again, that is enticing. It is very, very seductive,  but this is, it's actually probably no accident that this story dropped this week because on  Tuesday, the house committee had a three and a half hour long meeting with testimony about the  use of facial recognition in policing. The committee asked the general accounting office  to prepare a report on, hey, look, of the 42 different federal agencies that have police forces,  how are they using facial recognition technology? And the answer came back, well, because there's  absolutely no regulation on how they can, how they're supposed to use this, they're using it  for just about anything they want to use it for. They are drawing upon databases, including  driver's license photos, passport photos, security cam footage, pictures that they're getting off of  social media, mugshot files. So there's a, one part of the reports claimed that there is a half of every  half of the entire United States population is in some sort of a facial recognition database.  And again, no controls on it whatsoever. And if you think that if you, if, even if we don't start  discussing the racial bias that has been proven to, to befall all of these facial recognition  technologies, the fact that it is a very, very prevalent tool to use to keep harassing parts of  society that keep getting harassed, people of color, Muslims, any sort of community that  get harassed by a power structure get harassed even worse. This story in The Verge mentioned out  that it's not even that, I think it was, which drug store, Rite Aid, I think it was, that they're  using facial recognition technology, but they're not using it in every store. They're using it in  stores that are in predominantly black areas. Wow. We could not have predicted that. And so this is  why it kind of disturbed me that the part of the, the House committee meeting on Tuesday was about,  let's discuss, like, let's react to this report. Let's get testimony from a whole bunch of different  people and let's at least start to have discussions on what should be done about this. And there were  a lot of really good arguments about here's what, here's the, we absolutely need laws. And that was  agreed upon by everybody. Here is the sort of regulations that we need to regulate this tightly.  And here's the sort of regulations we need. But nowhere was it seriously argued that this technology  needs a moratorium. There's actually a law being proposed that's in committee right now  that proposes such a thing. It doesn't simply make it, it doesn't make it illegal. It just simply  says that there is a moratorium, at least on federal use of facial recognition technology,  until an act of Congress reverses it. And so it really disappoints me that in all of this conversation  about this technology that so many huge corporations are prepared to make huge amounts  of money on, there is no discussion about maybe this is just too damaging a technology for our  society and maybe we should just keep our hands off of it until we can use it responsibly.

Transcript:  Rosemary, you live in the UK where CCTV cameras are on every corner. What is our reasonable

Start time: 1199.64
End time: 1413.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  expectation of privacy in public? Well, generally the rule is that in public,  there is, you know, you don't expect things that happen to actually be private. But the thing is,  stores aren't public, they're private property. They're owned by, well, whoever owns the store,  and then whoever rents it to, you know, Walgreens or whoever's in it, if the company doesn't own it  themselves. And I think it's one thing knowing that actions are on camera. So if there's a crime,  they can wind back to that timestamp, they can see it, they can find out, you know,  okay, this is actually what happened. Therefore, we have this and we can prove that this person's  guilty. But then they have to go about identifying the people who are in that who could then  potentially also make statements, right. And this is where the facial recognition gets tricky,  because on the one hand that, you know, say, you know, somebody pushes somebody else out in front  of a car, you want to identify the other people around so that they can also make a statement.  And then the person who did the pushing gets prosecuted, seems like a clear case for good.  But then you start getting into, you know, less clear things. And it's exactly the same as before  with this technology is supposed to be used for good versus, you know, don't use it for bad things.  It's always going to end up being used. And we've seen this here with Rite Aid, they're  discriminating, they're not putting it in every single store to use consistently across all of  their stores. No, they've started with the low income areas. And I don't know about you, but my  experience with people is there are good people everywhere, regardless of what area they live in,  regardless of what walk of life they come from, regardless of the color of their skin,  their gender, their sexual orientation, etc. Most people are good people. So discriminating  against certain areas just feels worse in this case, because, yeah, I mean, it's just terrible.  But I don't see what good facial recognition really can do in a store, because what stores have done  before and what big companies have done before, if there was a problem with a person, is that they  have photographs of that person in the security area and for the staff, security check that. And  if they see that person, then, you know, they say, sorry, you need to leave. And what are they going  to do with facial recognition is going to ping up a thing that says, hey, you need to tell this  person they need to leave, you still need the security there to do the actual work. So why not  get them to do the recognition, because people tend to be better at recognizing other people  versus a computer who can, which can make more mistakes at these things. I have seen, you know,  my mom unlock my iPhone, my mom doesn't look that similar to me, but we now have a slightly  similar haircut. And Siri has learned as my hair has got shorter, what I look like, and my mom's  got shorter hair as well now. And oh, wait, she managed to unlock my phone the other day. And no,  my watch wasn't on my wrist. So that is a case of facial recognition gone wrong. And you know,  that's something, you know, innocent, it doesn't matter. But in the grand scheme of things, you  know, we know that these things are not flawless. We know they're not perfect. Yeah, I'm worried  about where this may end up going. And I'm glad that some companies have said that they will not  be using it. But I also think that maybe state laws here to blame, because I believe CCTV in  the US is same to subject to the same restrictions as audio recordings with microphones, you have one  party in two party states, where and that then dictates whether or not they have to put up signs  and say whether or not there's CCTV, I think that those laws perhaps need to be reviewed. And facial  recognition needs to have a separate, you know, clauses for that. And so that people can then  perhaps choose to just do their shopping online so that they don't have to be watched.

Transcript:  Yeah, the idea that this is I hate to make a slippery slope argument, but the idea that,  okay, well, we just really want to, we have a known shoplifter and we can identify who they are.  And when they come back, we don't even know who they are. But if we see them again,  the security people can be alerted. But you know, or you're showing your face in public,  it's public. And therefore, what's the difference? But once you start building a facial recognition  database, and now it knows every path you take, if you merge those databases to get together,  you have created a panopticon, essentially, everywhere you go in public is logged,  every store you go, every aisle you linger on. And, you know, the more you talk about putting  these things in computers and databases, again, you can say, oh, well, we're not going to do  anything bad with it. Take us back to our previous story. The truth is, most of this technology will  be used in a bad way by somebody at some point, because it's just sort of inevitable.

Start time: 1470.50
End time: 1563.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's completely up to the whim of the retailer. By the way, I think Apple says that  they don't use facial recognition, which is not the same thing as saying we've never used facial  recognition. So it's possible that both the claim against Apple and what they're saying are correct.  Walmart went from using Clearview AI, which is kind of a worst case scenario,  in terms of being abusive and inaccurate, to now saying that they won't use facial recognition,  but they could change their mind tomorrow and there's nothing to prevent them from doing it.  Which I think is one of the reasons why there's such a strong argument for legislation playing a  role. Because there are a bunch of major retailers who say they're not going to do it right now.  But we just have to rely on their goodwill and what their feelings are right now. And certainly,  even if you're really opposed to this technology, it's possible to be somewhat sympathetic to the  challenges of running a large retail chain, having to deal with shoplifting. So I feel like their  concern over all the money they lose will ultimately tug them back to some of these  technologies. And by the way, I am worried about the idea that going online and shopping there  is a way to avoid being spied on because it's just a different set of tools that they use to spy us  online. But there are lots of those as well. So in the old days, in-person retail was kind of appealing  because it felt like it was a little bit possible to be anonymous if you went in and used cash.  But even if you use cash right now, that doesn't mean they're not figuring out who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not the future that most of us signed up for. We want controls over the things that  are most dangerous that could be used to hurt us. I don't think it's possible to put the genie  back in the bottle. I don't think it's possible to get an outright ban on this technology.  Certainly not possible to make it into something that cannot be privately sold to a private company  for whatever use that they want to make of it. But what I'm hoping is that we don't collectively  simply decide that, oh, this is a great idea. We should have more cameras. Why are we limiting  investigations? We should make sure that every single driver's license photo is part of this big  database of facial recognition. The thing is we understand that when we lift this gun and we pull  this trigger, a big bang happens and lots of distractions happen. We don't understand exactly  what is happening and what the damage is going to be done with this. And that's the real scary  thing about any new piece of technology. You get focused on the bang and the flash and not on,  well, this machine is designed to punch an explosive hole into whatever it's aimed at.  You can say it's for law enforcement. You can say it's for target shooting. You can say it's for  game hunting. This is what the machine does. Do not ignore that this is what the machine does

Transcript:  and what it will always do. And I do think that in the end, laws will need to be written in order to  clarify what can and can't be done because it's one thing when facial recognition is,  Johnny the security guard saying, hey, I remember that guy. It's another thing when there's a  database and there are multiple databases and what's their data policy and are they sharing  the data? And that's when you need really somebody to say, we need some rules here about how you do  and don't use that. And hopefully we will get some at some point. Very quickly, there was one of the

And the investigator just said, okay, good enough for me. Arrested this man, African American man,  in his home in front of his wife and his kids. And as soon as they got him to the station,  everybody looked at him in the picture and said, no, no way. This is clearly not the same person.  But he took him all day to be at the police station. And yes, it's true that the invest,  I believe that the investigator actually got beaten down or rank and punished because the  entire department was saying this is a disgrace. This is not a proper investigation. But it just  goes to show with the lack of any regulations whatsoever, it is possible for someone simply to  say, well, the computer says there's an 82% chance that these two are the same people.

Transcript:  Hey kids, Leo Laporte here. Yes, I know I'm in Hawaii. Thank you, Jason Snell for filling in.  It's been a great show so far. I don't, I don't, I hope you don't mind. I just want to interrupt  to introduce a brand new sponsor to you all. Checkout.com. You know,  as much as we love technology, it shouldn't get in the way, whether it's an e-commerce platform  or just interrupting innovation. And I have to say that there, we are currently burdened with some  obsolete payment systems. They're heavily layered. They're disconnected. They're a cost center to the  business. It's not what you need. If you're a modern business, you need a flexible payment system  that can help you adapt, change, grow, scale fast. And I want to tell you about a company  with tech that approaches payments through a radical new lens. It's got a great name,  easy to remember, Checkout.com. Checkout did a lot of research on this space. They partnered  with Oxford economics, did an end to end analysis of the payments value chain for merchants.  One big problem, and I think everybody who does this knows is declined credit cards for a variety  of reasons. And they cost, they cost a lot. They cost the UK, US, French and German markets, a total  of $20.3 billion last year alone. $12.7 billion went to competitors. $7.6 billion completely  written off. That's shocking by itself, but there's more. The study found merchants are not currently  optimizing the consumers significant willingness to pay for speed, convenience and security online.  Most merchants do not feel their payments data is informing their business strategy  or their innovation. In fact, 56% of the customers surveyed said that they won't come back to a site  because the site doesn't offer their preferred payment method. They don't make it easy.  Here's another shocking statistic. Most merchants spend more than 10% of their payments budget  fixing disputes, fraud, outages. This is costing you. CEOs are more likely to overestimate the  quality of data returned to them by payment providers. CEOs tend to underestimate the extent  to which disconnected payments are hindering growth. Most merchants focus on the per transaction  costs of their payments, ignoring the backend costs. So this research really helped checkout  to find clearly what their model was going to be. They are a leading cloud-based global payment  solution provider. Their payment platform is purpose-built with some very important priorities,  simplicity, scalability and speed. They're perfect for any merchant wants to seamlessly integrate  better payment solutions globally. You get improved acceptance globally, better and more  actionable granular data. You get a flexible product structure that merchants can adapt to  their needs and it's combined with really personal white glove service. So just check out the brands  that are using checkout.com across the globe. Pizza Hut, TransferWise, Klarna, Revolut, Samsung,  all use checkout.com. I know when I use a payment system, if it's not fast, if it's not easy,  if I don't feel like I can trust it, I am either going to end that transaction right there before I  push the buy button or I'm not coming back. That's why checkout.com is so important. It  builds trust with your customers. It's speedy. It's simple. Customers love it. Checkout.com. It's  the dominant choice for organizations that are looking for the fastest, most innovative and  reliable global payment solution provider. Look, I want you to request a free, there's no commitment  demo at checkout.com slash twit checkout.com slash twit. Get your free demo. Checkout.com  slash twit.

Transcript:  What can we do next? Well, sad news of a sort, but it's not going to bring you down like some  other sad news. I got some Twitter news for you. Fleets is no more. Twitter is shutting down fleets.  If you thought that every single site in existence was going to have its own version of Instagram  stories, Twitter won't anymore because that's what fleets was. And I'm going to take this as  good news. I don't know. I know all of my panelists are on Twitter just like I am.  I love the idea that Twitter rolled out a feature, looked at it, said, nah, you know what?  It doesn't really work. We're going to get rid of it and move on and do something different.  So even though I'm sure that the five people who really liked fleets are going to be sad,  I'm choosing this as a positive. I want to view this as a positive. Panelists, you're going to  miss fleets? Is this okay? You're mourning sackcloth, ashes, weeping, bales? How can I miss

Transcript:  fleets when I never actually fleeted or checked them out? It turns out that Twitter got excited  about fleets, which are really a knockoff of stories, which were invented by Snapchat and then  became even more popular on Instagram and then were copied by everybody. Twitter thought it  might be a way to get people who kind of lurk in Twitter and don't actually create content  to do stuff. That's like the eternal challenge for Twitter is that most of the tweets come from a  very small group of people. And guess who used fleets? And so they launched fleets and it turned  out the people who already loved doing stuff on Twitter and tweeting also liked fleeting, but these  casual lurkers did not use them, so they did not actually really fulfill the goal that Twitter had  for itself. And so it makes perfect sense. And I suspect you will see some of the other many, many  apps and services that knocked off stories also rethinking them because they make a lot of a sense  in a certain number of instances, but it's not like LinkedIn needs stories or Slack or Twitter

Transcript:  You know, I thought there were more people at mass this morning. I thought that the prayers  were a little bit more solemn. I didn't know why and now I guess I know why. I mean, it hits  the Catholics hardest though, really, when Twitter makes a feature deletion like that.  Sick transit fleet. Exactly. Now going forth to favor and like the Lord.  But there's, I mean, the biggest problem of any service or any software, really anything,  is when they lose sight of who they are, what they're about and why people like them. Instagram  could integrate something like this very, very well because it really is about I want to see  a little piece of media from somebody that doesn't take that long to really access or digest. Perfect  fit. Twitter, people, every time Twitter tries to be something other than Twitter, people reminded  that we like you because you're Twitter. You don't have to part your hair on a different side. You  don't have to start liking albums from Bowie's Berlin days. Just be you and because this is why  we have given you this tentacle-like grip of control and power over our society because the  the mechanism by which you make us suffer is very, very effective, very, very addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fleets happen. It's just not going to happen. I thought fleets were coming soon and then I saw  this news and went, oh, they already happened. So yeah, I never fleeted. That's probably a good  thing. I rarely use Instagram, but I wonder if part of the problem with this is Twitter didn't  make this available to everybody else through their API, as far as I could tell, to this way.  Tweetbot never implemented it. I use Tweetbot to access Twitter. Therefore, I did not see fleets.  Full stop. And I feel like maybe this is where apps like Instagram and so on can do much better  because if you want to access Instagram, you have to use the Instagram app and therefore they can  roll features out using their A, B, Z testing or just to everybody, whatever they want to do.  But yeah, Twitter is not Instagram. And I think they should probably stop trying to make fleets  happen. I never quite got the idea of it. Like why would I want to do this on Twitter? I have

Start time: 2328.14
End time: 2469.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram for that. Yeah. Yeah. I think there was a mismatch there for sure. I do have a twist to  this story, by the way. The positive twist here is that Twitter is also making some other things  happen that might actually be worth making happen. But I do want to mention Twitter bought a few  weeks ago, a great website. They bought a company that happened to have already bought this website  called Nuzzle. And if you don't know about Nuzzle, Nuzzle was a news aggregator. It was  kind of a news reader, except it used your Twitter feeds and other people's Twitter feeds or Twitter  lists as the raw material and would parse those links and see like if a lot of your friends link  to a story, that would be the top story on your Nuzzle page. And it was a really nice way to turn  a Twitter feed into a news feed instead of a discussion feed because sometimes you want to  see the discussion and sometimes you just follow a bunch of smart people who have got a lot of  good links. And Nuzzle is now shut down, which makes me sad. But in announcing the acquisition,  Twitter said they were going to implement, they were looking toward implementing a version of  Nuzzle on Twitter. And I thought, well, there you go. That's a feature that probably should be part  of Twitter. It probably worked better as part of Twitter. The idea that you could sort of have a  news view into Twitter. So I'm hopeful there. And what gives me more hope that maybe Twitter's  product group has turned it around a little bit is another announcement this week, which is that  Twitter on iOS now lets you edit who can reply to your old tweets. Now this is a feature that they  rolled out for new tweets where you could say only my followers or only the people mentioned here or  nobody can reply to this tweet. And that was a little bit interesting, but a little bit weird.  This new feature though, I really like because it suggests that somebody at Twitter knows  about dogpiling. Finally, the idea that you do a perfectly innocuous tweet and then somewhere,  somehow a large group of people come and start replying to it and harassing you.  And with this new feature, Twitter's showing, hey, wouldn't it be nice if you could take that  feature, that tweet that you regret. You don't regret the text. You regret that it's being  engaged with in this way and sort of say, yeah, I don't want anybody replying to that anymore.  Only the people I was talking to and do it after the fact. I think it's so smart. And it's one of  the first examples I've seen in a long time of Twitter actually getting how its service is not

Start time: 2469.52
End time: 2487.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just used, but misused. Twitter has always had this reputation for kind of overthinking everything  and then being paralyzed by the idea of changing anything and thinking it over  endlessly. So I'd say that both Twitter getting rid of things and Twitter adding things,  they're both promising signs.

Start time: 2489.30
End time: 2507.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if Andy and Rose, I don't know if you've been dogpiled before, but like,  I've had those innocuous tweets go where it goes into some other subculture and they have  interpreted it in a totally weird way that was never intended. And I would love to shut it down  and it's too late. And now with this feature, you can shut it down.

Start time: 2509.10
End time: 2582.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But the big problem is when it's something you said like four or five years ago, that's now  stripped of all context. And I feel as though if you said it, maybe you should keep it up there.  But there's something doubly stinging about if when it becomes reactivated, you know, and  fresh batteries and fresh charger put into it, and now people are getting social media cred over  replying and retweeting it and making their replies, get lots of lights and lots of retweets.  And then somebody who is working for a website who has to have three things up over the course  the afternoon wants to suddenly this is suddenly this is a trending topic. And there's nothing  there's something else to really talk about. So yeah, you're absolutely right. I think that  Twitter is becoming a lot more conscious of how how its service can be both directly weaponized  by bad people, and also just incidentally, just cause the storm cloud to hover over someone who  really doesn't deserve to be rained on. And they're trying to address this step by step by step,  wherever they can. So yeah, I hope this is part of a growing trend.

Transcript:  I had a tweet in the early days when I was at Macworld, early days of the iPhone, early days  of Twitter. And it was one of those days where like there were lines around the block for the  iPhone 3 GS or something. And I tweeted and it was back in the day when Twitter was super casual,  like literally you wouldn't there weren't retweets, you couldn't really put quote tweets,  there was no context. And I did a tweet that was like, yeah, sarcastically, yeah, I guess this,  this iPhone thing is not going to work out. And on an iPhone anniversary, like two years ago,  I suddenly got dunked on by all these people who are like, get a load of this guy who didn't think  the iPhone would be successful. And it was like, that's not what that tweet was at all. But again,  it was just raw material for somebody to kind of stoke the the hate machine on Twitter. And if I  had this feature, what I turn off all replies to that tweet and just quiet it down? Yeah, I probably  would instead. I just deleted it. Because I stand by my sarcastic comment about the iPhone 3 GS line,  I guess, but it's not worth it. So this is why people delete old tweets, I guess.

Transcript:  Yeah. And again, I feel like this move makes me think Twitter actually has some people getting  features implemented that understand all the ways that Twitter is used kind of in an unpleasant way,  that maybe they can shut down and make it a better thing.

Start time: 2659.58
End time: 2695.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think we all know people who have a service go through and delete old tweets. Some  people have it very aggressively delete anything other than 24 hours, other people leave it a  couple of weeks or a month or so. And you know, that's just proof that something like this is  needed. And it should be automated. I'm not saying that because I love automation. I'm saying that  because realistically, after a month, you probably don't want people replying to your tweets.  After a month has passed, you know, Twitter is what 280 characters that is not a lot of text,  things get taken out of context incredibly easily, even from a full length novel. So it's no surprise

Start time: 2695.34
End time: 2721.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that that happens on Twitter all the time. I like having my old tweets because I can  there's sometimes there's gold back there where you quote something you're like, Oh my God,  can you believe this happened five years ago or whatever, I hate to delete them all. But I  understand why people do. And yeah, I like that idea. That's, you know, you see that in forums  all the time to the idea that that forum threads get locked after a while because, you know, why  why continue reviving this thing after the fact all the context has been lost. Well, anyway, good

Start time: 2721.98
End time: 2815.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  job, whoever out there did that for Twitter. Thumbs up to you. But but but Rose had a really  good point that that would be a lovely feature to simply say every all of my tweets should  should expire after 30 days, just delete them after 30 days, right or lock them, probably,  or or or lock them. But the good thing about deleting them is that if you're if your personal  philosophy and policy is that none of the things that I put on this Twitter account are going to  be really relevant a month from now, two months from now, three months from now, so I may as well  get rid of them so that people don't people people will understand that I said this at a time when  the Red Sox were in game six, and looks like they're going to be thrown out of the postseason again,  and I was really, really on edge. And so I said some angry things about the pitching staff that  maybe I regret saying right now. I say right now. But the thing is, if I had gone back and  selectively deleted stuff that I thought was going to get me in trouble, that's kind of suspicious  in and of itself, people should ask, gee, why is it that people seem to be mentioning something  related to a tweet that doesn't exist anymore? Whereas if you simply say, well, look, of course,  if you want to find out my background by checking my Twitter feed, I mean, just as a matter of policy,  nothing over 30 days old is still on my feed. I just have it automatically deleted. There's  no malice about this. I don't pick and choose to make myself look smarter or more enlightened.  I just simply have this policy where 30 days is the freshest date, just like a Twinkie.

Start time: 2816.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the idea here is that you're giving Twitter users choices that are features that  really need to be in Twitter. And there are these weird things like Rose mentioned, you can  wire up a weird API kind of app that will go and auto delete your tweets. But really,  that should be a feature of Twitter. It shouldn't be a third party opportunity. And likewise,  locking tweets should be a feature of Twitter. And maybe I'm reading too much into the tea leaves  here. But I look at this feature and the ability to lock these tweets manually after a while. And  I think, oh, a good sign that maybe they get it. So more please, I guess I would say to Twitter,  more please. I want to pivot here to something that I found really, really fun, which is what  can't you do on an iPad? Now I'm a big iPad fan. I didn't bring my iPad today, but I'm a huge iPad  fan. And I've been watching Harry McCracken's Twitter feed about all the things he's been doing  with a particular app called iDOS, which led this week to Benj Edwards writing a whole story about  how you can actually run Windows 3.1 entirely, finally Windows on the iPad, like windowing,  no, it's not that Windows, it's actual Windows 3.1. Or if you really want, you can also run  TRS-80. And again, these are things that computers can emulate stuff, but to see it on an iPad,  where we've been trained sort of, no, there's, you don't do things like that on an iPad,  has been a lot of fun. So Harry, how did you get into this? And what have you done? What,

Start time: 2911.78
End time: 3031.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh my God, what have you done? Well, you know, emulators for old computers have been around for  a long time, like almost as soon as the old computers started being old computers, people  were emulating them. And I'd say for a while, I've sort of idly wondered whether it was possible  to run TRS-80 software on an iPad. And not surprisingly, it's not obvious how you do that,  because Apple probably is not going to allow a TRS-80 emulator under the App Store, even if  somebody builds one. But it then had dawned on me that there is actually an emulator which is  available on the App Store, and that's iDOS too. iDOS has been around for, I think, about a decade,  and it was on the store, then it got kicked off, then it came back. And last year, Apple allowed  iDOS to have access to files and to treat a folder like a hard drive, which makes it very easy to drag  old software into a folder and have access to it. And it suddenly dawned on me that there are DOS  TRS-80 emulators, and I have access to DOS on my iPad, so maybe I will be able to emulate my TRS-80.  On my iPad, I discovered it works really well. And then while I was continuing to fool around,  I thought, I'm not really sure what versions of Windows are compatible with iDOS, but maybe  Win 3.1 being old and relatively simple is, and I installed it, which took like 30 seconds.  And it actually works really well too. And because at Fast Company, writing how-tos about  emulating old computers is not really our thing, it dawned on me that Benj Edwards,  at How-To Geek, his thing is, A, writing how-tos and B, writing about old computers. So I suggested  to Benj that he write about this, and he was nice enough to do so and to give me credit.  So I got to bask in the glory of the cool story he wrote about this topic.

Transcript:  So how do you feel about the, does it feel weird, or does it feel strangely normal to run  a TRS-80 application or to run Windows 3.1 on the iPad? Do you just sort of, once you're in there,  does the screen fall away and you're just back at your desk in 1985?

Start time: 3049.20
End time: 3119.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It works remarkably well. I have to say, I kind of assume that it might be quirky and it might not  work. I'm running a beta of iPad OS 15, and there are a few issues with the keyboard occasionally  freezing when you first go in. And you also have to figure out stuff like how the keyboard's mapped,  because with the TRS-80, the TRS-80 keys are being mapped to IDOS, which then has to be mapped to  the iPad's keyboard. So I sort of just randomly hit keys until I realized how to do it. But  it works surprisingly well with Windows 3.1. The main thing I had to do is, A, you have to install  sound drivers, but DOSBox, which is the technology that IDOS uses, supports Sound Blaster, and you're  going to upgrade to a better graphics driver. And I found that slowing down the Windows mouse tracking  helped. By the way, the other thing about Windows in particular is that it only works at all because  Apple introduced cursor support relatively recently. Without that, Windows would not really make sense.

Now those who are not watching the video version of this or are not in the studio  with us, I'm staring at Harry's screen, which is sitting at a DOS prompt right now, which is just  freaking me out because it's in the smart keyboard here. And again, emulation is one thing, but the  idea of it happening on an iPad where we... The rules used to be you couldn't emulate anything on  iOS, but that's no longer the case. And so now we have this app, and it's not the only one.  I wanted to mention a couple of apps that are really great if... Right, like iOS doesn't have  a terminal either, like the Mac does or Windows does, but there is an app called AShell and another  app called ISH-ish. ISH, that is... Those are both, believe it or not, I believe ISH at least,  is emulating an Intel PC running Linux, but it works and it means you can run Python scripts  or Perl scripts on an iPad just like you can play Solitaire in Windows 3.1. Boy, that takes me back

Transcript:  to the 90s there, Harry. And I think maybe Apple knows what it's doing. This is not something that's  randomly squeaked by the guidelines. It's possible that Apple says this is not really a security  concern. Apple also gets concerned about somebody essentially building their own app ecosystem

Transcript:  and yeah, 30-year-old Windows apps or 40-year-old TRS-80 apps are probably not going to kill  Apple's business. So I'm hoping that they kind of are doing this because maybe they don't think  it's cool, but maybe they also at least don't object to it. So what was your favorite rediscovery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the TRS-80 side? I didn't have a TRS-80. This is going to shock people. I had an Apple II,  but I had a friend with a TRS-80. And so what jumped out at you was like, oh, I can't believe  this app that either you never saw or that you remember fondly. Well, one interesting discovery

Start time: 3241.72
End time: 3289.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is that there were a couple of guys who wrote a lot of the best arcade games for the TRS-80,  which is a real challenge because the TRS-80 did not officially support sound at all. They did  extremely blocky graphics, but they managed to write some fun arcade games. So there's a Donkey  Kong. And they thought, this was when Donkey Kong was new and hot, and they thought maybe if  we write Donkey Kong, we can convince Nintendo to let us license the rights to it. So they wrote  a really good Donkey Kong and they took it to Nintendo, who knowing that Nintendo, it's not a  great shock that Nintendo was not interested in this. But about 10 years after that, in the 90s,  they released their version of Donkey Kong, which...  We are now going to attempt to run. Yes. Let me see if I can...

Transcript:  and the gang. Thank you Leo. It's weird he's sitting where I'm sitting. It's like there's a  little strain. We should do a morph or something there would be very strange. I want to talk about  Facebook for a moment and wait, wait, where are you going? Where are you going? Come back.  Come back. I used to do a podcast with Stephen Hackett over at Relay FM where we did  News of the Week, kind of like twit and we ended up essentially having to do a Facebook is Terrible  segment every week. It was kind of soul crushing after a while but there's some Facebook news. I  thought we would at least mention it. One is a story that came out this week about how Facebook  has fired dozens of people over abusing access to user data. This is from a book. It came out  this week. It's actually kind of old news in that these were things that happened five, six years  ago but the story is chilling because this is one of those examples where somebody with access at  Facebook basically one of them was gotten an argument with his girlfriend and she left their  hotel room and he used the Facebook backend to find where her location was. It's stuff like that,  really creepy, weird stuff that at the very least if it doesn't say that Facebook was bad,  because they did fire these people apparently, but also that Facebook's policies regarding access to  information were really weak and questionable and allowed these people to do these things.  So that's not great. And then the other Facebook news, I'm just going to roll them together here  and then let all of you react as you choose, was there was literally a Surgeon General's warning  against Facebook this week. Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, released a statement warning  people about COVID vaccine misinformation on Facebook and Facebook responded and said,  no, no, no, we're actually great in a way that was not convincing, I would say to most anybody,  but what a situation to be in when the Surgeon General is saying that your website is a health  danger to the people of the United States. So it's going great everybody. It's going great.

Cigarettes, tobacco, the most important and successful industry in the world.  Oh, we're going places. We're going places. Free two foodie scoops for everybody this week.  Yeah, that was not a proud day and not a proud week and not a proud month for not especially  proud company. The book that has the head those stories, An Ugly Truth Inside Facebook's Battle  for Domination by Shira Frankel and Cecilia Kang, very well researched, very well reported.  I got my copy like late last week. I'm not done reading it yet. But yeah, it makes as you open  the book knowing that this is the tech company that I trust the least that I think is doing the  most damage and is the most reckless of all the ones that if there are five to 10 companies that  most people could name of those companies, absolutely the worst of the lot. And I open the  open the cover and I hear the crinkle of the of the spine. And yet I'm not prepared for the enormity  of the case that these two reporters make. It's just they're making it's not just a series of  anecdotes. They really do forensically make the case that this is not a company that particularly  cares about its impact on people in society at large, that they care about bad press.  And that's it. And they have a very dysfunctional co heads at the very, very top that basically,  if they don't want something done, it doesn't get done, which means that the people who report to  them are like filter every single decision through is, is Zuckerberg likely to care about this? No,

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. It's somebody said in the chat room, the Facebook apology department must be on  vacation. I want to know why these people have got access to personal data in general, because  clearly they shouldn't be trusted with it. And secondly, why they're allowed access to the  personal data of people they know, because that I mean, I get that it's more complicated to say  you're allowed access to some personal data, but not of anybody that you actually know, I'm very  well aware of that. But you know, people will abuse these things. We have to remember humans suck.  There are great people out there. There are bad people out there. We have to expect that at some  point, somebody is going to do something stupid. And yeah, people share stupid information, we're  all well aware of that. So yeah, I wonder why I've worked at plenty of jobs where data security was  a thing. And you know what they did? They didn't give me access to data unless I absolutely had to  have it. And then I got access to the absolute minimum amount of data for the absolute minimum  amount of time. And then my access was yoinked as I requested it, because I don't want to be responsible  for anything that goes horribly, horribly wrong. And I kind of feel that that's what Facebook should  be doing. But I guess maybe they didn't figure that out yet. Yeah. And this other story, the

Start time: 4072.54
End time: 4160.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Surgeon General's warning, this is a similar sort of thing, which is they're basically saying there's  a very small number of people who are responsible for most of the vaccine misinformation that's in  social media. It's a very small number. It's not actually hard to find out who these people are.  And the challenge is what they say is that people's Facebook social circles are amplifying this  information. And it's leading to all sorts of misinformation that of course leads to people not  getting vaccinated, which is the safest course of action to not dying of COVID-19. And Facebook's  response again seems to be damage control. And it's from somebody called their Director of Integrity,  which is funny because it's such a misleading statement. It sort of refers to the general  Facebook population and how they're trending the same as the general public in terms of  vaccine opinions. But of course it's not about the general population. It's actually about a very  specific hesitant population. And of course Facebook also has all the data. And when we do  have stories about Facebook data becoming public, as we did a few weeks ago, Facebook's reaction  tends to be, oh, we're going to shut that down. We don't want to actually any of that data to be  public. And I mean, I know, look, we beat up Facebook a lot. I'm sure that it happens all the  time here. It's happened on other podcasts I've done. They're not always the worst possible case,  but they are enough times that I don't think they've got any benefit of the doubt from most

Transcript:  of us about how they do their business. In answer to Rose's question about why these people have  access to this data, it's apparently because when you're writing code, it actually is useful to have  access to the data that your code is about. And that trumped privacy concerns to a great degree.  It sounds like just a vast number of engineers at Facebook had access to the data with very little  oversight. And the book, I think essentially puts that on Mark Zuckerberg. He had the option of  putting privacy first and making it way harder for these people to get access to the data and  having a far smaller number of people who had access to it. And instead, Facebook opted for the  approach that was good in terms of moving fast and building stuff, which is always top of mind

Transcript:  for that company. Yeah, I just want to jump in as a software developer and say this is what mock  data is for, fake data. And then you have testers who test your code with real data on a completely  separate server. That's how that really should work. All other companies can do this. Facebook

Transcript:  has the money. They need to do that. One of the big trends these days with AI is synthetic data,  where you take the real data and you're able essentially to convert it into stuff based on  the actual data, but with no privacy concerns because it's no longer that data. And it seems  logical. And maybe Facebook is doing this in some cases. I don't know that they're not.  Right. This was several years ago when these incidents happened.  It seems like they have the opportunity to get what they need from the data  with way fewer privacy concerns.

Transcript:  That's great stuff. I'm going to do a little plug here for a book by tech journalist Charles  Arthur. It just came out last week, I think two weeks ago called Social Warming, the dangerous  and polarizing effects of social media. Really thoughtful. Not a Facebook is bad because  Facebook kind of book, but like how the motivations of social media apps and how they're constructed  leads to rewarding behavior, human behavior and human weakness that leads us down some very dark  alleys. As the, I believe the back cover says, nobody meant for Facebook to facilitate a genocide  or for Twitter to be used to harass women or for YouTube to radicalize young men.  But all those things happen. Nobody meant for it to happen and why and what might be a path out  of that. It's a good book by a really good writer. So I'll just throw a plug in book plug there.  It's a good book, Social Warming. Check it out if you want to read more about why we are  where we are. I want to talk about something a little more fun. Maybe. I mean, I thought it  was fun, which was this announcement that Microsoft is going to take its PCs and put them in the cloud  and call it Windows 365 and let anybody on an iPad like Harry's iPad or on a Mac on like my M1 Mac  that probably is never going to emulate Windows particularly well. And Microsoft just said, you  know what? Starting soon for businesses, they'll be able to pay for Windows 365 and you just get a  window that has a PC in it and you don't have the PC. The PC is a magic PC that lives in a cloud  somewhere as they do. That's where PCs come from. And I just, I got a kick out of this because this  feels so new Microsoft to me where they're like, yeah, you want a window that is a PC? We got that  for you. Whatever. Put it on your iPad. Harry, you spent a lot of time at PC World. What was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4391.72
End time: 4396.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as far as I know. It's using their old game technology, game streaming technology. Some of

Start time: 4396.78
End time: 4490.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  us remember something called OnLive, which was a game streaming service for more than 10 years ago,  which briefly had something called OnLive Desktop, which was very similar to this. It was a way to  run Windows on mobile devices in the cloud. And even before that, a company called Citrix,  which has been around for decades, was about putting computers on the server and letting people  get access to them on demand. So it's not a technological breakthrough, but the fact Microsoft  is doing this is great. I'm probably in the same situation as a lot of people in that I still have  an Intel-based Mac, and I virtualize Windows occasionally. And I'm a little intimidated by  the idea of M1 just because right now there's not a clear route to running Windows. And it sounds  like what Microsoft is doing might be all the Windows they need. Right. And it would work on  your iPad, too. It would work well. And the other cool thing is it's a Windows machine that spans  all your devices. So you can run it from a Windows PC. You can run it from a Mac. You can run it from  an iPad. It's the same machine no matter where you use it. It's a little unclear what the pricing  is going to be like. And this is for businesses. But they say it's for businesses as small as a  one-person business. I resemble that remark. Which suggests it might be fairly accessible.  I think some consumers would like to do this, too. And I'm hoping that the next step after  this initial version is something that is at a price point and a level of ease of use that makes  sense for almost anybody. I'd certainly be a customer for this, for sure. I just like the idea

Start time: 4490.72
End time: 4500.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of Microsoft saying, hey, you don't want to buy a PC. It's fine. You can still just run Windows  in your web browser. It's fine. Like just for Microsoft to say that. That's something. And it

Start time: 4500.30
End time: 4552.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is kind of meaningful that they're doing this now. They could have done it before and they did not.  So I'm hoping it's because they're comfortable that it works well enough. If you have a really  long memory, which Jason does, you'll remember Virtual PC, which was a Microsoft product for  running Windows on a Mac before the days of Intel Macs. So Microsoft does have a longstanding  interest in helping people on different devices use Windows. And this is sort of the ultimate  expression of that idea. Because if this works, then you don't have to worry about emulation or  virtualization anymore. This should work on any device forever, which is not true of things like  virtualization and Intel based Macs. That was sort of ultimately a dead end. And I think people have  been aware it would probably go away at some point. Yeah, I just having a Windows PC around

Start time: 4552.64
End time: 4570.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in this way, instead of having to worry about some of these other methods of doing it, even  a hard, fast Mac user like me, I was really enthusiastic about this because it's just like,  oh, so a Windows PC can just be another tool in the toolbox. I think that's pretty great.  Andy Rose, any thoughts about that? You excited about it?

Start time: 4571.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I looked at this and my immediate thought was, wait, didn't Amazon already do this?  And they did Amazon workspaces $25 a month for a one virtual CPU, two gigabytes of memory Windows  machine in North Virginia by the looks of it $33 a month in the US. So Microsoft have to at least  be equivalent to or cheaper than that pricing for it to be, you know, better for people. This also  has an educational discount. But yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I had a Windows machine at my  last day job. It was a virtual Windows server, which I just use as a Windows computer for the  three things that I needed a Windows computer for. And that was it. Because I could get into  it from anywhere. And it was also my backup machine if and when things went horribly,  horribly wrong. I can see a lot of people having a use case for this. I personally don't think I  would need it. I have a Windows machine running down there ish. It's got some hard drives plugged  into it and is doing some stuff and is a gaming machine if such when I want to play games. I don't  think virtual Windows is going to be great for games. But yeah, I'm sure a lot of people will  want this. And then lots of be great for those people maybe on Chromebooks who need a more  powerful machine and didn't realize it when they bought it. And now they can rent one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, it's it's a great idea. And I have a I have an account on a similar service called shadow  that it's a it's it's basic purpose is to allow you to essentially have a Windows gaming PC  remotely. And yes, it's great because you can you can play it on you can use it on your on your iPad.  I mean, I had such a smile on my face, Harry, when you were demonstrating Windows 3.1, because  I had like Windows 10, just full screen on my iPad, you know, with the keyboard with the trackpad,  and being able to like install like the Windows version of Scrivener, like the full desktop version  of Chrome, because you don't need a floppy, you don't need a disk or for anything, you install  everything over the over the network anyway. And it's sprightly, it is fast enough to run games,  if you want to do that. And it is a way to say that, look, I don't have a, I don't have enough  of a need for Windows PC to spend $1,000, even $800 and have this extra piece of kit, I just have  this, I have this project that I'm working with these other people on this window shop. So I need  to have access to Windows for two or three months to work on this. And that's actually one of the  use cases, big use cases that Microsoft was mentioning about this, that if you've got a  temp worker in, or if you got you have to add more people in on a project, you don't have to  add nor hardware to your loadout, nor do you have to like ship laptops and ship desktops out to  people, you simply give them a link that they now they then click on, which logs them into a  fully configured PC that has all the software they need, all the files they need all the access to  other servers that they service that they need. And when they're done, you can just simply take  them off that server and they're and they're good to go. I do hope that it's something that  becomes more like shadow PC, where basically anybody can get in on this and do this. If they  decide that they again want access to Windows, I could, I'm not sure if it makes sense to spend  for me to spend $360 a year for access to actually a pretty good middle of the road PC in terms of  RAM in terms of processors in terms of graphics, graphics card and whatever. But nonetheless,  it's a it really does patch a lot of holes for a lot of people. I did see that some other people  were reporting that that Microsoft's product was going to be about $32 per seat. So it's not as  though people are going to be saving any money with this. But the problem with the problem with  these services that you have to make sure that it's you can't make it into a Ponzi scheme,  you have to have the processing power for every single user who signs up for this. So if this  becomes popular, and now you've got like 8 million users, suddenly you've got to have enough CPU power  to serve them all, which is why a lot of these services like Shadow, sometimes it will take you,  you sign up and it'll take you like two or three months before they will give you an account  because they just need to add capacity or wait for somebody to cancel their account before they  can let you in. But it really is a terrific idea and really does underscore the really complicated  relationship that Microsoft keeps having with their with the PC hardware community, where if  now if they're at the point where look, we don't care, we don't care if you're running Windows on  air, so long as you're running it on running Windows, yes, to hell with Dell, to hell with HP,  to hell with Lenovo, or whoever they are these days, just give us 30 bucks a month, we're good.  And long we can flex our cloud performance to other contractors, that just helps us out quite

Transcript:  a bit. Thank you very much. It feels like the ultimate example of such a Nadella's Microsoft  versus Steve Ballmer's Microsoft is such a Nadella. He's a cloud guy. And he's like, you  know, Windows is important, but Windows can be in the cloud. And that's just fine. It's it just and  again, as Harry pointed out, technically, this is not like it's not something that Amazon and all  sorts of other companies have been able to do before putting a PC, making an available provision  to you doing screen share, like, there's nothing groundbreaking here, except that it's literally  from Microsoft. And we know the power, like, how many times have we heard that story, which is like,  Well, yeah, Microsoft's got a version of this, but you know, it's not slack. It's Microsoft Teams.  And everybody who's got a Microsoft relationship in a company somewhere is like, What, what, what,  Microsoft did it? Well, it's from Microsoft, we're just going to do like the weight of Microsoft as  Microsoft as being in businesses as being the platform owner saying, Yeah, this is totally  legit. And in fact, we will sell you one of those rent you one of those PCs to just it's a very  different Microsoft than the one that maybe we all grew up with. And I think it's really cool.  Because I think I love it when Microsoft says, you know, when you want to use Windows, use Windows,  we don't care where you are, just use Windows, we are happy to charge you to use Windows wherever  you are. Love it. I have a really one more story before we take a break, which is about steam  and the new steam deck. I don't know if you've seen this or not. A lot of people tried to make  pre orders. Some people succeeded, some people failed. Those of you who are video streamers or  Rosemary, it's not the new stream deck from Elgato, although there is one that was announced the same  day. It's the steam deck, which looks kind of like a really big Nintendo switch, but it's actually  a Linux PC. And it's got steam OS on it with steams store, and it will play games. It's got a couple  different windows, API emulation layers, so that you can take games that are built for windows that  are on the steam store and they will just work now. You know, this probably hasn't shipped. How  just will they work? It's always the question with pre-announced products. But people in my timeline  on Twitter were super excited about this because the idea that you can take steam games, PC games,  and get something that, you know, if you squint a little bit, is kind of like a Nintendo switch.  The steam deck is supposed to be what? Four hours, three hours? It depends on what you're  playing. I think they said you play Portal 2, you can play it for like six hours on the steam deck.  So on one level, again, is this new technology? But it's a really interesting package coming from  essentially a platform owner in a way because the steam store is so popular. So I was very confused  that it wasn't a stream deck, but also very impressed with this announcement as I was laying  on the beach because that's where I was when this happened again. Just mentioning that for no reason.  So anybody have some thoughts about the not a switch? It's fun to see this renaissance in

And they told  companies like Nintendo, don't even bother to build new gaming hardware, mobile hardware. It's pointless.  And thank heavens Nintendo ignored that advice and came out with the Switch, which is one of their  biggest phenomenons ever. And it's fun to see both things like the steam deck, but also kind of at  the opposite end of the spectrum there's Playdate, which is also a new mobile gaming platform,  which you are not going to run any of your AAA first person shooters on. It's something radically  different, but I feel like it's a fun era when these companies you never would have expected  to do gaming hardware are doing it and at least have a fighting chance at succeeding at it.  I think we have Nintendo to thank for showing that mobile gaming hardware can thrive in an era  when people are carrying smartphones around in their pockets. And Steam really feels like a platform.

Transcript:  of being really successful. Yeah. I kind of have to wonder if they're how much money they're making  on these game decks or if they're actually selling them at break even because so long as it gets  people in the casino, keeps them playing, keeps them paying, that doesn't necessarily have to be  a big earner for them. And the fact that, I mean, when this news started to spread, I was shocked  to find out that it was $399 at the entry level and even the really good ones aren't that much  more expensive in a world where similar gaming PCs, handheld gaming PCs in the same form factor,  they are priced almost at the level of a gaming laptop. So they've made a super attractive product.  It's a product that the gaming community, thanks to Nintendo, has already been very, very well  trained to use and embrace. They didn't appear to screw anything up in the design of the thing  because it's essentially they said, let's write, let's make a PC that runs Steam really, really  well, but we're not going to just out of spite, make it impossible for you to connect a keyboard  to it, connect it to a screen, connect other controllers to it. We're not going to limit what  it can do. We just want to make this the most attractive product as possible. And that really  does make you think that their game here is to make sure that take people who are already very,  very happy Steam customers and make them like slobberingly devoted Steam customers or  Steam customers that are now more likely to buy games because they're not locked down as  they might have been. They get to be in this much more immersive sort of area. I have to say that  even I regain control of my senses within seconds, but it really did trigger my $399.  Gotta buy it, gotta buy it, gotta buy it.  I know, it's like I have $399.  It's like I can write about it and I can, it's almost like I'm getting it for free, aren't I?  They said, oh yeah, I'll put it on the business credit card. It'll be fine.  You don't play any games whatsoever. I already let you talk me into ordering a playdate when  that comes, when that goes on pre-order. Don't push your luck son.

Transcript:  No, I'm considering a Retroid Pocket 2, which is $80 and won't lock me into the  Steam system. I don't have enough Steam games for it to be worth it. I buy games on good old games  and stuff like that. So yeah, I'm not sure it's, I'm not the target market. I'm the kind of person  who owns a Nintendo Switch and plays it really intensely for a week and then ignores it for  two and a half months and then comes back to it. So I don't think the Steam deck is what I was  looking for. A stream deck is what you were looking for. A stream deck? Yes. That said,  I don't need the new one. My 32 button one is perfect. I think somebody could make a really

That's where it all starts. Okay. We've got more to talk about,  including some fun and interesting stuff yet to come, believe it or not.

Transcript:  Can I just interrupt for one moment? I'm sorry. We'll get right back to the show, but thank you,  Jason, for filling in for me. When I'm in Hawaii and I'm using Mint Mobile, I have to say,  it is the mobile wireless service you want. And I know when I tell you it's 15 bucks a month,  you're going to say, I don't believe it. I mean, we've been for years, big wireless providers have  been lying to us, right? Fine print contracts. There's always a catch, you know? So when I heard  about Mint Mobile's premium wireless service starting at 15 bucks a month, I thought, oh,  there's a catch here, right? But I've been using their service now for more than a year.  And I got to tell you, not only is it real, it makes sense. They're secret sauce. They're the  first company to sell wireless service online only. No retail stores, no crazy overhead costs.  The savings that get passed down to you, and there's no mystery fees. There's nothing. It's  just sweet savings direct to you. Now, there are all sorts of different plans, including a  no data cap plan, but you should check it out. I think the best thing to do is start off with  their introductory offer, $15 a month. That includes, as do all their plans, by the way,  unlimited talk and text plus high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network. You can bring your  own phone if you want. They'll send you a SIM, no cost. If you go to the Mint Mobile site, you can  enter in the IMEI number for the phone and it'll tell you whether it works. Basically, it'll work  with any phone that works with T-Mobile or GSM networks. Their LTE runs on T-Mobile. So if your  phone works with T-Mobile, it'll work just fine with Mint Mobile, but you save so much money. And  of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, then mobile has you covered with their seven day money  back guarantee. So again, just to recap, Mint Mobile, mintmobile.com slash twit, you get premium  wireless service that's unlimited nationwide, talk and text plus high speed data, just $15  bucks a month. And they'll ship you the plan to your door at no charge. Most other companies  charge you for the SIMs. They don't even charge you for the SIM. Go to mintmobile.com slash  twit, bring your own phone, buy one from Mint Mobile. I got an iPhone SE from them.  Very affordable. The whole package total, $30 a month, phone plus data plus unlimited text and  talk. I mean, it's such a good deal. Cut your wireless bill down to 15 bucks a month. Mintmobile.com  slash twit, 15 bucks a month. It's not made up. There's no catch. That's it. Mintmobile.com slash  twit. Thank you so much for supporting this week in tech.

Transcript:  Jason. Oh, Leo, thank you so much. Boy, that fist bump that we did in Hawaii now has extra meaning.  I am Jason Snell. I'm here with Harry McCracken, Andy Anadko and Rosemary Orchard. Still talking  about tech, lots of stuff going on. My old pal, Heather Kelly, who used to work with me at Mac  World, is now a tech reporter for the Washington Post. And she had a story this week that I thought  was really good. This could be filed away as the one of those bummer stories about how everybody's  got your information and everybody, all your privacy is vanquished. But I feel like there's  something inspirational about this as well, that once you're armed with this knowledge,  you can do the right thing. The story is called Lots of Apps Use Your Personal Contacts. Few  will tell you what they do with them. And this is just, it's a little quirk. If you've ever  been in your smartphone and you launched an app and it said, I would like to look at your contacts,  you might be like, oh, sure. But what can happen in those scenarios is that the apps then have  access to your entire contact library. There's a philosophical discussion to be had, by the way,  about whether you really should even be allowed to grant access to contacts. Do your friends'  phone numbers belong to you? Do you have the right to actually give that information to whoever  wants it? You sign up for Clubhouse and Clubhouse says, great, send me all your contacts. Do you  want to do that? But also, what happens then? They get siphoned off, they get taken somewhere else.  Do they get compared to other people? Are there social maps being built behind the scenes against  your knowledge about who knows who? Some horror stories in here about therapists who keep their  patients' information in their phones. And then they're uploaded to a site like Venmo where they  can be, where it's a public viewing of contacts and all of a sudden they've disclosed their  patients' names in public, which is a no-no. And again, we could make this about, oh, they're out  to get your information because maybe they are, some of them probably are. But what I like about  this story is I think forewarned is forearmed. Android and iOS, I believe, give you some features,  some power to say, no, I don't want to share my contacts with this app. I refuse. And then you can  decide, do you want to do that or do you not want to do that? And I really like that idea because  I think the problem here is in part that we don't think about it. When we say yes, we're not thinking  I'm disclosing everybody I know and without them saying it's okay, I've just handed their phone  number and their address and who knows what else in the notes field to who knows who. So I thought  this story was really, really great. And I opened it up for discussion. That's a terrible host thing  to do. Leo is going to revoke this. But I don't know. When I signed up for Clubhouse, I didn't  want to share my contacts. And it was really kind of creepy to say, I don't even think I have the  right to share other people's phone numbers with any service that I signed into. It was a great

Start time: 5730.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  story. And one of the troubling things about it was that Heather asked a bunch of big companies  what they're doing with the contacts they get from users. And in some cases, some of those companies  wouldn't tell her. There were relatively few at SIEM that were really specific about how they're  using contacts. I think one thing that is a little encouraging is that as this becomes more public,  both Apple and Google really do have a lot of opportunity to give us even more control.

Start time: 5757.94
End time: 5775.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple recently did a new photo feature where you can, instead of sharing your entire photo library,  you can pick specific photos to share. And I look at that and I think, well, yeah, you should do  that for every single bit of data sharing on that device. Like with location on Apple, you can give

Start time: 5776.86
End time: 5816.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an app just a vague idea of where you are because most apps don't need to know precisely where you  are. And it really feels like it would not be surprising if part of the follow-up to Heather's  story is the companies that control the platforms giving us a lot more power. And unlike some stuff  out there, this does seem to be an instance where there's stuff that can be done about it.  One of the challenges, which is pointed out in the story, is once a company has access to your  contacts, you can't yank them back. They have them pretty much forever. And so there may not  be that much you can do about what you've showed in the past. But moving forward, I think there is

Start time: 5816.98
End time: 5919.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  good opportunity to give us a lot more control. Yeah. And it's not like it's about people wind up  on a mailing list. It really is about the part of the job of these marketers is to solve for X.  If the information that they're collecting is anonymized, that's great. But if you have  enough samples of anonymized data and enough you can calculate for the missing variables,  and a list like this is a very, very powerful tool, it also brings to mind that one of the most  valuable single pieces of information that data collectors can get is your cell phone number.  Because it uniquely identifies you. It follows you from one place to another. So you might have  moved three times in the past five or six years, but you probably still have the same cell number.  And this is if they can attach unknown anonymized subject A441144B with, oh, well, I know that his  cell phone number is 818-441-2211. Wow. Now you've pretty much that's pretty much the master key that  unlocks so much other stuff. So yeah, it's terrible that we sometimes don't pause as we're so eager to  get to the part of the app that lets us give ourselves big eyes and a propeller on our nose  that we just blow past the, oh yeah, by all means, take a look at all my contacts. I'm sure I'm going  to want to share some of these new animations with my friends of mine. Well, no, it's not about  sharing things with friends of yours. It really is collecting information and trying to make life  a little bit more tragic for all of us everywhere. This is the story about Venmo, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  disclosing Joe Biden's Venmo account because he sent Venmo. He's used Venvon to send money to his  grandkids and they were able to backtrack from there and find Joe Biden's entire Venmo friend list,  which, oh boy, Grandpa Joe sent me some money for ice cream. Thanks Grandpa Joe. But still,  the point is they added an opt out, but if you don't know that your data is there, you don't know  to opt out. So it's not great. It's not great. It's not the end of the world, but it's not great.  You should be aware that you're giving this stuff away. These things should be opt in, not opt out,

Start time: 5952.94
End time: 6039.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to be very clear. They always have to be opt out rather than opt in. And secondly, what the heck  are they going to do with something like GDPR, which I'm aware doesn't affect Venmo because they  don't operate in the European economic area, but California data laws definitely affect Venmo. If  I tell them I need you to delete all of my personal identifying information,  are they going to actually do that? Because it seems like they probably wouldn't because,  oh, but that's not really your account. That's related to Jason Spell's account or Joe Biden's  account or whatever. No, it's my personal information. I don't want it out there.  I personally think this is a big issue and they should never be collecting this information.  And yeah, it's one of those things. I do wish Apple was a little bit better specifically about  the photo sharing. I had an issue when it first came out where I said, oh no, this app hasn't  allowed access to any photos, but then it couldn't access the camera. Now I'm pretty certain that was  because I was on a beta at the time and we all know betas break things. But yeah, it would be  good if this was a little more easily tweakable. So you could say, hey, maybe it can access this  album of photos or it can only access photos that I take within the app. But why does my  toothbrush app need access to my location? They say it's so that they can only sync my toothbrush.  But when I'm at home, well, guess what? I haven't been anywhere in 18 months, so I'm always at home.  So yeah, apparently they want to know that. Well, Phillips, thank you very much, but you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  getting my location. Yeah. And we've had a lot of conversations about location data, right? Like  location data and photos a little bit. But that's what struck me about this story is contacts. Maybe  people don't think about them. So just I'm saying to everybody who is listening now, think about it  the next time or go into your privacy settings and see what services you've granted access to  your contacts. Because when you're doing that, it's not just your like your basic information. It can  potentially be your entire contacts database. And that's probably, I mean, having restrictions is  good. But you do sort of feel like they're patching an initial hole instead of revisiting  that feature and saying, actually, by default, everything should be completely locked down.  And then we should give data very in very limited ways beyond that. And I'm actually surprised that  they haven't done more in that way, because quite honestly, you shouldn't be able to do a couple of  taps and send all of the phone numbers of everybody you know to anyone. That's a bad idea.  It's a bad idea.

Transcript:  And the odd thing is, it's not like this is really that much of a revelation, because Path  many years ago got in trouble for what they did with address books.  And they built the whole social graph, right?  So there is an alternate universe where Apple and Google really screwed, put the screws on some of  the stuff a lot earlier than they have. And I'm not sure why they didn't, because it seems fairly  obvious in a lot of ways. It's just that people don't think about it.

Wasn't that great? Like there was some great YouTube  videos showing that it still has problems with making unprotected left turns and driving in  San Francisco and things like that. But it's out. Elon Musk said it was going to be out for a very  long time and then it did come out. I have to be honest. At some point I lost faith in the entire  full self-driving thing. There was a, there was a point several years ago where I thought,  oh yeah, these computers are smart. These, these computer wizards, they're, they're brilliant.  They're going to figure it out. And now when I see Tesla, which is a company that has a pretty  impressive track record in a lot of areas, struggle mightily to release new versions of this thing  that they insist on calling full self-driving. And I don't know, I've lost faith at this point. I,  I feel like every, there's another story this week we heard that maybe the guy who helped  squire the Apple watch to completion, Kevin Lynch has been moved from that to Apple's car project,  which I'm like, oh, Apple car. That's interesting. And then the recap is Apple's full self-driving  car. And I thought, oh no, no, no, that's, that's never going to happen. So friends around me,  am I wrong? Have you, can you re-instill the faith in, in self-driving cars or are you all just like,  finally Jason figured it out. It's not going to happen. Yeah. I mean, it was, it was so much fun

Transcript:  three or four years ago when everybody was starting up a self-driving car company and like,  it was, it was like the Bitcoin of the early 2010s. And we all thought that we're going to be at  self-driving cars and hover cars by now. And it's see, but it's, it's, this is the kind of, kind of  technology where every getting halfway there from where you are is always easy, but it gets harder  every time you do it. So we go from zero, it's easy to get like it could get self-driving software  halfway there. The next time you want to get it to 75% there and it's twice as hard. The next time  you want to get it, have that again to the, to the finish line and it's twice as hard. And you will  because of Zeno's paradox, you will kind of never get there. And meanwhile, you get these,  the expectations being raised by, by Tesla, by calling it autopilot when I mean, secret,  if you haven't figured this out yet, the, the, there's a standard for, for self-driving car  technology, one through five, one being the lowest five being what we all imagine to be self-driving  car. It's as defined as you don't need to have someone in the driver's seat. You don't even have  to have a steering wheel or pedals and it will, and you can use it in every situation, no matter  what. Tesla, the Waymo's cars are at level four, I think right now, meaning that there are situations  they're running in test, test situations and kind of a 50 square mile area in suburban Phoenix,  Arizona, plus Mountain View, plus San Francisco. And even there, even there in a situation where  if it's raining, that's the situation where, no, they're not comfortable having self-driving cars.  If you ask for a Waymo taxi in Phoenix and it's raining, you will, your Waymo taxi will have  someone behind the wheel to make sure that things are working. But they're calling it autopilot. And  again, they're at level two, meaning that you have to have a human being not only sitting there behind  the wheel with the feet on the pedals, but also paying as close attention to the driving process  as they would had if they were actually driving this car. And they want to call it autopilot and  they want to start charging $200 a month for this malarkey. They're nowhere near ready. And we're not  even, we're not even at a place where we can start to regulate self-driving cars yet. We're not, the  technology is not mature enough that we can start asking governments, okay, well, we want to start  putting autonomous vehicles on public roads. How, what do, what rules are we going to have to comply  with in order to make that happen? We've not, we just don't have the data yet to make that happen.  Waymo's most successful by far. And, but they're still doing most of their miles in simulation  rather than on the road. So yeah, I mean, I think it's going to, I think it's going to happen, but  it's going to have to be that thing where it's just slow incremental changes. And suddenly we find that  we might be at an airport and the, instead of having a, like a, a monorail sort of thing that  takes you from the terminals to the parking area, maybe we will have like autonomous vehicles that  we can hail that will take us to where our rental car is. Maybe we will be in a situation where if  we're on a college campus, we can have a hail riding service where on the campus, the car is  going to drive automatically, but it's going to be a long, long time before we get into that sort of  dreamscape where we get to, we call an Uber and it's a self-driving Uber and it takes me  from the suburbs all the way into a meeting in the city without my screaming for my life

Transcript:  and texting last messages to loved ones. Now I, they've probably already sent their emails,  but I, I'm just going to clarify something for all of those, the Tesla fans out there.  There are actually two levels of driving here, which is probably part of the problem with the  marketing is there's autopilot and there's full self-driving and autopilot is actually the smart  cruise control feature and I've used that and I think it's actually pretty nice and that they  pretty did a pretty good job, but it's literally just a smart cruise control when you're on the  freeway and then full self-driving is when you like start in your driveway and say,  take me somewhere and it stops at the stop signs and it makes all the turns  and that's the stuff that is, guess what? A lot harder to do and, and again, I feel like Tesla  is a really nice product and there's yet there's something about the, and it comes from Elon Musk.  It is the over-promised under deliver ethos of the whole thing that drives me crazy because like  they have done some really great engineering, but when everything is late and everything is  over-promised and everything is misnamed to make it seem more impressive than it is,  you start to get kind of down on what the company is doing even though it's doing, and this goes,  honestly, this goes for SpaceX too. It is endemic to Elon Musk companies that they do amazing things  but only in the context of having over-promised. So yeah, yeah. And then, and the fact that the  Apple car, who knows for sure, but that the Apple car project is still being described  similarly as an autonomous vehicle. I can see Apple doing a smart car of some sort,  but it's that last, I can't believe I just walked into that at the last mile that I don't  believe. I just, I just, that's the really hard part is can you really just not have anybody  paying attention or behind the wheel and that, that we have not had enough evidence of, I think, yet.

So it's not vast numbers of people, but things like left-hand turns that are really  hard, even if you're just a human being, are even harder for a car. And it is a little creepy to see  people try to entrust their Tesla to make a left-hand turn and it just utterly fail to do so in a

Transcript:  safe fashion. Yeah, it just isn't there and I think it's okay that it's not there. I think the  problem is that you have the head of the company talking about how, oh, no, no, like any day now,  full self-driving is coming. And, you know, just be a little more humble about it. It's probably  impossible for Elon to do that. But like Tesla's got some great stuff. It is building smart  software. It has a lot of interesting sensors. But to go all the way to full self-driving,  you are putting the bar so high. And yes, you watch these YouTube videos and they can't clear  that bar. And that's because set the bar lower. Set the bar lower. It's the antithesis of the Apple

It's very  unlikely that all of us running the iOS 15 beta are going to accidentally kill ourselves or other  people while we do it. I mean, it's possible. Anything is possible. But it's a lot less likely  than if that data software is running on a car. Maybe that's why the Apple watch has so much fall

Transcript:  Yeah. Tesla just starts giving an Apple watch to everybody just in case one of their cars hits them.  Yeah. No, I recently got a new car and it's got smart stuff in it. So it can detect like road signs  to tell you what speed you should be driving and things like that. And it can also detect the white  lines on the road and the edge of the road. If you're on a motorway or a freeway for Americans,  it can't do it on any normal road as far as I can tell, because it literally just doesn't recognize  you know, the faded white lines in the middle of the road because guess what?  Companies don't pay enough money to actually maintain roads around here.  And I'm sure everywhere has that kind of problem. It's like, okay, my car is a Renault. It doesn't  have necessarily all the money behind it that Tesla's got. But Dyson poured what was it? 600  million into building an electric vehicle and that didn't pan out. So I'm wondering how much is this  autonomous electric self-driving car costing Apple? And is it ever going to see the light of day?

Transcript:  Well, they're good for it. They've got enough money under their pillow to pay for it a couple  times over probably. But yeah, I do wonder sometimes having Kevin Lynch move into Apple  car territory is a real interesting sign though, because he is perceived at least to be the guy  who got the Apple watch over the finish line. And if he's the closer, what does that mean?  Does that mean it's in disarray and they're desperate need of help? Or does it mean that  they're kind of closing on on having a product? Or does it mean that Kevin Lynch is really bored  of Apple watch and wants to do something different? I don't know what we're all reading the Apple  tea leaves the Kremlin ology that goes on. But it is an interesting move because his last one was  Apple's last major product new product, which is the Apple watch. It is it is really weird,

Transcript:  because I have a completely honest I have no clue what Apple is up to with the with self-driving  cars. I have no idea. I can't I mean, if you could give me a list of 100 possibilities,  and I would not at each one of them saying, I guess sure, that makes sense. But the thing that  keeps that keeps me interested is knowing the level of talent they keep bringing into this project,  that that's the slide deck they keep showing people say, Okay, well, I know that you are  incredibly successful in the field of auto design. And you have one of the most prestigious  positions at one of the most prestigious auto companies in the world. But I'm going to show you  this little I'm going to show you this little keynote deck in 22 minutes of your time. And at  the end of that time, they're saying, you know what, I'm going to quit my job and start working  for Apple. That is one hell of a pitch deck. And so whatever it is that they're showing them,  whatever plans or whatever, you know, do you want to keep so you want to keep selling sugar water  to kids, and you want to help change the world. It's definitely convincing people to, again, leave  leave positions of great success and great security and great renown and join this,  this project that I keep comparing it to like the Soviet moon lander project, where at some point,  the Soviets said, Okay, we're canceling the moon lander project. I know that you you you you you  and you have been doing nothing but training to be the first to be to walk on the moon. But  not only we canceling this project, we will never acknowledge this project actually existed. So good  luck with the good thanks for your past five or six years of service and good luck. That's what  Apple could absolutely do if they simply decide that. Nah, this was actually we were going to go  ahead with the with the with the Apple car project. But Tony has an idea for a really cool new watch  band that really is going to scratch that innovation itch for us for this year. So

Transcript:  One more one more commercial. Let me just briefly mention and Java E and D A, V, A. They have a  great podcast. I know you're going to like it's called tech reimagined. They just put out season  two of tech reimagined. Here's how it works. It brings together leading tech personalities,  industry experts, I mean, names, you know, Guy Kawasaki, Mary Williams, Alex Hunter, Brian McBride,  Tom Gruber, Dave Copeland, Emma Martinez, Viola Llewellyn. And they talk about big technology  and how it's changing our world guests and hosts talk about how technology and its industries are  impacting our everyday lives, how our relationship with technology is constantly being reimagined,  hence the name tech reimagined. They they've kind of focused on different areas. For instance,  there's two episodes in the series about insurance insurance reimagined. The guests are  Ann Norclit and Kevin Crawford. They talk about how you know what I T and means to the insurance  industry. It's actually fascinating. A lot of inside information. There's two episodes about AI,  the role of AI reimagined with Boris Sergal and Radu Orgedon. And they talk about the regulations,  the accountability, the expectations that arise when you use AI to solve complex problems. There's  a lot of interesting philosophical issues they also talk about. And I always find this fascinating  what the future holds for AI and people using it on a daily basis. If you if you're interested  in shopping, who isn't parts one and two of our shopping experience reimagined really goes in  depth into how tech is changing commerce.

Transcript:  Aloha means hello and goodbye. I don't know which one I'm saying to Leo there. Both, maybe both.  Maybe both. Why can't it be both? A few other fun stories for you before we wrap up today.  This one a little philosophical. Another Andy and Natko original. Well not the story but the link  that he sent to me. It's such a good fun weird topic. There's a documentary called Road Runner  which is about the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. He committed suicide and it's sort of the people  involved in his show and people who knew him writing or doing a documentary about him including  dealing with the fact that he committed suicide and it uses clips. He was in so many shows that  it uses a lot of clips of his voice to tell the story. However there were things that he had written  that he never said that anyone can recall on tape and so what the documentarians decided to do  was use an AI voice training system trained on his previous recorded words to generate Anthony  Bourdain's voice narrating portions of the documentary with words that he wrote but never  said out loud. I've read some unflattering stories about this documentary saying that it's actually  kind of weird and and elides some of his personal history and that the more you see it the more kind  of questionable it is that it was even made but I haven't seen it. I don't even know. I don't really  want to talk about the documentary itself as much as this idea that Andy sent to me about is it like  it's his words right but he never said them out loud so what is and I'll grant you three decades  ago we had video of Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum cleaner on a Super Bowl ad so it's not as  if this sort of thing hasn't happened before but at this point the technology exists with AI. There's  a company called Descript that makes an audio editing tool that if you feed it enough audio of  a human being it will let you type anything you want and you can get that person's voice to say it  and we've seen this before Roger Ebert had a Ebert-esque voice built for him that he decided  he didn't want to use and here we have a case where Anthony Bourdain cannot speak for himself  he's no longer with us it sounds like perhaps some of the people closest to him were not consulted  on this and yet here's his voice that's being made to say things that he did write but then he never  actually said it is a real weird 21st century ethical conundrum so and Andy thank you for  recommending this to me I feel like you have strong feelings about this that's just my guess

Transcript:  yeah it's it just has so many different layers to it well first of all in the context of a documentary  it's unnecessary and it's really damaging because you yourself brought up that Val Kilmer has a  documentary because of his throat cancer he can't he his speech is very much compromised so for a  lot of the narration that's in quote his voice the he and the filmmakers cast someone to represent  his voice uh kind of sounds like him but is not him exactly exactly yeah roger ebert did the exact  same thing when his memoir while he was alive was produced into a movie he chose a voice artist  he's actually he's actually also voice artists who does a lot of the empire empire villains in the  in a lot of the star star wars games but he got to choose who's going to represent his voice  anthony bordain did not have a say in this as you say but in in the context of a documentary  when you find that one thing has been faked it ruins your it ruins your perceptions of everything  else this is my problem with with michael moore documentaries that you will you will watch it and  then you'll say wait a minute that's totally not true i know for a fact that's not true and then  no matter how positive or or uh uh humanist this whole this whole story is i can't trust anything  that's being said in this documentary so if they choose if the filmmaker chose not to simply have  somebody not even necessarily sound alike but someone who has a compatible voice read this email  i think it's a 40 second email to a to a friend it's it really interferes with how you start to  go with this but now but outside of a documentary it really is very very interesting i'm i'm sure  that the reason why fred astaire was able to be likeness was able to have a vacuum cleaner in his  hand dancing up and down the steps from one of his famous clips from i think it was from the  barkley's of broadway but i could be wrong with that is because he was a big celebrity he had  really good lawyers and part of his estate was he he made the decisions that well after i die is it  okay to use my likeness and my and films of my movies in advertising and he signed off on that  maybe he didn't anticipate how it could be used but he did think about it he could have said no  he decided to say yes so i think that now we're going to have this extra element where people are  going to where celebrities are going to have to are going to say i do not give my if i don't want  my voice to be recreated if i don't want my likeness to be recreated then that then that's  going to be in their wills but let's go into something a little bit more personal this is  i'm going to cut i i swear to god i've got a shot clock in my head because this could be like two  hours of conversation between the three of us but for the past couple of years i've been thinking  about how technology um how technology plays a role in the grieving process when we lose a loved  one that uh we've all been to we've all now been to funerals in which there is always that's that  that little hd tv on the table that has a slideshow of all kinds of different pieces of video and and  and photos that were collected over the course of this person's life and helps us to remember  who they were but imagine a little step in the future as you said we do have this technology  where if you have enough samples of someone's voice you can recreate that voice what if for  certain people they decided that would help them with their grieving process if they could have  the emails that that your your mom or your dad sent to you read in their voice with a synthetic  voice that they create or even this is going to sound really creepy but again people grieve in  their own ways what if you decided that i want to have i i don't want to have my my smart speakers  speak in my my dead mother's voice but i want a voice that reminds me of my mother that maybe a  voice that that maybe has grew up in the same neighborhood as my mother what does does that  become the sort of technology where it is helpful and healing or is that just so creepy we want no  part of that forever and ever these are questions that we're going to have to start asking ourselves  i mean we we are in a we are in a society where it is part of our grieving tradition to have the  body of a loved one on display for a couple of days in a funeral home that in itself could seem  pretty weird it might seem less weird than you know my my favorite book my my my dad read the  hobbit to me like as a little kid when i used to go to go to bed i want to hear my my father's voice  reading the hobbit to me from start to finish that if technology like this could be used for  something like that maybe doesn't matter that the deceased person didn't get a choice in the matter  because on some level they're no longer here and because these products are not being used in a  public fashion maybe that's a situation in which we can sort of overlook the fact that we didn't

Transcript:  bourdain estate did sign off on this which well that doesn't mean i like it that does mean  something but uh an even more important fact is that the only reason we're discussing this at all  is because a writer for the new yorker named helen rosner saw they was writing about the  documentary and saw it and wondered to herself why do they have audio of anthony bourdain reading  his email it's really weird they would have that so she she asked them and uh morgan neville the  who's a really good documentarian who made this uh acknowledged that they did that in several  instances um but he did not disclose it and he seemed i have to say a little bit flippant  in his response to her he kind of said there are other places where we did this but you're not going  to be able to tell what they are and maybe someday we can have this debate but i'm not going to have  a debate about the ethics while i'm promoting my movie now yeah and his ex his bourdain's ex-wife

Transcript:  not being upfront about it and i guess to andy's point about um trust of the information that  you're seeing in a documentary even if you just put up a super title that said um this is uh  reconstruction of his voice uh that you're hearing reading this uh you might have the reaction of  this is amazing we get to hear his voice reading his words but instead it's just a little bit weird  i'm not saying this is a scandal either i just am saying that it is it gives one pause about  the capabilities that we have to do things like this and i think that's interesting i mentioned  dscript earlier the idea with dscript is if you're working for a very popular famous podcast let's  say this week in tech with leo you could get leo to speak all the words into dscript that it wants  and then when leo goes on vacation he doesn't even have to pretape the ads or what if one ad  changed after he already left then somebody here could retype that part and output it as audio and  it would sound like leo said it and that's why that product exists so it's generally the idea is  that it's with the approval of the person it's like a very busy correspondent is not around  and you need one slight wording change in the piece before you lock it but still when i first

Transcript:  yeah i think this is the thing is they didn't think it would be a big deal and helen rosser  noticed it and it became more of a thing and i think the answer is that this is the kind of  thing we have discussions like this about and the next documentary says you know what let's  disclose this we'll still use it but we're going to disclose it or let's not use it and use somebody  else instead whatever but they'll they'll probably think about it a little bit more that's all  i'm saying is maybe think about it a little more um a couple stories before we go and thank you all  for being with us and thank you panelists for being with us um one story before we go harry  and i are residents of the bay area i just wanted to point out this story in the new york times this  week headlined tech workers who swore off the bay area are coming back anybody who has been in the  bay area or san francisco or anywhere in the surrounding for any amount of time remembers  how many they actually they remember when they lose track of how many times the bay area in san  francisco is declared dead i have lost track it happened when i moved here in the early 90s it  happened in the late 90s during the dot com crash it happened in the late 2000s during the financial  crisis it happened again during covid the idea that everybody's leaving the bay area and everybody's  leaving san francisco and they'll never come back and everybody who's here goes probably not and then  wait you know set your watch wait for it wait for it oh here's the piece about how they're not actually  leaving or if they did leave they're coming back i you know i don't really have a lot to say about  this other than it always happens like this this is just how it is this is san francisco is a city  and this is a region founded on the gold rush people rush in to get rich and some of them stay  and some of them go and it's kind of a weird place but there's value to be here and so every time  i'm just saying if you see san francisco declared dead again take the under it's probably not going
