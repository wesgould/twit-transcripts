Start time: 220.82
End time: 236.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he loves Seattle so much. I still miss New York.  I think I will always miss New York, but I love the job and I love my team.  But he's very happy in the Pacific Northwest.  So it's important to your husband. Yes. Yes.  Well, no, it is. Well, he he kind of suffered through the whole time we were in New York.

Start time: 237.36
End time: 240.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he didn't want to be in New York. Not really.

Start time: 240.44
End time: 274.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not really. I mean, he he liked it, but he got to the point where he was he was really not happy.  So that was actually one of the reasons why when I was approached,  I started to kind of think seriously about it because I was like, well, we thought we looked at cities that we would want to live in.  And the hard thing was, you know, as a journalist, there are kind of limited places where I could do what I did.  But we talked before we took, you know, Austin would be a place.  Portland would be a place. Seattle would be a place.  We had a couple of different places and then Microsoft reached out.  And I was like, oh, well, this is interesting timing, especially with everything happening in the media world.  So it worked out well. And it's been exciting.

Start time: 276.00
End time: 278.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  It's really interesting how Microsoft its stock and its fortunes have improved since Christina Warren started working.

Start time: 288.24
End time: 302.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is completely not in relation to me at all.  But I can say, yeah, the stock has gone up and I'm very grateful for that.  I'm very grateful. But yeah, it is absolutely not because of me.

Start time: 303.24
End time: 305.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that Nadella guy has a little something to do with it.

Start time: 306.85
End time: 308.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe, maybe something. I mean, yeah.

Start time: 309.10
End time: 331.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you at Microsoft at a really interesting time.  I mean, they just acquired GitHub. They have done something that so few tech companies do, which is completely reinvent themselves,  especially when you're a big hit. You dominate the world with Windows and Office.  And then suddenly it's no longer about operating systems.  It's about the cloud. And to make that pivot is remarkable.

Start time: 332.60
End time: 384.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it is. And it's been really interesting being on the Azure team.  And that's what I'm an advocate for and talking with the product people and the developers and obviously all the people in our communities  and trying to get insights into how we can do even better.  But yeah, you're right. It's really exciting. And it's a challenge, right?  Because we dominate in Office and in Windows and we have a really big competitor in cloud and they are actually in our backyards.  You know, they're like literally like my my personal apartment is closer to Amazon than it is to the Redmond campus where I'm recording this.  And so, you know, we've got to be on our toes and we have to be authentic.  And it's been really interesting for me, somebody who never would have necessarily seen myself working at Microsoft  to see what the company's become and how real everybody, at least that I've interacted with, is about the transition.

Start time: 384.00
End time: 404.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's been really exciting. It is. It's one of the most exciting companies in tech right now, which is pretty surprising and amazing.  Now watch what happens to IBM stock because Wesley Fong is here.  Wesley just took a new job. He starts tomorrow, formerly at FSG.  And we thank FSG because they've been very supportive of you being on Twitter.  And now you're going to Big Blue.

Start time: 405.66
End time: 433.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be super exciting. I'm going to be joining a great team.  It's going to be here in Austin. So I'm not moving, at least not cities anyway, moving houses.  Like I said before, we're in a we're just setting up boxes everywhere in my new house here.  Congratulations. That's nice. It's going to be it's going to be a great company.  They're doing really exciting things.  They're trying to make a startup within a giant corporations that that's over 100 years old, which is it's they're doing really good things.

Start time: 433.00
End time: 451.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in some ways they're faced with a similar challenge to Microsoft.  You know, they they need to reinvent themselves.  It's got to be hard to be a old tech company, including old tech company Google and Apple.  You've got to reinvent yourself much more often than you used to, much more often than U.S. Steel has to, you know.

Start time: 452.77
End time: 471.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they've been really making some really big moves.  It's just more quiet and to larger, more senior people that actually here are in the know because, you know, Google helps with websites.  And but I've been empowers companies and governments all around the world.  So it's going to be one of those things.

Transcript:  Is Watson the big thing, the A.I. and all of that?

Start time: 475.46
End time: 507.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it seems if you look at what Watson does in health care, it has changed things.  It's just that people just don't know about it.  And they just did a debate version of Watson where they can hold the debate.  And it held its own.  Yeah.  With a human.  Just being able to be able to hear assertions and challenge them may even help us think differently.  Even from a government standpoint of coming up with a premise and being able to work it out with a computer before you bring it to the masses would be great.

Start time: 508.42
End time: 521.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, if you think about debating is one of the things Watson would be like Jeopardy very good at because it has a huge database of information.  And so it's really about kind of organizing that information in support of a debate argument.

Start time: 522.20
End time: 538.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they and there's this always the same saying you don't know what you don't know.  So being able to find a way of exposing that before you get the ire of the press or critical eyes.  That definitely is going to help.

Start time: 538.77
End time: 569.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What pre what critical eyes of the press?  What are you talking about?  The enemy of the people.  Oh, that's us.  That's right.  That's us.  Actually, I shouldn't joke about it because, of course, there was another terrible shooting in the United States this weekend was in a newsroom of a newspaper in Baltimore area.  And so our hearts go out to all the people affected by that just terrible, terrible thing.  It just reminds you being being a journalist can be dangerous.  Often is.

Start time: 570.28
End time: 591.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortunately, it certainly made us it certainly made us much more cautious.  I bet.  Yeah.  When I when I left that day, I was headed out the front door and the publisher was talking to the to the receptionist at the front door, explained to her what they were going to do to improve security after that.  It was pretty pretty moving.

Start time: 592.04
End time: 598.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We went through that in radio.  San Francisco radio station guy came in, shot a number of people in the radio station many, many, many decades ago.

Start time: 599.40
End time: 608.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this was this was this the the talk.  The KGO.  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah.  What was the movie?  The Oliver Stone film.

Start time: 608.00
End time: 615.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he may have.  Well, no, then there was another one in Colorado.  Very famous case in Colorado.  That was the one I was thinking about.  That was talk radio.  Yeah.  That was talk radio.

Start time: 616.02
End time: 619.76

Transcript:  Yeah.  Eric Bogosian.  It's scary that you can confuse them because there are so many.

Start time: 621.38
End time: 638.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a shame that we have to.  Oh, no, not that one.  The other one.  Yeah.  But but you know, we have I mean, every radio station in San Francisco after that, you know, severely improved security.  We have an armed guard at our door.  You can't if you're in media, you know that there are risks.

Start time: 639.65
End time: 698.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely.  I will remember when Charlie Hebdo happened, you know, so Mashable is in the same building as Gizmodo Media Group, which was then Gawker and The Intercept.  And I believe all three publications published the Charlie Hebdo comic, the cartoons after that terrible attack.  And there were there were a number of bomb threats against that building.  And so I it was one of those things because we're all in the same building.  And I felt I felt bad for MasterCard and Capital One and some of the other tenants who were kind of like, what did we you know, what did we get into?  But it becomes like a real thing.  Like you don't think about it until you know, like you're talking about, Leo, you know, the radio station thing or you see something that happened with the with the Gazette, which is just terrible.  And or something else happens and you have to kind of assess to go, oh, this is actually dangerous because I think a lot of us when we get into it, especially if we're not doing hard news,  we're not, you know, in war zones, you don't necessarily think that you're doing something where your life could be at risk.

Start time: 698.22
End time: 782.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. And I always figured tech journalism is fairly safe.  Knock on wood. Yeah.  Yeah, really. No, you know, I don't think we ruffle feathers that that much in tech journalism.  Thank goodness. A couple of big stories this week.  Not it wasn't a huge news week, but Apple and Samsung buried the hatchet.  That's kind of a surprising story after good Lord seven years.  It started in 2011.  It kind of following this is a twisted tale all by itself.  Initially, Apple got a billion dollar ruling, then a series of appeals pushed the dispute to the Supreme Court.  It turned out lower courts had validated Samsung's patent.  I mean, Apple's patents. So it wasn't about the patents.  It ended up being what the damages would be.  It went back. There were a number of design patents, a number of utility patents.  Eventually, the verdict was whittled down to five hundred thirty nine million dollars for Apple.  Samsung appealed on that.  They reached an agreement before it could be litigated again that Judge Lucy Koh and that last court case said you two get together and work this thing out.  And while we don't know the terms, I think probably both companies lost their thirst for battle.  This was really Steve Jobs battle, wasn't it?

Start time: 783.04
End time: 823.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they realized that that it would have been horrible if they actually got a settlement because I think the part they're working out is what percentage of the Samsung phones  were due to the infringed Apple patents.  So if they were able to monetize saying, OK, we got the screen and this is worth this much,  it would have done an enderun around all the other companies in terms of patent infringement because they would have just done it.  And if they got caught, they said, oh, it's only been five percent of our design.  Oh, good. We can do that. Great.  Exactly. And so if they did the settlement, if they didn't work it out before, then that could have totally screwed both companies.

Start time: 823.74
End time: 828.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. So there was actually some economic incentive not to not to continue the battle.

Start time: 829.02
End time: 896.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah. But I think also you have to look at the phones and the devices that were cited in that case were all I mean,  I think, you know, the original thing kind of started in 2010 is when some of the early, you know, kind of back and forth started.  And so you're looking at like it was like the Galaxy S3, I think, and it was some of the earlier phones.  And so from that point forward, after the first lawsuit, Samsung started to change things just enough so that they were, you know, I guess, avoiding whatever whatever patents.  You can't if you look at a Galaxy S9, you can't say that's based on Apple unless you think that all slabs of glass with rounded corners are Apple's right.  Right. Exactly. I mean, and at this point, you could argue that if anything like the iPhone 10 goes the other way, you know, it's not the same.  Exactly. You know, it looks a lot like the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S9 in some regards.  But yeah, I mean, I think I think Wesley's point there probably was some sort of economic thing.  But also at this point, you know, it's gone back and forth between the courts so many times.  As you said, it was a Steve Jobs thing where he was really trying to fight two companies.

Start time: 896.06
End time: 898.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said we're going thermonuclear on them.

Start time: 899.30
End time: 918.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. He was just like, I'm done.  But at a certain point, you're you're now litigating over phones that haven't been sold in seven years and damages and whatnot.  And you're paying lawyers who only knows what.  And I'm sure that Judge Lucy Coe has been so tired of this case because she's been dragged into all of the variations.  She's just like, OK, just settle this. Get it over with.

Start time: 919.32
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So finally, you know, although not all of it, not all of it was look, some of it, I think the pinch to zoom was one of the issues.

Start time: 926.34
End time: 928.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And swipe to unlock and swipe to unlock.

Start time: 929.00
End time: 944.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And both of those are still found on all smartphones.  So I suspect the lawyers probably would have loved to have continued it.  But I agree with with Leo that and and Christina that it really was kind of Steve Jobs's fight.

Start time: 945.52
End time: 986.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's over. It's interesting to look back.  It's really from the Walter Isaacson book where the biography of Jobs, he said, Steve's was livid in 2010 when HTC introduced remember the G1, the first Android phone, and it had touch.  Apple sued Jobs told Isaacson in an ex.  This is the AP writing in an expletive laced rant that Google's actions amounted to grand theft.  Quote, I will spend my last dying breath if I need to and I will spend every penny of Apple's 40 billion dollars in the bank to right this wrong.  I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.  I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.

Start time: 987.20
End time: 992.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow. And I think you keep in mind also that someone from Google was on the board of Apple at the time.

Start time: 993.38
End time: 998.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't it wasn't someone it was like the CEO, you know, he was at the iPhone launch.

Start time: 1000.76
End time: 1009.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we know that Google and I think we know this maybe from the trial when Google saw the iPhone, they scrapped their plans for the Android phone.

Start time: 1009.00
End time: 1033.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been planning on ripping off.  It was a combination of a Blackberry ripoff and a Windows mobile ripoff.  If you looked at their original Android phone, it had like a keyboard and it basically kind of looked like what the Blackberry was at the time.  But a lot of the interface things for what Windows mobile like six point five did.  And as soon as they saw it, they're like, we got to start over.  There's a great book about that dogfight.  Oh, I love that book. Yes.  Good book. Yeah.

Start time: 1034.66
End time: 1057.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think both companies realized that in the there was collateral damage as always there is in this trial where because of discovery, you know, public is learning secrets about how the companies develop products,  what Apple's thoughts were and all that stuff.  And Apple is so secretive.  I was actually surprised that they pursued this as long as they don't need the half a billion dollars.  It's not like the money.

Start time: 1057.72
End time: 1065.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although it's funny to for you to read that quote again when to go back to 2011 when our 2010 or whenever when Apple only had 40 billion dollars in cash.

Start time: 1065.22
End time: 1112.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have 240 billion now or more.  Yeah, it hasn't hurt Apple's bottom line.  And but anyway, it's over and I think it's time to time to time to it's like the end of the Vietnam War.  Just time to move on and and think of other things.  I don't think lawsuits in Silicon Valley are really the right way to go.  Honestly, in the long run, speaking of lawsuits, I am not happy about a California law.  I'm sorry, a federal bill.  Let me get this story up.  I don't have the link here.  That just was proposed in the House of Representatives that would change the way patents work.  And this one is a little personal for me.  I do remember the podcast troll.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 1113.20
End time: 1113.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Start time: 1114.32
End time: 1138.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a story from this is actually from the Center for Protection of Intellectual Property, which is a conservative think tank that wants this bill to be passed.  The whole idea here was when was this a few years ago, there was a company down in Texas, a very popular place in Texas, East Texas, Tyler, Texas, Texas.  Yeah, where everybody sues patent.  All the patent.

Start time: 1139.08
End time: 1141.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we want patent trolls is kind of a weighty weighted weight.

Start time: 1143.94
End time: 1249.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll call them non practicing entities and patented.  Okay, okay.  Patent trolls.  They're the companies that don't actually make anything.  They're non practicing.  They buy the rights to products so that they can go around demanding royalties.  And there's a famous one that goes around to small businesses saying you have a copy machine.  Oh, we have the patent for copy machines.  You have to pay us to use your copy machine.  And these companies usually ask for such a small amount, only 10 or $20,000 that it's more expensive to say no than it is just to give them some money.  So there was a patent troll in Tyler, Texas that was doing this for podcasts.  As you remember, they went to Adam Corolla.  They went to a lot of podcasters.  They asked us for $2 million.  See, that was a strategic mistake, by the way, because if they'd asked us for $50,000, I might have said, well, better just to give them the money because it's going to cost me.  We got lawyers.  We found out it would cost a million dollars.  We'd have to go to Texas to defend.  And I was so incensed and they were asking so much.  I said, doesn't matter.  We're going to do it.  So we hired attorneys and everything.  Adam Corolla, you remember, had a crowdfunding campaign to raise money.  But what happened and what ended up destroying this company was the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  They did something that is still currently law, but that this new bill would overturn called an Interpartes appeal.  They go to the patent office and say, hey, dudes, I know you approved this patent many years ago, but you see how they're trying to apply it now.  Is it still a good patent?  And in the case of the podcast troll, they overturned it.  The Patent and Trademark Office said, no, no, that's ridiculous.  And that's a huge risk.

Start time: 1250.14
End time: 1256.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a huge risk when they do that, because if you lose that case, it's straightens the other party.  Right. Yeah.

Start time: 1257.62
End time: 1338.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because then you could say, well, see, the the patent office agreed that it's a good patent.  It's funny that you know this, Wesley, because that's exactly what our lawyers said.  Don't do that.  If you if you do that, you're running a huge risk.  So we didn't.  But we don't control the EFF.  And the EFF did.  And they you know, that's what EFF does.  I actually gave them several thousand dollars when they announced it.  I said, good, good luck.  And they won.  So this bill, the it's got a terrible name, too.  It's called let me let me let me find the name.  Representative Massey introduced this.  The Restoring America's Leadership in Innovation Act of 2018.  H.R. 6264.  It eliminates inter partes review.  It eliminates post grant review.  It eliminates any appeal.  Essentially, it is a bill clearly designed to support people who have patents, including patent trolls,  and to really reduce your ability to fight those trolls.  And it would have, in my opinion, exactly the opposite of supporting innovation.  Yeah, exactly.  Because it reminds me of Agit Pai.  Go ahead, Wesley.

All it really does is helps for people to file patent after patent after patents, you know, and then sit on it and either sell it to someone or do something else that doesn't actually, you know, encourage anyone to innovate.  Because I mean, the Samsung thing, as we were just talking about, I mean, I think we can we can talk that both companies were hurt in some ways by all this protracted legal stuff and that if we're honest, both, you know, yes, did Google steal blatantly from iOS?  Absolutely.  But has Apple also been able to steal blatantly some things from Google?  Yes.  And are we as consumers, is the world better for both?  Yes.  You know, and in keeping things, you know, in a way where you can sue someone for something like a podcast or, you know, there was a there was early on there was a patent troll who was trying to sue anybody who was doing anything in the app store and trying to claim that if you were selling a mobile app that that you were violating their patent.  And Apple actually stood up and said, OK, we'll fight these companies.  But I knew a number of independent developers who were contacted by that, you know, in PD and were, you know, worried and didn't know what to do.  And if Apple hadn't stepped in and said, we'll take care of the legal things that would just encourage people not to make apps, which is hardly encouraging innovation.

Those guys also were put out of business by appealing to the patent office, a defense that would disappear if this bill passed.  So I don't know.  I mean, you might as well call it the Patent Troll Act of 2018.  I have no idea how likely it is to pass.  But if you if you if you're talking to your congress critter anyway, you might mention H.R. 62 64 and say, I don't think that's a good idea either.

But yeah, I mean, you could make a strong case that one of the reasons we have patent trolls is because of software patents.  Let's take a little bit of break.  There's lots more to talk about.  Apple says it's rebuilding maps from the ground up.  Dr. Dre owes its ex-partner, the Beats partner, the guy who invented Beats, $25 million.  Are you wearing Beats?  No, those aren't Beats.  All right.  I had a check.  They're very cool looking.  All right.  Those are nice looking headphones.  Foxconn finally breaks ground on its Wisconsin plant.  And a whole lot more.  But first, a word from Rocket Mortgage.  Actually, you've heard me talk about Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  And they've got a new thing that's really cool.  They're going up.  And there's a lot of unpredictability when you buy a home and you get a home loan these days.  That's causing a lot of anxiety.  And our friends at Quicken Loans don't like anxiety.  They don't want you to be nervous.  So they've created something they call the power buying process.  Quicken Loans, this is how it works.  We'll verify your income assets and credit.  They'll do that in less than 24 hours.  Once you get verified approval, it basically gives you the strength of a cash buyer.  Once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  They'll lock up your rate for 90 days while you shop.  You have 90 days at guaranteed rate.  But here's the best part.  If rates go up, your rate stays the same.  It doesn't change.  If rates go down, your rate also drops.  So it's locked in as a maximum, but it could even go down.  This protects you.  It means you have 90 days to find that home and not have to worry about shifting interest rates.  It's of course exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from America's best and largest mortgage lender.  All you have to do is go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to rate shield approvals only valid on some 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.

And then the rates that the increases keep happening so much that a place that was valued at 450,000  ten years ago is easily over a million now.  And and so people who bought places right after the financial crisis, right after the real estate bust,  can't afford to move because they could never afford the place that they're in now.  So it's one of those types of things.  And then and then you have a lot of foreign buyers who come in and pay cash.  So even if you have a mortgage, even if you're able to get a loan, you're oftentimes, you know,  undercut, you're oftentimes like someone swoops in and will pay cash.  And so it can be hard even for people who have the money to find a place.  It's it's it's kind of bad.

And so there's less properties available.  When we moved out of a townhouse about four years ago, they tore down some small houses next to it.  They probably would have sold for one hundred and twenty five thousand.  They were little shacks essentially and built condo and built townhouses next to us that were eight hundred thousand dollars.

We you know, Amazon bought Ring and one of our sponsors for more than a billion, I think.  And Apple bought Texture for four hundred million dollars, another one of our sponsors.

Transcript:  Yeah. From your mouth to whoever to to John Doar's ear.  Amazon buying PillPack is the strongest indication yet of Amazon's interest in pushing into health care.  As you know, they announced a partnership with Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan to do a health insurance company.  Oh, it's just for Amazon employees right now.  They have they were applying for pharmacy licenses all around the country about a year or two ago.  Now they don't need to because they've got PillPack.  PillPack. Yep.

Start time: 2040.40
End time: 2083.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they're going to get a ton of information from this acquisition because they'll get insights of what the negotiated rates for all the insurers are on drugs.  Yeah. Which is going to inform their play.  They're going to get a more accurate count of households because like if my grandmother lives with me and I get the medication sent here, they'll know who because, you know, the names are tied to the medications, even for kids, even for people who are older.  They'll get all that information.  And also, PillPack doesn't just do prescriptions.  They do vitamins and over the counter drugs.  That's right.  So they'll be able to get a scrape off all that with their leverage buying power and be able to make even more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you think about it, too, it means so, you know, the CBS at a deal, right?  Like that, that's a big one.  And that was seen in some ways as kind of anticipating Amazon getting more into both prescriptions and health care.  And, you know, not all drugs can have, you know, online or by mail prescriptions, but increasingly that's becoming an option.  And in fact, some insurers will even penalize you if you don't do a by mail prescription, if you actually go to a pharmacy.  I know that when I was with United Health Care, they had I had to like opt into a thing to be able to use an actual pharmacy.  They really wanted me to to send stuff in the mail.  And so, you know, you can see Amazon's not an insurer yet, but you can see them probably getting the data like like Wesley saying, like being able to get have all that that accurate information to then make direct deals with the insurers and other things and also start to anticipate.  You know, if they're ever able to cohabitate, like, you know, where your prime now stuff is, you can just imagine, you know, in a few years being able to do a prime now to get your your prescription delivered to you.

Because now they actually have retail space.  So before, you know, that was the big thing with Amazon is they didn't have.  Yeah, they might have their own pop ups.  But now I'm not saying that every Whole Foods will have a pharmacy or a pill pack counter in it.

And PILPAC has a certain amount of lock in because they renew the prescriptions automatically.  They send you the prescriptions once you're once you're in the system.  It's kind of it's just, you know, inertia alone will keep you as customer.  So it's a good move on Amazon's part.

Transcript:  Like, but I mean, it just it seems like Amazon's I mean, look, first of all, Jeff Bezos, richest man in the world, his not stated goal, but it's pretty obvious.  His goal is to take us a fraction of all financial transactions across the board.  You know, just give me one percent of everything that goes on and I'll be happy.  And he's moving very closely, very quickly into that.  We know that Amazon, when it enters a market, depresses the market for every other company in that market and and really changed first publishing.  I mean, that's the best.  The best example is how many cities don't have bookstores anymore.  If you're if you're a book publisher, you hate Amazon because you no longer control the price of your products.  If you're an author, you might love Amazon because you don't need a publisher anymore.  They've completely changed how books work.  And I imagine every market that they enter, this is going to happen.  At what point?  This is what worries me.  Does Amazon become the company store?  You know, that that old song, Oh, must all do the company store where this is you just buy everything from Amazon and nothing.  No other retailers exist.  For many people, it already is.  Yeah, I buy everything from Amazon.  Same.

Start time: 2420.00
End time: 2528.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I buy everything from Amazon.  And I mean, I think you I mean, I think what you're saying is absolutely accurate.  I guess my only pushback on that would be I think you could have said the same thing about Wal-Mart a decade ago.  And in fact, still in many small towns, you know, Wal-Mart came in after, you know, there's mining places or manufacturing left and, you know, huge super stores came up and everyone worked there.  Everyone got their health insurance there.  You know, that was everyone.  You spent their paycheck there.  It was literally the place where you work and you end up spending all your money, which to me is actually a little bit more insidious than what Amazon's doing.  But you know, but Wal-Mart was was trying that model first.  Amazon's the big innovation is the distribution and the fact that they now have the, you know, the couriers and the delivery and just the huge number of warehouses.  But yeah, I mean, I think I think it's a valid thing to ask is that they literally are kind of touching every aspect of everything.  I think that it's interesting you've seen like with bookstores, the first people that really kind of put the small independent bookstores out of business were Barnes & Noble and Borders.  And it was the huge super bookstores that had the cut down prices.  And then it was, you know, some of them were part of leveraged buyouts.  Some of them had bad real estate deals, whatever.  They couldn't keep up with the demand.  And, you know, people moved to other methods.  And then, you know, Borders went out of business.  Barnes & Nobles, you know, closes down certain stores.  But you did then do kind of see this resurgence in certain pockets of markets, certainly not everywhere of, you know, the independent places cropping up again.  And so I wonder, like, I'm not trying to defend Amazon, but I do wonder how much of it is on Amazon and how much of it is a combination of Amazon.  And really what Amazon benefited from was the huge big box explosion of the 90s in the early 2000s that they're just riding that wave and taking it to the next level.  You know, but I write off Wal-Mart.

Start time: 2537.60
End time: 2601.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you don't write them off, but it's certainly different.  Right. And I think that, you know, it's interesting when you look at what Wal-Mart's doing in terms of e-commerce.  Let's look at certain markets like New York.  And if you actually look at their acquisition strategy, it's really interesting because they're going after brands that are completely 180 from what the Wal-Mart brand is.  So you do a Bonn post. They bought Moose Jaw, Polyvore.  They bought Jet even.  They just started this new pilot program kind of subscription service thing for rich people in New York.  The irony there is that Wal-Mart is not allowed to operate in New York City because the city council and the public will not allow it.  So they literally cannot have a store in New York City.  So if you want to go to Wal-Mart and you're in Manhattan, you have to go to Jersey or you have to go to like Long Island.  So but the brand has a totally different connotation.  I think that that's honestly probably where Amazon is the most disastrous to Wal-Mart is that their brand doesn't really have any sort of, I guess, kind of value or I guess.

Like, you know, famously, they'd really gone after the South and had always kind of eschewed large cities because they didn't really like those markets and they didn't want the unions.  They didn't want to pay the wages.  For me, that's not honestly my biggest concern with Amazon isn't so much that they become the company store where that's where we get everything.  But what does this do to the wages and the labor situation of the people who work there, especially their contractors?

Transcript:  And particularly one of the things that they're trying to leverage is the whole notion of combining online with a physical presence.  If you go into you buy something online from Amazon, I mean, from Wal-Mart, you can then the next day or even the same day go into the store and pick it up in Houston.  They've got several stores that have set up these kind of towers in the middle of the store.  And rather than going up and waiting in line to pick up your online item, you walk up, there's a kiosk, you put your name in and a code and the door pops open.  And there's your there's your the item that you bought online.  So it's very frictionless.  They're experimenting with all kinds of things.  And they you know, while it's probably an uphill battle in terms of catching online commerce mind share, they are I think they're putting up a very smart fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Wal-Mart has made their much of their money on having the cheapest price.  And that does not make people feel loyal to that brand because they'll just go where the cheapest price is just Wal-Mart usually has the cheapest price.  That's an excellent point.  What Wal-Mart really should do is lean hard into what Amazon is not known for, which is their people.  So the experience at Wal-Mart is also bad.  And that is something that they really should scale, making sure that when people go into the store, that it's a really good experience.  Wal-Mart's complete strategy is to drive more people into the store, even their online.  Their online presence is to try to force people to do the order online, pick it up at the store.  And when they pick up the store, they don't pick up in the front of the store.  You have to go all the way in the back.  So you have to walk completely through the store, then walk all the way back through the store on the way out so that you can so they could pick up all those other port purchases.  So like all those impulse buys at the register, you'll want to get one of those or, oh, I need to get toilet paper while I'm also picking this up.  So their whole drive is to get people to go through the store.  And so they get those additional purchases.  So that's interesting.

Transcript:  Here in Houston, the pickup thing is right up front.  So when you walk in, it's right there in front of you.  Well, that's smart.  Are you happy?

Transcript:  I'll just say here, isn't that the advantage of Amazon is maybe it's just going on my curmudgeon.  There's no people involved.  There's no contact with humans.  I kind of like that.

Start time: 2808.06
End time: 2812.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although sometimes you do want that, you know, or if you're wanting to make a return or something.  But Amazon's customer service is pretty good.

Start time: 2813.20
End time: 2850.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, I think about this a good conversation.  What is the future of retail?  Is there a future for brick and mortar retail?  Is it is you know, I've thought maybe that and I think you see this a little bit in some areas downtown Petaluma.  You know, retail is dying.  The places that survive are places that provide more experiential.  Yeah.  You know, you're not just there to get a product.  And as to your point, Wesley, you're not there to save money.  You're but you're there for an experience.  Movie theaters are trying to do that too, to get people back into the movie theater, which is really dying.  Is that what is the future of retail look like?  Yeah, I think that's part of it.

Start time: 2851.28
End time: 2864.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I also think what's interesting is you've seen this kind of shift where you have companies like Warby Parker and Casper and other things that are known for being online.  And then they set up stores where people go and can actually see them in person.  Both sponsors probably both about to be acquired by Amazon.

Start time: 2866.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably.

Start time: 2868.10
End time: 2875.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, but it's one of those interesting things of there's a term for it, like showcasing or something like that.  Show rooming.

Start time: 2877.12
End time: 2900.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show rooming.  Yes. This is actually in the I'm told in the Torah, it is it's considered a sin.  It's called the shopkeeper's law that if you go into a shop and you get the shopkeeper to help you understand a purchase and choose a product and then go out and buy it somewhere else, that's a sin.  That's what people do all the time.  Now they show room and then they go buy on Amazon.  Yeah, totally.

Start time: 2901.86
End time: 2942.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then but what's interesting is you see these brands and these companies that are primarily online who are now opening up pop ups or small places where just to do that, where a lot of times you have to actually still order it online.  But before you make you know, before you buy a mattress, before you buy a sound system, before you buy, you know, certain other things, it does help if you can see it in person.  And so maybe there's some sort of hybrid, you know, kind of show rooming model.  I don't know.  But I think experiential, that makes a lot of sense.  The problem with that is it doesn't scale.  You know, I think that works for certain types of products.  Yeah, it is expensive.  And also you have to kind of you have a certain type of customer who's going to want to pay more for that experience.  Leslie, did you ever go to the Austin Whole Foods?

Start time: 2943.62
End time: 2945.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2946.00
End time: 2986.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's awesome.  It's awesome. And during the Christmas season, they do a temporary ice skating rink right in front.  Oh, my God.  They have they have a wine tasting bar.  They have a car charger.  So if you have an electric vehicle, you can charge there.  They want the upscale trade, don't they?  And then on the corporate offices are on top and in the back, they have a culinary like a chef.  Cooking lessons.  So you can learn how to cook better, of course, using their products.  It's a great place. It's an amazing place.  So if you have it, if you go to Austin, I would definitely go to the headquarters.

Start time: 2986.54
End time: 2996.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was wondering if that maybe was one of the reasons Amazon was interested in Whole Foods is this whole idea of experiential shopping.  But it doesn't doesn't scale very well.

Start time: 2996.30
End time: 3024.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And everybody who works there is super smart.  You ask about a product, they can tell you where it is.  They can tell you why it's better than the one next to it.  They they really do that well.  And and Walmart really should do that.  I've gone through many Walmarts and it's it's always been no one knows where things are.  Things are falling off into the aisle.  It takes forever to get cleaned up and no one knows how much things cost and they just scan it and move on.

Start time: 3024.26

Start time: 3063.02

Start time: 3068.55
End time: 3109.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we do.  We have the Nordstrom.  It's that as a Nordstrom alkylite who missed it very much in New York.  I was very happy with that.  But yeah, no, I unfortunately haven't been to a Walmart in so long.  I, you know, I've obviously been to them in the south, but it's been a long time since I've been to a Walmart.  But yeah, I feel like one of the big advantages they have that Amazon slowly is encroaching on is the fact that if you need something, you can go get it.  That's that's the one thing that brick and mortar still kind of has going for it.  But I think it's hard, especially for for big ticket items where people will just go and look at it in person if they need to see it.  Or increasingly, they just learn to trust online reviews.  Yeah.

Start time: 3110.08
End time: 3187.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a lot easier to find to choose a product on Amazon because you can read all the reviews.  In some ways, there's reverse showing showrooming going on.  If you I wanted to get a picnic basket, I could have gone down to, you know, Williams Sonoma and bought an eighty dollar hundred eighty dollar picnic basket, but I just bought one for fifty bucks on Amazon.  They get good reviews.  On the other hand, I wanted to give my son Anthony Bourdain's book.  When Bourdain passed away, I went to the bookstore about a week later.  The guy said, oh, yeah, we're all sold out.  Yeah, you get a run on it.  I said, and I thought if if he said, I can order it for you, I said, yeah, I can order it.  I can get it faster on Amazon.  If I were a bookstore, I would have 100.  I would I would go I would buy them from Amazon.  I would get a hundred cases of that because, you know, there's demand, right?  You got it.  I think retail's got to start getting smarter if they're going to succeed against Amazon.  That's for sure.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And honestly, I'll answer my own question.  I think it's all over.  I think Amazon is going to just dominate completely.  I really do.  Let's take a little break from the tech burger.  It's Dwight Silverman used.  Do you do your radio show still, Dwight, or have you stopped doing that?

And that's the thing is that it's like my now that like it used to be I could get around it for work reasons because it was work to have the beta on my phone.  Or I would have a secondary phone on loan that would have it.  Now I get concerned. I'm like, okay, I need my phone, you know, for my two factor often for certain other things.  And so I get concerned with the betas.  But I have played with it and other people's devices.  Actually, Jeremy Boogle from Emojipedia.  Oh, Jeremy's great. I love him.  Yeah. Isn't he the best? When I was in London a couple of weeks ago, he created an emoji for me and I love it.

Transcript:  I mean, without a doubt, like anybody who I think tries to claim otherwise.  I mean, look, they would not do what they've done, which is to basically acknowledge the issue, even though I have some problems with, you know, some of the I guess terms and conditions of getting repair.  But they wouldn't be doing that going all the way back to the 2015 MacBook if there was not something.  But yeah, no, I mean, I haven't experienced it myself.  I did manage to get cookie crumbs from an air from an exploded airline cookie in the lightning courts.  I mean, I'm good at all.  Yeah, I'll find the tweet and send it and put it on Twitter because it was funny.  Compressed air. It was fine.  But I was then very concerned.

I just I had to.  Not that it'll charge for it.  Oh, you don't even want to know.  You don't even. It depends. For one thing, it's getting harder to find them.  So the price is starting to go up.  The one I got was I don't even want to admit it.  Two hundred dollars. But it's not it will never wear out.  Right. I mean, this keyboard is is give you a dongle.  No, because it's a PS2 keyboard.  So you have to buy a PS2 to USB adapter. He sells them.  Sixteen bucks. Yeah.  He does go as low as he's having a sale on some Model M's from 91,  but they don't have a cable. So that's kind of not good.  That's one hundred sixty five dollars.  But I mean, the guy actually I feel like it's a good price because he's got to buy the keyboard.  He literally takes it apart, cleans it. He replaced screws.  I mean, there were rivets. He put screws in instead.  He puts a lot of work into this. So it's kind of a labor of love.  This is the one. It's awesome.  This is the one. Honestly, honestly, two hundred dollars is a lot.

And when you press the thing down, you know how the spring goes like this, this is and then deforms.  And that's when it clicks and makes the contact.  So you're deforming a spring every time you're typing a key.  Kind of crazy. But this is how this is why I can't use a MacBook Pro.

Transcript:  I mean, like when I was first reviewing the MacBook both in 2015 and 2016, I thought it was a little shallow and I didn't love it on the MacBook Pro with the touch bar.  I actually felt like it anyway.  I think it's just a you know, an illusion, but it feels like you have a little more travel.  And I like that. Fine.  Do I prefer the older chiclet MacBook keyboards?  Yes, but I didn't have an issue with it.  What I have an issue with is is them not working and a piece of dust being able to force someone to have to be without their computer for a week because the entire bottom portion has to be replaced, which is just insane.

Transcript:  Yes.  And, you know, who used to make a really good, loud clicky keyboard was Compaq here in Houston.  And I had been to their factory.  They showed me how they did the testing on it.  And and I like theirs because theirs was actually like a little louder than the IBM.  I like that a lot.  I don't.  You know, my wife has I have the previous generation design MacBook Pro and I love it.  My wife has the newest one and she likes the keyboard.  But I think there's this constant anxiety because is it going to happen now?  Right.  You know, is it going to go out now?  We have a friend who lives in Mexico who bought the form of the first versions of the MacBook that had it.  And almost immediately her space bar had this problem.  Well, and the issue is Mexico was a problem.

Start time: 4145.48
End time: 4160.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the issue is like on the model, you could pry off the keycaps, you could blow air into it and all that stuff.  These keyboards were not really designed to be repaired at all.  And in many cases, Apple just actually swaps out the whole top part of the computer.  That's why it's a seven.  They did with her.

Start time: 4161.16
End time: 4165.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, especially something like the keyboard.  And to be clear, the earlier models were not the easiest to repair.  So if you go back, like, I guess, to like the like the 2010 MacBook Pros and the ones earlier than that, those you could kind of remove the keys from if you needed to.  Although it was very easy to break.  But the ones from kind of like the 2013 2012 onward, you can definitely like the MacBook Airs.  You can definitely break that if you are trying to replace a keycap yourself.  But it's not going to require what the new ones do.  And to me, I mean, like I get the, you know, aesthetic for thinness and wanting to have, you know, the solid piece of aluminum and all that.  But as you say, Leo, like it, you do have to question the design because this isn't something that is never going to need repairing.  This is a keyboard.  You know, it's one of the most probably I would think most that in the in the screen and maybe some of the internal components are probably, you know, the top three things that are that get repaired on a MacBook.  You know, most people who are bringing it in, I would say the keyboard, regardless of what year you have is probably one of the more common issues that people have with with any laptop.  And so to make it so that you can't even do it in store, you literally have to ship it off.  That that's what's ridiculous to me.

Start time: 4249.78
End time: 4272.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all companies, all PC manufacturers, they do this durability testing where, like, if you're making chairs, you have this artificial butt that just mashes down on the same thing with the keyboards.  They do these to see how long it'll go before you mean time to failure.  They test all this.  And so I don't see how they did not pick this up in testing way before the public did.

Start time: 4274.42
End time: 4345.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the only thing I can gather is that they just, you know, when they were doing their testing in their labs or whatever, you know, they don't have dust.  They don't have cookies.  Right.  That's right.  But even if it's not cookies, you know, which like even if it's just regular stuff, I mean, just in the course of using it, that it can happen.  And it's one of those things that I've talked to people who are ridiculously anal retentive with their devices who have had the issue.  I've talked to people who, you know, don't care and haven't had the issue.  I mean, so it seems to kind of be willy nilly.  But the fact that, you know, a speck of dust can do it.  The fact that I mean, what was so funny to me and it was Casey Johnson who really made this story what it is and the outline when she pointed to that help document that Apple has where they like show how you can take a can of compressed air and like spray and like, you know, like a deformation.  There's a special angle and a special movement.  When I saw that, I was like, OK, I'm an Apple stan.  I'm somebody who will carry water and like will defend the company a lot, even though I obviously don't work for them or any of that.  But I'm looking at that.  I'm like rolling my eyes.  I'm like, are you serious?  If that's in your help docs, that's something you actually have to put in your documentation.  That's a problem.  Like that to me is acknowledgement of a design problem.  If you've got to actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Wesley, you're right.  I mean, we may actually learn that Apple knew because there's three class action lawsuits and really the kind of the critical key to the suits is did Apple know about this before they released it?  Because that's when they really could be there could be some serious damages if they knew about this ahead of time.  So I'm sure that's one of the things that's going to be a big issue in discovery.

Start time: 4369.76
End time: 4381.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, my guess is they did, but they figured it was too late to change the design.  And so they like we can't miss the ship date, so we have to go.  Someone someone's higher up said, let's ship it to ship it.

Transcript:  There's enough like transitioning from I worked at this company that I worked at this way now ended up at Apple that someone would change those practices.

Transcript:  Yeah, I fix it.  Kyle Weins, the founder of I fix it, who also a sponsor of ours and I and we love Kyle says it's design anorexia.  He said, making a product slimmer and slimmer at the cost of usefulness, functionality, serviceability and the environment is just not right.  They did. They really did some stuff.  They took a key cap.  They injected a grain of sand and they showed how even a tiny little grain of sand can block the action of the key, how it's impossible even with compressed air to get it out.  It wedges under the butterfly lever, preventing it from depressing.  And with the space bar, particularly, there's no way to remove the key cap without breaking it.  You have it.  Well, the space bar will break.  And oh, and here's the worst part.  When they designed it this way, they glued the battery to the keyboard.  That when they designed the Retina MacBook Pro, the Macbook, the battery is glued to the keyboard.  So you can't just replace the keyboard.  You have to replace a big chunk of that.  That's why it's so expensive.  And they knew about it.  He says, you know, we knew us immediately when we tested it.  We downgraded Apple from a seven out of 10 repairability score to a two, which is in fact the subsequent update went down to a one out of 10, the lowest a notebook had ever earned at that point.  Finally, at the end, he says, you know, I should really look at some Dell or HP laptops.  They're making some very good stuff that's repairable.  Kyle's always been an advocate for consumers and the ability to repair stuff.

Transcript:  No, no, he has.  And he's been really kind of leading the whole, you know, right to repair stuff and all of those things.  And obviously, they're guides.  I mean, I think we all love them from the gadget porn perspective of seeing, you know, how they're taken apart, what it's made of.  But it's also really good for consumers.  And as you're pointing out earlier, your friend in Mexico, you know, who makes it very difficult to get to an official Apple repair place.  Like, it's not just people wanting to be cheaper doing it themselves.  It's that Apple doesn't have service centers that are accessible everywhere.  And if you've got something like a keyboard, that's a real problem.

Transcript:  A jury on Wednesday found that Dr. Dre, Jimmy Iovine, both of whom became Apple employees when Apple bought Beats and Beats Electronics, owe a former partner $25.2 million in royalties.  Steven Lamar and his company, Jive Audio, the suit said that Lamar came to Dr. Dre in 2006 with the idea for celebrity endorsed headphones.  He got royalties, but only for the first Beats headphone.  But now the jury says, no, no, you owe him a little more.  You owe, you owe.  He said, I want $130 million.  But the jury said, well, $25 million now.  And as sales continue, you'll get some of that as well.  So Apple did not respond.  But, you know, Apple can afford $25 million.

And I think they tried to or something like that.  Although I think what happened there was it was just really bad business decisions all the way around.  But that's what I'd assumed it was.  It was with the, you know, monster made the first Beats headphones.

Transcript:  Yeah. No, they, you know, did a lot of the design and some of the other things, somebody that they hired, I guess, anyway, did the design.  And then Dre and Beats or Dre and Iovine, you know, had an ownership stake.  Then HTC bought an ownership stake.  Then I mean, bought it back.  And then they ended up buying all of Monster out basically.  And so then when the company sold to Apple, you know, obviously, Noel Lee was very, very upset.  There was a there's like a great classic Gizmodo story from Sam.  I can't think of the last name.  Biddle.  Biddle. Yes. Sam Biddle wrote like before the Apple thing happened about the whole saga, which is fascinating.  But that's what I'd assumed it was about.  So I'd forgotten that there was another company before they approached Monster.  It was involved in this. Yeah.

Apple breaking ground, Foxconn, rather, breaking ground on a plant in Wisconsin.  Remember, they had pledged what was 30 billion dollars to President Trump.  This is a 10 billion dollar factory.  They say will create thousands of jobs.  It'll manufacture LCD screen panels.  For TVs. Yeah, ironically.  Not for iPhones, but for Sharp, which which Foxconn owns.  And they also own a significant stake of Vizio.  And that's where the panels will go.

Yeah. And then at the signing at the ceremony, Trump said that it'll bring 12,000 jobs.  And when he tweeted it out, he said 15,000 jobs.  It's a lot of jobs.  But if you go back to last year, it's supposed to be 3000.  It's growing.  It's just like it's so they're inflating this at the same time.  Harley is like losing right there.  They're reducing their their their workforce there.  And so I think there's a lot of eyes on this for this to be a win.  And they keep blowing up the numbers.

This actually felt like, OK, you guys tell me.  Matthew Panzerino, who is a tech crunch reporter, but also I think beloved by Apple, got a scoop  that really basically is a PR release from Apple saying Apple Maps is going to be so great.  It's going to be so good.  They're rebuilding maps.  It for a long time, maps used other companies map data, TomTom and others.  Apple is for the first time going to be using first party data gathered by this.  I thought this was interesting.  iPhones like you and me.  Oh, but it's a privacy first methodology and its own fleet of cars, kind of like Google's Street View cars.  The new product will launch in the San Francisco in the Bay Area soon, I guess, with the iOS 12 beta.  I haven't tried it yet and will cover Northern California by fall.  But this is a long piece on the remaking of Apple Maps, which sounds to me almost like the Apple Apology Tour for the Mac Pro,  which Matthew was also a part of.

Start time: 4906.20
End time: 4972.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, it makes a lot of sense because Apple increasingly is trying to own its own data.  It's trying to own all of the components for the iPhone.  And I think that it sees it knows the value in mapping.  And so while yet maybe a press release, I think it's a really interesting press release and one that kind of shows that what they want to do is maintain a lot of control over that.  I mean, that's a really valuable thing to have that kind of location data.  And they're finally making use in the same way Android does this with with Google Maps.  They use that data from Android in the same way.  So I think it's a it's a smart move by Apple and hopefully it will make maps better.  I started I put a radio in my car that uses CarPlay and I've started using Apple Maps exclusively when I'm in my car just to make to see how good it is.  And it's it's on a par in terms of directions in the places I go with Google Maps.  So I think it is it has gotten better.  And hopefully this this will help, too.

I can't even read this with a straight face.  It makes no sense.  We collect data when we do it in an anonymous fashion, but we don't collect data.  But when we do it, we do it in an anonymous fashion in subsections of the whole.  But we don't collect data so we couldn't even say there's a person that went from point A to point B.  We're collecting segments of it.  I don't know.

Transcript:  Also, I can appreciate what they're saying for privacy reasons, and I get that that's a sales pitch and for some people it's a value add.  But the reason that Google Maps has been good for so long, and I kind of went on a mini Twitter, kind of not rant, but kind of had a thread about it, was because Google's been doing this for a decade, right?  They were in...  And they don't hide it, by the way.

Start time: 5087.46
End time: 5180.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. But what I'm saying, though, is that part of the reason Google is so good is not just that they had the cars going around.  A, they had for many, many years, they closed it a number of years ago, but they had an open mapmaker data where anyone could kind of plot their own areas.  And that was hugely beneficial in areas like parts of the world that had never had updated mapping and where the existing third party data didn't exist.  So you had people who would update things automatically.  And then they started gathering really early on, even before the iPhone.  And I think actually from the iPhone, I think that was one of the reasons why Apple dropped Google Maps from the from the default thing was that they were grabbing information from users and enabled to kind of build that into their whole systems.  And so that's one of the reasons why, frankly, it's so much better.  You know, and but you're right, there is a kind of a lot of fuzziness of, OK, well, how much data are you collecting?  And the part of me is like, well, I appreciate that you're not collecting my data or so you claim.  But if you're collecting part of it and if this is all going to be anonymized, I'd really rather not be stuck on an access road where we have to go and reverse a mile because the Apple Maps directions to get to the lake took us through this place where, yes, we did.  Actually, this is a true story.  This was happened last Fourth of July.  We had to go and reverse a mile on like a back road kind of thing because it took us a very wrong route.  And now I don't know. Google wasn't much better, but it was better.  And this is kind of like the mountains kind of part of Washington state, which isn't well mapped by any of these companies.  But the Apple Maps was particularly egregious in that case.

Transcript:  You know, I almost prefer Google's system where you can you can go to Google.com dashboard.  You can see all the data they've collected.  There's a button that you turn off location history.  So you have a choice.  But but I have it on because I think it's useful.  And if it helps them make maps more power to them, I can I just looked on Tuesday.  This is my this is what I did Tuesday, February 6, 2016.  This is exactly all the places I went.  Here's the map of it.  You can even do a playback and watch it move around.  And they I know was on a bicycle.  I just picked this at random.  I even have Google's picked the pictures I took when I was doing this.  And you can delete it.  You can have Google not collected.  But at least they tell you Apple is like, well, we don't if we don't collect data.  But if we did, it wouldn't be very much data.  But they don't they don't give you the option to say no, they don't.  I guess they do in location history.  But I would I almost prefer the upfrontness of Google on all this.  I don't think it's so bad.

They know you're at your destination.  You pull into the street, you speed up, you get past, you know, 25 miles an hour.  And they go, OK, now they're traveling.  Take data, take data.  And and that's when and and for a map, that's the important thing.  You want to know the route.  You don't necessarily need to know the A to B.  And so that actually makes a lot of sense.

And wait until you hear the deal we've got for you today.  An online retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  Casper really started this trend.  They realized that the markup, the middleman markup at a mattress store is so absurd that they could revolutionize the industry by just getting rid of resellers.  And selling directly to you.  And what an amazing solution that's been.  And you do save.  The original Casper mattress is an obsessively engineered mattress at a fair price.  Combining multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with just the right sink, just the right bounce.  Plus, it's breathable design lets you sleep cool on a hot summer night like tonight.  You will be so happy you have a Casper mattress.  You just regulate your temperature the night.  You're very cool.  Long lasting comfort, long lasting support.  You can buy it online.  And as I always tell you, it's completely risk free because you get 100 days.  So instead of lying on a mattress in a showroom, you can lie on it, experience the mattress in real life in your house for 100 days.  If at any time you say, it's not right for me, you call them, they'll take it back, refund you every penny.  And they'll take care of it.  Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards you know.  Because when you open the box, it smells fresh and clean.  There's no, you know, some mattresses, you've got to air them out, not the Casper.  They're always made in the USA.  Free shipping and returns in the US, in Canada, and in the UK.  Get a Casper mattress today for a limited time.  Get this.  We've never had a deal this good.  Save up to $225 off your order by visiting casper.com slash savings.  This is limited time.

We thank them so much for their support.  I'm so tired talking about Facebook, but I'm going to just bring this up because there's another, you know,  if you ever take one of those, you know, which Game of Thrones character are you quizzes, those personality tests,  nametests.com, which Disney princess are you, Christina?  nametests.com, the website behind the quizzes, apparently had a flaw that publicly exposed information  from 120 million monthly users, even if you deleted the app.  Nice.  Even if you deleted the app.  This is a Medium article by Inti.  I'm going to mispronounce your name, Inti.  Inti de Suclair, who discovered this, by the way, he is Jasmine.  That's his Disney princess.  But discovered this that in the URL that is sent, it's all public.  It's all unencrypted.  Any third party could request it.  And it's been going on for years.  This is just one more fabulous way.  I, you asked me, Wesley, before the show, what my current Facebook status is.  It changes all the time.  It's complicated.  But right now I'm deactivated because I just, I just.  I just, I have one more.

Transcript:  That's a really good point, Wesley, because there's a lot of effort to shut people like this down.  Like, oh, he's a hacker.  He got $8,000 donated it to the Freedom of the Press Foundation.  So that's good.  Now, we don't know that nobody got it, but just that this was fixed before it was published.  But that doesn't mean other people hadn't discovered it and didn't say anything about it.  But yes, good point, Wesley.  Hi, NT. Thank you for confirming the fix.  So they got a nice little bounty.  He got $4,000 and then they matched it and donated a total of 8,000 to the Freedom of the Press Foundation.  Nice.  He says, I have no idea.

Equifax asked the engineer to design a site for a company, some other company that had a data breach to help customers find out.  He started designing the site and he said, this is not for some other company. This is for Equifax.  So he shorted the stock.  And when Equifax then a week or two later announced it, he made $35,000.  He's in trouble.  The CFO, you know, these things happen.  By the way, has Equifax ever been punished, fined or in any way dinged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, we kind of have to at this point, is this reality.  We have to accept reality.  Reality number one is that your Facebook data has been breached in some way because of either something you've done or more likely because of something that one of your friends or someone that you added to your friends list is done.  The number two thing is that your social security number is public because of all the numerous breaches and because Equifax is such a show.  There's a word before that that I can't say on on Twitter.  So yeah, as sad as it is, I almost have just been like, yeah, I will likely be the victim of identity theft.  We all will have those that have to watch our credit reports for the rest of our lives.  It kind of points out how bad and dumb credit reports are in general.  And I kind of feel like maybe this would be a good time to just kind of reset the whole system.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Equifax says we've spent or will have spent two hundred seventy five million dollars in remediation.  I'm sure they're going to get a nice tax write off for that.  And I know they're making money because one of the things they offered everybody is free credit monitoring.  But it was only for a year. And then I'm sure it automatically renews.  And you're paying Equifax now to keep an eye on your on your credit report.  So I'm sure they made more than they than they lost.  It's a good you know, you could try to try the data breach technique.  Bruce Schneier, good, good article on his blog, Manipulative Social Media Practices.  He calls out a Norwegian Consumer Council report.  This stuff has to be that we have to research this in Norway.  The executive summary Facebook and Google have privacy intrusive defaults where users who want the privacy friendly option have to go through a significantly longer process.  They even obscure some of these settings that the user cannot know that more privacy intrusive option was preselected.  The pop ups from Facebook, Google and Windows 10 have design symbols and wording.  This is really interesting that nudge consumers away from the privacy friendly choices.  Choices are worded to compel users to make certain choices while key information is omitted or downplayed.  None of them lets the user freely postpone decisions.  Decide now. You have to decide now.  Also, Facebook and Google threaten users with loss of functionality or deletion of the user account if the user does not choose the privacy intrusion intrusive option.

And, you know, just just add that to your that I mean, we know about this from A B testing that you can be kind of coerced without your knowledge into clicking a certain choice.  The colors, the shapes of the buttons, the verbiage all can contribute to kind of pushing you in the direction that you may not even.

Transcript:  That's exactly right.  And in terms of ads, Facebook gets paid per click or per per view.  They want to have that engagement.  So when someone clicks on an ad, they get that money.  So they're not going to encourage people to see, for instance, this is how you opt out of seeing these ads.  This is how you see more ads.  They want you to lean the other way around.  It's in their best interest.  And that's why when people said there's going to be transparency and advertising, you have to go up to the hamburger menu and click and then find and go down and figure out how you're targeted.  They want you to go through all these steps.  But if you wanted to buy that product, there's a buy button right at the bottom.  It's just how they make it.  Why not? Why not?

Start time: 6141.29

Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter has now an ad transparency center ads dot twitter dot com slash transparency.  When you search for any advertiser, you can see all the ads that are currently running on Twitter, including promoted only tweets or if an ad was suspended and why.  This is a response to dark ads where a company buys ads, but only the people who are targeted by those ads can see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you can.  Facebook just did something similar with their video ads anyway.  I know that some people were mad because they're like, oh, no, your competitors can see what your ads are.  I'm like, well, if your ad is that like if your idea is that hidden, like, you know, like I think you're you've got bigger problems if someone's seeing your ad is going to make them steal it.

Start time: 6181.04
End time: 6193.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I think Twitter says like seven days of history.  Yeah, it doesn't go back far.  So you'll need a third party that keeps eye on this so they can understand patterns, because if someone says, oh, we don't want these concurrent ads, we do this.  Wait a couple days.  Wait a week or so and then do another ad.  So there's going to be someone someone needs to keep an eye on this.  Hopefully, yes, a great inverse and investigated journalism will help expose the really bad actors as we go through this trend.  But it's not going to be easy for us people who are just casually looking at this site even.  And I do want to know.

So, yeah, hopefully some investigative journalism unit or somebody will start something to start monitoring that stuff and archiving it someplace.  You should be able to scrape that.  I mean, you should.  I'm just saying I could just see them go, no, no, no.  You know, the same way they did with like political little whoops and things like that.  Hey, I buried the lead.

It's funny to read, speaking of tweets, the tweets about it because, you know, apparently the killing stopped for a moment when the rocket went up.  It opened a dimensional rift, a one time event.  People logged in and a lot of people were pissed because they got killed before the rocket went up and they missed it.  Oh, so who else got killed before the rocket launch asks Mr. Knox.  The Fortlight rocket launch was awesome.  And I can't wait for the next season.  But whoever killed me, I hope you stub your toe on a door.  What happened with the rocket in Fortnight?  I was too far away to see what happened.  Then some idiot killed me.  I just got killed walking.  See, the key was to let everybody look at the rocket and then snipe them all.

Transcript:  Well, late, late next year, you'll probably see the earlier the earliest routers.  WPA three, which is the which is the security protocol that was written about this week by the Verge, myself and others, is will come sooner.  And on some devices that are have powerful enough processors, it may come as an upgrade, like, for example, some of the best routers now.  But WPA three fixes a lot of really interesting issues, including one feature of it allows you if if you are in a car.  If you are in a coffee shop, which, of course, now is a very insecure place with Wi-Fi.  If you're in a coffee shop and you have a WPA three device and the router uses WPA three, you can actually connect securely without a password.  Oh, interesting.  How do they do that?  It's an open protocol.  It sees WPA three.  The open security protocol is turned on in it.  And the two devices do a handshake and connect securely.

Start time: 6465.34
End time: 6472.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 6486.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, unless, of course, you can still be hit with a man in the middle attack where it looks like the coffee shop.  Right.  That doesn't prevent that.  But once you connect to it, you know, it's hard to jump in and sniff packets.

Start time: 6486.52

Transcript:  Perfect forward secrecy as well, which means even if you, you know, your keys are lost later, they can't they can't go back and read old books.  Go back and read older data.  That's important.  So that'll be good.  WPA three coming soon to some existing routers, but it will be required in AX routers.  Right.

Start time: 6505.12
End time: 6535.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the chances are for most people who have a router in their home now, you're not really going to be able to have a software upgrade for that.  It's the newer, higher end ones with processors that can handle it that will.  But, you know, you won't really see the full rollout of WPA three until probably later next year.  And at that point, you know, a lot of people may go through their repurchase cycle for buying a new router and that would be a time to do it.  Or you could just wait till AX, which is another year and a half away from that.

No state can say we're not going to we're going to stay in saving time because the state, you know, your your time zone is a national thing.  And so Congress would have to say, oh, you're in a new time zone.  So California will stay in daylight in standard time.  It just won't spring forward, which is I think Indiana is there's one state doesn't Arizona doesn't.  I think Hawaii doesn't.  There's a few states that don't do that.

Transcript:  That's right.  The other thing that happened is the California state legislature actually did something because had they not done something,  a real estate developer had gotten a ballot measure in November that was a very tough data privacy law.  And the legislature's but he agreed with the legislature.  If you pass this law before midnight, June 28th, then I'll withdraw the ballot measure.  They did with hours to spare.  And he did.  So we won't be able to vote on this in the fall.  And I think one of the reasons given that the legislature rushed on this is because it's much harder to change a ballot measure with a with a with this state law.  The legislature can weaken it whenever they want.  It's the California.  It is a good law, though, based on GDPR.  It's the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.  Companies that store large amounts of personal information, including Google and Facebook, will be just like with GDPR,  required to disclose the type of data they collect and allow you to opt out of having their data sold.  So unless unless they, you know, water it down at some point in the future, it's not going to happen immediately to give companies time, just like GDPR.  The companies will have a couple of years.  It won't be fully in effect until January 1st, 2020.

Start time: 6736.36

Start time: 6751.04
End time: 6775.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What a shock.  However, the legislature decided, well, at least if we pass it, we can change it.  If it wins in the polls in November, we're in deep doo doo.  So watch with interest to see what's going on.  So good news.  And I suspect just like GDPR really changed everybody.  If California has a bill like that, that means everybody operating in the US is going to have to adhere to this.  So it's good.  Yeah.

Start time: 6776.00
End time: 6789.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to make it much, much.  At the very least, what you'll see, because you have had a couple of instances of various sites that are refusing to serve content in Europe because of GDPR.  And fine.  But they're not going to be able to not serve California.

Start time: 6790.16
End time: 6813.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, precisely.  Yeah.  Although there's I just saw a study that said a lot of companies are kind of they're not really doing the opt in stuff with GDPR because they're just going to wait and see.  They're not you're supposed to require people to agree if you're going to collect data about them.  And they're just going to wait and see.  Let's see what happens.  Let's see how aggressively this this gets pursued.

Start time: 6814.08
End time: 6831.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like these people.  It's like these companies aren't realizing that the people in Europe are litigious about things like this and don't mind going to the courts.  And that's I mean, that seems like a bad a bad wager, like I guess, you know, thing to take.  I wouldn't I wouldn't make that bet myself.

It has now appeared in patents, in operating system references multiple times, dual display design,  and the Verge, Tom Warren, who's really good on this stuff, got an internal document that said it's going to be pocketable.  And even more interesting, when you open it up, the screen, flexible screen, will stretch over the hinge.

They would add additional features so that you could do certain offline things and have  different away messages, and people would hack the actual AIM program to do stuff.  Then AOL would patch the client to not make that stuff work, and it was a whole cat and  mouse game.  That was kind of how Trillian started, I believe.

Transcript:  We actually used Dead AIM at the...  I mean, not Dead AIM.  We used AIM at the Chronicle to communicate with each other.  Right.  So that's got to make sense.  Early newspaper computer systems, which were client server computer systems, had built-in  messaging, and we used it a lot.  When we went to PC systems, they didn't have that, and so we started using AIM to communicate  with each other.  And we did.  I had AIM on my computer until last year, really, when they killed it.
