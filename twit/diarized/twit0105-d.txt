So this is TWIT episode 105 and I've got two great people and maybe a third joining us  in just a bit.  We're here with David Spark, old friend from, I want to say Tech TV, but it's really ZD  TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I started one month before the station even began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And still around doing what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doing a lot of things.  I'm the tech reporter for 960 The Quake, the progressive talk radio station here in town.  They do talk now?  It's all talk.  It used to be progressive rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's progressive talk?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Look, it's in San Francisco and it's a liberal radio station and so it's like, you know,  they're the perfect station for the perfect market, I guess.  Anyways, they also play a lot of the Air America feats as well.  And I'm doing that also, you know, the Guidewire group, the guys who co-produced the demo conference.  I work as an analyst for them.  And so I'm covering lots of new technologies, a lot of Web 2.0 stuff.  And then lastly, I have my own custom publishing business, which is sort of this merger of  my 12 years of journalism and 10 years in the ad industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've wanted to get David on Twitch for so long because I'm really glad we could get  you on.  I ran into you the other day at a seminar and a good thing.  We did.  Joining us also by phone, I hear her.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Veronica Belmont.  Hi, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm glad to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we have a good reason to talk to you in just a second.  In fact, let me introduce your new boss.  Veronica, of course, was, well, still is.  I'm going to still say it with Buzz Out Loud, bol.cnet.com because your last day hasn't  come yet and on cnettv.com.  But I know it's coming soon.  When's your last day there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My last day is Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more week.  And here's the very, very, very, very smart fella who snapped you up, Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thanks for having me back 50 episodes later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reprise?  No, not a reprise of twit 57, I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was insane, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andrew Baron will not join us later on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The mini mogul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Jason, you've kind of since then, you've been doing the mini, still mini, by  the way.  You've been not yet a Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the greatest line ever in the history of podcasting when he told me that I didn't  know what I was doing and that he was going to be the next Rupert Murdoch.  You've got to be careful when you make those claims.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In public, in recorded form, you really, you know, whenever I hear stuff like that, I go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh, he's that.  You know, I think I missed that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you, well, it actually was a good one to miss.  It's still considered the worst twit ever.  Although Veronica, you were on the second worst twit ever.  You should be glad to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did the iPhone thing a couple of weeks ago and I thought it was actually, frankly,  great.  I like that episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Who critiques the worst twit ever?  I mean, is there a twit rating board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dig fanboys.  Dig fanboys, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it was just overkill.  I mean, we had so much iPhone news going on that week.  It wasn't overkill.  I think people were at the end of their limit with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were sick of it.  Some, not they, some, a few, a few vocal, a few were sick of it.  I defended the death, our coverage of the iPhone.  It was fair, it was even handed and it needed to be done because it was a significant product,  perhaps one of the most significant products in a decade.  I don't think there's any, I don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's the greatest gadget and the most significant gadget ever built.  I was going to say that.  I have mine in my hand right now too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, stop stroking your iPhone, Jason.  David, are you the only one without an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not have an iPhone and I will not be buying one until probably Gen 2 or Gen 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Playing the part of John C. Dvorak on this week's episode, Mr. David Sparke.  John is not with us this week.  I did ask him, believe me, I asked him, but he's, I think he's out of town.  This is actually a tough time to get people on, but I was really anxious, in fact, to  get both Jason and Veronica on to talk about what's going on.  So Veronica, you announced this week on Buzz Out Loud that you would be leaving CNET, a  cush job with a health plan to go to work for Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, hopefully I'll still have a health plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm banking on.  Right?  We have a health plan here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's to be.  No, of course.  We are a well-funded startup.  What is Mahalo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I thought it was a search, a human-powered search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a human-powered search engine.  We are handwriting the search results and obviously, you know, handwritten search results  is better than one made by a machine because it doesn't have spam and it's organized  and all those other great things.  You mean like Yahoo, right?  I guess like Yahoo used to be or DMOS at its best or, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great and it's unfortunate that doesn't get more attention because I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of falling apart now and the SEOs have taken it over.  Yeah, unfortunately.  It's very sad actually.  Well, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, David.  Oh, I was going to ask you, Jason, I was looking at Mahalo and your plans for it and the fact  that, you know, it's going to take you like another year and a half to get up and running.  But with a human-powered search engine, how are you going to like stay up to date?  I mean, something you did a year ago is not going to be current today if you create this  search engine.  I mean, just wondering how are you going to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great question and that's the question I got most from investors, from the press,  from analysts.  It's a very fair question.  One of the things we did was we were built off of the software media wiki, which powers  a lot of great wikis out there like Wikipedia and wikias.  And we added to it the ability to syndicate RSS feeds.  So when we do something on the news, you know, you can go and you can go to the news section  right now, look at it or even with musicians, we will pull in three, four, five RSS feeds,  mash them together.  And so when you go pull that page down, you've always got some recent news.  The second thing we do is we don't let pages get older than, say, 60 days old.  The full-time staff and the part-time staff keep them up to date and that has a cost to  it.  The RSS doesn't have a cost to it.  And then the third thing is the public submits links.  So if you had an iPhone link, like does it blend the iPhone link?  That got submitted to us a bunch of times on the iPhone SERP, search engine result page.  And when people submit a link, it goes to the guide, the guide that makes a decision.  Is it spam?  If so, delete it and ban that URL.  Is it great?  If so, include it in the search result.  And if it's just somewhere between those two opposite ends, leave it in the recommended  list.  We rely on the public, our full-time staff, our part-time staff, and technology to keep  them up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How big is your staff?  I mean, this must take a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we've got close to 50 people now.  We'll have 100 by the end of the year.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I take it Veronica is not going to be somebody who's doing handwritten search results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.  Veronica, you feel like doing some search results?  I mean, I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're going to pay me a little bit more to do that, I'm all about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you doing there?  First of all, I want to say mahalo means thank you in Hawaiian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  M-A-H-A-L-O.  And hello.  Isn't it?  It's like shalom too.  It's in the meaning of every word.  That's aloha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't confuse mahalo with aloha.  Yeah, the origin of the word is to admire.  Then it became known as thank you, eventually.  It's a very special word to Hawaiians.  And the tagline of the company is we're here to help.  So the concept of what we're doing with Veronica is the mahalo daily.  And it will be her doing what she's been doing, which is, I think, entertaining people and  informing them, which she's very capable of doing and very entertaining, on a daily  basis about technology and about pop culture.  Kind of like a rocket boom?  I hope not to a certain extent because my feeling on rocket boom was it was always a  little bit content light.  I think what attracted me to Veronica's work is that she does have great delivery and she's  got great presence on air, but she also has the substance behind it.  If she talks about Twitter, it's from the perspective of somebody who's put in 50 hours  into the product.  Or if you talk about the iPhone, it's on the basis of somebody who was in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that all Veronica, just 50 hours?  I know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's like, I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I have those 50 hours back, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all going over to Pounce now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what do you think?  Are you a Pounce?  I moved to Jaiku and now I'm torn between Jaiku and Pounce.  I can't go back to Twitter.  I see you on both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I've kind of dropped Jaiku out of the rotation.  Who has time?  I still have feeds updating on there.  I like the service a lot, but I think between Twitter and Pounce, I've pretty much covered  my cases in terms of letting people know every little bit of my day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to do a daily, how long?  Daily 10 minutes to half an hour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anywhere between three and 10 minutes, depending on the topic, I would say.  We have a bunch of different kinds of videos that we're going to be doing.  From interviews to how-tos to something a little more product related, maybe a comparison  type of thing.  We've done a lot of stuff in the pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So similar to what you were doing at CNET TV, but kind of your own show, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's going to be my own show.  Sometimes we'll have specialists on topic available to talk with me about something.  And also, it's going to be more general.  It's not just going to be technology.  So I can talk a little bit more about pop culture and other stuff that I'm interested

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in.  I've had you on the radio show.  I hope you'll still do that, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Anytime you want me on Twitter or radio, I'll do it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's great is you do represent a certain segment.  I'm way too old to be represented to be part of that segment.  So it's great to hear what you kids, what you young people are doing.  We'd like to get that on the show, too.  Yeah.  Well, that's exciting.  So it's your own thing, which I think must have been a part of the factor in making the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  decision.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm excited about it, to have a lot of the creative freedom to kind of talk about all  the stuff that interests me.  And you know, I've seen it's a wonderful, wonderful place.  And it's very bittersweet in a way, because I love working there and I love doing Buzz  Out Loud.  But there's a whole wide world out there, and I'm ready to do some new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's get to the tech news.  We'll talk a little bit more about Mahalo as time goes by.  But this is a very red-letter day, a significant day.  This is the day the music died, or maybe not.  This is the day that the copyright royalty board chose as the day that the new royalties  would be due from internet radio stations for playing music.  And potentially, we could see hundreds of thousands of radio stations shut down today.  Now the latest is that maybe they won't.  There might be a reprieve.  But frankly, if I'm an internet broadcaster playing commercial music, the reprieve to  me doesn't seem too appealing.  The sound exchange testified in front of Congress this week saying that, well, we won't, we  won't bill, if you don't pay us right away, we won't bill you, we'll negotiate.  But you do have to sit down at the table with us and talk, and you could owe interest on  the royalties.  It's a little scary if I'm an internet broadcaster.  You don't, Jason, you don't play any real music on your, real music, any, actually,  you don't play any unreal music, any science music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't put music under my stuff when I do my podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when I do it, we do independent music, which I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope that.  There's also positive choices.  I hope they just raise the price to the point of absurdity, put net radio out of business,  and shoot themselves in the foot, and then create a market for all these emerging artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the same exact thought.  I feel like, in a way, I don't want them to settle on this.  This is the greediest, I mean, this could be the beginning of the end for the recording  industry.  Their greed finally puts them out of business.  If I would like to see all these internet broadcasters just start using unsigned artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be one way of doing it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not too fond of it.  I just, I don't really see a good way out at this point.  I mean, the, like you said, the greed is so overwhelming that they can't really go back,  but going further kind of scares me as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've talked about this before, and I have a theory, maybe it was Dvorak's theory, but  I have a theory about what happened.  The Copyright Royalty Board approved this outrageous royalty, not only a royalty now  on publishing rights, but also on performance, which commercial radio does not pay, although  I think the RIAA is also going after them for that.  And worse than that, it's a huge royalty and it was retroactive to the beginning of 2006.  So many of these internet broadcasters, if they had to pay today, would owe bills, astronomical  bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think...  Well, they knew that going into that too.  I mean, they knew that this was coming up.  All the internet radio stations...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they didn't know that it would go back to January 1st, 2006, did they?  I mean, this is something that happened six months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they did.  I was talking to Rusty Hodge about it.  The big surprise was they knew they were going to have to have retroactive payments on this,  but what they didn't know is how big it was going to be.  And that's what scared them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rightly so.  I mean, most of these guys don't make any money at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But I think two things.  One, what you just mentioned earlier, SoundExchange, they can price them completely out and just  everything will shift back to terrestrial radio and terrestrial radio will control everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I might point out that they want to do the same to terrestrial radio.  These guys don't...  They don't want to stop.  They want to charge Performance Royalties terrestrial radio as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and don't they double hit them too if they play terrestrial and online?  So it's like they have to cough up double the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tim West is going to Pandora says we're going to stay on the air, but I've talked to him  before.  He said we'll owe millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is going to be really huge for Pandora, which is really unfortunate considering  they've just made a lot of really...  Why don't I say really a few more times?  Really, really, really major for them.  They had deals with Sonos and Cell Carriers and all sorts of great stuff in the works  and to just be totally knocked out of the park with this is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a very...  A lot of the times these people think it's a zero sum game and they have to...  They can't think about this sort of big open ocean where they can just make money many  different ways, many different levels of money.  They don't want to do any hard work.  They want to have a one size fits all and it's insane.  But it's like Princess Leia said, the more you tighten your grip, the more galaxies go  through your fingers kind of a thing.  They're just going to tighten their grip to the point they're going to lose everybody.  It's going to go offshore.  You're going to keep creating things like Hype Machine, which I almost don't want to  mention because it's such an awesome service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, don't give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I know.  Every time I mention Hype Machine, I just think to myself, shut up, Jason, because it's  such a great service.  You're going to ruin it.  I try never to mention it.  So what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody listens to this show.  You could talk about it.  It's not like Calacanis Cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  HypeM.com, Hype Machine.  And what happens?  Basically, they go across all the blogs out there and they pull all of the MP3s on them.  So you can go there, type in Bob Dylan and then it will create an RSS feed for you that  you can add to your iTunes.  And then you pull down all these Bob Dylan tracks that are mentioned on people's blogs.  You'll sign up for it and then all of a sudden you'll have Dylan doing a cover or somebody  doing a cover of Dylan.  All this crazy stuff just winds up in your iTunes.  You take out your iPod, you go to your Hype Machine feed and bang, you've got some interesting  stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's music on demand almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really cool.  There's a cool little hack for the iPhone to kind of do something simpler.  I think it's with a search engine called Soundseq, something like that.  It's a website.  Do you know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Soundseq, the one that sort of combines people's iPod directories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it is because I've only played with it on the Safari on the iPhone, but it's awesome  because what happens is it aggregates people who've got MP3s online, many of them illegal.  And Seekpod, S-E-E-Q-P-O-D.  Oh yeah, I wrote about these guys for Guidewire Group.  So it works great on the iPhone because it can play MP3.  So you just click the links and all of a sudden on your iPhone you're listening to music via  Wi-Fi or the Edge if you could get any Edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really cool.  You can create playlists and share playlists with people.  The major problem is that yes, a lot of it's illegal.  It's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like Hype M, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other thing is that being that they're only pointing to MP3 files, the quality of  listening is all over the map.  You may be connected to a great connection on one song and then the next connection may  be just trickling.  So it's very, very erratic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no kind of quality control going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Jason and Veronica, if you want to try it on your iPod, they have seekpod.com slash  iPhone, I should say.  They have a special iPhone page and it looks just like your iPhone.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also do it for video.  It's pretty cool, the video tech they've got as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  This is the problem.  Exactly.  Princess Leia's problem is that you can't stop this.  It's all digital now.  How are you going to tell you?  You know, shutting down internet radio is not the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you look at when they introduced iTunes in the 99 cent track, piracy went down because  convenience went up and it was sort of a fair price.  You know, I think if they went down to 25 cents or 50 cents per track, they would sell  10 times as many tracks.  So I don't think they've really, you know, actually taken that as far as they could go.  They could get rid of piracy completely.  It's really an economic and convenience issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a good study came out of, I think it was University of Toronto, where they addressed  this exact issue, did a very, I think, comprehensive study and came up with the price of a nickel  a track.  They said, at that price, we believe the industry would make more money for exactly this reason.  Why would you steal it if you can get it for a nickel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, look at DVDs.  You know, there's a story in the New York Times today about DVDs and why people don't,  Sol Hansel did it on why people don't copy them.  A DVD only costs $4 to rent or, you know, whatever, you know, with your Netflix account.  And it, the cost of copying a DVD from what I've heard, I wouldn't know this firsthand,  is a half hour to two hours, depending on if it's got over 4.7 gig and if you've got  to compress it and whatever.  So not that I have any personal experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, also people, people don't watch DVDs and videos at the repetition basis.  They do listen to music.  Precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not worth it.  You're only going to watch it once.  Why spend, when a rental is so cheap, why spend all that time and money to make a copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of it?  And also there isn't a music rental business in the same sense.  I mean, there is, you know, with the tools like Napster and Rhapsody and whatnot, but  it isn't kind of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've always been opposed to subscription models, even though I know they're very popular.  I belong to the school of wanting to own all my music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just something mental with me.  Like I like having the collection.  I think it hearkens back to when people had giant CD collections and it was like a big  deal to show off how many CDs you have.  I like to have a giant music collection on my hard drive.  But do you also want to do a movie collection as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want the same with your movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm okay.  I'm not really the same with that, which is weird.  I'm okay with renting movies because I really only want to watch one movie once.  Like just like you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a study from the NPD group.  It says that they monitored 12,000 Americans of the people who had, of them only one and  a half percent had DVD ripping software.  Two thirds of those who had it used it, but 12 percent of the people monitored burned  their own music.  So it's a significant difference in the number of burned DVDs and the number of burned CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the reason people do steal DVDs is because they can, the timing of them.  So again, availability.  If you don't make the product available, people will buy it for $5 on Canal Street in New  York, you know, a bootleg copy.  And that's really why people are going to the Pirates Bay and downloading, you know,  And also convenience.  Like if I want to watch something on my iPhone or my iPod, I don't want to take a DVD transcribe  and spend an hour and a half doing that.  You know, I think a lot of people would just rather go to sites like Podtropolis, which  is a site I heard about from a friend.  I've never been there, but they seem to have all the movies already in iPod format at Podtropolis.  Oh really?  That's handy.  Yeah.  I just heard about it from a friend, but I've never been to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the P2P sites that are the problem with the stealing video, of which, you know,  there is a lot of that, but it's actually just these big DVD copying houses that, you  know, worst cases are like in Indonesia and areas of Russia where, you know, they have  such a low percentage of actual legal sales of DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a real black market kind of industry that's damaging more than anything.  It's not really the individual users you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember who, I think it was someone at the MPA.  I wrote a piece about this for E!  Content Magazine a long time back, and this was just very much the case that that was  more the concern because there was a direct connection between money they were losing  because they were selling physical DVDs at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to be speaking tomorrow to a group, it used to be the Video Software Dealers Association,  they now call themselves the EMA.  It's the keynote for their conference, big conference in Vegas, and what they're doing  is they're doing a panel of consumers.  They've got like 10 consumers and that's what they're going to do is they're going to say,  oh, actually, that's what I'm supposed to do for them is, so tell me, it's okay to talk  about this.  Do you steal music?  Do you steal video?  What are you up to?  Just between you and me.  Just between you and me.  And of course, the people in the audience are not only people who buy and sell DVDs,  but also the motion picture industry who's trying to get them to buy their DVDs.  So it'll be very interesting.  I feel like I'm going into the lion's mouth there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I witnessed a tipping point though on stealing movies at the Foo Camp that Tim  O'Reilly does.  I'm definitely name dropping there, but I got invited for the first time this year.  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just about 10 miles away and I could hear you guys having a party and I was not  invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You hear various people landing in their helicopters.  Yeah, Larry Page helicoptered in.  It's funny.  It's kind of cool actually.  We're there and everybody's talking about Sicko and I'm like, oh yeah, everybody has  seen the film.  And I just asked myself, I don't think this film is out yet.  It wasn't out yet.  It wasn't out yet, I don't think.  And so everybody had downloaded it off BitTorrent and unlike when The Hulk came out or I guess  Revenge of the Sith came out same week and Hulk came out two weeks before, those are  films that you would want to see on a big screen, special effects, et cetera.  This was a DVD rip of a documentary which is much better to watch at home or on a plane  than in a theater with people talking and whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I mean, I got to think Sicko had a major...  That's also an example...  I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just said I got to think Sicko took a hit in the box office because of that.  Yeah, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what the MPAA complains about most is when people are stealing at release time  because you know the arc of sales, you know, you got your first weekend and then X number  of weeks in the box office and then it shifts over to DVD sales and if something comes in  like you know, it gets distributed on a P2P network anywhere on that sales cycle, they're  going to take a major hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think Jason makes an excellent point because you're not going to take a hit if  it's a big movie that you want to see on a big screen.  It's just a teaser for it.  You're still going to go see the movie but not Sicko.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right.  I mean, that is true, Jason.  I agree on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you think for the method of when a lot of studios have been quietly contemplating  and I think even a couple have tried this of releasing the DVD on the same day that  the movie comes out in theaters.  So do you think that it's different between blockbusters and documentaries?  Like maybe this wouldn't hurt a big summer blockbuster by releasing the DVD on the same  day or would it not work for something like Sicko?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that you could sell the DVD of Spider-Man or Pirates of the Caribbean for $50 online  and you get it by FedEx that Friday.  I think you would have, you charge $75.  I think you would have tons of people doing it to have parties at their house.  You would be like the cool person to have the $75 DVD special limited edition of $10,000  you know, whatever with a poster or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look how many people waited in line for six hours to get a $600 phone so they could be  the first one in the office to show it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, it would be fantastic and they could have like the alternate ending at the same  time.  So in the movie theater, you can't see the alternate ending but if you spend $75 on this  one, you get a party kit with it or something.  Also Sicko, why not release it on the web and get Ford or somebody or somebody who wants  that Volvo, somebody who wants that demographic to...  Yeah, right?  Safety, health, whatever.  Somebody crunchy, somebody earthy crunchy.  You bet, yeah.  I could get one of those to give you $3 million to sponsor it online.  How much is the film going to make?  That's $3 million in pure profit.  It's not going to affect the box office that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What this underscores is that the problem is that these movie companies, these music  companies are holding on to this old business model with their, you know, claws to the bitter  end whereas any entrepreneur, and Jason, you're a great example, can see many ways to use  these new technologies to do better and they still won't let go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Peter Rojas with Record Label, I think is Peter Rojas who did Engadget and created Gizmodo  before that.  He's a tremendous entrepreneur, you know, he's starting this thing Record Label and  He's going to be doing artists that are sponsored by advertisers and the MP3s are available,  you know, for free on a website.  It's a genius idea.  He's going to clean up.  It's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think there's very much an us versus them.  They just don't want to cannibalize, you know, their big budget or the things that makes  them the most money, which is like theater sales and DVD sales.  They're all up for other distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't see to new models.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Certain new models are coming out, like extra stuff you can see on websites and whatnot.  I mean, I'm playing the anti-John DeVorek here in supporting industry right now.  I think what they're just trying to do is keep the life cycle.  When you release a Spider-Man, they want the sales life cycle like it gets released this  summer, you know, still showing it.  And then when Christmas comes around, they can sell the DVD because they're going to  make more money in using that cycle.  If you do the cycle that Jason suggests, well, it's probably not going to make as much money  because people get, you know, their Spider-Man fix all at once and then, you know, they'll  move on to something else come Christmas time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, maybe it would be good to try that model on movies that aren't expected to perform  very well in the theater because a lot of movies have a short life cycle in the theaters.  And then when the DVD comes out, they do really great.  So maybe if there's an anticipation that it's not going to do well within the first few  months of being in the theater, that they do it with the releasing the DVD on the same  day.  And that way they don't have to wait to make their profit.  They just bank off the DVDs right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened to Mark Cuban's plan?  Remember Mark made a movie and released the DVD the same day and this was going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the model and yeah, that's one of the kind of he's he's pulled back a little bit on it.  But I think the issue for him was I don't think he had, you know, one of these big blockbuster  movies.  Perfect example.  Yeah, exactly.  But I don't think they've given it up, given up on it yet.  And, you know, I think the problem is if you go to if you look at music companies and movie  companies specifically, if you go to their offices and say who sells the advertising  here, they they would just look at you like you're crazy.  Whereas you go to a newspaper, a magazine or an internet company, you know, you say  who sells ads here?  It's like, OK, that's like these three floors.  It's 60 percent of the people in the building.  And when for a music company or a movie company to not have an ad sales group is crazy when  they they will have, I predict, you know, all this stuff is going to be ad supported.  And you're seeing it happen at CBS.  I just saw Transformers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's selling ads in the movies.  My God, there was more product placement.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was more product placement in that.  I got to tell you, though, I maybe want a Camaro real bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  Real bad.  GM did very well on that movie.  I think I'm not even a car person.  I wanted an 18 wheeler after that.  So, Veronica, you were at your first E3 this week.  I was.  Yes.  So you'd never seen the big razzle dazzle E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, unfortunately, I never got to cover it when it was super cool and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And was it super cool and fun this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just a bunch of press conferences and airplane hangars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was totally boring and somewhat depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God.  But but but but there's a new that new rock star game.  Don't you want to play that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Rocket of the new rock star game.  Yeah.  No, no, I mean, the guitar rock band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's rock band. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, it's like guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know rock stars confusing because they do Grand Theft Auto.  Right.  Rock band is the guitar hero for somebody who wants to sing or.  Oh, it looks so much fun.  I thought you might be into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't wait to get my paws on that one.  I mean, I have to save it for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the show.  Don't waste it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I haven't even gotten I'm still trying to work on hard on Guitar Hero 2.  I can't my fingers just don't want to do that.  I don't want to go any higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your show's name going to be, by the way?  I don't think we asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't totally pinned it down yet.  So we've got some ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The VB show.  It will definitely be.  It might be The Holiday Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might be it.  But we'll figure it out.  We'll figure out something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely with Veronica's name somehow incorporated into the name.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got to be.  See, that's the new model because I'll tell you what, in the television business, they  keep your name way out of the title just in case, right?  They don't want to give you any star billing.  Yeah.  You have to earn your.  That's the opposite here.  Yeah, that's right.  You're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I did get to meet.  I was one great part about you three was I got to meet Ashigaro Miyamoto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  And that was like.  He's the Nintendo god, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That was like an ultimate moment for me.  I was doing an interview with George Harrison, who was the senior VP of marketing for Nintendo.  And I saw Miyamoto-san come in and I was like, I have to go shake his hand.  If I don't do it right now, I'm never going to forgive myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He designed Mario.  What did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am Mario and all the good stuff, all the great oldies, all the new stuff.  He's done amazing work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And was he gracious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very, very much so.  Yeah, absolutely.  I just went up and said, hi, I'm Veronica from CNET.  I just wanted to introduce myself and say I'm a big fan.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you've got to get in the next step is you got to say, can I get you on my show  on Mahalo?  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was still on CNET time at that point.  I know, I know, I know.  Hey Leo, you can have Veronica on every week if she can say Mahalo half as many times as  Dvorak says, dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like saying Mahalo.  There's something nice about Mahalo.  Mahalo.  Whenever you fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The original name of the company was going to be 20.com.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Mahalo better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mahalo is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you into Hawaii?  Is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Hawaii.  I got married there and I just always loved the word Mahalo and I was able to buy it for  Unfortunately, I bought it like three, I was able to buy it three months after I bought  20.com for 75,000.  Oh dear.  So now I'm sitting on 20.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two zero or 20, I spelled that.  Two zero.  Two zero.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A two letter.  I'm getting a big offer for it.  I'm getting like 150, $200,000 offer.  Does somebody have like 10?  So what are you complaining about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're going to double your money.  So why don't you buy 30 while you're at it and 40 and 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not into doubling my money.  I like a hundred X. So until somebody offers me $7 million for it, I'm going to be very  disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like a wise investment.  It was no big deal on your part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would start buying more numbers if I were you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 is available.  Not 300 though.  Actually, I have another good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A day.  I bought A-D-A-Y a day.  Like hack.aday.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had this great idea of doing a website that would be kind of like that.  It'd be a daily tip or a pushed out thing and I wanted it to be dai.ly.  It'd be your daily action item.  Dai.ly.  The problem is, ly is Liberia.  Oh no, Libya.  Libya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you have to ask the country's permission?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Libya doesn't like the U.S.  So I asked Amber, I said, you're Canadian.  Maybe they'll like you better.  And they never responded to her either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that was the same idea I had.  It's interesting you had that same idea.  Daily tip line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Daily tip.  And it was daily, your daily action item.  dai.ly.  And yeah.  And it pushed out.  You know where it comes from is that candy site.  What is that?  Daily candy.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Great idea.  But I thought we'd get a, it'd be like a boing-boing.  We'd get a couple of star bloggers like Amber and each one would have a different beat and  each day you'd have a different suggestion for an action item.  Something you should do today.  Stop and smell the roses.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that you've said it on air, someone's going to try to go do your idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  I'm not like Jason.  I have ideas, but I have no, no, no implementation skills whatsoever.  So that'll go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I listened to the show, Leo.  It's still an idea.  It is anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You suggest how to implement and then other people do it for you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Sony's suing the company that did the root kit for him.  I like that.  $12 million in damages.  Yeah.  I mean, they're trying to recover it from the company that made the media max, made  the CD protection software.  I guess Sony's saying, we didn't know it was a root kit.  It's their fault.  The ultimate finger point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's funny.  I was missing the days, lamenting the days of the Sony root kit era.  It was like, that was, you know, we had good meaty stories to talk about.  Simple times.  We weren't just complaining about the PS3.  Like a good scandal.  Simple times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those were the good old days.  So a hundred bucks off the PS3.  Now, unfortunately, it turns out that that $60 PS3 is being discontinued anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a big trick.  What a big...  It's a double trick.  60 gigabytes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  60 gigabytes.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I don't know what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Replacing it with 80 gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the big trick is that last week on this show, I said, oh yeah, there were rumors  they were going to do this, but Sony's president said, no, we're not dropping it.  Two days later, they dropped the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just very surprised that they did it right before E3.  I mean, they didn't have a lot of exciting things to announce at E3, and that would have  at least given it some meat at the conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you, at $499 though, it's the lowest priced Blu-ray DVD player.  Forget the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was what I was going to ask, because I haven't bought a DVD player yet, and I'm  still confused as to why I need to spend $2,000 on two $1,000 things when the PlayStation  has Blu-ray in it.  If I buy the PlayStation for $500, I get a Blu-ray drive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is another $500 player I think Toshiba makes.  No, not Toshiba.  Sony, maybe.  But why not get the game for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I do with my PlayStation 2 instead of buying a DVD player.  I was like, this thing is smaller, and I get games and it was like $299.  That's how I'm watching HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But are people going to be buying this as a DVD player or a gaming machine?  Why don't they market that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People have been buying it as a Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then if they ever can come up with a good game for it, then you could play it.  Oh, there's a few decent titles.  Resistance, that's the only...  What's the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any one leading game yet for the PS3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Resistance is decent.  What do you like, Veronica?  Oh, me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh.  Yeah, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See what I'm saying?  There's no standout game on the PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a second, the PlayStation 3's come out?  That's released?  Yes, one of these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, there are very short lines to get one.  I could walk right in the store and pick one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember actually I was there the night that the PS3 launched and the line of people  sitting there, I think, was all of 10 deep.  It was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It turned out it was mostly speculators.  That was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a huge line actually down at the Metreon in San Francisco.  It was going all the way down the block.  I was covering the line for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they had a big concert there that night, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they had something going on too.  Yeah.  The thing was most of the people were buying it to put it on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To sell it.  They were speculating, yeah.  So, $499 for the 60 gig model and will it be hard to find, Veronica?  I mean, is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people will probably grab it up while they can because they want to have a cheaper  player than the 80 gigabyte version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's not going to be any more.  They're not even making them anymore.  Yeah, so it's going to be...  When they're gone, they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like on the clearance rack at this point.  They're just trying to get rid of their stock and under the guise of doing a price drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft did not drop the price on Xbox.  Did they have any announcements besides...  Oh, I know they did.  Halo 3, September 25th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're talking about Halo 3.  They have a special edition Halo 3 Xbox 360 Elite.  The Elite is going to be available in Europe, which is exciting for a lot of European people.  They finally get their console out there, the Elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What exactly is different in the Elite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's got the souped up hard drive, which is good, the 120 gigabyte hard drive.  It's got the HDMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's got a connector.  It's a bigger hard drive and a connector.  And now in green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and now in a lovely army green.  You know, I have to say it's hideous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really the big news all...  It is hideous.  It's the color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would want that?  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same color as the Master Sergeant or whatever.  Master...  I mean, I don't get it.  I love Halo, but I don't get it.  So the big news at E3 was all Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the biggest, I think the most exciting press conference was probably Nintendo's.  I mean they have Wii Fit, which looks really fun.  It's got the board that you can do all the different moves on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really just a Dance Dance Revolution mat though, right?  It's not a...  They call it a balance board, but there's nothing to balance on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you can move...  I didn't get to try it out, but...  It looks like a mat.  ...you can move around on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a mat.  Oh no, it's more...  There's more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.  What was the game they demoed with the mat?  I mean I saw that too, but what did they demo?  Wii Fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you...  They're gonna do yoga?  It's the first console game with yoga involved, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a lot of cute stuff.  I mean I think it'll speak to a lot of people.  People were very excited over Wii Sports because they felt like they were physically getting  involved and getting off their doffs and doing something fun.  And this is gonna take that to that next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you game at all, Jason?  Do you do any of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I play Texas Hold'em Poker, but that's in the real world.  I will not play poker against this guy.  Command and Conquer.  That's a great game.  Yeah.  And I was playing the Star Wars real-time strategy was like Empire at War or something.  I like the real-time strategy.  Me too.  Me too.  For me, I brain...  I get flow moments when I'm in those games.  It's like playing five games of chess at once.  So I love playing chess or backgammon or that or Texas Hold'em.  Any of those games we have to really strategize, I love.  Not the massively multiplayer online games.  I did City of Heroes and I got about 50 hours into that and level 30 and I was like, I'm  the CEO of a company.  I can't be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't be doing this.  You can't be doing this.  I have a life.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't.  Did you see any games that you were just crazy about besides Rock Band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Mercenaries 2 looks pretty cool and Burnout Paradise.  I'm a big fan of EA, so there were some good EA titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're dominant now.  It's interesting to watch how they've really taken over the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's their model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it's the model they have.  A lot of that stuff's not made in-house, right?  They just acquire the rights to...  It's almost a motion picture studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're huge.  I mean, they've got between EA Sports and the different divisions.  They've got a lot going on.  What else?  Rock Band, of course, like I mentioned, looks awesome.  There's some RPG games that look pretty cool.  I think there was one for PS3 that looks pretty neat as well.  I'm having a hard time remembering all the names because they're all running together in my mind right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they run together in your mind, just imagine how the rest of us feel.  It's so sad that what was a dynamic, vibrant, exciting conference and industry has just turned into this kind of...  Yeah, there's another Rock Band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, everything was so spread out.  They had to drive all over the place.  Even the Barker Hanger, which was really the closest thing to the show floor,  was just little TV screens with the games being demoed.  There was just no excitement.  There was no real feeling of passion and,  oh, wow, I can't wait for this thing and this other thing.  It's just like, meh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I'm excited about?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sigbrit Lothberg.  Now, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the woman who has the fastest internet connection, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's absolutely right. Very good.  You win the prize.  Seventy-five-year-old woman from Karlstad in central Sweden,  for reasons I'm not completely clear about,  now has the fastest internet connection in the world, 40 gigabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what she's doing?  She's going into the left-hand lane and driving a 56-set.  Her blinker's been...  And then in other news, they just gave an 80-year-old man a Lamborghini.  What's the deal?  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, her son is actually...  He works at Cisco.  He's using her kind of a proof of concept model to show that it can be done.  And he set the whole thing up for her.  But it is pretty ironic, considering what our speeds are here in the US.  And then there's this one lady over in Sweden who's killing us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40 gigabit. Don't want to play World of Warcraft with her.  Cisco contributed the project.  That's her son's company.  But it's the fiber that's making it.  Really, he's just showing off.  He said the most...  Actually, Hofstein Jonsson, who was, I guess, with Cisco, said the most difficult part of the whole project was installing Windows on her PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I didn't get. What was she using before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She wasn't using anything, probably.  Was she Linux?  She's a Linux. Yeah, she's an elite hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you've got a 40-megabit connection, I think we can afford to buy the woman a new computer.  40 gigabit?  Gigabit.  Gigabit, rather.  I take 40 megs. 40 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  40 gig?  40 gig?  Yeah, dude.  I was trying to figure that out. It was like 40...  40 megabits is fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard they're coming, like, she can download a two-hour movie in like five seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the MPAA. It's going to be knocking at her door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You get sued next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sigrid Hovlandt. This is the Swedish police.  Sigrid Hovlandt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You hit me off hard.  They're saying that they can switch between some, like, 1500 HD channels or something like that?  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Concurrent. She's got them. Yeah, she can have concurrent.  I think she's running about 400 torrents right now.  She's seeding 400 torrents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the other story. Pirate Bay has now moved into her six-bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. They're living in her guest room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoa, we like this. This is good.  So what do you think? Now, I'm going to ask the CEO here about this one.  Eric Schmidt talking with reporters at a hotel bar at the Allen & Company meeting.  Do you go to the Allen & Company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's never a good start to a story, by the way.  I know.  Walking to reporters in a bar is going to be downhill from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is downhill. He says that Viacom is basically a company built from lawsuits.  Look at their history, he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the drunken ramblings of a CEO?  I'd just like to say Viacom.  We made the same joke on BOL. We're like, I got to tell you about Viacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Wall Street Journal, and I'm going to kiss you.  You look so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you doing Larry Flint? Who are you doing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm doing a drunk Eric Schmidt.  A drunk Eric Schmidt.  I love you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love you, baby. And Viacom, you suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's take it outside.  I'll give you some inside baseball stuff that's interesting.  Michael Moritz had a dinner at his house.  The guy who runs Sequoia was the investor in YouTube, Google, and Yahoo.  Nice record.  He had not a bad record. He's an investor in Mahalo as well.  And so he's not done yet.  But he had Mika Salmi in the room who is from Atom Films, which was bought by Viacom.  And he is sitting there with the guy who is suing him.  Having dinner. It was a very weird kind of moment.  I was like, I wonder if anybody else is noticing what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're very collegial when they meet.  They let the lawyers fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all negotiation. It's all negotiation.  It's a price. The price will be paid.  And there is traffic. And it's just all negotiation.  And it'll all be taken care of.  And actually, to be totally honest, I think there is a, the way the DMCA is structured,  you know, YouTube is acting within the law.  Are they being fair? Maybe not. But they are acting within the law, which is you have to take stuff down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They take take down requests. They do what they're supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. But the problem is...  What more are they supposed to do?  The problem is that they blanket delete everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like they don't just take down the infringing content.  They will totally wipe someone's entire videos down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe they're over aggressive. Yeah, I think that's over aggressive.  They shouldn't be doing that.  There's no filtering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They will kill your account if you're doing, from what I understand,  they will kill your account if you've done one bad thing, all 10 go.  But, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not true, not true. I got one of these messages myself because I, when I was at ZDTV,  I did a story about Comedy Central, about The Daily Show.  And it was not owned by Comedy Central or The Daily Show.  It was actually technically owned by ZDTV.  But they took it down because it said The Daily Show on it.  Ultimately, I think the problem is that Viacom is angry with their viewers.  They're not angry with YouTube and Google.  They're angry with their viewers that go to YouTube instead of going to Comedy Central.com  to watch videos.  Again, just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way the DMCA law is structured,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and I have a lot of experience with it from working at AOL and stuff,  is, you know, if you start looking at the content and you start doing proactive take downs,  then you're responsible for everything.  So, you know, you take down the one Chappelle show clip that you stumble upon,  now you're an editor, now the site is edited.  So you only do it in response to the DMC take down request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the system is so easy to upload and there are so many people doing it that the DMCA doesn't work.  But they're kind of out of technology.  Viacom is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they're saying we want Google to become, to create a filtering system and use it.  And I think you're exactly right.  That's why Google's drawing the line.  They don't want to be in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also Viacom's other argument is, you know, if someone posts a clip from the Daily show up there,  and I, you know, I put the keyword, the Daily show in there,  well, that should be first clue that you should be looking at this darn, you know, piece of video.  But no, they let it go up until Viacom says, hey, take it down.  So that's their argument.  That's within the letter of the law, though.  Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The law was intended for ISPs and for people who were cop and carriers, not for web-based services.  So now you have things like Pounce, which is going to have this problem very soon,  or other people will have this problem who host stuff.  And if the more efficient you host, the easier it is to get to this content.  So it's efficiency in technology matching up with inefficiency in law.  And what will happen in that is the marketplace tends to sort it out.  The marketplace hasn't sorted it out here.  And so you have lawsuits, which are a proxy for negotiation.  So if we just see the lawsuits as negotiation tactics, all you have here is a big negotiation.  Makes sense. Makes perfect sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Viacom needs to come up with a better solution, which they haven't done.  And what happens, like in the case with the Napster thing,  when you shut down Napster, then somebody else who's got a little bit more wherewithal,  like, say, Steve Jobs, pretty much defines the music industry at 99 cents a song.  So what's going to happen is someone with a little bit more wherewithal will define the video industry,  and it's not going to be Viacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All these guys are going to have all of their stuff online with advertising around it.  And so when they have their stuff, Google will probably settle with them,  or Google will send them some traffic.  There's all kinds of interesting settlements that could go on.  Remember when AOL, Microsoft, and Netscape were having their whole dance?  Microsoft paid AOL and Time Warner a couple of billion dollars.  AOL previously got the AOL client on the Microsoft desktop.  Microsoft got AOL to use IES, the default browser, even though they own Netscape.  All kinds of weird negotiations and things could happen.  You might see Viacom say, you know what?  YouTube is now going to be the official host to our content,  because Google's giving us a billion dollars over the next three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where the negotiation is happening.  I think it's unfortunate that the people who are never at the table are we users.  And so all of this will be decided without us.  The good news is, ultimately, the power resides in our hand,  as Viacom and Google are learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are the people of the year, if you read Time magazine.  It's us, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I bet you had fun on Buzz Out Loud with Wabi Sabi Lobby.  Did you?  WabiSabiLobby.com.  It is a site where there is a Swiss internet startup.  You've got to love their guts.  Where they're auctioning off exploits, eBay-style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And it's supposed to help for security things, if they sell them to the right people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but can't I, as a hacker or a bad guy, come along and say, oh, I'd like to bid for that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess it goes to the top dollar, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Top dollar or lowest dollar? How does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's an eBay-style auction site.  So I go on WabiSabiLobby.com and say,  well, I figured out a way to inject a bad piece of Trojan horse software on somebody's system by having them come to this site using this exploit.  How much would you pay for that? And then they bid it up and then whoever gets it gets to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's mostly for researchers. Yeah, or it's researchers that put up the exploits, right?  Right.  And then it can either go to people who are going to exploit that information or people who are going to use it to defend.  Well, we thought to fix it.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was to fix it. And so whoever gives the lowest bid, they'll give it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the company, they are going to screen sellers and buyers requiring proof of identification, articles of incorporation and bank account information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This has been going on for a long time. I mean, the guys from 2600, their bread and butter was getting paid to crack systems on Wall Street.  And this is just a marketplace for doing that. So it's actually nothing new. What's new about it is they're being transparent.  There was going to be black cats to do this for a long time. Sure. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also the whole the whole sort of network of virus creation is becoming more transparent in general, isn't it?  I mean, in that, yes, people are becoming more aware of how it's being created.  And in two ways, a, it allows viruses to be created better.  But at the same time, it allows the people who are defending and attacking the viruses to get at them better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And to make money to make money at it, too. If you're a good researcher, now you could sell your research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, both industries are taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting. I mean, I guess if they if they do a good job, and I don't know how good a job you can do of validating the buyers, then this is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, then there's that whole, you know, are you really sure you're validating the buyers?  Well, that's my problem. Imagine the people you're selling to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love these kind of ideas. Like I was thinking all these SEOs are trying to spam Mahalo.  And so I was thinking about putting a reward out there of one hundred dollars or something like that every time a user found a spam link.  That's a great idea.  So then it'd be cheaper than us policing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great idea. Yeah, give me an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Give me an iPhone.  You got a couple left, right?  I'm giving away one hundred iPhones to the to the part time guides.  Oh, that's nice of you.  We're working on it. Yeah.  No way. Really?  Yeah, I didn't publicize it except for here, but with the hundred part time first.  Yeah, no one will hear about it now.  Veronica, you can have any video thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's already got one. She's already got one.  But I paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As I told you, any hardware you need, you can have.  Any toys you need.  Now I know why you made the deal, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am the greatest guy to talent ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know you have a good reputation.  Oh my God, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the 25th anniversary of the computer virus, by the way.  Science magazine documented it in 1982, previous before the Morris Worm,  which was the first one I was aware of in 1988.  In 1982, the first computer virus was Elk Cloner, a Pittsburgh high school student,  wrote it, spread through Apple II systems via infected floppy disks.  And its payload? Bad poetry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ouch, like black heart. Oh, simpler days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'd rather have my hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish they had examples in science of the bad poetry.  I would have loved to have read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you going to do to celebrate the anniversary, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. What should I do? What would be good?  I remember maybe take Norton antivirus out to get drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it'll say something nasty about Viacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does that mean it's the 26th anniversary of Windows if it's the 25th anniversary of the virus?  It was an Apple II virus, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interestingly enough, I remember Michael Angelo,  Devorak and I were doing a radio show in the early 90s, I think it was 91 or 92,  and the Michael Angelo was the first really big virus.  I remember it.  Yeah, boot sector virus.  You'd get it by trying to boot from a floppy that had the virus on it.  And I remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the virus from the movie Hackers? Was that Da Vinci?  Did they call it Da Vinci?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't remember that. Maybe that was based on the same thing.  Yeah, I think it was based on the same thing.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember. That just pops into my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a simple fix program that you could get on floppy, download, put it on floppy,  but because this was early, before the internet was widespread,  I remember offering on the radio show, it was a syndicated radio show,  anybody who wanted a disk, I would send them one, and I got thousands of requests.  I ended up getting a disk duplicator and spending hours making these disks.  Well, what else? There's another anniversary. It's the 25th anniversary.  I'm trying to remember. There was another anniversary.  Of Veronica?  Is it your anniversary?  Next weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Happy anniversary, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of being on the planet.  Of being alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, happy birthday.  Thank you. I was just playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's a good one. It wasn't the one I was thinking of,  but it's probably better than the one I was thinking of.  It was the fifth, oh, it's the 10th anniversary of the blog. That's what it was.  Of course, it's not until December, but the Wall Street Journal has written about it,  so that makes it official.  They highlighted right-wing bloggers. I thought that was kind of interesting.  That story was whack. I opened it up yesterday, and I looked, and it was like, it was whack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two pages, two full pages with pictures.  There was no bloggers commenting.  They had whatever the guy, Thomas Wolfe or whatever, commenting.  Everybody commenting who doesn't have a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Tom Wolfe says, blogs will never go anywhere.  Ah, New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the term blog isn't 10 years old. I mean, there have been online diaries for plenty of time.  No, but how old is the term blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Justin, that's right, Justin Hall.  Justin Hall, 1995. Anybody see the movie Homepage?  No.  Nobody's seen the movie Homepage. Justin Hall.  He worked at ZDTV.  He worked, and he also worked at Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he didn't, but we had him on Call for Help. I remember having him on, in fact,  there was full frontal male nudity on his website.  I know, that was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I never forget that.  He was the first journalist, as in journal person, person who ran a journal,  and he had a movie made about him called Homepage.  And it was about him teaching kids how to do HTML in order to create their own journals  and tell their stories about their life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really, this is as old as the web. To say it's 10 years old is absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Justin Hall was absolutely the first blogger, although it was not called a blogger,  and that was in 1994, 1995. This was before the web had backgrounds.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, back then when he was doing that teaching, he actually said he would go anywhere to teach  as long as he got a bus ticket and a couch to sleep on.  I remember that.  That was, I think, his only form of payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a kid, too, then. I mean, he was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was in college. He was 20 years old, 19, 20 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, happy anniversary to the blog, whenever.  25th anniversary of the virus. I'm sure there's a virus predates that that'll make that mood as well.  I do thank you guys for joining us. It's really been great. What a great panel.  David Spark, you don't want me to give a plug to your old site. You've got some new sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, sparkminute.com or sparkmediasolutions.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And those are the places to find more sparkle in your life.  There you go.  So great to talk to you again. And we'll get you back many, many times on Twitter.  I want to make you a regular. Same thing with you, Jason.  Thank you, bud.  You've redeemed yourself. You are not the blood-sucking vampiric demon others have claimed.  Why, you're just a mild-mannered entrepreneurial guy.  So you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I'd like you to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm never playing Texas Hold'em with you. I'll tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good thing that he's not a vampire because my family has a history of killing vampires.  Really? Is that true?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  In Castlevania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, in Castlevania.  Calacanis.com. That's the home of the Calacanis cast and also the iPhone contest on Mahalo.  Because you could win one too.  Calacanis.com.  And I'm going to give you one more, one last plug, Veronica, for bol.cnet.com.  From now on, it's Tom Merritt and Molly Wood will have to come on and plug Buzz Out Loud.  You'll be on Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can find all my personal blog at veronicabellamont.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always know when somebody's about to leave their job because they start plugging their personal blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Find more information there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always a sign.  I think, Jason, you made a very good move. Veronica is absolutely a superstar and I can't wait to see what she does on Mahalo.  So when does that start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hopefully in August. I've still got some time to figure out where I'm shooting from here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll be up here. You'll stay up here, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm totally staying in San Francisco. But I'll be down in Santa Monica quite a bit as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where the Calacanis cast studios are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Mahalo offices. And we're thrilled to have Veronica here with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Oh, I forgot to mention our Audible Book of the Week.  Any of you do Audible.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do sometimes.  I love Audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've done Audible many times.  They are a sponsor of, actually most of the network now, and offer a free book to anybody who's not yet an Audible member at Audible.com slash twit.  I'm going to recommend a book called Shadow Divers. Somebody reminded me of this.  Great, great book. I bought it on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that awesome?  It is the greatest audiobook. I never read the book.  But Shadow Divers, told by the guy who wrote the book, amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anthony Schieffer sent me an email reminding me about this. And, Anthony, I thank you.  It was one of my favorite Audible books ever.  It's about deep sea divers and their recovery of a German submarine, a U-boat, that had been lost but nobody knew about.  And they discovered it off the coast of New England. That's a fascinating story.  True story, chills and thrills, and a great, it is a wonderful audiobook.  You're really right there.  That is Shadow Divers. It is our book of the week.  You can get a free copy of that or any book Audible offers.  If you're in the U.S., there are some limitations if you're outside the U.S.  But do check Audible.com slash twit. Do a little search there, and you'll see which books you can get.  And you get a free book.  And we do thank Audible for their support. It's a great service.  If you've never done a book on tape, try this free one because you'll see why we love it.  If you listen to podcasts, you're a natural Audible listener.  Audible.com and Shadow Divers highly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awesome. Oh, this book, I like for two or three flights, I just listen to it because that's the great thing about Audible.  You download it, you got on your thing.  And then when you're on a flight, you know, you've listened to your Jay-Z album for the 12,000th time.  Enough Jay-Z.  No, and this book is riveting.  And the guy who does the voiceover on it is awesome.  And it's definitely one of the five best audiobooks I've listened to. I've probably listened to over a hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Robert Kirsten is the author, and Michael Pritchard reads it.  And he's one of the Audible's best readers. He's really, really good.  Great. Really great.  The comedian Michael Pritchard?  No, it's not that much. You know, it's funny because Michael Pritchard, I think it's spelled differently,  but I think Michael Pritchard does do some books. He's very funny.  The comedian.  The comedian. But this is a different Michael Pritchard who does a lot of Audible stuff.  And he's really, he's, I agree with you, Jason. He's, I think, my favorite reader on Audible.  Anyway, enough of that. Audible.com slash twit. And thank you all.  We do have some twit hoodies for sale on the website, twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gee, a print magazine in trouble. Who'd have guessed that?  Yeah, I'm working.  I mean, I would never go back to print. Although, the whole way the AOL deal with Weblogs Inc. went down  was because I was meeting with Time Magazine.  Oh, really?  Because I was trying to pitch them on doing an Engadget quarterly.  Oh, interesting.  And I wanted them to give us a couple million dollars a year to do a Gatling or travel blog as a MOOC,  a magazine book like O'Reilly did. It was funny because he had the same idea I had,  which was I had always been buying these graphic novels or looking at those Japanese magazines for cars.  And I would give them to the bloggers and say, hey, check this out.  There's got to be some good content in here. You can get all this crazy stuff that's in this Japanese MOOC.
