Transcript:  Also on his yearly visit to twit Jeff Kanata is here  We talked to him every week every year after e3 we gotta do this more often Jeff Kanata  of course the host of the totally rad show on  Revision 3 and just a great guy all around nice to have you back Jeff. Thank you very much, Leo  It's great to be here  So there really are there's you know two big things in you know to talk about this week one is e3 which wrapped up this  Week and the other is tomorrow's worldwide developers conference Apple has a big show in fact their last big show  They only do one a year now and  All the rumors indicate that they're gonna be some big-time announcements, so we'll we'll talk about both those stories  Let's start with with e3  Jeff you were down there obviously  Yeah sure was some said this was a kind of a dully three  But I think maybe dull from a gaming point of view is all sequels  I don't think there were any new franchises introduced, but there are a couple really

Start time: 246.90
End time: 265.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a couple of surprise new IPs a game called watch dogs from  Ubisoft was kind of a big surprise  And some people are even saying that might be the first of the next generation games to sort of secretly be revealed  They didn't say was next-gen, but it certainly looks like it isn't possible in current-gen hardware

Start time: 265.38
End time: 278.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so Ubisoft which does of course Assassin's Creed and  And and always has enough you know Assassin's Creed the next Assassin Creed every year at 83  Actually doing so what is different about watch dogs? Is it a first-person shooter?

Start time: 279.56
End time: 358.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a it's an open-world game kind of like Grand Theft Auto  I love those you you're in control of  basically the character you play has this cool hacking ability with his  Futuristic cell phone and he can hack into any part of the city that's connected to the internet  So this is kind of you know near future where he can hack into for example a series of  Stoplights to cause a car crash or hack into people's  You know Facebook accounts or whatever and find out information about them secrets about them that he can use to his advantage  So he's always connected all the time to this massive network  And it looked like a really really interesting fresh concept which is all too rare at e3 these days  I think it looks cinematic it looks really cool. Yeah, well it definitely looks very beautiful  Which is why a lot of people are thinking that this might not actually be  Aimed at current gen  Systems there probably will be a version for current gen systems, but it will likely not look like that target video  Which is you know exciting for those of us that are excited about the the next-gen hardware, and it didn't really make an appearance this year  But we got to see you know unreal for kind of  Make a make a little bit of a tech demo  And we get to see it a glimpse at what these these next-gen systems might be showing us even if  They weren't actually there

Start time: 358.96
End time: 368.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  And it really is true that the we the PlayStation and three and the Xbox 360 are all three very long in the tooth  I mean we are well overdue aren't we for new console hardware?

Start time: 369.24
End time: 391.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely and one of the big trends that I noticed at the show was that all the games that looked really spectacular  That will have console versions. They were demoing them on PCs with  Console controllers plugged in them interesting  Yeah, I think we're at that point now where PCs are just far outstripping what consoles can do and so I think it's it's  About about that time for new consoles to debut well

Start time: 391.22
End time: 402.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also kind of good news for PC gamers that you know who have felt a little left out for a while that they now  Are so far ahead of what consoles could do that that's where the future of high-end gaming is gonna go

Start time: 403.14
End time: 426.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's always that pendulum  You know we go to with the new consoles get announced and all of a sudden you can get  Bleeding edge tech for three or four hundred bucks  And that's really where all the excitement is and that's where you know the high-end is sitting and then as those years go by  The pendulum swings the other side and and you know a $1,500 PC is gonna be so much better than what the consoles can do  You really see the bleeding edge tech over there, right? So, right? I

Start time: 428.62
End time: 452.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Want to talk about I?  okay, I may be wrong, but I think that the bit there were really the two big stories were the we you and  And  And and the biggest story at least from the tech point of view was Microsoft smart glass and what what Microsoft's doing with the Xbox 360  We'll talk about that  But let me find out from you Andy if there was if you had I mean you watched it from afar  Although it wasn't so hard to do it was on TV

Start time: 453.80
End time: 522.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's just so much as just was Jeff was saying before there's just so much noise  You pretty much have to be 2,000 miles away. Just protect your hearing  But yeah, I mean I thought I thought it was really interesting just just to see the different perspectives  Presented from those three different major major  presentation events where Nintendo really wanted to say that we have a  Relevance in the future of gaming as their fortunes start to wane  Microsoft there were really there were a lot of really nice game demos  But a lot of it was talking about to me the the strength of their whole platform  Not just whatever new titles are coming out this year. I did think the South Park demo was pretty cool  For kind of the flip reason of why those next-generation games seem so cool  It's great to see absolutely cinematic looking games  But it's just as impressive when you see a game whose only goal it is to make it make a live gameplay  animation look just as good as the animation that everybody's already completely intimately familiar with from the  week  And and and Parker and Stoneward were making that point that it's really really hard to make a game console do  Really crappy animation the way that we do it

Start time: 524.70
End time: 534.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny when they first did South Park people looked thought it was like cardboard cutouts  Because that's what it was intended to look like but they were using weren't they using like a cray supercomputer to do it

Start time: 534.36
End time: 642.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're using silicon graphics workstation. Yeah, yeah, they're do all the stuff to mimic the shadows and mimic that sort of movement  So that's that's that's actually I'm looking looking forward to seeing but also they're really making a big point about how their connect  system is gonna inform a gaming where you have a  Soccer games and Madden football where you can actually just bark out the plays and  Remove a lot of that menu structure clutter that's on the screen of so many games by speaking of it  and then you know talking to talk about smart glass and  that's really really interesting because the next year's worth of work is going to be to  Someone has to lay claim to the TV sets of the world right and no one's really done it yet  I mean Xbox they they had a very they opened up their their event with a very  Very Steve Jobs Tim Cook like opening which is to spark out a lot of numbers  And we are now the number one gaming platform in the entire world. We used to be in just in the country  But now we've had the world  But it's still a gaming system  The next step is to convince people that's not just for games  It really is for all kinds of streaming entertainment  It seemed as though every single act of their presentation was just all about how here's another kind of content  We're gonna be bringing to the Xbox down  Here's another way that we're gonna make it more relevant not just for people who have like  Having extra fingers surgically installed to to increase their reaction times on games  But also to make it more relevant for maybe middle-aged people who don't aren't interested in gaming at all  But who really understand seeing Game of Thrones and being able to follow along  A complicated plot without having to call their kids over to say who is that guy? Is that the guy from the station?  Class  When they're demonstrating that they had the part of the demonstration they had it wasn't

Transcript:  I was instantly transported when I was taking care of my mom watching watching that Jack Black movie  I shallow hell which had this funny movie with this odd  Conceit in which Jack Black's character has been hypnotized into thinking that when the paltrow is actually like a  Slinky sexy supermodel type which is of course for her actual body type when in the the character  The her character is actually about three or four hundred pounds and so I'm out there on my sofa and try my wait a minute  So who's the fat woman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all about well as the move and are the connect flops

Start time: 714.70
End time: 742.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all not at all  It's just interesting that the the focus on those things has moved all we heard from the connect this year was was voice control  And so now it's all about voice control and social social is the big new frontier and everybody is talking about  Tablets and how we could connect your phone and your tablet to games in new ways and of course Nintendo is is giving you a tablet  With their new new system, so everybody I think is buying into that idea, and it's an exciting you're talking about the Wii U

Start time: 743.66
End time: 755.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean the weirdest video of somebody doing a  Wii fit standing on the platform looking down at the Wii U on the ground and then up at the screen  That's just that's a recipe for disaster

Start time: 756.28
End time: 763.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  And privy to information that I'm not but but it seems like they're more concerned with little brothers and  Husbands whose wives want to use the television exactly that's our market  Maybe that's a huge market that I'm doing  You know that I just not you know not connected to but I think little brothers will love having their own screen  But for me as as a kind of hardcore gamer, it's not something that I'm I'm excited about and then

Transcript:  Sony kind of left out because all they have is really the PS Vita, so they're gonna say that's a second screen

Start time: 801.22
End time: 828.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of an expensive second screen. Well the cross connectivity that they're showing with the Vita is pretty cool  Okay, the big thing they're leaving out is any kind of pricing structure that makes it viable  I mean if I have to buy a game twice on right different systems in order to play that it's a little less  Attracted to me than if they're saying well  Hey, you know throw throw in a second version of the game on this other console for a reduced price  I think that would be something exciting that they didn't mention so so really the most compelling is is

Start time: 829.62
End time: 843.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft's offering an Xbox 360 looks like Microsoft is saying we want to make more than a gaming machine  This is going to be a set-top box. That's going to give you all sorts of  Video and connectivity this is a competitor to the Apple TV or the Roku right?

Start time: 843.50
End time: 869.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean isn't that what they're saying I think from a tech perspective. Yeah, that is the most exciting thing  I think from games perspective Sony's sure certainly showed a whole host of really exciting interesting titles  But yeah, Microsoft is definitely doing that thing that they said they were gonna do about eight or nine years ago  Yeah, they've always wanted to do it. Yeah, yeah convergence box for the for the home, and it's really happening  You know they showed all kinds of new sports stuff that they're gonna be doing and like I don't know what is smart glass though

Start time: 871.62
End time: 924.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a it's really interesting that they're supporting Android and iOS  So it's basically an app that you'll be able to do on those devices and of course on Windows phones and Windows tablets as well  But it'll allow you well it allowed developers to use it in all sorts of different ways  But basically it's a set of protocols that allow your tablet or your phone to sync up with stuff. That's on your TV  However a developer wants to do that so if you're watching a television show like Game of Thrones or a film  It'll maybe give you extra info on your on your tablet or if you're playing a video game  maybe certain menu items will come up on your tablet or  Someone will log on and request a game and that'll come up on your tablet rather than on your TV screen  There's really interesting applications for that software  And it's certainly exciting that you can do it with as they're saying things you already own you already own your phone  You already own your tablet, and it'll work on anything and that's really exciting and I think they're smart

Start time: 924.80
End time: 928.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not saying you have to have a Windows 8 tablet  to do this

Start time: 930.30
End time: 976.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was an aggressive move against both Nintendo and Apple because Nintendo is saying we're gonna we have this great gamepad  Tablet, but you're gonna have to lay out extra money  And it's only gonna be working with our games  And we got to hope that developers are gonna want to support this thing that we don't know if we're gonna sell a lot  Of or not right Apple whatever they do with Apple TV whether it's the Apple TV or the Apple no space TV  That's being rumored you can bet that they're not gonna have a lot of support for Android or for  Windows phone devices. This is all gonna be an all Apple logoed mobile show so they're saying that hey look  We're not gonna force you to rebuy a whole bunch of stuff. We're not gonna limit you to one set of choices  We're gonna give you that second screen experience with just the all you got to do is download a free app for whatever device  You already have so that's a really really powerful move

Start time: 976.12
End time: 996.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think seems Sony fumbled this one because Sony PlayStation has a blu-ray DVD in it it has Netflix  I mean it has the potential to do all of this it seems like Sony Jeff is that is am I crazy?  But this seems like Sony just kind of missed the ball on this  They could make a very credible set-top box there's Sony

Start time: 997.48
End time: 1067.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do have a lot of the features that that the Xbox has to be quite honest  They're not trumpeting them in the same way that Microsoft is well, and they don't have a consistent strategy around it either  You know Microsoft announced Amazon streaming and it had already be on the ps3 right it is it was already there  So there's there Sony is doing a lot of really interesting things  But they have this whole other arm of the company this digital film arm right? I don't think they're leveraging  Effectively I think they really could be and you know they're making a big hullabaloo about  Their their online service, and they gave everybody in the audience at e3 a year subscription to PlayStation Plus  I think that is still has solidified into something that's really attractive for mainstream gamers  The it's interesting that they give away things for free  You know you can put on the PlayStation online service for free in contrast to Microsoft's gold membership  Which is $60 a year, but  This this PlayStation Plus, which does require a fee  They're giving away games and doing certain things, but it doesn't seem to have the same kind of  Broad entertainment appeal that that's some of the things that Microsoft is doing

Start time: 1068.12
End time: 1081.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course Apple could throw a monkey wrench into all of this Andy tomorrow if they announced apps on the existing  Apple TV because then presumably you could do anything that you could do except that you have to have Apple all Apple

Start time: 1082.48
End time: 1226.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and also that really is the problem  I mean would they really throw a monkey wrench in it with I don't really think they're in a position right now where they  Can disrupt this market?  This is something that I was when I wrote about this for the Sun Times last week about e3  I was saying that whereas Apple  Whereas with Apple TV Apple has what they actually call a hobby with the with the Xbox  Microsoft has a market leading product, and there's a difference between those two right so it really depends  It really does depend on how each of these companies succeeds or fails in sending that message  I think Sony's problem is that they are still perceived as a  It's a gaming of the PlayStation is a gaming console with a few extra value adds  Incorporated into it just like they'll throw Netflix onto a lot of their smart TVs  They'll throw Amazon instant video onto a lot of their blu-ray disc players  There's just things that we get will give you for free  Microsoft it really is being really aggressive and saying that we are bringing independent content to this box  This is a network a streaming network computer  That's X that excels at playing local games  but also can take in any content that you're interested in anywhere in the internet and put it onto that big screen and  Given that they already really have a really large beachhead of people who aren't just simply hobbyist users or don't just use the  Apple TV is largely used to connect your stream stuff off of your iPad onto onto your screen  Xbox is really the center of the living room for so many households  It is the focal point of couch activity for a lot of these families  And so once they simply say that hey, we're just gonna make your existing subscriptions to our service even more valuable  Apple's gonna have to suddenly say here's why you really really want to have our little  $99 hockey puck no subscription required device on your TV or here's why you want to give us  $1,800 for our own day dedicated device  And I think that the way that they're gonna have to do that is by being the company that has the media cloud to bring in  Extra content that isn't available on any other service  I mean if I could just get I've always said the gold standard of my cable box is Turner classic movies for other people  It's a different channel, but if I could just buy get a Turner classic movies app for my Apple TV  That's about 40% along the way towards canceling my cable subscription  I would use Apple TV for just about everything if they can strike those deals  That's gonna be the differentiation that really can disrupt things as is they really have to start  Pounding the boards and convincing people that Apple has a wonderful plan for your TV set just as a just as they once had a  Wonderful plan for your phone and a wonder and a wonderful plan for your tablets

Start time: 1227.34
End time: 1251.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's actually more than its deals. I'll agree with you deals because you have to content, but it's also integration  It's also ease of use. It's also UI. Yeah, I mean that's where for instance Sony seems I look I'm sitting with a nice TV  Actually have a project a 10-foot projection screen as well attached to a PlayStation 3 and it's a great gaming box  But I'm kind of thinking I really wish I had an Xbox 360 on it because that seems like that's where the future lies

Start time: 1252.72
End time: 1255.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember that that was another big. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I think I have to say what I was gonna say

Start time: 1257.82
End time: 1272.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Perhaps not I helped me buy help me choose. What do I buy? I have an Apple TV  I have a PlayStation 3 do I have to have an Xbox 362?  I did give away the Nintendo Wii. I'm sorry. I'm not keeping that I'm not buying a Wii U

Start time: 1273.90
End time: 1346.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find this conversation fascinating because it kind of points to the whole issue with e3 at this point  Which is it's such a bifurcated conference as far as messaging because here we are on a tech centric  Podcast and we're talking about how Microsoft is clearly the leader  Why is in kind of bringing entertainment to this convergence box?  But if you're if you're talking to a very hardcore gaming audience, which I am a lot of times  Everybody was really disappointed Microsoft because they didn't feel the focus was on the games enough  So they're almost a servant of two masters in these conferences and it's hard to please anybody where it's like we show  the newest latest best games or do we you know kind of try to please investors and and the tech crowd of looking for what is  ostensibly a  Entertainment product an entertainment box in our living room and it's hard  To get all that across in these in these conferences and you saw Nintendo struggling with that as well  I mean, they're not so much trying to do the entertainment thing, but they kept saying over and over  Oh, we don't have enough time to talk about this. Oh, well at the second  We'll have the second press conference later to talk about that  It's a really tricky and I think it left a bad piece in a lot of people's mouths with this e3 just purely from the press  Conferences point of view. Yeah

Start time: 1348.12
End time: 1376.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a very interesting that the console game  Platforms have not been updated because technology is moving so fast and they have been around it's almost ten years in some cases  Mm-hmm. That's a long time  I don't you're not gonna see  huge improvements in quality  Again, right until we get a new platform Jeff. Are we gonna have new platforms next year? I think so  Yeah, I mean, so that sounds like I shouldn't buy anything right now

Start time: 1378.08
End time: 1402.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is sort of the waning days of these consoles the good news about it being waning days  Is that the level of quality in the software is really high because the developers know these consoles inside and out  So you're getting really that's right and software taking full advantage of the hardware, right?  But it's it's kind of late to hop on if you've been holding out, right? Right by a used one

You just walk out your door in the Staples Center is right there  so much nicer  Yeah, no, I know how you feel  Well, very you know, it's very interesting. I think Microsoft has actually shown that some life in this and it's  In I think if anybody's a winner here, it looks like Microsoft has has kind of surprisingly  Put themselves in a very interesting position as more than a game machine  But as a set-top box as well and I just feel like Sony as you say Jeff had it  Has it all and just hasn't been able to make a credible story around. Yeah, and the real

Yeah, the Wii U is finally HD  We use finally HD but by the time it debuts we don't even know the date on that yet  But I'm in debuts all of the hullabaloo is gonna be about these next gen consoles  And it's gonna feel again like we're you know, one step behind and it's so strange their conference  They spent so much time on Batman Ark City, which is a game.

Transcript:  This is the same exact Sony processor and lens that they're using the iPhone 4s. Have you taken pictures with it?  Yeah, the software is not as good but there's some features that I like for instance  It has a panorama feature built in that's very it's so fast that you don't the stitching is done before  You even put the phone down I'll go I'll show you took a panorama a couple of days ago of  Graduation let me pull it up on my desktop and you could see the detail in this is phenomenal  I took it sideways so I'd get more more megapixels  It allows you I think to stitch nine images together. I can't stop shooting panoramas. Actually, it's kind of a bad habit now

Start time: 2046.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, this is see there's also something that Apple really needs to do  They really need to open up the camera API so that any anybody who oh there go  Apple really the one I tend to like  Android camera apps more than I like Apple's built-in iPhone app because on Android you can actually just do something as simple as simply say  Look, I don't want to have to like fumble and tap on like the place that I want to you to do exposure  Point from you just this the last one was a little bit dark  You just simply like over expose it by stop and call it like that  That's a feature of just about every built-in Android phone Android camera phone. Exactly  You can't do that on  On an iPhone because you have access to the camera  But you don't have access to like low level features of its operation  So Apple I really wish Apple would just open up all the API's and let people write  Whatever camera the app that they want that takes takes advantage of the full Samsung camera app is pretty good

I think the Apple software is probably marginally better in terms of the resulting photos  But this is the same hardware as Apple is selling so you basically you've got  Apple now the pressure is on I think with it with an X iPhone and they have a few months  So it's you know, they have time to to do something. But boy, this is if you could see this in person Andy

Transcript:  well, it depends one of the one of the  Biggest rumors is that they're gonna change the aspect ratio of the screen for the first time for the entire series of the iPhone  And they might have to talk to developers about how they're gonna be able to support  a single iPhone app that can be the 16 by 9 or whatever the new aspect ratio is  And the old kind if they have to do that then they might have to at least show off this new phone

Start time: 2197.14
End time: 2211.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think so? Yeah, because you're right. They have to tell developers. Hey get ready guys. Here it comes  And you know we have seen that part and there's I think in my mind now now that you've seen video as well as  pictures of the new iPhone frame that that's a genuine part, right?

Start time: 2212.76
End time: 2291.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, also this is right about the time when you would  If this part video had come out and let's say February you would think okay  It's another person who came across some sort of a part from some sort of production line and decided to you know  So the laser laser carve an Apple logo on it and call it like an actual iPhone 5 part  Right before a developer event where supposedly they're gonna have a lot of engineer where they might be able where Apple might be preparing to  Actually take the wraps off of something  this is when security tends to dip a little bit by necessity and you at least start to  Open your mind a little bit to the possibility that these kind of leaks are genuine  Mean you can barely keep up with all the rumors that start flying starting four days before keynote and it's because  Suddenly they have to start giving more information to the retail channel  Suddenly stores have to be ready to stock things not just the Apple stores, but the independent stores  Priceless start to appear and so that's when you really start to it's it's difficult to really turn off the flow and for  Information because so much of that information is actually good now  Yeah  But yeah, I agree with you that does look like a really good part if it if it's a if it's a fake or if it was  For some sort of a you know Shenzhen back alley fake iPhone  They've really went to incorrect lengths  For a very simple demo. How does this change things? I mean it so it's taller

Transcript:  Looks tall and thin what is it?

Start time: 2296.50
End time: 2414.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's it's definitely taller that would the the the  Leading theory is that Apple wants to have a foreign screen?  however, they don't want to make it thicker and they don't want to lose the concept of  We have an actual retina quality display where the resolution is so high the human  I can't distinguish individual pixels and so rather than make it actually larger like an Android phone  They're keeping the regular width but changing it to like a more wide-screen aspect ratio that'll let them give that'll let them have a four-inch screen  And will let them have a retina display  But if they stretch the display like that that'll give them an extra bank of pixels to deal with so  That one answer to that might be that they'll let you run legacy apps by just simply centering it within a window  another might be that they're going to have like a different type of  The the developers can create  Graphics and uis for this different layout screen if it's available and another idea might be that they're just going to use that extra space  For something system-wide like not just a home button, but a home  Like a home dock that's persistent or some some element of UI that never goes away  This the the the case part is actually a back plate so you don't see the front plate  Right, so if they decided to make the home button actually a soft button from now on where it's always on the screen  But it's no longer mechanical button that might be one way to get that answer  But I don't think that Apple would get rid of their one mechanical button  I do think that that having one distinct button that you can activate by touch without having to orient yourself visually  I think that's an actual big feature also remember that one big mechanical button is what makes the iPhone one of the no  not one of the the most  Accessible device for people with low vision and and vision impairment out there, so I don't think they'll get rid of it  I can't guess as to what the extra aspect ratio is going to be for but I hope that I hope they don't just make  We don't want to make it bigger so we decided to come up with this oddball aspect ratio just so that we can make ourselves

Transcript:  Happy the thing that's very scary or odd is that the bottom now doesn't look like it has a 30 pin connector  Yeah, that looks like it's roughly the size of a micro USB connector. Do you think that's where Apple is heading?

Start time: 2427.00
End time: 2483.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They might be deciding to change the change to a new connector  I don't think that would go to micro USB because remember that that 30 print connector they use so many of those those signals  It's not just for data and it's not just for power. There's also a video channel. There's also a  There's also an audio channel. That's how you can oftentimes plug in microphones to that jack  So they would have to come up with something that would duplicate that kind of functionality in a smaller form factor  So proprietary connector then it would also be exactly remember. That's also a way that Apple Apple  maintains control over third-party accessories because you have to license that and if you want to make an actual iPhone compatible accessory  The other interesting thing is if you look at the bottom, they also move the headphone jack right next to it  It's on the bottom now, right?  Yeah  So and that makes sense too instead of having this thing that looks now that looks like a Christmas cracker with wires coming out of  The top and the bottom and it may as well have them both coming out of the bottom which is like, you know aiming toward

Start time: 2483.80
End time: 2499.56

Transcript:  The head anyway, right? I guess what I'm worried about is I think so many people have such an investment in 30 pin  Accessories that including Doc's and I mean I have a lot of huge investment in that  All of those are maybe Apple sell a $50 connector. I don't know

Start time: 2500.32
End time: 2538.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly where I guess what I'm hoping most of more than anything else that I hope they have a darn good reason for disrupting  Everything that if they can say that we became what we this this connector served us really really well for three four years  We it's under serving us now for all the stuff we want to do in the future  So here's now what this new micro port is gonna do for us. Okay, then I can see that  But if it's just that well, we were upset that we were absolutely we're finding a way  We're looking for a way to shave an extra two-thirds of a millimeter off of it  And unfortunately this plug was just getting in the way so we had to redesign a smaller plug  But hooray, our new iPhone is now two-thirds of a millimeter slimmer than the old one

And of course we knew that there would be  iOS 6  Spoken about now iOS 5 was a big jump big improvement for iPad and iPhone  I think we could safely assume this will be more incremental  But there will be one massive change at least according to the rumors and that is the Google Maps will no longer be part of  The operating system. I suppose you'll still be able to get Google Maps from Google as an app  But Apple has its own map app  With 3d and a lot of features and I think that's all pretty credible since they've been buying mappings  companies for the last couple of years at least three mapping companies and they even admitted when they got in that kerfuffle over  collecting data on the iPhone and storing it that what they were really doing is trying to save data for a  Future app that would tell you about traffic conditions  So not much of a surprise if they do in fact dump Google Maps Google kind of I think is expecting this because Google had its  own mapping  Event on Wednesday a minor mapping event in which they talked about new features of Google Maps for Android  They have turn-by-turn and they wanted to have offline maps. You can download them ahead of time. And yeah, what a surprise  3d imagery they also have go back a little bit there Chad because there's a great shot of the guy with the Google backpack  That you walk around it's the new Street View trekker  version, you know about Street View the special cars they drive around take pictures of  What it looks like from street level now  they have one that you can walk around Yosemite or a

I really do think we're gonna say I believe the rumors  I don't know and you let me know what you think but and Jeff too  But I believe the rumors that we're gonna see retina displays. We're gonna see new MacBook Pros  We I think we might see new Mac Pros. I'm sure the developers in the audience will be happy to hear that  Featuring USB 3 as well as as well as a Thunderbolt which the back pros currently do not have  I would love to see new MacBook airs with retina displays. I think that would be very cool  You agree Andy, I mean we've seen the parts list. Yeah, we've seen parts lists

This is happening so close to WWDC and that  Stocks on replacement hardware has have been kind of low of the past a month or two  That's pretty good indication.

It's the one display that after I've been after I've been using it for a couple days  It's like oh man, that really is kind of hard kind of small. Yeah, but it's I I  Would be really surprised if they can actually put it into that machine and still have a $999 price point  But hey, they put into a $490 iPad. So what do I know?  The other the other idea is that's not so much that they're gonna be cramming more megapixels into the display itself  But simply making existing graphics easier to read and that they're gonna do away with  Monitor settings that show you well, here is the pixel resolution at this level at this level at this level  They're just gonna simply say here is the amount of density of the display  You can have a good better best and awesome  And just take your pick as to what is gonna be best in your eyes and what you need for this whatever display

I don't see I  Spoke before about there's certain leading indicators that  Cause me to believe that a rumor is true above and beyond the actual reality of what I'm looking at  I have not seen  Incidental indicators that there is a smaller iPad coming out tomorrow if they and if they did that  I'm not sure that they would want to take the wraps off of it tomorrow

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't well. Yeah, the theory is that Apple right now?  Absolutely owns tablets there is just no challenge  whatsoever as I mean people  Another thing I wrote last week at the line that I was proud of if maybe needlessly so it's all repeated here people compare Android  Tablets the Titanic well it no that's not fair because the Titanic did not back off and re-rim the iceberg twice  And that's why the tiny Titanic is actually better than the Android tablet  but  But it's the the idea is that Apple might decide Apple might have decided they want to go into 7-inch tablets  Just to make sure that no one else can get a foothold Tim Cook and previous  Market market calls have talked has been asked questions about the Android excuse me the Android based Kindle fire tablet  Acknowledging that it's a good product and knowledge that's doing okay  But also saying that according to their research and their beliefs they don't believe that the Kindle fire is competing with the iPad  But at some point somebody's gonna have a big enough success that they're gonna feel like  They're leaving so much either. They're leaving money on the table, or they're creating an opportunity for somebody else  I think that that's it's not exactly a 7-inch tablet for Apple  I don't think it's necessarily the third rail  It's not as though they would never touch it, but they were pretty vocal about how they thought about a 7-inch tablet  They will fully skipped over it in favor of a 10-inch tablet  They don't think a 7-inch tablet really really works  But there could be a time when they're gonna need if the market says that hey we really love these 7-inch tablets  We love having something that we don't necessarily need to carry around in a separate laptop bag for  And we don't really want this to be a full iPad like experience  We just want a really really good e-reader  And if they figure out that you know what we can make a really good one of those we can make a really big  iPod touch for $199 and absolute eat absolutely eat everybody's lunch with it  And we end more importantly do it better than that Amazon is doing it with the Kindle fire  Then maybe they'd sick of toeing to see how it worked looks like by the way

Transcript:  I just saw a report that the Kindle fire is not in fact the number two tablet  Samsung is number two in the tablet market Kindle fire a distant third  So it not exactly that what that shows me is it's not just price people really are looking for functionality that no there isn't a  $200 market for a $200 tablet market if you're gonna buy because nobody needs a tablet  So if you're gonna buy a tablet you're gonna buy an iPad probably right and you're not gonna surely go for it

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen in the near future a couple reasons being that we live in digital  Digital world so we feel as though everybody's buying their comic books digitally. Everybody's getting all their entertainment digitally. Everybody would buy  Streaming HBO when actually that's just a fraction of the actual market for it  So you're asking HBO to like really really screw up relate their biggest money-making  Relationships with all the cable companies in order to start selling a service that would then require the cable companies help to deliver via broadband  So that's never gonna fly and the other thing is that it's my understanding that HBO go is not served by HBO  It's actually served through it's actually served through the same cable company that you're subscribing from so then HBO would have to figure out  How are we gonna serve all this content ourselves?  And it's just it's just a big mess. I agree though  I would buy channel after channel all a cart and I  As I keep a real evaluating that question about cutting the cable. I keep thinking about well  How difficult would it be to simply say I don't like the I don't like the idea of having to go out and look for Game of  Thrones off of a torrent every time I want to get access to it to a show  But it would it be so difficult for me to wait a year to be a year behind  But still be able to get this stuff like just for one  $36 payment and then and then own all the episodes as opposed to getting it part one week at a time and then  Mediocre resolution that I can't keep on my iPad. So I don't know it gets closer and closer every single time

Transcript:  Think I think that's okay  and I have to admit that I did the exact same thing when it comes to digital comics because I just got tired of waiting for  For Marvel in DC to start actually making their stuff available  so my my rule was that if I had paid for it in some format before if I'd gone to the comic book shop and  actually bought this copy of  Fantastic Four number 23 or whatever then I felt as though I had a I didn't have a right to do that  But morally I had no problem with then downloading a CBR now it real now that they are actually doing day-in-date  Company wide I feel as though I can't do that anymore because they're offering this to me for sale  I understand I understand the motivation  I just the only way that I can ever really really disagree with somebody is when the this the reaction to this cartoon was so  just  Ellen  So so completely off the hook  that's so many people saying you know what I'm gonna stick it to the man and show them and then send them a message by  Stealing by downloading great with Thrones and it came down to you don't you don't have a right to this  You're not entitled to this you have not been wronged by HBO  by the fact that they decided to release it when they wanted to release it if you decide that you can't you don't really want  To wait a year to get it or you want to be able to watch it on your iPad  You don't want to have to again wait another year for it to come out on iTunes  That's fine admit that but don't say that you're you're you're Patrick Henry making this this this incredibly brave stand you are Johnny  No, want to pay for stuff.

Transcript:  That's the thing. Nobody wants to do anything  On WWDC week because they know this is there's gonna be the news cycle will be owned for a little bit  So that's why Google did all of its announcements last week about the by the way, Google did have a good week  In the Oracle Google case, it's over  In fact, the judge basically gave some of Google's money back  It was an inclusive copyright trial patent trial Oracle lost  Oracle has spent millions of dollars on it and  They essentially will be listed lit limited to the statutory damages which can't be more than a hundred fifty thousand dollars  They say we'll appeal to protect the broader Java community of nine million developers  I think I think that one's over another case that was over with some some extreme prejudice is  A Motorola's patent suit against Apple this kind of surprised me or rather vice versa Apple sued Motorola over things  Like there were two pens, but one was slide to unlock a judge Posner who was sitting unusually on the district court for this one  Basically said it was a frivolous lawsuit  Were you surprised by this Andy we did not get to talk about this on  Mac break weekly this week because it happened. I think our Thursday or Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I  Got see that was surprised by it, but it's a big I've learned big loss for Apple  Yeah, I mean the the the one thing that I've learned though about all of these patent movements  Is that do not predict what's going to happen?  Do not predict the the enforcement of the power of a certain patent and also don't try to guess as to what a company's motive  Is and trying to enforce a patent?  Because man from from inside and from the outside  I've talked to people and I've just gotten so many different opinions all the way across the board about four different actions that I  just have to sort of reset my head said I  That's end thing where I know nothing right? I will talk to people I will try to learn more about this

Transcript:  It is an arcane  The legal the legal profession is fairly arcane and the things are debating perhaps to it or do don't fit the common-sense standard  The judge can't the trial was supposed to start tomorrow the judge canceled it  Saying I have tentatively decided that the case should be dismissed with prejudice because neither party can establish a right to relief  Go Google of course owns Motorola mobility. So Google was involved. He's not gonna judge Posterty said  I will not I will delay the entry of judgment until I've prepared a full opinion  He says it's not gonna change my my ruling but it but I don't want to I may change my reasons for my ruling  But he says I tentatively conclude that it's admissible evidence of damages  That is Apple's claim for damages with respect to those claims do not create a genuine issue to material fact enabling it to withstand  Motorola's motion for summary judgment in effect. He's granting their motion for summary judgment and saying there's no there's nothing here  There's no fire for this smoke kind of a big one because slide to unlock Apple really  I think felt that they had the rights to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm glad I'm glad that it went the way it did because that's just to me to me  That's just that one of the epitome is of too broad a patent and also I  Test so many different Android phones and so many different third-party phones out there all of whom do this really really weird thing  To get you to unlock it because they were terrified of violating a patent on something that's just so damn obvious  But I was surprised that there was a summary judgment more  Most judges seem to be very very conservative and assume that if a patent was awarded than it deserves to be defended  So that's the part of it really surprised me the thing I liked is

Transcript:  All right, we're gonna take a break  I do want to talk about the security issues that we heard a lot about this week including millions of passwords leaked and  flame  It has issued a request to self-destruct  Yikes, this is a this is a scary story  This is a scary story  But first a word as long as we're talking scary about backing up your data with carbonite.com  I talk about carbonite a lot for Mac or PC  It's exactly what you're looking for in a backup plan automatic. That means you don't have to think about it  You don't have to remember to do it. It just does it it's continuous  That means even when you change, you know  You change a one document that that change is gonna be immediately saved not just locally but also in the cloud  It's also secure uses 128 bit SSL so you can use it at any open Wi-Fi access spot whenever you're online anywhere  It's backing up and you can add additional security  In fact strong encryption and you keep the key. They do not have the key  So it is a true trust no one  Product as Steve Gibson calls it  He gave it a thumbs up for the carbonite and it's not even a cloud storage solution  There's not intended to be it's really a backup solution, but it is a very effective cloud storage solution  You can get online and log into your carbonite account on any computer. They have smartphone apps free tablet apps free as well  And there's your stuff  So with these cloud storage and boy it starts as low as $59 a year. That's for everything on an internal drive  so if you want to take a laptop drive not say oh I can only put this on and  I got a worried tonight  No anything all your data on your laptop drive is  Automatically on the cloud automatically safe and it's so easy to restore it  But I don't want you to take my word for it as with all our advertisers  We want you to try before you buy so visit carbonite comm the offer code is twit  That'll give you two weeks free and make sure you do that because if you do decide to buy you'll get  14 months for the price of 12 whatever plan you're using  14 months for the price of 12  Less than five bucks a month to make sure that everything that you do on your hard drive is safe  That seems like a great deal to me carbonite  Com use the offer code to it do check out the plans that they have a variety of plans not just the  Single hard drive plan they've got external drives NASA's  Many computers for small business that kind of thing  So now that we're talking security  LinkedIn has 65 million users  6.5 million passwords were leaked and  Even though they were hashed they were hashed with  SHA 1 and so it's not a completely secure hash you can reverse it  So what they'd so what happened is that the hacker in a Russian forum?  Uploaded six and a half million passwords and said help me  Help me crack them and so if your password was something easy to guess like Facebook  They what you do to crack it is you type Facebook you get the hash out of it  The SHA 1 hash out of it then you search the database for that hash match you got it  You got the guy's password so all the bad passwords were guessed immediately  LinkedIn revealed through a tweet that is looking into  Reports of stolen passwords and said stay tuned and finally three days later sent an email saying and yeah  I took that as an opportunity now by the way mine was  Leaked you there's a website Gina. Trippani told us about this on  This week in Google called leaked in at leaked in org where you can type your password  Say it's Facebook and  Then it will give you the hash and  That's the hash then it searches the database for the hash by the way your password stays local  It's just a little JavaScript that does the SHA is SHA 1 hash  Then it sends that hash  To their servers to check against the database and yes if your password was Facebook it was leaked and cracked

Transcript:  Well, we've learned something though since in the last year since the Sony hack because the Sony hack the passwords weren't even hashed  They were stored in the clear. So now LinkedIn says well, we least we hashed them  Now the next thing of course is to salt the hash and put the salt somewhere safe  So that in fact, no one can figure out what your passwords are. It's a minor detail. They'll get it right eventually  So we all know about flame, right  This is a this is the 20 megabyte malware was discovered last week  It's been around for years and the researchers who discovered it or said it's pretty clear. This was a government effort  It had modules all kinds of modules  To do all kinds of things like turn on the camera and get pictures of people turn on the mic and listen to people  Get passwords and so forth. It was a massive malware attack and had a module called suicide  That  Would delete everything would delete itself  And well, it turns out they didn't use suicide but a command was issued at the flame  CNC servers  to delete flame if it was on your system  So they had apparently at least two suicide mechanisms built into flame. That's how good it was and  Thursday  Oh, here's a good one  Because they keep analyzing this huge keep analyzing they had it was written  You know the glue code was it was written in C and C plus plus the glue code was written in Lua  Which as you know, Jeff was used to World Warcraft scripting language. It's a very it's also Lightroom was written in Lua  So on  Thursday a much more sophisticated capability of flame  This is from the Ars Technica article a much more sophisticated  Capability flame came to light when two of the world's foremost cryptography experts said the malware had achieved a  Mathematic breakthrough  That could only be achieved or have been designed by world-class  scientists

Transcript:  We have confirmed that flame uses a as yet unknown MD five chosen prefix collision attack  That itself is very interesting from a pure science viewpoint  There are already some practical implications  Collision attacks and by the way, Steve Gibson does a much better job of explaining all this and security now this week  It's kind of sort of like what happened with the leaked in password  They've but it's it's two different sources of plain text generate identical cryptographic hashes  So let's say you got the hash from Facebook and it matched another hash from another password. That's a collision  It's long been theorized that these could happen in  2008 a team of researchers using a bank of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles  Finally I use for the ps3  Found collisions in the MD five algorithm, which is long thought to be very reliable and they you know  I mean this isn't too useful  But anyway apparently flame is the first known example of this attack being used in a real-world environment maliciously  And it's how they got it wielded the esoteric technique to digitally sign malicious code with a fraudulent  Certificate that appeared to issue from Microsoft  It allowed flame modules to hijack Windows Update  so that if you had flame on your system and  You did Windows update would update flamed as well. Just the side it nice side. I want to keep up to date  You gotta keep those patches going

It's a cyber warfare tool  And one of the things you want to be able to do you come on  You've seen the born identity  You want to be able to push a button and pull your guys out and have deniability?  So they built that in the flame you push a button and they pushed by the way, the button was pushed this week  We don't know by whom on it, you know, but you can see somebody in the NSA said all crap  Push the button Joe Joe pushes the button and flame deletes itself. So you're saying it's Biden  Joe Biden exactly. It's Joe by many people don't know he's very skilled

Thank you for being here  Always a slice Leo. Yep. He's just love you Andy and do tune in tomorrow 930 a.m. Pacific 1230 p.m  Eastern time we're gonna begin our live coverage a little earlier than the the actual keynote at WWDC  I will be joined by saw Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane from TNT and Chris Breen of Mac world to talk about  the summer of Tim  Because I think it's gonna be the biggest  Product announcement in the history of Apple just watch it's gonna be a huge and we will be there live  Starting 930 Pacific on twit TV. We do this show every Sunday about 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern time  On Twitter TV. That's 2200 UTC. We'd love it. If you watch live. I watch the chat room. We get some great ideas from the chat room  But if you can't don't forget we make audio and video available on our website  And everywhere else that podcasts are available to subscribe including iTunes a little bit of a program note. We are going to  change the format of  Large video if you subscribe to large video we're gonna change that format a little bit and  That's potentially gonna cause some problems with some older devices particularly second generation or earlier  iPod touches will no longer be able to play the video and that's going to be a problem for the future  Play the video and the reason that's a problem  Is  iTunes won't let you know what's going on  iTunes will just stop downloading, you know stop putting the video on your on your iPod touch  So what I want you to do do we is that I think the site's not up  Twit TV watch us we were gonna set up a page, but I guess we haven't done that yet  So we we will set up a page with samples of both kinds of video for you  So you can see whether it'll work it's it's it's still gonna be h.264  It's just we've changed the profile just slightly to make it more up-to-date and frankly more act more more high quality and accurate  But no matter what platform you use the mobile version will always work for you  But it I'm just saying for those of you losing older devices who currently subscribe to large video  You might want to check to see if you get it next to starting next week  And if you don't then you might want to either get a newer device or subscribe to the mobile version, okay  And we will get a page up. It'll be twit TV slash watch  As soon as I can do that  And there are encoding tests right on our blog inside that Twitter TV and you can all go there now because it's a Squarespace blog  So you can't bring it down. All right, without further ado  Clang I give you my friends Neil Stevenson  Neil is of course the author of so many great books including  Kryptonoma con  Anathem his new book is Ream D  He did his famous book snow crash. Yep, the Baroque cycle. Did you read that Jeff?  It's one of my favorite. Oh my god. You are literate. Love it. Holy cow. I could not I have to try again  There's an audio version of it. I'm gonna try that because I just couldn't manage to get through it. Anyway, here is Neil Stevenson  Go ahead and try to rewind it.

I've been writing science and historical fiction for three decades  Well, she looks like a monk straight at the end of the video game  The video game about something really sorry that I enjoy sword fighting  For years now. I've been burning the midnight oil learning everything  I need to know to make this video game in a way that will be faithful to the house of the dead  to the hallowed traditions of swordsmanship  For example in this ancient manuscript, which I uncovered in a crumbling  That's okay, sir Galahad I'll go 20th century on your ass later  I don't actually have an ancient manuscript. This is the cookbook  As long as my little ruse has been detected, why don't I take you on a tour?

We're ready. We've got geeks in suits of armor  We've got geeks in front of computer workstations  We've got a lot of people out there who like to play games with sword fighting him  And who might be ready to step it up to something a little bit more interesting  I really want to start higher the professionals need to turn all of that into something that'll work.
