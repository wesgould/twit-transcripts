Transcript:  You're letting the cat out of the bag. I've got the army outside at the moment.  No, I've got the cats. Well, yes, you have the vaticats, of course, which are always a tremendously fun thing to hang around with, and I'm sure they're used to you.  Okay, so we've got an exciting show this week. When we were originally planning it out, we'd think the Facebook papers had just come out, and it was kind of like, yeah, okay, we'll cover it, but let's try and do something else.  And then, of course, Zuckerberg dropped his bomb and Facebook is meta-sizing, it seems, in possibly the bad way.  But so we'll be covering that. Of course, it's been earnings week as well, so there'll be some elements of that.  We'll be looking at Jeff Bezos' plans for a business park in space.  And the Right to Repair movement got a big step forward this week, so that'll need covering. And of course, the rest of the news from around the tech industry and so whatever else comes up. So let's crack on with Twitter.  Okay, so the elephant in the room. This week, after facing a weeks and weeks of very bad news stories over the Facebook papers,  former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been earning his millions dollar salary and taking a fall for it, just as he did for the Liberal Party back in the UK.  And yes, so we appear to have Facebook is no more. There is now Muse. It's all metaverse. Sorry, it's meta, sorry, rather on Muse.  It's basically a good time for a name change, it seems. So will it work? Brianna, Padre?

Transcript:  You know, I'm very much reminded when I was coming of age here in the United States, we had a company called Value Jet in the 90s that had an absolutely abysmal track record to the point that there were late night punchline year after year.  And people just didn't want to fly that airline. So what did they do? Did they radically change their policies? No, they changed their name to something else and just kept on conducting business because  their name was so toxic, they couldn't move any more forward with it. I'm really reminded of that story with Facebook. And some reporting came out this week that I think is so interesting.  Did y'all read about the moment that Zuckerberg decided to change the name? It actually happened when Oculus released the Quest 2.  And there was an uprising with people saying, no, no, no, no, I do not want to have a mandatory Facebook account in order to use this gadget. I don't trust Facebook. It's completely corrupted.  Don't get us in the same boat. And according to reports, that's the moment that Zuckerberg was like, okay, we need to rebrand the entire company. So is there a predictable move? Yes. But I also think it really signals an abrogation of any responsibility to fix the very serious problems at that company.

Transcript:  Yes, I mean, there are a couple of different ways to look at this. You know, first is standard corporate growth at some point means that you're going to rename your company. It happened to Google, just because you need to have something that encompasses all the different subsidiaries that you're going to buy or develop. That's that's I understand that that's fine. That's going to go every business is going to have that growing pain. There is another element here, which is Facebook and Zuckerberg have realized that Facebook has become top.  The actual name is a negative connotation. That's amazing. To me, that's amazing for a company that's that's this big. I mean, it's it's something like Comcast or Cox, you know, these companies that are huge that everybody uses and yet everybody hates. That's what Facebook has become. And I don't see that changing with the name. I mean, yeah, it worked for value jet because there are so many small carriers that can essentially do the same thing. You've commoditized that service. But with Facebook, there are so many things that are going to change.  There are so few large social media companies and there are none like Facebook. Everyone knows what they're using. It doesn't matter if you're calling it metastasize or meta or muse or whatever it is. It's still Facebook.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, this is it. And I thought it was very interesting from a from a standpoint of they're now grouping Facebook and Instagram. They're just apps and everything else is meta. I wondered whether that was possibly so, you know, when if the regulators do start coming in, then they can say, well, okay, well, we'll just sort Facebook out. But we're all meta now. So, you know, that's it's really different. But I mean, as you say, Google has done this with alphabet. I mean,  back in the UK, we had the wind scale nuclear reactor, which caught fire and spread fallout all over Eastern Europe and they changed the name to wind scale sorry to Sellafield. So I mean, name changes are commonplace. They do work. But will it get Facebook out of this hole?

Transcript:  I don't believe it will. You know, they they made there was a document that came out this week basically talking about Facebook's crisis with trying to hire engineers. You know, in 2020, they put out a huge, huge call for new talent. And by this year, it had fallen flat. Right now in the United States, there's a real the Facebook name is so toxic. They're not able to even get Facebook out of this hole.  They're not able to even recruit talent to the company to fix their existing problems. And that's why I thought it was so notable that you know, disrespect to European engineers, y'all are great. But they're actually having to go to other countries to recruit talent to build what they believe is going to be the  metaverse. They put out a call to hire I believe it was was it 10,000 or 20,000 engineers. It was one of those numbers. But, you know, just imagine how much work they could do repairing their product here, if they invested that kind of infrastructure in it. It's clear that this is just it's a distraction for Zuckerberg in his view. And he's not serious about fixing it. So he's moving on to the next thing. So I think it really signals that Facebook is not serious about addressing their  toxic problems and their toxic perception in the public. And I think we should expect them to continue in this way.

Transcript:  Could we take one step back just to play devil's advocate here.  It's popular to hate on Facebook, because Facebook has done so many things that we the the tech neradi, the digerati have cataloged over the years. But to the common person to an average person who just uses Facebook, because it's where they find their friends and their family, has Facebook really done that much wrong? I hear it all the time when I'm trying to explain how big data can be so dangerous in the hands of unscrupulous operators that they don't care if so and so has their data or they don't care if so and so has their data. And I think that's the biggest problem.  I think Facebook is analyzing their their internet usage patterns. For us, the the branding change is ridiculous, because it doesn't change the underlying company. And like Brianna says, it doesn't change the underlying toxicity. But to mom and pop Joe and and and Jan Smith, who are using Facebook to see photos of their grandkids. Is there really a problem that Facebook has to has to fix?

Transcript:  You know, I don't know, I think it's kind of like cybersecurity, you know, there's never going to be a market based solution to fix cybersecurity, because neither the buyer or the seller, or incentivize to, to pay for it, right? It's only going to be fixed with regulation. And I think expecting the general public to have a, you know, forgive the phrase, Robert, but come to Jesus moment.  About these issues. I just I don't think it's ever going to happen. I don't think it's their role. You know, we don't expect automobiles to get better gas mileage, because consumers are out there demanding it unless we're in a different country, it might have higher petrol prices than the United States.  You know, this is a it's a job for regulators, ultimately, I think it's, it's very dark and disturbing to see Congress has basically abrogated their responsibility to do even bigger oversight here. At the end of the day, Zuckerberg, he's one of us, he's a technologist. And he's made a decision to see no evil hear no evil. He's clearly going to continue on this path. He doesn't think it's a problem. So  I just I think he's he's beyond help.

And they send that information to their friend over WhatsApp. So there's a better understanding. But I think we're still at that point where it's too convenient. And no matter what, even though Facebook seems to be the harbinger of doom for freedom in the Western world.  Too good for them to pass up. And that actually really scares me.

Transcript:  Myself, although I mean, I disagree wildly with what Facebook's been doing, but I still use it because it's the easiest way to keep in contact with friends and family back in the UK. But yes, I mean, for all the bad press they've received, and, you know, it really hasn't hurt the user stats that much. Although looking through their financial figures this week, I have noticed there's a drop off in European use and average revenue per user, which  could be getting people slightly worried. But in terms of the people that could actually change so that this regulators and governments, the US government seems to have basically said, you know, they levied a $5 billion fine, which what three months profits for Facebook, I think they can live with that, you know, probably find it down the back of the sofa, to be honest. But I mean, regulators seem to completely abrogated their responsibility. I mean, Brianna, you're very up on the political scene. Is there any sign of this changing under the Biden administration?

Transcript:  I unfortunately, I don't think so. You know, we have seen, you know, we have seen better digital policy and better, you know, better policy coming out of the FCC overall. Thank God, it could hardly be worse. But I don't get the sense that it's really a priority. I do want to say though, it occurs to me that there is another group of people with the power to influence Facebook. For me, I run a political PAC, and I  write giant checks to Facebook constantly, because they're such an effective vector for getting political advertising out. Yeah, I've been thinking about this. I wonder if there's space for advertisers to kind of come together and demand more from Facebook, right? Like, first of all, they charge us  entirely too much. They're not transparent on the metrics. They've shown time and time again that, you know, in the case of video advertising, they actually can not be honest about the metrics at times. So I wonder if there's space for people that write Facebook's checks to come forward and say, we demand more, you know, we demand better products forming a kind of alliance.

Transcript:  Well, the Facebook is like Facebook is famously the company that said that if a video opens and is played for three seconds, then that counts as a view. Right, right. I mean, it's completely bizarre. Padre, sorry, you were.

Start time: 964.84
End time: 1046.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, okay, so I deal in this space, because one of my responsibilities is the new media outreach. That's that's Twitter. That's Facebook. That's Instagram. And the first they rejected my appeal to just not do anything with Facebook. They said, no, we have to be in Facebook. It's it's where we get the most views. It's where we get the most traffic. It's where we get heat.  So I get that it's it's a necessary evil. But trying to get them to not pay Facebook money to push their posts is it's an uphill battle. I just I can't do it anymore. Because Facebook gives them that little dopamine even for them. It's a dopamine hit when they see what kind of reach a video gets or what kind of reach a post gets.  And even when I try to explain exactly what that data means, and it's not actually what they think it is, it doesn't matter because it's it's someplace where they can put their money and they see a result. It may just be a result in charts, but it's still a result. I don't see that mindset changing.  And again, these are enlightened people. These are people who understand the issues with Facebook, and yet they're still not able to wean themselves. So I would love the idea of getting advertisers together and using their collective power to say, look, we want we want to advertise with you, but we need these changes. I just don't see it happening until there's one big player that stands up and says, okay, I'm going to put my flag in the ground. I'm going to start it. Come with me.

Start time: 1047.10
End time: 1058.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, this is it. They've got such a diverse advertiser base, though, that is that there aren't really there isn't really a couple of big players who could say change this or we're going to pull our revenue because they need to pull it in from other areas, surely.

Start time: 1060.70
End time: 1125.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's true. And that's the problem. You know, for me with political advertising, I forget what the number is, but you know, something like almost 70% of voters from my party are on Facebook, like that is the easiest way to to reach them with very targeted ads. So I think you're correct. It's an uphill battle. I just  I think there's a real need for leadership, I think, from all areas. I mean, regulators, I think we need to have users demanding more. I really backed into a corner because even basic tools like corporate oversight, I think a lot of different boards would have kind of insisted on different change of direction a long time ago.  Zuckerberg controls 51% of shares. So like this is a guy he's even beyond the reach of corporate oversight from his board. So it's it's I don't know. I mean, do you think I almost wonder if like he needs help from the Almighty? Maybe you can help us out. But I feel like we have very few options.

Start time: 1126.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I mean, it is ubiquitous. And it does seem to be out there pretty much nonstop. And there's not a lot you can do about it. Even people who hate it carry on using it. And then when you throw in Instagram into the into the equation and WhatsApp, it's an enormous reach. I mean, is it possible to break it up? Is it even advisable to break it up into separate units?

Start time: 1146.76
End time: 1213.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's this is not an operating system. This is not okay, we're gonna we're gonna cripple functionality. These are actual independent services that in no way, shape or form need to actually exist within the same company. WhatsApp will work just fine apart from Facebook apart from Instagram. And the other Facebook property is going to be a separate unit.  The only thing that binds them together is that desire for the central company for meta to have all that data in one archive in one place that they can do analysis on. So yes, it is possible to break them up. And actually, I think it would be better to break them up. I think services would start working better in the same way that they would in the past.  I know for a fact that once the Oculus started requiring a Facebook login, I gave up, I just know I don't need another piece of equipment that's going to require me to use an account that I only have because it is tied to other services.  Once the Oculus started requiring a Facebook login, I gave up, I just know I don't need another piece of equipment that's going to require me to use an account that I only have because it is tied to other services.

And I'm sure they'll treat that information very carefully. Same problem again, you know, it's just like, oh, we're changing the way that you log in.

End time: 1536.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100% can we I know we're focused a lot on like the Facebook component of it in the ethical considerations there. I'd love to talk about the meta announcement itself, because as a game developer, I have a lot of thoughts about this specific vision coming from Zuckerberg and Facebook about about why I think it's specifically flawed.  Yeah. So, you know, what are the I think an assumption? Well, first of all, let me just tell everyone out there in Twitland, I've spent a lot of time developing prototypes in VR to kind of figure out what kind of game designs work in VR, what kind of ideas work in VR, what kind of stories can you tell in VR, because it's a it's a very different environment.  Although there's a special set of rules that you have to start thinking about, like, automate is optimizing draw calls towards the center of the screen, and the way you tell stories, the way you move around. So I've thought a lot about this. And I think that there's an underlying assumption with many VR and like metaverse enthusiasts to think that VR is like the ultimate level of immersion.  Right? Like you read Snow Crash, or you read Ready Player One, and you imagine this world where you're out there fighting with swords or, you know, looking for an Easter egg and a recreation of all these different things. And that's the core assumption, right? That this is somehow more immersive than what we have today.  And what I can't personally square that with is if that's true, then why haven't we seen the early adopters flock to using this more than we do, you know, traditional screens, traditional games, because it's very clear, you know, this isn't just an opinion, the metrics will show this out that you can have the very, very best games in the  entire world and the best experiences in the entire world. But it's not a place that people want us to spend a lot of time in. They'll be there for like 30 minute bursts, and then they'll get away and they'll want to go back to the real world.  I actually don't believe that VR is inherently a more immersive experience than looking at a screen. And if you think about that from like a game development point of view, it makes sense, because most VR experiences, they require you to be in this first person view. And it marries you to a certain set of mechanics, working with your hand, shooting things with your hands, kind of representing your real body in the world.  We all know if we're sitting back with a controller, in playing a video game, you kind of get lost whether you're doing combos, or, you know, playing a third person story like Mass Effect. It has exactly that quality of immersion. So a conclusion I've come to is that VR inherently, it gives you it almost limits the amount of tools that designers have to give you the immersion.  The second part of this that I'm really not sold on with the metaverse vision is the fundamental reason that I think social media is so addicting in the first place, that it gives us all the illusion of feeling connected to real people. You know, I feel like I'm in friends with many of the people I talk to frequently on Twitter, right?  These are people that represent themselves with a real icon of themselves, they promote their real life work, you know, sometimes at least real opportunities like doing Twit together today. That is a real connection. The Zuckerberg vision of this seems to be cartoons and this like, this inauthentic representation of yourself that's once removed from that authentic, authentic image of yourself.  This is a real authentic connection. So I think you come to this same question, like, is it more immersive? Are you going to feel like you're forming a more human relationship with a person if you're talking to them through an cartoon avatar of them? I don't really think that's true.  I think it's just simply a different way to do that. So, you know, with those two issues side by side, I'm just not sold that a metaverse is going to do anything better than what our current social media and games and tools that we have today are going to do.

Transcript:  Well, this is it. I mean, virtual worlds are all well and good, but they've got to be a believable and be immersive and be something have something that which no one else can offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There have been requests and there actually have been some technical studies and I've basically told them we can do it. I don't know why you want to do it. To get into the discussion, I think something that Brianna brought up is why hasn't VR caught on and I think it's because VR comes out of a fundamental misunderstanding of how we absorb information.  Right now I'm sitting in front of my setup and it's a pretty typical setup. It's got three monitors. I'm monitoring a couple of different things at the same time. I have a sense of where I am and when I'm working, I can easily move from one piece to the next.  I can absorb things through my peripheral vision and I can take breaks so I can look away from my screens when I need to sort of concentrate on something. VR doesn't let you do that. VR is always there. That's the whole idea. It's always connected, but that's not the way humans work.  We like to be connected. We don't like to be constantly connected. As far as forming relationships, I think one of the issues that we've seen, because we study this, my organization studies this greatly, there's a lot of surface connectivity where people think they're forming a relationship because they have communicated with each other.  They've sent messages, they've sent tweets, they've sent posts, they've maybe exchanged a couple of photos, but that is fundamentally not how you build a relationship. A relationship actually requires real risk. So VR, especially the way that it's being envisioned by Facebook, might be fantastic at selling you a product. It is still horrible, absolutely horrible at working or building relationships.

Transcript:  Would augmented reality deal with the problems of that? The idea behind augmented reality is that you can have VR when you want to be fully immersed, AR when you're out in the physical world, or reality as the rest of us do. Would AR help with that?  Certainly, based on what we've seen so far, AR hardware is still very, very prototype-faced. They announced Project Nazare, the AR glasses, as part of the announcement, but I have yet to see a pair of AR glasses which you actually could use or could wear in any conceivable format.

Start time: 1705.14
End time: 1760.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, but the idea of AR is so much better. The idea of being able to be out in the world and receiving information about the things that you're seeing or the things that you're interacting with, that is so attractive to me. That I can actually see real-world applications.  Putting on a VR headset, you are closing yourself out from the outside world. So for me, AR from the start has always been far more promising. Yes, much more difficult because the technological hurdles that you have to leap are much higher. You have to make a system that is usable outside. It has to be light. It has to be stylish. It has to have a long battery. It can't be connected to a huge computer on your waist.  Those things are just technical problems, but if you put those aside for a second and just admit that at some point we will meet those technical problems, the promise of AR far, far exceeds VR. Is that true in the gaming world, Brianna?

Start time: 1763.26
End time: 2022.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a different set of assumptions. I definitely agree. The promise is there. I think if you're thinking about game design, I think there's less of a difference between the way you would design an AR game and a VR game. They're kind of the same set of assumptions. You're a physical body in the space.  What is exciting to me about AR is it's essentially it's the same idea of social media, right? You're given 2D information. Maybe it can be slightly more 3D, but essentially you're giving a more convenient way for us to always be addicted and streaming this information like straight into your brain receptors.  I think our social media addiction shows that there's a real tendency in human nature to want to receive information constantly. I think many of us as techies, it's almost addictive, right? So I do agree with you that that's going to be more addictive, but that is not a space where Facebook is going to be able to create a universal experience.  or a monopoly in the same way because you could have any application kind of there in the bottom of AR playing in the corner of your glasses and many, many years down the road with like neural link implants where it's going straight into your brain stem.  You know, John Carmack had some fascinating comments on this to come out of Facebook the other day because he, even though he works for Facebook, made some very public comments saying he thinks that they're completely going about this the wrong way.  And just in case you don't know John Carmack, he's the guy, one of the pair along with John Romero that launched id and did doom in the 90s. So his thought with this is you can't go out tomorrow and say, I'm going to create a universal experience.  You can't say I'm going to hire 10,000 engineers and we're going to build this thing. And he likened it to the experience of building doom. If you remember that in 1995, I believe it was, you know, they built this kind of three-dimensional space that was built in the 90s.  And then along the way of building this game, there just happened to be all this other stuff that they coincidentally could do along with it. They developed doom the game, which has a purpose, and they built this kind of 3D engine that had a game with it.  And then along the way of building this game, there just happened to be all this other stuff that they coincidentally could do along with it. They developed doom the game, which has a purpose. And then along the way they came up with wad files, you know, these huge files that let monitors come in and create different versions of it.  They came up with multiplayer over TCIP. They came out with all these innovations that really changed the industry. So what he is advocating for them to do, if they really want to develop a metaverse rather than trying to build that as the big goal, he thinks they need to bite off a small part of the problem and dedicate Facebook's huge resources towards development.  So as a specific example, developing, you know, like, what's their conference? F8, I believe it is having that entirely in the metaverse next year, because if they commit to that, they're going to figure out how to widely deploy this to a lot of different people at Facebook.  They have a lot of different usage requirements are going to figure out spatial audio, they're going to figure out the infrastructure and bandwidth for a lot of people to log in for the same time. And by focusing on goal, they'll get all these other technologies out of it.  So to me, I think that says two things. First, obviously, that's a smarter way for Facebook to go about that. But secondly, I don't really believe there's going to be a future where Facebook is the only company that develops a problem, develops a solution to a problem in this space.  I think it's going to be much more akin to what we see today, where, you know, many, many startups are working in this space. You have different specialists with that work on different parts of it. And ultimately, four or five companies getting a lot of market share.

Transcript:  Hey, Ian, thank you so much for filling in for me while I'm down in Mexico, but I do have to interrupt just going to be a minute. Got to tell you about Audible. I love Audible. Audible.  Audible audiobooks are the best. It's not just audiobooks. It's spoken word entertainment of all kinds. What am I listening today? Well, there is a great Dune audiobook. It's a one of Audible specialties. They do dramatizations, multiple voices, acting it out.  I saw the movie that I got a hankering for more Dune. It's on Audible. Love it. Actually, I bought it many years ago. And that's one of the things I love about Audible. All my audiobooks, and I have a library of over 500 of them I can continue to listen to at any time in the Audible app. That's pretty awesome.  What else am I listening to? Well, I'm getting ready for the Wheel of Time, which is Amazon Prime's next big fantasy TV show. It comes out next month. 15 volumes. I just downloaded volume six of the Wheel of Time saga. I am loving it. It's one of those titles that you're glad there's so many of them because you're just going to get immersed in a world that just you just suddenly you know these people, you know this world, you're really there.  In fact, that's how I really got started with Audible. I had a long commute all the way down to San Francisco for tech TV. Sometimes I'd be four hours a day in the car. And I was getting pretty squirrely until I found audiobooks from audible.com. And that saved my life. In fact, my first big series was 21 audiobooks. They were very famous and I highly recommend them. Aubrey Maturin series about I've mentioned it before about Napoleonic War era.  British sea captain and his good friend the doctor as they sail around the world with all sorts of adventures. There's yeah, there's 21 of them. Patrick O'Brien, the author fantastic. The nice thing about audible is, you know, when you're in the car on a commute, when you're doing the dishes, walking the dog, but you want to enjoy something you want to listen and these audio books or spoken word titles are so engaging. I just I mean, I like Lisa and I are listening together to James Mitchner.  And James Mitchner is Hawaii. Instead of watching TV at night, we put on an audiobook from audible. It's so great.

Transcript:  go back to Ian in the game. Thanks very much Leo. Okay. Now obviously you don't want the show to be all Facebook but we really should mention the Facebook papers since Francis Hagan the whistleblower has been speaking to the UK Parliament about it. And we've had a bunch of revelations have been problems with India trying to deal with content. There have been allegations that Facebook knew that it was putting out anti-vax information. But at the end of the day, didn't we really already know this? I mean, a lot of the allegations Yes, it's not a

Transcript:  nice to have, you know, Facebook's own documents confirming them. But this was stuff that was covered years ago. Are we really surprised by this? Surprised? No. The fact that there are mainstream media outlets that are now catching up that that actually is a little surprising because there was some discussion about whether or not they would ever be able to connect the dots and say, hey, wait a minute, this happened and that happened. Now, we've known for a long time that Facebook has been doing this. We known for a long time how  Facebook can sway public opinion with the types of advertisers that they accept. But as I mentioned earlier in the show, the the the common person, the regular person who really doesn't cover technology every single day and actually doesn't really care about it, as long as it works to connect them to what they want. They don't seem to care. I've seen people read these stories and say, oh, that's pretty bad. And then they go back to Facebook and then they go back to WhatsApp and then they go back to Instagram.  So am I surprised? No, not really. Am I surprised by how little this is going to change things a little bit? I was I was hoping that maybe this was the time maybe the outrage was finally big enough. Maybe the pain would finally be high enough that Facebook would be forced to change. That's not going to happen.

Transcript:  I don't know. I think I'm a little less pessimistic than you are, Robert. I feel like, you know, it's like that moment in the murder movie where you kind of know that the guy did it, but they can't quite prove it in court because they don't have enough evidence. And then, you know, they they go and they get something comes through. Someone agrees to testify. And that's the moment they have something they could use in court to put somebody away. If you're talking about regulars, you know, you're talking about people who are going to be able to do something.  And I think that's something that's going to be very important for regulators in the pretext that they're going to need to take stricter action. And I think it's very much worth noting that Europe has traditionally been much harder on American tech companies than the American Congress has been.  That's what reporting has been hitting at. And it's all cooperated at this point. Like, here it is. Regulators go to work. If you need an excuse, you've got one.

Transcript:  There is that. I mean, I'm just thinking back to the Snowden papers. I mean, when those came out, when the Snowden Archive came out, I mean, it was literally 18 months before I'd been at Black Hat and had suggested to a former deputy director of the FBI that the US had used the  Echelon Network to spy on commercial companies for the benefit of US companies. And he tried to have me thrown out the conference because it was conspiracy theory rubbish. And then when the Snowden leaks came out, it's kind of like, wow, we've actually got the data now. Everything we suspected they were doing, they were doing.  But then after that, what did politicians do? They just changed the laws to make it legal. I'm not massively hopeful about Facebook changing these leaks, actually changing things. Is that a little bit too maybe doom laden, do you think? Padre, give us some joy.

Transcript:  I don't think I don't know. I got no joy here. I think it's just, it's very realistic. I remember one of the very first episodes of tech news today that it was ever on was when we were covering how Zuckerberg was going to have 51% of the voting shares of Facebook. And the comment at the time that I made was, this is great as long as you believe in Zuckerberg's vision, because there is nothing to stop him with 51%. It doesn't matter what the rest of the board wants. It doesn't matter what the rest of the  stock shareholders want. He's got the majority, he's going to do it the way that he wants to do it. Now that worked really well when people were totally on board with him building up this giant network and making record profits. But now that we don't like what he's doing, that 51% is still there. He still doesn't have to worry about getting voted off the board. There is no one who can kick him out of the company. There is no repercussion that unless you were to bankrupt Facebook would  actually affect his net worth. So that's where my pessimism comes into play, which is, yes, we've got the data. Yes, we can now prove that Facebook was doing horrible, horrible things. But none of it was illegal. Lawmakers have no idea what they're talking about when they're talking about regulating big tech. And there's no one who can stop Facebook internally. So where do we go?

Transcript:  I mean, this does seem to be the thing from some of the leaks in that, you know, engineers were saying, this is clearly what's happening. We are dropping the ball on this. We are promoting divisive content. And yes, it drives engagements. But we we need to think about the longer term and sort of the image part of this. And yeah, when you've got someone who is in complete control of the company, there's no real incentive to to go up against them because you're going to lose internally, at least. I mean, Brianna, you were saying a lot of Facebook, Facebook is having real problems hiring at the moment. Do you think that

Start time: 2670.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  might be a break on things? I do. You know, it's become very popular on Twitter for, you know, software engineers to tweet their, their basically, no, I will not work at Facebook, letters from recruiters when they come forward and try to, to get them to work there. You know, I know this is a strong analogy, so stay with me. But, you know, there are tech companies that facilitated some truly  horrific historic events. Right. And I think that it should give all of us that make these things pause to say, what am I getting involved with? Am I building something that's fundamentally evil?  There are real, serious, credible questions from reasonable people. If Facebook is fundamentally incompatible with democracy, because since this explosion of Facebook all around the world, we have seen a movement towards authoritarianism that is terrifying.  And, you know, my hope is that if the people that are skilled at this, the people that they need to build these products, refuse to work there, you know, hopefully another competitor could come along that does actually have ethics, you know, and will be held to some kind of standards with the public.  So I think that's a very positive development. I would encourage any software out there engineers to follow your peers and stay the course on that.

Transcript:  It's quite interesting. And we saw a similar sort of thing when Uber was being exposed for the rather toxic atmosphere that it had in its own company. And I was speaking to a recruitment consultant, but they were saying people are now taking Uber off their resumes and just putting themselves down as a freelancer or something, because they don't want to be associated with the company.  And I wonder if that's going to be happening with Facebook too, but there will always be flax around to defend it. A friend of mine did a story about IBM's involvement in the Holocaust in building, you know, the tabulation machines which enabled the Nazis to, you know, put people down.  I'm not saying Facebook or Nazis or anything, but it was interesting. We got an email from IBM's chief PR person saying, read the article, a couple of things. First off, we pulled out of Germany in 1938. I don't think anyone really realized how bad Hitler was before 1938, which led to some hollow laughter.  And then follow that up with, by the way, you say our actions were deplorable. We prefer regrettable. Would you mind changing it? There are always going to be people out there who are trying to spin this right. I don't know if Facebook can spin themselves out of this, but experience suggests that they may be able to. We shall see.  But yes, I mean, overall, let's try and make the show not all about Facebook. I would just like to bring in bring in Brianna at this point, because I understand you've got the new MacBook Pro. Tell us what I do.

Transcript:  It's so funny. It is like, it's like holding my old 2012 MacBook Pro. It's just everything, everything they've made bad decisions about in the last few years. They kind of rolled it back. Yeah, I've only had it since this afternoon, so I can't give you a full in depth review of it.  But I can give you some very quick impressions. First of all, the keyboard in it is excellent. You know, I work on political initiatives. Most of my day is spent sending messages one way or another.  So the keyboard isn't just drastically better than this scissor keyboard that they used for many years. It's better than the keyboard in the M1 Mac they introduced last year.  I had the 2020 model of that. So if you write a lot, I think that this is a you have the money. I think it's an upgrade that you could very seriously consider.  It's much heavier in hand. It's it's squared on the edges. It's just it feels really chunky and substantial, which I think is a good thing.  But I also think because it's so much heavier, that's why I personally decided to get the 14 inch instead of the 16 inch. So, you know, you're going to be having a heavier, sturdier laptop.  The notch, I was concerned about that. I haven't even noticed it since day one. So I think that's going to be a non factor for me.  The other thing is there was a real kerfluffle this week with Dropbox who had kind of thrown it out to the community.  Hey, guys, do you think we should develop a Silicon app and Apple Silicon app for Dropbox Dropbox currently on my Mac uses over a gig of my RAM, which is massive.  That makes Chrome look positively efficient.

So Dropbox quickly walked that back from their forum post saying, no, no, no, guys, don't worry.  We'll be releasing this next year in 2022.  But I just feel it's like, you know, Apple Silicon's been out for a while, guys.  This is something I spend twenty dollars a month on.  I might want to make this a priority.  But overall, yeah, I think overall, you know, ultimately I can't do my job without a Mac book.  And I think this is an excellent version of it.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, they have they have really been letting the MacBook down over the last few years.  I mean, OK, there's the keyboard problems, which are many and numerous.  But I mean, it just it wasn't a priority for them.  It seems they were, you know, it's all about iOS and it's all about the latest generation devices.  But I have yet to meet a MacBook user, someone who's used MacBook for a few years,  who isn't passionate about it and doesn't want to change.  And Apple were giving people reasons to change.  I mean, Brianna, do you think this is obviously you've only had it for a couple of hours.  But I mean, and you're Mac based, but I mean, generally you're feeling positive.  This is something which could woo people back to the fold.

Start time: 3099.04
End time: 3213.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am. But I mean, let's let's really dive into something you just said about the ways that they've  been laying the community down. You have the lack of ports that's been addressed.  You have, you know, you have the keyboard that's been addressed.  You have better thermals that's been addressed.  It's higher up on the table. But there's something that they they have and they haven't addressed.  And I think this really gets to the core of your question.  For a long time, we've been talking about the lack of discrete GPUs in the MacBook lines.  I'm a professional 3D person and a game developer.  I need very powerful 3D capabilities to run Unreal Engine and Autodesk Maya on my Mac.  Apple at this point have functionally ceded the ground on games and professional 3D work.  I'm sorry. It's just a fact. You can play Apple arcade games.  They are not sophisticated enough to need a 16 core, you know, Mac max GPU with Apple silicon  inside of it. So I think this is the return to form that we were looking for.  If you use Final Cut or, you know, those kinds of that family of apps that have been  really optimized for it. At the same time, Apple has given up, in my opinion, on gaming  and really sophisticated graphics technology to the point where, you know, Robert, like you,  when I do Unreal work or serious graphics work these days, I don't even try to do it on Mac  anymore. I have a very expensive PC and a PC laptop that I use for that. So I think it's very  good, but just know that you're not going to be a gamer on it.

Transcript:  It's interesting that you say that because, I mean, back in the day, in the sort of the  80s and 90s, gaming was key to Apple's popularity. They did much better games than you could get on  the PC. I mean, what is it? I mean, that kind of dropped off once Doom came out and everyone  realized, wow, this is absolutely fantastic. You mentioned Doom earlier and I just, I lost so much  time to that game. You put on a pair of headphones and you were there. So why did Apple drop the  ball on this? Games change.

Start time: 3244.42
End time: 3321.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was two things. Yeah, games change. They found themselves accidentally in charge of  the biggest games market in the entire world, right? There's a tendency with Apple devices,  and I know this firsthand, to force them to run on a very wide range of hardware. So, you know,  whereas the PlayStation or PC can kind of aim for a higher end of graphical experiences,  Apple arcade games really default down to this cartoony style where you could probably run them  on like the iPad 3, most of these games with very little problem. So I just think that it's not just  that the kind of ecosystem of successful games on iOS and Mac don't really require powerful  graphics. Apple themselves have not really spent a lot of money developing these graphical APIs  and tools. Remember how long SceneKit and SpriteKit were really the only tools an iOS developer had  for these things, forcing you to go to something like Unity or Unreal Engine. So the bottom line  is it's just not been a priority for Apple and the technologies that they've developed and the  relationships they've made with game developers, and they have the outcome of the choices they made.

Start time: 3376.70
End time: 3653.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  works, as I understand it. That is correct. This is the first time I've gotten to talk about it  in media, so I'm really excited about the view. So for those of you that don't know, I was one  of the primary targets of Gamergate back in 2014 and 2015, which was a kind of concerted effort  by trolls to silence women speaking out in the game industry. I've been approached many times  over the years to basically come forward and turn this into a movie or a TV series or something like  that. I've turned it down every single one of those times, not once, not twice, not three times.  Four separate times, Hollywood's come to my door, has offered me quite a bit of money and I've said,  I can't be involved with that. And the reason was they wanted to make it like a feminist horror  movie. One of the most iconic moments of Gamergate that they actually put in the Law & Order episode  was the man in the skull mask sending videos to me about how he was going to murder me, my husband,  and my dog. It's kind of just melodrama, right? Just not something I want to revisit. It's not  something that I thought would add to the discourse. So this company came to me, Mind Riot,  and they were like, well, how would you do a Gamergate TV series? I think the reason we're  still talking about Gamergate all these years later is because our failure to act then has really  led to the failure of many of our systems today as we see politics kind of breaking down all our  around us. Because Gamergate wasn't really about death threats. It was a fundamental change in how  we argued online and how extremists could kind of hijack a conversation in bad faith and bring some  really terrifying policies to bear. I just want to walk you through a short list of things that  have happened in the United States since Gamergate. You had 8chan, which was born,  and 8chan directly led to the Christchurch Massacre in New Zealand where 49 people were brutally  murdered by someone who was radicalized on 8chan, which again directly was formed because of Gamergate  where he live streamed it and became inculcated with these white supremacist ideas. You have one  of the primary targets, architects of Gamergate and the harassment campaign, Steve Bannon, who  literally helped Donald Trump get elected in 2016 and brought these kinds of troll wars to  bear, which have poisoned United States politics and have made it so we really can't tell which end  is up when it comes to issues like vaccines. You have the QAnon movement, which again is directly  linked to many of the people behind Gamergate and 8chan. So this QAnon movement in the United States,  this cult, which again has hijacked social media, that has directly led to many events in the United  States like January 6th. So what I wanted to do was to take Gamergate and to tell a story about how  American politics got to where they are today, to talk about this choice we made and that the Obama  Justice Department made back in 2014 and draw the line every step of the way with using myself as a  narrator but using largely fictitious characters to kind of represent these different points of  view. Why did the game industry fail to stand up for women employees? Why did the Justice Department  fail to act? Why did companies like Facebook fail to seriously invest in addressing disinformation  and harassment? Why was the media so unable to respond to Steve Bannon's particular  use of disinformation? How were our ideals in America about free speech twisted and used against  us? So that's the story that I'm working with Hollywood to tell, this streamable series talking  about how our institutions are failing us and why that's directly why the United States is broken

The way it works is you have a pilot, the pilot is written, we have the arc of the first  season and what we're doing now is basically bidding it out to different major production  companies and I can't tell you which ones are working, we're working with that yet but some of  the most major studios have written some of the our favorite shows that actually one of them I  know for a fact you like a lot because we've talked about it before.

Transcript:  Let me interrupt if you don't mind, let me interrupt for just a moment. Hi it's Leo,  thank you Ian for filling in for me while I'm gone. You know what I'm bringing to Mexico on  my trip with me? Of course I bring it everywhere with me, Express VPN. Did you see this study the  FTC just came out with it said internet service providers are shocking, spying on their customers,  gathering information, selling it to marketers, even like personal stuff, location information.  You know you don't really have much choice in ISP. If you're one of you know customer one of the  big ISPs is doing this there's not much you can do. I don't expect you to switch ISPs but I think  a good solution would be to use Express VPN. Prevent your internet service provider from snooping on  your internet activity with Express VPN. It's so fast, it's so easy you can even put it on your  router and protect your whole household. It's a simple solution. You can even put it on your  it's a simple app that works on your smartphone, on your computer, even smart TVs, even routers  to protect you, encrypt your data so that the ISP can't see it, so the hackers can't hack you.  I love it because it gives you access to content that's restricted geographically. Express VPN is  the best, absolutely best VPN provider. They're in I think 90 plus countries so you can see content  in any of those countries. It's very easy to use one big button on the app. You're connected  and it's so fast and this is important. You want to go with a VPN provider that frankly is  making enough money so that they don't have to snoop on you like your ISP does and they can  invest in infrastructure so that they're fast. That's Express VPN and it's still a great deal.  This is seven bucks a month. I'll tell you how we can get that deal. It's the number one VPN service  according to CNET, according to The Verge. It's the only one I use. The one I'm bringing down  to Mexico with me to protect me. It doesn't slow down your connection. It doesn't log what you're  doing. It can't. Their trusted server technology means they cannot write to the disk. They cannot  log what you're doing and they're regularly audited so that you know their privacy policy  means what it says, that their trusted server works as advertised. It is absolutely the trustworthy  VPN. You can't say that about all of them. So stop handing over your personal data, ISPs,  and the other tech giants who mine your activity and sell off your information.  If you want to protect your privacy, protect your security, and watch some Netflix out of  Japan or England, protect yourself with the VPN I use and trust to keep me private online. Express  VPN. Go to expressvpn.com slash twit. Spell it out. E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N dot com slash twit.  You'll get three extra months free when you sign up for a year. This is the one I use,  the one I recommend.

Transcript:  Now back to you, Ian. Cheers, Leo. Leo is down in Mexico for the day of the dead.  I suspect possibly recreating the iconic scene from Bond, but still that's a story for when he  gets back. Now, further, well, non-Facebook news and other things, we saw that Jeff Bezos,  has Blue Origins Company, and a couple of other partners, including Boeing, are now talking about  by the end of the decade putting the first commercial space station into orbit, which they  described as a mixed-use business park, part hotel, part business centre, part research facility.  It's a quite challenging proposition considering that Blue Origin can't get anything into orbit  as yet with their current rocket systems. The passenger systems from Boeing haven't yet  worked and indeed their passenger capsule is back at the factory because it failed on its last  attempt to try and get into orbit. Brianna Padre, do you think this is a viable idea?  Should it be trying to build business parks in orbit? Go on, someone should be.

Transcript:  Would I like them to? Yes. I mean, I'd love to see it because that's the vision of my childhood.  Everyone's in a space station. Everyone's orbiting either the Earth or the Moon or in a Lagrange  point. But in terms of does it make financial sense? Not really. I think we've proven that with  the ISS. Yes, there's some interesting experiments, but it's far too expensive to escape our gravity  well to have anything in a business park just so that it can be in space. It's going to be a  prestige thing. It's going to be something that's used by the wealthy so that they can do PR shoots.  Other than that, it's not really viable. The level of technology that we have, not just booster tech,  not just to get out of the gravity well so that you're actually in orbit and not just falling  quickly, it's not there. More so, it's not going to be there until we stop using chemical propellants.  Neither Blue Origin nor SpaceX or NASA or any of the agencies are anywhere near that level of  technology. Interesting idea, sure, for science fiction, not in my lifetime.

Transcript:  Brianna Larkin Yeah, no. Frankly, I talk about that all the time. This theoretical thing where  an alien comes and you have to jump on a spaceship like the Ingardians of the galaxy. You better  believe I'm going. So, Robert, I do share your pessimistic appraisal of the situation.  I do think it's worth noting there are some unique things that can be done in space from  a commercial standpoint. My own husband works in biotech, helped develop the coronavirus vaccine,  and there are many kinds of drugs that could best be developed and manufactured in a zero-G  environment. There are all kinds of manufacturing issues like that. So I do think there's commercial  value for that. I don't mean to get political, though, but this news does come out the exact  same week that we are talking about a very substantial billionaire's tax here in the United  States that would be almost impossible for them to avoid in the way that it's written.  Personally, if I got to choose between Jeff Bezos developing a hotel in space or taxing Jeff Bezos  so we could fund NASA much more aggressively and have the public way in and do a lot more space  exploration and development there, I would choose B all day every day. So I hope that's the way the  dice rolls there. Robert Leonard

Transcript:  Can I geek out for just a second here? When you're dealing with space, there's primarily  two issues that we have right now. Three, the first is the propellant getting out of the gravity well.  But if you're in orbit or even on a lunar body, power and heat. You build up heat and it's almost  impossible to get rid of it. And your power budget is incredibly limited. So I'm big on  manufacturing in space. I mean, I'd love the idea that there are certain things that can be made  better in a zero-g environment. But having a zero-g environment that provides both the manufacturing  capabilities and the power to run the equipment and the ability to remove the heat that the  equipment generates, that's not just a business park. I mean, that's building a factory in space.  So again, I mean, that's several factors of complexity above what's being proposed as a

Start time: 4192.84
End time: 4228.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  even then, even then, because our nuclear reactor power right now, unless you're dealing with a  radiothermal isotope generator, is basically steam power. It's a steam plant that uses a nuclear fire  instead of burning something. The problem is none of those plants work unless you can  get rid of the heat. That's how you have to condense the water. So if you're in space,  it actually becomes far more difficult to do something like nuclear power. I mean,  essentially, the only thing that works is solar. And you can't create enough PV space to run a

Transcript:  Brianna, you raised an interesting point on this because you're right, the billionaire tax proposals  did come out this week. Obviously, the tech industry is very likely, the leaders of the  tech industry are right in the firing line on this. I mean, from the proposals that they have,  it's not as though Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos is going to be hanging around with a cup outside  Grand Central Station trying to pay off the mortgage that way. But I mean, it does seem a  bit rich that, you know, but particularly for Elon Musk has been very vocal against it this week.  And considering the guy, you know, did get a certain amount of government subsidies just to  get his business off the ground, quite literally, it does seem slightly more case just to say,  well, actually, yeah, but I'm not that keen on this tax business. Do you think it's going to  go through? Is Congress actually going to act on this? I think it's up to Joe Manchin,

Start time: 4295.16
End time: 4384.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  unfortunately. And I think we're going to get more information about the text of the bill this  week. And, you know, fingers crossed on that. I think what I would like to see is this isn't  my analogy, but it's one that I've heard frequently. You know, a lot of these billionaires,  it's almost a Batman situation where they, the company that like Wayne Enterprises,  where they make all their money causes all these problems for society. And then you have to have  the billionaire Batman go out and stop all the consequences from it. My personally, what I would  like to see is more money taken from the billionaires where we as the public can kind of  decide which way this goes. And just one more thing about this, Robert, as long as we're talking  about the nitty gritty details of how we actually do something like this in space. One of the things  that we've tried to figure out for a long time is how to stop the loss of muscle mass  in space because you go up there and your muscles atrophy. And one of the things that I'm so proud  of my husband for is while he was working at Novartis here in Boston, his name is actually,  he helped develop the patent for one of the drugs that's going to do this. They came up with the  drug and you can literally, according to the patent, it causes you to just automatically  generate all this muscle mass and they see it and they're like, Oh my gosh, people are going to be  using this to abuse sports. And it's kind of like,

Transcript:  It's interesting. We have a bunch of drugged up astronauts who are managing,  but I mean, it is a serious problem. It takes what, six to nine months to get to Mars.  Same to come back. That's an awful lot of muscle mass to lose. And particularly if you're,  I mean, also thinking longer term, if you're actually born on Mars and you grow up with that  kind of gravitational stress, you probably couldn't come back to earth unless you've got some serious  muscle development going on because the gravity would just crush you.  I mean, if we're going to become a space faring species, as I hope that we do,  it's obviously going to take some fairly serious physiological changes in humanity.  And also, you know, sort of where are we going in terms of how that's going to equalize out when  things get back to earth. But I have to say, Brianna, when you heard it, when I heard when  you told me about that drugs, my first thought was pro sports people are going to be on this,

If I'm remembering it correctly, they were trying to figure out ways to  let sports teams try to detect it ahead of time, because they knew it was going to be such a thing  that would be abused. Put a marker in the drug so that it shows up. Yeah. Right. Yeah. They could  also help elderly people, right? You fall and break a hip is because you lose muscle mass. So

Transcript:  there we go. Yeah, we shall have to see. But yeah, well, hopefully we'll get out there.  We're starving in the midst of plenty at the moment, considering that most asteroids contain  enough metals to deal with the markets for quite some time. But still, we just have pointed out  that, of course, we could have the spinning space stations that would engender a certain amount of  gravity. But that requires a massive space station to actually get it get it get in organized. I mean,  I love 2001. But we're a long, long way from that. I'll see Clark actually. Oh, sorry,

Start time: 4507.04
End time: 4548.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going by we don't actually have the material science to do that yet. Spinning spinning a  space station is a way to generate a force that will resemble gravity. But the force that you  would experience on the the hub of that spinning structure would tear any current material to  pieces. So it looks great in sci fi, but not incredibly practical. There actually is a show  that deals with this really, really well. If you've read the expanse series of books, or even watch  the show, that's actually something that it builds into it that that was Abraham put that into the  writing of the show. So that much is actually realistic. That's interesting. Because I mean,

Transcript:  when Arthur C. Clarke always regretted the introduction of the transistor, because when he  his idea for for satellites, it was based on valve technology. And that's why he thought the manned  space technology was remand space flight would become essential basically for the maintenance  of satellites, because somebody would need to swap out the vacuum tubes. And once they broke,  and in later years, he was kind of like the transistor really mucked that up, you can just  send machinery up there now. It's painful. Well, we shall have to see and not even carbon carbon  nanotubes could help us out of this one, it seems, but we will hopefully the material scientists  are onto it. Now we've had other good news this week. It's every three years, the US Copyright  Office and the Library of Congress comes up with exemptions to the digital Millennium Copyright Act.  This basically says that under the DMCA, then you're not allowed you're technically not allowed to  tinker with stuff even if you bought it. The right to repair has been severely curtailed. And now we  have a bunch of new exemptions of things that we can look at and things that we can repair.  They've clarified the language on whether or not you can repair on what kind of vehicles you can  repair what kind of medical devices you can tinker with. And most importantly, for from a security  perspective, the kind of security tools that you can use. Brianna, have you been in terms of how  our latest this latest three year menu has come up?

Transcript:  about the thing? Oh, 100%. It's fantastic. Yeah, my own state of Massachusetts has really led the  way on right to repair laws. So I was just absolutely thrilled to see this. Yeah, I really  think listeners out there may not know I love to restore classic Porsches. It's just my favorite  thing in the world to do. And the tools and the lockout you increasingly have with more and more  modern Porsches. I mean, it's it's gotten to the point where you can't work on your own cars. It's  impossible to get the software to do it in even independent shops. They charge such strikingly  high fees for just the tools to go in there and fix it that it's just not a very tenable situation.  And let's be clear about what this is. It's a it's a scam to get you to go spend three times as much  as the deal. Right. So I was very happy with the the changes that they made. I think that all of us  don't just have the right to repair the things we own. I think we should have a right to access  parts and tools to repair the things that we own. And I think if we're talking seriously addressing  climate change, addressing our culture of disposability has got to be part of that and

But Rita just pointed out that  apparently in Massachusetts, Subaru stopped offering certain vehicles in Massachusetts  following laws on this. Are you aware of that at all? Yes. That is actually a thing. That's  outrageous. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. It really is. There it is. Yeah. I mean, Padre, you love to  tinker. Is this right up your alley as well? Oh, absolutely. I've been I've been down with the

Start time: 4746.76
End time: 4873.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right to repair since before the movement started. I mean, it comes down to a culture of ownership.  Do you actually own the things that you buy? Are you leasing them? Are you borrowing them? Do you  have the ability to do with it what you want after you've paid your money to own it? And it's strange  to see how companies have used copyright law that never, never intended to cover their industry,  their product, their whatever it is that they're selling to keep you from doing that. I'll use the  car repair analogy because I know Brianna is so down with it. I remember when I repaired my first  vehicle, it was a Dawson 310. It was like a 1984 Dawson 310. It was a piece of junk, but everything  was manual. The only thing that was electric in it was the battery. That was literally it, the  battery and the spark plugs. And it was so much fun to tear it apart and put it back together and  learn how parts worked. Then I got a Toyota Corolla and I tried to do the same thing to it,  but it already had an electronic harness in it that was tied to the electric fuel injection.  I couldn't even buy the manuals to tell me how the stuff worked. That actually required me to be a  dealer to be able to buy it. And this was back in the 90s. And that's when I realized, wow,  this is really, it's a racket. You purchase something for a tremendous amount of money  and then you can only fix it with them. I mean, if they had their druthers, you could only use  gas purchased from their dealerships. So yes, I will push back, I will push for any right to repair.  I will push back against any company that says that they have a right to tell me what I'm going  to do with something that I purchased. And I don't understand people who don't get upset about this.  I know, I know. I had to calm down. I mean, people who are like, no, that's fine. That's fine. I'm  like, I don't get it. What are you spending your money on? Do you actually own that? Do you want  to own it? If so, then you have to be with me on this. Well, I mean, this is when they were

And you remember  those old adverts when CDs came out, it's like, buy to own for the rest of your life. And then,  then it kind of changes. Well, you own it on this particular format. If you try and digitize it so  you can listen to it elsewhere, that's against the law. And you can't be able, you can't be allowed  to do that. I think you're right, Brianna. This is an empadre. This is basically a scam as far as I  can see. But it just seems to be moving very, very slowly. I'm so happy that you brought up those,

The FBI could  advert in that. It's like, you wouldn't kill a policeman and steal his helmet and then go to the  toilet in it and give it to him. It's just like, it was beautifully done. But that kind of moral  panic built up. And companies, as you say, Brianna, have been very, very quick to capital, right,  okay. No, you can't do this. You can't do that. You can't, you know, one of the first things when  you get a car is to have a tinker around. But the original Model T came with its own, you know,  toolkit and descriptions of how to use it. And from an ecological perspective, I think we've  had some massive loss in terms of disposable consumer technology. So there was some interesting  stuff on that in terms of, you know, hopefully making things slightly better in, in terms of  usability. But yeah, we shall have to see how that develops.

And I think it's, it's, I think we have entire generation of  people that see a car the same way that they see like an iPhone, something they drive and they don't  have to maintain or service. You feel so connected to something that you work on or maintain. It's,  it's more meaningful to you. And I feel like as we've moved more and more to this corporatized,  you know, disposable world of products, I really do feel like you lose something of your humanity  along the way. Like anyone that's built their own PC knows you have more of an emotional  attachment to that and making it work than you might have to a Dell that you just bought off  the shelf.

And,  you know, I kind of, I kind of miss the days of PCs where, you know, you had the big box and you  could swap stuff out and upgrade and that sort of thing.

And I found enough working components to put it together,  but it didn't have a case. It didn't even have a proper power supply. So I had to kind of rig up  a power supply to make it work.

Lisa brought her black card with her going down to  Mexico. And I love it. She loves it. I love it because it's a Visa signature card. So it's a  great deal on international. There's no foreign transaction fees. There's no annual fee. You get  all the benefits of a Visa signature card. Lisa likes it because she earns Bitcoin on her BlockFi  card. Whether you're a crypto pro or total beginner, you can finally earn Bitcoin the easy way.  Bitcoin rewards. Yes, it's the world's first Bitcoins rewards card from BlockFi. You can earn  unlimited Bitcoin on every qualifying purchase you make. So as we travel around Oaxaca, we are  earning Bitcoin. I love it. It's the BlockFi rewards Visa signature card. And it's just the  easiest way to get Bitcoin. When you buy your groceries, when you pay your bills, when you fill  up at the gas station or, you know, when you fly down to Mexico, you can earn 1.5% back in Bitcoin  on all qualifying purchases. There's no rewards limit. It is a great card. It's a Visa signature  card that you know that's the best. Everybody agrees that's the best. It's a beautiful black  card, by the way, with a Bitcoin logo on it. I love that. And there's no annual fee. And we're  not paying any foreign transaction fees.

Unfortunately, when you buy one thing in the Apple ecosystem,  I do have to say, I keep watching the demos of voice to text on Android and  it is, y'all just got us destroyed on this. Like Siri is the Hugo. Android is driving the Lamborghini  when it comes to a text to speech. It is embarrassing how much worse we are. So it's a very pretty  operating system, but I will leave opinions on this to the experts. It is interesting. The speech

I've been trying out  Android 12 and I've got to say, I can't swear on that, but I think it's terrible. It's great  from a security perspective, great in a lot of under the hood type things, but the actual user  interface looks like it's been designed by somebody who's just blind. I mean, it's terrible. Padre,

Transcript:  have you updated yet or are you? I have and then I downgraded. Really? You didn't like it that much?  I get it. I understand why they're doing it. I remember in 2011 when they first shipped  Honeycomb and they tried to do the same thing. They tried to make a push for the tablet environment.  They didn't have the apps back then and so that's why a lot of people just didn't use it. That's why  it failed because ultimately in Google world, if it doesn't immediately do incredibly well,  they kill it after a couple of years. I understand the dock. I get that. That comes straight out of  their Chromebooks. I understand the split screen. That's something that people have been asking for  a while so they can take a familiar interface from the phone and put two of them on a tablet.  But like you, it just feels messy. I understand why they did everything that they did with the UI.  I just don't like it. Now part of that might just be I have to get used to it. Maybe I have  to commit myself to it, use it on a daily basis and eventually all the positives will come out.  But right now it just feels like a really bad version of Android. Why would I use a really bad  version of Android when I have a perfectly good version of Android that I could be using?

Start time: 5521.50
End time: 5606.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I mean that's fair enough. With 12L certainly it addresses something, an issue with Chrome OS  in particular because now that Android apps are putatively running on Chrome,  I think that's an aspect to it certainly. As you mentioned, twin screen devices.  Now it's been nearly two years since the first foldable phones came out and they are  about as popular as a rattlesnake in a pinata. They look really cool. Well, until they break.  Until they break. I'm sorry, I understand materials technology. I'm a big fan of it.  I looked at that first foldable phone and I thought, yeah, that's probably going to be broken  within a year. It didn't take that long, no? No, it didn't unfortunately. Maybe Microsoft's  got the right idea with the sort of actually having two screens with a hinge in it, but that's not  really what a lot of Silicon Valley people want. I don't know, I've tried the dual screen phone.  I don't see that it really adds anything, but I'm kind of worried about where Google is going  with Android. They seem to have really lost their way in some regards, just in terms of the features  and the usability of it. It just seems like Google's taken its eye off the ball. Do you think that's fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I think this is going to happen anytime you have a maturing market. The same thing happened  to the iPhone. Once they had a UI that worked really, really well, any change that they called  innovation could also be seen as, wow, what is wrong with them? Why did they fix something  that wasn't broken? I'm not going to hark on Google for trying. They're trying to make a better  operating system. They're trying to include more features. They have made it more secure.  They have added more hooks so developers have more things to connect to when they  develop new applications and services for those products. But like you, I sometimes wonder,  is there someone powerful behind the helm? Is there someone who's actually driving  Android forward with a vision or is it governance by committee? Because it kind of feels like  governance by committee right now. It's a bunch of people saying, wouldn't it be cool if this and  wouldn't it be cool if that rather than, well, what do we want the end experience to be for the

But I mean, in terms  of iPhone, do you feel happy with it? Do you feel they're actually developing and moving the  operating system forward or have they kind of reached something which works and will just tinker

Transcript:  at the edges now? Yeah, I think it's more tinker at the edges, right? It's gotten so complicated,  I think. I think that normal people just don't notice a lot of the features that they bring out  year after year. Looking back at Android, I just have to say I had such a different reaction,  like not being an Android user, but looking at the screenshots of it. I mean, it's just stunning  graphical design. And it's so disappointing to me to hear from you all that it's not a great  experience because by every single press report, the Pixel and the Pixel 6 Pro are such amazing  phones this year. So that's really disappointing to hear. The Pixel 6 is a really tricky one

It's got a headphone jack and I'm  sorry to be such an old-fashioned person about this, but I do like a headphone jack on a phone.  I use the phone in the car an awful lot and it's quite handy for that. And I hate the idea of  having to carry a dongle around everywhere. But I mean, Brianna, as an Apple user, you are used to

Well, for me, I think it may not be as bad for  women because I carry a purse with me whenever I leave the house and I keep the $70 official  Mac USB-C to USB-A adapter, which is an absurd thing to carry with you everywhere. So I guess  I'm just numb to dongle town at this point. I'm 100% with you. It should come with ports like a

In fact, I think if I have  to move to dongles, I'm going to have to start wearing a fanny bag again, just to carry them with  me because I'm not going to have that thing in my pocket and then lose it. And suddenly I can't  connect my headphones anymore. The strange thing to me is when companies start looking at innovation  removing a port that everyone knows and loves and uses all the time, that just seems so strange  and counterintuitive, but it's what's passing for forward looking design now. I do find it

It's like, well,  it's also, it's not great for things like dust and water protection. It's like, I'm pretty sure  we can work our way around that. And besides-  Yeah, mine's waterproof.  Yeah, you know, it's water resistant. I mean, but yes, it's just, it's a very odd setup. And I'm  sure, you know, it's quite handy. Apple has shown that you can make a billion dollar business out of  dongles. I think other manufacturers got that message loud and clear and it's like, really?  Okay. But yeah, 3.5 works for me.

Like there's a recycling  program, but it's not, it's not something they're even prepared to fix. So, you know, there's this  planned obsolescence of AirPods. So, you know, God knows they've made bank from killing the  headphone jacks. I don't think it was courage as much as, you know, they needed the stock price  to bump up a bit.

Transcript:  Good grief. Well, on the other hand, it brings in a lot of shareholder value.  Now, speaking of shareholder value, I have to say it's been an interesting week for Activision  and Brianna, I'm pretty sure you probably got a view on this. Basically, Blizzard has  cancelled 2020-2022 BlizzCon. The Activision CEO has taken a 99.9% pay cut until he, until he,  to quote, has sorted out the diversity issue, whatever the phrase he used was.  The games industry in general has been, as we discussed earlier, has been fairly toxic in  terms of sort of frat boy culture, but Activision has kind of become the poster boy for quite,  for an awful lot of things that were wrong.  Brianna, do you think this is actually going to change anything or is this just, again,  coming back to Facebook corporate marketing again?

Start time: 6004.24
End time: 6136.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that Activision is a situation that is going to actively change because it's  a different situation than Facebook. We've been talking about what's broken in Activision since  Gamergate. The reason things are happening now is because regulators got involved. The  state of California subpoenaed a ton of documents, found some horrific, horrific allegations. Just to  repeat, one of the most serious ones, you have a woman that worked for this company who her boss  basically sexually propositioned her. She eventually was sexually harassed so badly that contributed to  her suicide. Then after that point, that boss passed nude pictures of her around to her teammates  for them to leer at. That's actually in the California documents. These are tremendously  serious allegations. The reason it was taken seriously is because California regulators got  involved. From what I hear inside of Activision, I do think a culture is going to change.  I think that it's affecting things like them trying to get insurance because of the cost of it.  I think that's going to get better. As far as Bobby Kotick specifically in the salary cut,  when I ran for Congress and I looked up donors that had a history of donating to people with  a tech background, he was on my number one donor list. We actually called his office quite a few  times because he throws out so much money to people and most frequently to right-wing candidates.  This is someone that has quite a bit of money. He's gotten very rich working at Activision,  $150 million last year by many reports. I see this as an overwhelmingly symbolic move,  but I think that ultimately it's going to be the regulators and the lawsuit that are going to force

Start time: 6137.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Activision to make a change. It's interesting. He said, oh, I'm going down to a $68,000 a year  salary. It's like, yeah, you were rewarded over $150 million last year, so you're not out shaking  the cup. You can live on that for a while. Padre, it's easy for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of  Heaven. We're not going to go there, but what's your take on this? Well, I'm with Biyani in that

Start time: 6161.22
End time: 6260.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  looks like a Facebook move. They're just trying to get some good press out there to change the  story, but I think the enabler here is the fact that they are being sued by a state agency.  They have to make these changes. We're doing it because we want to be good and because we see  that it's better. This is an existential crisis for Activision. If those suits were to grow and  if it were to gain speed, it could really, really destroy the company. Now, I think the pay cut,  it's a PR thing because no matter how much pay he makes, he's still going to get awarded through  his options. That doesn't go away. That's not written away. If the company does well, he still  gets paid millions. What I'm looking at is I want to see on paper what are the diversity  steps that they're going to make? How are they going to handle diversity hiring? How are they  going to handle complaints? Are they actually going to strengthen HR to be able to work for  employees rather than HR protecting the company? Because that was the biggest problem that we saw  in the legal saga, which was HR was only there to make sure that it didn't go any higher than it  needed to, any complaint went higher than it needed to go because that would affect the price of the  stock. So if they can do that, if they can show on paper that they're making systematic changes,  then I'll say yes, kudos to you. Good job. Until then, I'm very skeptical. I've just been  incredibly skeptical about everything this entire episode. I don't know why.

Start time: 6261.26
End time: 6294.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't think of it as skeptical. I think it's just a realist who hasn't been proved right  yet. But there was an interesting point about HR. I do find, particularly with American companies,  you kind of forget that HR, you are a resource. They're not on your side. This is all about  keeping management out of jail or out of being sued. And it's a very weird thing. Somebody was  saying, no one ever grows up thinking, yes, I want to be an HR person. I wonder how people end up in  it. But I don't know. Hopefully things will change with Activision. We shall see.

Transcript:  If I could just say one more thing on this. I want to put into perspective why this story  matters. There's obviously the ethics concern. I think no one out there, no matter how cynical  you are, wants to see a situation like the one that happened with the woman that tragically  died by suicide. I am of the opinion, and I feel very strongly about this, that we have a larger  innovation crisis in the video game industry. And I feel that the quality of games that we are  putting out there are so laden and so hampered with these mechanics like daily login bonuses,  pay to win mechanics, DLC, live subscription models. Ubisoft, even this week, had something,  if you bought Far Cry 6 and didn't play it enough, they had the villain in that game  emailing you at your personal email address saying, oh, thank you for leaving Yara in my  capable hands. You couldn't stop me. Bwa ha ha. So I feel so strongly that we have an innovation  crisis in our field. And I think part of that is tragically, if you go and look at game studios,  who are the people that make video games? I'm not trying to knock straight white dudes here,  but you're really, really over sampled at game studios. We had a major game studio announced  this week where the only woman listed on the workplace ledger is the dog who is listed as  the morale officer. And that is the norm in our industry tragically. So it's not just, I think  that when you only have people from a single perspective developing games, I think unfortunately  you tend to see the same ideas and the same priorities happening again and again and again.  And I think if we want our industry to be vibrant, if we want truly the best kind of games to come  forward, if we want to have more interesting experiences than just call of duty every single  year with slightly prettier graphics for the thousands of people you're murdering, I think  it's really important that we are an industry where anyone qualified can come in the door  and can do their best work. So I feel very strongly this isn't just about making Activision a safe  working place. This is about making the game industry the very best version of that it can be  where everyone wins. People get to have safe careers, but you as a gamer get to play better

Transcript:  Ian, I got one more ad before we wrap things up on this week's This Week in Tech. And thank you so  much for filling in for me. I really appreciate you doing a bang up job. Of course, Lisa and I  are down in Mexico and I got to tell you, when I'm buying online, whether I'm buying in the US or  buying in Mexico, I am using this next sponsor, Privacy.com. I've been a Privacy.com user for years  before they were advertising with us because I love the idea of a credit card  that is secure in one of two ways. You can make a burner card with Privacy.com that can only be used  once. Boom, that's it. So you don't ever have to worry about it being stolen or being overcharged.  I often use though their merchant cards. I love this idea. The minute it's used with a merchant,  it's locked to that merchant. So I use it for all my online transactions. It's easy to share,  by the way. It's built into Privacy.com. You just say, I want to share this credit card.  Why would I want to do that? Well, my mom, 88 years old, she cooked for me my whole childhood,  amazing cook, but she told me last year, I'm too tired. I want to cook anymore. I said, mom,  let me get dinner. Let me get dinner. And I sent her a Privacy card. Just click and share. She  didn't have to have a Privacy account to use it. She put it in DoorDash. And now anytime she wants  a meal, she just orders one. They come, they bring it to her and I'm buying. I said, mom,  tip good too, because I want you to get the best service. I love it. It's completely secure.  If it leaks out, I don't have to worry about that. It can only be used with that merchant ever.  I can set limits and I can pause the card. Now that's really handy. I'm not worried about my mom,  but it's not unusual for me to sign up for subscriptions online. You know, sometimes  that can be hard to cancel. I use Privacy. I get the security of locking that card into that  particular subscription. But if I'm done, I don't even have to cancel. I just pause the card  or delete it and boom, that's it. They'll be declined. And you see on the Privacy website,  you can see all the times the card is declined. That's actually useful in case somebody tries to  use the card somewhere else. It will be declined, but you'll know. It ties into your debit card or  to your bank account. I should let you know it's not a credit card. You don't build up a balance.  It's like using a debit card. It's an immediate use, but it does appear to all the merchants  as a regular credit card. I think it's great for subscriptions, great for using online,  great for using anytime. You want to use a credit card, but you don't want the bad guy to use.  I'll tell you, you know, I sign up for a gym. I wish I'd had a Privacy card at the time.  I canceled the gym, but they kept charging me for quote, trainer appointments. I didn't catch on for  months. I called the credit card company. They said, well, it's been too long. We can't refund  you. If I had used Privacy, not only would I know that charge is going on, I could have hit the pause  button and I wouldn't be out any money. I wish I had a great way to control subscriptions, recurring  payments. You could set a spending limit with the service so they won't overcharge you. You can  catch them trying to, you know, add on and you can stop it. You can stop it. I just, I think Privacy  is the best way to go. It's easy to use. They have a Chrome extension, a Firefox extension that  automatically fills in the information, generates a new card. So you don't even have to exit that  page. And sharing is easy. No copy and paste, no texting. It's just click the share button when  you're viewing a card, enter the email address. They get it as my mom did. She found it very easy  to use. Your account summary is great. You have a choice when you have it show up in your checking  account statement. You can either just say privacy.com or can say the merchant. I always  say the merchant. That way it's easy for me to allocate to budget and so forth. You can even tag  now. This is something new. They added custom tags so you can sort your card by category. And  that's actually great because I use Privacy so much. I've got dozens and dozens of cards,  each of them either tied to a merchant or for a single use. And I love it. It's just the easiest  way to do it. And then I think the most secure, protect your financial identity online. Use  virtual cards. And this is the easiest way to do it. Privacy.com slash twits. Sign up for a new  account, new customers automatically get $5 to spend on their first purchase. Privacy.  P-R-I-V-A-C-Y privacy.com slash twits. Sign up today. You're going to love it.

For those of us who  were still using Windows 2000 at the time, it wasn't that big a deal. But if you're on  Windows Millennium Edition, then it was a very, very welcome edition. So it's an iconic operating  system. It's still massively in use. There's a big long tail of users out there. I mean,  in terms of outdated technology, it's one of those things that has hung around like a smell  in a space suit. Any Vatican systems working on it, Padre?

Transcript:  Yes. Actually, yes. But all of them are air gapped. So we have a few machines  that are still running Windows XP just because of some legacy software that will only run on XP  or below. But they are not connected to anything. So that's the concession that we made. They're not  even hooked up to a private network. They are completely standalone, which kind of limits their

And after,  you know, we got the first shots back and everyone applauded and then they sort of closed down the  meeting. But the default screensaver came onto the projector. And it was Windows XP. And you're like,  you've just landed a ton and a half of rover on Mars and you're still using Windows XP.  Brianna, did you have much experience with XP or you muck all the way?

Transcript:  Oh, God. Yeah. This is why I was doing network support for a career. I remember it like it was  yesterday. I can't believe it's been that long. You know, one of the things that really strikes me is  when I ran for Congress here in Massachusetts, I personally dropped off. You have to get signatures  to get on the ballot. And I personally went around to every single town's, basically,  clerk's office to drop off my signatures because I wanted to get to know people.  And it would be a fun event. And I was terrified, to be honest with you, how many election computers  were still running on Windows XP. You know, we talk, I talked a lot about cybersecurity on my  campaign. And here's kind of example one about how we may need to be spending a little bit more  money on infrastructure to make sure we can't be hacked. So fingers crossed that that lucky

Transcript:  streak continues. Well, this is it. But I mean, when XP first came out, it was billed as the secure  operating system. Because Microsoft had had such problems with computer viruses really going rampant  on this thing. They were just like, Yep, this is XP. It's built on the NT framework. This is going  to be the most secure operating system yet. And I think people are hanging on to that a bit too long.  It does seem, as you were saying, with the with the election machine stuff, the DEF CON voting hacking  sessions, they were still running Windows C on some of these machines. But what is it,  Padre, that you think XP is still hanging around? Is it just the legacy software?

Start time: 7077.89

Transcript:  It's just the legacy legacy software. But remember, there were a couple of advantages  to running XP. It was the first Windows OS that allowed for multi monitor setups.  It was the last way Microsoft OS that allowed you to to move setup files to either a hard drive or  solid state if you had one of those later on and do a completely in computer installation,  ridiculously fast. It also had no problem being mirrored from machine to machine to machine. It  was before Microsoft added any of those protections. So as a whole, it is a fantastic  testbed system. It is an operating system that I still use every once in a while. I will occasionally  spin up an XP instance, put it on the internet and see how quickly it gets owned and see what  kind of new attacks the box experiences. So it's still it's still kind of fun. It's a versatile  environment. It will run on very low end hardware. I can move it from box to box to box without ever  having to worry about whether or not I'm licensed for it properly. So yes, it's still in use. And  yes, it will remain in use for years and years to come. I mean, the same attacks that are working on  XP machines now will probably be seen on the internet in about 15 years.

Transcript:  good, better to work with in 2000? I remember, yeah, it was an upgrade in a lot of ways.  We were figuring out technologies like DirectX back then. So the underlying reset for the game  industry was revolutionary at the time. Networking overall and getting office systems to talk to one  another was tremendously more difficult back then. I don't know if you remember this, but trying to  get Windows and Mac machines to talk to each other on the same network. That was an absolute  nightmare back then. You had to go buy specialized software and oh God, I'm having flashbacks just  remembering it. So, you know, it was for the time it was very good. And I think it was clearly a  groundbreaking product. I think about it from a technology leadership point of view  that we need to, I think we could be much better at incentivizing and funding ways to upgrade our  infrastructure in the United States as time marches on. I don't feel like that should be in schools.  I don't feel it should be in voting systems. I don't feel it should be used in DMVs, something  I saw one time. I think we need to better fund this march forward with technology.

Transcript:  It's interesting. It's amazing how long old tech hangs around simply because it's convenient and  easy to use. I mean, as I say, I was still using Windows 2000 in 2008 just for a gaming machine,  which wasn't, you know, connected to the internet because it was just convenient. You knew how to  use it and you could, you could futz around in the operating system, which I really liked.  This was what turned me off apples originally, because back in the early 90s, you had to use  res edit, which is kind of like trying to repair a nuclear reactor with a stone axe. It's just,  it was a horrible tool, but still, but as I say, old technology is hanging around and June is very  much on all the billboards, all the adverts. I'm sure those, those people that love it, love it  dearly. I know my wife had a picture of Sting in it on her bedroom wall as a teenager,  which I'm not at all. But,  indeed, yes.

Transcript:  need to focus on? You know, pick a game that you really enjoy because you're going to be playing  it a lot and then go to speedrun.com. Look at the top run for the game and watch an entire playthrough  and then start learning the tricks about how you do that. So like for Tomb Raider, if you want to  sequence break the game, you have to back up on a door and then you have to get 51% of your geometry  through the door. So you scramble backwards until Laura reaches a state where her hands are just  twitching in the game. And then you scramble forward and press backwards simultaneously  and she'll roll through the geometry and be pushed out of it. So watch it and learn those tricks and  then just copy what other people have done. And what you'll find is if you then put more time into

We shall have to  see how it goes. Actually, while we're on the gaming front, interesting stuff going on with Stadia at  the moment. Brianna, can you fill us in on this? I mean, Stadia was sort of pushed out there,  it's going to be the next big thing, it's going to be great. And then it just seems to have died

Start time: 7553.32
End time: 7572.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  my understanding is that Stadia is pivoting, which is always, which is never a good thing to hear.  But they're going to become a sort of white label game streaming platform.  But I do, this whole, the whole Stadia concept seems slightly optimistic, to say the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not as crazy as you may think, though. One of the things that we've been doing a lot  more on Nintendo Switch is if you don't know, Switch is made on, I believe it's the Tegra  architecture, whereas every other game in the industry is made on x86. And one of the ways  they've gotten around Switch's complete lack of power is basically doing what Stadia does,  doing cloud computing and having a server compute everything and then stream it to your Switch.  And those games have done remarkably well on Switch. So I could actually see that being a viable  future for this. Maybe not on the big consoles, but for more constrained hardware, that could

Start time: 7625.20
End time: 7693.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have. And when I first played with it, I was actually impressed. A lot of the lagging issues  that I thought were going to be a problem weren't a problem. It helped me through part of the  pandemic because it was a fun device to play with. But the day after I received it, I already wrote  the obituary for Stadia because I know Google and they just don't have the attention span  to make something like that work. The thing about running a game delivery surface over the  internet is you have to be constantly pushing and refreshing your catalog and bringing in new talent.  And that's why they're making it a white label. They're making it a white label because they  realize, oh, that's a lot of hard work and that's a lot of continuing work. It's not just one project  and then you're done and everyone loves it. It's, well, what are you going to do today and the next  day and the next day? And Google does not do well with those types of products. Google is a  set and forget company. They want to be able to do their product development, push it out there,  and then just start cashing the checks. So Stadia was never going to be that. It's just not possible.

Start time: 7694.88
End time: 7775.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I agree with that though because I'm thinking through it.  And Google does something they do very well is bringing architecture and services. I think there  are very few people that would argue Google is not drastically better at services than say  Apple is. And if you start thinking through all the possibilities for that kind of client side  rendering of things like this, I can really see an explosion of that. You may not know this.  The game industry is really experiencing a shortage of talent right now because there are so many new  players in our field. They're trying to gobble up as many game developers as they can. Netflix,  for instance, has announced that they're going to make a very big push into games because they see  experiences like Fortnite being a very big threat to their business model. Do you really think  everyone that subscribes to Netflix is also going to have a $2,000 PC with an RTX 3090 inside of it?  I could see that kind of architecture having a very useful market for companies like that.  I'm not cynical about this. I think it makes sense.

And there is, as you say, there is a  huge market, at least a very valuable market in terms of gaming PCs and gamers are cutting edge  when it comes to the hardware in general, which is why the Stadia idea never seemed to work.  They're going slightly wider. It does have that opportunity to maybe get out there.  Let's face it, if you're a serious gamer, you're always going to want your own rig, surely?

Well, it's the enduring story of technology, I believe.  But yeah, okay, right. Well, we're going to wrap things up, but thank you very much to my  guests, Brianna Wu and Padre. Marvelous to see you both as ever. And we've had a very good time  at the time of it, I hope. People may be slightly concerned that this is being done on a Saturday,  but it's Halloween tomorrow. Parents are going to have to deal with hopped up sugar,  kids hopped up on sugar and I should imagine a wee bit of vomiting going on if people have  overindulged, but still. So this is why it's on on Saturday, but usually Leo is recording the show  on Sunday between 2pm and 5pm on Sunday Pacific time and you can watch in and of course come in  live on the chat room on our Discord server and one day when the virus is finally abated, we can  reopen the studio and allow people to come in and watch the show as it was meant to be watched in  person. And it really is always fun seeing people and seeing people actually come down and come  into the studio, but those days will come again, I'm quite sure. In the meantime, another twit is in the bag.
