Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode Number 11 for June 27th, 2005.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a Twitcast. We were supposed to have some short guy named  Chris Perillo in here to give us a recap on what happened at Locker Gnome because it was a big  deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a big deal.  I mean, talk about it. Although it's kind of a non-announcement, isn't it? I mean, Microsoft's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saying Internet Explorer 7 in 2006 or maybe like early 2007 will support RSS like Mozilla,  Firefox, Opera, and Safari already do.  I agree. It's good for Perillo.  I guess so.  Yeah, okay.  He's a big fan of the company.  He's a big fan of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a big fan of the company.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, ladies and gentlemen, and I can say ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in 11 episodes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  12 if you count the pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but Jessica, that's because you haven't seen the picture that people are talking  about.  No, I haven't.  They're not hot.  Not hot.  That was my attempt at sarcasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aging VJ kisses Harvard professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a good image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Chris Perillo somehow in the mix in it all.  Why does he always end up like the weird son of all these triads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, ladies and gentlemen, yes, you're hearing a female voice on the twitcast for the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  time since our pilot, Jessica Corbin, everybody.  I'm so happy to have you here.  Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  This is really funny.  I'm just thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's by popular demand, I might add.  We tried to keep her out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't keep me out.  You can't keep me out.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I started getting all these emails from people, from tech TV old days saying that  you guys were doing something up to no good.  And so I started to listen and I was like, hey, you got something going here.  It's kind of like the old days.  And of course, I'm not going to be able to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And of course, I went in.  I'm so glad.  Because what you guys started to do was just so authentic and real and it just, it's so  exciting to see what you guys are doing.  And yeah, so it's my pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thank you.  What are you doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  On the tech side of things, still working with CNET, doing a bunch of video on demand  stuff for them.  And yeah.  Six floor.  Six floor rocks.  Are you both on the sixth floor?  I see him every now and again when he makes an appearance.  So I've been working with them, but then also just been starting at my own venture, which  you so eloquently called.  No, no, don't tell them that.  Don't do it.  Yeah.  It's called Fempire.  That's short for the female empire, not female vampire, which some men kind of think sometimes.  Are you going to, it's a brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to ever forgive me for that comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe we'll see what you can come up with.  Try to like, indicate yourself.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know what?  I've heard a lot of crap been tossed over the years.  That was pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're just really glad to have MB on the show with us today.  That's her new nickname MB and you can ask her what it stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I will stand by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Fempire.com is kind of up, but you're going to do more on there, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a placeholder right now.  Just kind of showcasing what we're going to be doing and our fledgling apparel line.  So yeah, Fempire.com is where it's at right now, but it should in the next couple of months,  we should have the whole online magazine up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any plans to return to television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, dude, I'm going to be doing a show, I think for we called Wing Woman, because you  guys know you don't need a wing man.  You need a wing woman when you're trying to get a date.  You need a chick to get the buyers with you to kind of tell you what's up.  So that's going to be kind of the new calling.  Oh, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you'll go with guys who are going out on dates and you'll whisper in their ear what to tell them,  what to tell them what to do and stuff like that?  I'm your wing woman, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But doesn't the person that you're meeting find that kind of odd?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, here's just a tip for you guys.  Anytime that you're rolling with a girl, girls are more likely to look at you.  So yes, in a way, it might put them off a little bit at first, but they're going to be looking at you  and I think it's going to actually work to a benefit.  So what you're saying is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a competitive evil thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of a primal thing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, so you're saying basically men are more attractive when they have a woman beside them  than if they're alone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It can't just be any woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take notes, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if you go with a certain...  Yeah, I would say it does help your game.  Because if you're rolling solo and you approach a woman,  they're automatically going to think that you're trying to jock them,  but when you're with another woman, you don't necessarily know,  so it kind of throws a lady off.  They don't know what your motives are, and so they're more likely to let you in,  opposed to just being the single guy approaching a girl.  You know what he's after.  And sometimes you can meet that with a little bit of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had brought Jessica Corbin on my first date with Jennifer,  I would not be married today.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I'm happy I didn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't show up with this beautiful woman on your arm and say,  hey, this is my wing woman.  Hi, I'm out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, you don't introduce me as Slatch, I'm Jessica.  I'm just Jessica.  Oh, that's even worse.  Not wing woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's one thing, I mean, it's one thing what Jessica's saying is like,  if you're with a group of women and you're going out to a bar,  you're out to a club, that basically you get some sort of credit  from the other women in the room because...  That I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't show up on your first big date with a woman trailing alongside you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what she's going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I'm kind of like, imagine it being like I'm there with you in the first stage now.  Second stage comes off and you've got the number.  I'm not going with you on the damn date.  I'm not.  But I am going to be watching.  So I can critique you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, had I shown up for my first date with Jennifer  with a camera crew sound man producer,  that probably wouldn't have gone over too good either.  So, it's all...  Hey, let's get to the tech.  Although, as funny as this is, in fact, as tech as I am to say,  let's not do a tech show anymore.  Let's talk dating, ladies and gentlemen, but it's time...  Relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Relationships.  Does vampire sell bumper stickers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  I think you have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I slapped one across your forehead the last time.  No, I saw one at Barney's Beanery in West Hollywood in one of the booths.  I thought, oh my God, vampire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Prager, join the movement.  That's all I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm sorry, but I hate to say it,  but it sounds like a feminine hygiene product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's totally not.  You're supposed to say that.  It sounds hot and sexy.  And I want to know more.  It's not a feminine hygiene product.  It sounds like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even though you could use a bumper sticker for whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop, stop, stop, both of you.  Stop right now.  It sounds like Summer's Eve, the new Bean with Bacon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the new Bean with Bacon flavor.  I just, it's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm going to release the vampire on you, Leo.  You better be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I got the twit army behind me.  Okay.  Guys?  Excuse me.  Guys?  Where'd they go?  They weren't here.  Guys?  Oh, they've all gone over to the vampire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember that return your money offer you made a couple weeks ago?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we got our first charge back on PayPal.  Get this.  Somebody donates.  I mean, this is free.  Look, this podcast is free.  Somebody donates, I think it was 20 bucks.  And then calls their credit card company, says,  I didn't get the merchandise I bought.  And cancels.  And then there's an investigation.  The credit card company calls PayPal.  And PayPal says, well, we've got a charge back.  So I just wrote them a note saying,  dude, you didn't have to ask your credit card company.  I want to give you the money back.  What are you talking about?  Maybe it wasn't, you know, him or her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it was their spouse or their parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they thought it was a porno thing.  We didn't get our merchandise.  Yeah, twit.  That's a vampire.  That's different.  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Story number one, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is 7800G2X this week, which shockingly enough,  the product actually shipped the night of the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, we had three shops the night of the announcement  and pretty much everywhere.  How much is it?  Heron, where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like 600 bucks, I think, for this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like 550 to 600 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a video card.  What shipped?  Oh, yeah.  The 78.  You remember the 78.  $500 is a typical high-end price for a brand new card.  I think this one's 600, though.  It's more than that, even.  That's more than an e-machine.  Okay, okay.  Take a deep breath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I own two e-machines, and I know what I'm getting,  and it's no 78.  It's no 78.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're sold.  But that price has been there for a while now.  That $500, $600 price point for the very best cards  as soon as they come out.  And it holds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is NVIDIA eating ATI's lunch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Temporarily.  No.  Well, it's amazing to look at the benchmark numbers  that people are throwing out.  And like a 7800, especially NVIDIA's throwing out.  Like a 7800 is the equivalent performance  of two of our former fastest cards, and that's in Li mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it funny how this goes back and forth?  Like a couple of years ago, the script was,  NVIDIA's dead ATI has finally beat them,  and the X800, and now it's gone the other way.  It really is a seesaw, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It always is.  For years, it was like, first, Matrox got three, or like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever happened to them.  What was it before, Matrox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're still making high-end video products up in Canada,  but they're pretty much out of the 3D race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really ATI. It's a two-horse race now.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, who should upgrade...  For desktop 3D, yeah.  Who should... I mean, should anybody upgrade to a 7800 GTX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, if you're building a brand new system right now.  You should... If you're spending, you know,  over $500 for a CPU, you should be spending over $500  for a video card if you want to match them well.  So say Robert, and so it shall be.  And with a corollary to that would be that,  look, if you're going to spend $500 on a video card,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you better already have a CPU that's top of the line.  They can push that GPU as fast as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jessica, this is why we can't get dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm sitting back just trying to visualize...  If you were the wingwoman at this point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what would you advise Roger to do?  Let's say you're Roger's wingwoman here.  Change the subject. Change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How would we change the subject to, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What should he change the subject to, wingwoman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If I was in this situation and Roger was talking about  cards, sound cards, graphic cards, I would tell him,  you know, relate it to the woman.  How is this going to affect the woman in some way?  Is this going to affect her fashion sense?  You know how fast the virtual woman can create the video card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not what she's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're back into virtual. We're not back into reality.  We want real.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, one of these could put the down payment on a diamond ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you say, this is how you wrap it back in.  I'm not going to get the new card,  and instead I'm going to get you a new Tiffany.  That's how those two things work.  I would love to buy this $600 video card,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but honey, because you matter so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's a really great line from Firefly,  the Joss Whedon series, to go,  honey, remember that sex we were ever going to have again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? So what did you do to me that whole series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want guys to stop the geek talk  because any time that you talk passionately about something,  it's hot.  Passion.  So there is something for you guys right there.  If you're passionate about this, you talk about it with passion.  But every now and again, you've got to kind of bring it back down and relate it.  That's pretty rare, Jess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tend to just listen and then repeat.  Did you know I can get frame rates over 100 frames a second in Far Cry?  See, that didn't get you anywhere.  I mean, this is incredible.  You tried it.  You just don't even go there.  That's for your gang.  1600 by 1200, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing. Zip. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Passion in the right area.  Item two.  Passion in the right area is okay.  Let's get sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jack Kilby has passed away.  The inventor of the microprocessor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten points for Mr. Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eighty-one years old.  He got a Nobel Prize for it.  Okay. Item three.  That was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's move right along here.  It's kind of funny that, I mean, was that even made a super big deal?  Like, if someone like the inventor of the automobile,  I mean, granted, he'd already passed away many hundreds of years ago,  but if he died recently, more people would take notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's about a hundred years ago, give or take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure when Orville and Wilbur passed on, there was a big national ceremony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we should point out the story where we found this on was in an MSNBC story.  It's not like it was, you know, I don't even know.  Has this even shown up on SlashTime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  But it isn't the front page news it probably ought to be.  I mean, this guy changed the world, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, concerning cell phones, your ATM machine, you know, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'd be no Fempire without Jack Kilby.  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There'd be no, you know, Paris Hilton, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Where would she, where would she have no sidekick?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's pretty amazing to realize there was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Surely someone would have invented an integrated circuit, though,  I mean, if it hadn't been for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think somebody else would have done it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the guy, I mean, it's an interesting thought.  There are people working on it, but he was 1958, he was fresh out of college,  and, or at least, I don't know if he was fresh out of college,  but it was his first year working at TI, and they basically let him work on this.  That's neat.  Miniaturization full-time.  That's pretty cool.  And, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're right, if somebody else, probably at TI, would have done this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an interesting thought.  He's the one who put it together, for better or for worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do they call it the Kilby?  No.  He doesn't even have a hamburger named after him at Barney's Beannery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he probably found away all his patent rights, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably true, too.  He didn't make any money on it, either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of sad, in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was he part of the military after during the war, World War II,  for code breaking and things like that?  I should just read up on the guy.  For more on Jack Kilby, visit your local library.  Thanks, kids!  Or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wikipedia.  Wikipedia and Jack Kilby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is really interesting to think about how our lives would be changed had he not.  But the thing is, it's probably a collaborative effort.  So, even though he got the notoriety for it, chances are it was a number of people working on it.  Probably fame more than notoriety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I mean, remember, who was it?  Neil Stevenson wrote the Steam Age, the Diamond Age.  The theory being that the computer was steam-driven and how that would have changed the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Gibson and Bruce Sterling.  Bruce Sterling, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of funny.  I think that's kind of the heart of speculative fiction is thoughts like that.  What if that had never happened?  Sliding doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sliding doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh!  Pardon me, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just thinking back to that anime, Steam Boy.  That's kind of bits on the whole premise of the Victorian Age.  And he has this one device, it's steam powered, but it's super powerful that can decide the fate of humanity.  And he has controlled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someday David Byrne is going to make a song out of Roger Chang's tweet comments.  I don't even understand.  Oh, gee.  Not only is it digitized, but it doesn't make any sense.  It's like, you know...  He's a xylon, for worse.  He's a xylon.  Resistance is brittle.  It's a condition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My doctor says no clear-up.  It all...  What's that, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hey, on Kilby.  He's noted as being the patenting inventor of the portable calculator and the thermal printer.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Hey, the thermal printer.  I remember those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, let's move it along.  We only have an hour show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've covered a lot of ground so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next to our wing woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prager, what's the story of Sunnyvale getting its lights hacked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I left this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know anything about that.  I heard about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I heard you did it.  You didn't do it?  Wasn't it for G4?  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  Just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is going to be something coming out on, I believe it's called From the Shadows, about  traffic lights in their next little box.  So Yoshi did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing in Sunnyvale, somebody's basically been hacking the traffic light boxes in Sunnyvale  and they're just lighting them up so all directions blink red simultaneously at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically shutting down traffic in Sunnyvale.  I think it's a good hack.  What a lot of people don't know is that there's boxes they put in ambulances, there's boxes  you can get access to that will trick, that will trip certain lights to change them from  red to green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I always wanted one of those.  Buses have them too.  It would be so cool.  I don't know if the buses have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In San Francisco they just run the red lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't care.  Right.  So this has to stop for a red light, would that make a difference?  I think it's, you know, it's not a high tech hack.  I mean the guy probably has a key to the box and is able to wire it.  I just think it's kind of funny.  Nobody's died yet.  But it's funny that this happened in the heart of Silicon Valley.  The hackers live everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Has the guy been caught?  No.  Or is this like a, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and actually the tech angle is that the police are asking people to put down their  cell phones and pay attention.  Nobody's noticed this guy doing it.  And if you're going to use your cell phone, use your camera to snap a picture of him doing  it.  Nobody's seen him do it.  When's he doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, is this a, this might be a boy versus girl thing.  Like do all guys kind of have the ambition to be able to do something like that?  Because this isn't occurred to girls.  Girls aren't like, I want to go out there and hack into that.  My daughter does.  Does she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it might be generational.  Maybe it's just personality.  Maybe it's genetic.  I don't know.  I would.  Daddy, what's your password?  What's the root password?  What's the root password?  Well, I wanted my daddy's passwords.  I think your daddy had passwords?  God, you're so young.  Forbidden knowledge.  My daddy didn't have passwords.  My daddy was lucky if he had a safe deposit box.  Passwords.  When did passwords enter our life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember using them on BBSs.  1985, my first ATM card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's part of our lives now.  We all have hundreds of passwords.  Twenty years ago you didn't have a password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How many passwords do you guys use?  Do you guys use the same password over and over and over again?  Or do you guys have tons?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I try to change mine yearly.  My master password.  Oh, you have a master password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I forget my password.  Yeah, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a medium, high and low security password.  I use the same thing over and over.  Okay.  Because the minute I use a different password, I can't log in.  I keep having to ask Skype what's my password because I never remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually use the same theme for everything.  It's all a variation on the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to share this theme with us or is it something you probably don't?  I'll tell you about it later on.  It's all pies.  Different flavors of pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm hungry now.  Pie.  Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we have any other stories, Patrick?  You've got to keep moving here.  Patrick's going to be doing this on his own in the next couple weeks.  I have a fun one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can I tell you something that I found?  Did you guys read about the PlayStation thumb?  You read about it, this 13-year-old girl, the first published case in a medical journal,  symptoms including blisters, numbness and tingling.  The first case published in a medical journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this the first case?  I've been hearing about Nintendo thumb for a long time.  Oh, this is the first PlayStation thumb.  Is there an Xbox thumb?  Or Pong wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what's interesting is I think a couple of years ago there were some British medical doctors  who were saying that there should be something to turn about vibration controllers.  Because they found this one kid was playing PlayStation like eight hours a day  and he was actually getting early arthritis.  High gene issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because don't we all, if you use a console, they all have rumble packs now, right?  Isn't that kind of standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  They were just saying you've got to take that in moderation.  Because those British doctors, they pay attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I thought you were going to talk about was the overheating the laptop thing.  Because that was also in the Lancet or whatever the Journal of American British Tom Fuller he is.  Medical stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They say that this PlayStation thumb is becoming very common in children.  Very common.  Oh, I'm sure it is.  Instead of like skinned knees, which I'm sure is a common injury, it's now PlayStation thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm waiting for an entire generation of kids who are super near-sighted  because all they do is they watch a monitor flash sprites and all that.  And a Lasik side edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That whole near-sighted television thing is hooey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you had a Lasik, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I went through that process, but I didn't get the actual injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zap and flap?  Remember?  Flap and zap.  Oh yeah, that's right.  They said your eyes were so bad they couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they could do it.  Mines would just take a year instead of like a day.  They would do it and then I'd show up six months later to do some more.  They'd do some more because they would only do half of it.  And then they would make sure that the eye wasn't trying to regrow or redo something with my eye.  In that period where they had to laze off a little more.  So I wouldn't be one of those people that would throw off their glasses  at the end of the operation saying I'm free.  Tech TV was going to pay for that.  They were?  Yeah.  Oh, because we were going to fake, we were going to film it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right, we were going to tape it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Put my eyeball under the laser and blaze away.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's sad.  I could have had perfect vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or at least better vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it would have taken a year and we weren't going to be around in a year.  So they just said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually the real reason they canned it was because Roger would be like,  hey, how do you like your new eyesight?  And Roger would be like, I can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, you know the real reason is everyone likes to wear glasses.  And then they'd go, Roger doesn't wear glasses anymore.  And then it's not Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find the minute I started wearing glasses, people found me more approachable.  Strangers on the street especially.  It was just like out of nowhere.  You need a wing woman.  That's awesome.  Wing women are hot.  Wing women says glasses are hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really?  As long as they're the right frames.  Heck yeah.  What kind of frames?  Not that I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll go eyeglass showering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I got Nike wire frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you say Oakleys, like the old school 80s Oakleys, we're in magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oakleys?  No, these are actually very tasteful.  They're not aviators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're actually kind of steel frames, very subtle.  That sounds good.  Did somebody turn on a motor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hear that too.  What the heck is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's my fan.  Wait until you see the horrible, horrible frames that Martin Sargent has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God.  We've got to get Martin on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's he up to now?  He's having a lot of barbecues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the noise just went off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really is he looking for work in television or has he found a job?  Yeah, I just saw him last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's got his manager and his agent there.  He's auditioning all over the place.  They keep telling him that he nails these auditions.  I don't know, he's still moving, still going, looking for the next big gig.  It's tough.  It's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It's so hard.  It could be great and it doesn't matter.  It's just the right time, right place, right look, right shoe size, whatever it is, it's  hit or miss.  That's why I just stay here in my little attic in Petaluma and I don't talk to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're a man-pire in your own way.  I'm a man-pire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a vampire.  You're your own man-pire.  I don't think seeing man-pire doesn't work.  Man-pire sounds like I'm on fire, like they're burning me.  We have a man-pire.  Somebody sent me a discovery.  Okay, I've got a British, this is the kind of crap I get offers for.  Some British company that's producing probably for $12 a show for discovery on science.  Then they say, yeah, and they say, can you come to LA?  I said, no, I'm in Petaluma in my attic.  If you want to come to my attic, I'll talk to you.  They don't and then they don't.  That's my career right there in a nutshell.  It's nice here in the attic.  There you are.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Chris Lockernoam-Perillo.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  You had a big question mark next to you.  By the way, I don't know if I really like this icon, Chris.  It's your chest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an easy way of identifying me on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to put him on a hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turn your volume down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick's going to work with you on your microphone.  I have to put you on hold because everybody else is going, what the heck happened?  Just hang on.  Hold on a second.  Just turn it down a little bit and I'm going to resume the conference.  Hey, guys, hold on.  I know we disappeared, but hang on for a second.  Because the Lockernoam has appeared.  So Roger, I'm going to bump you off here because you're the lowest quality.  Okay?  It's great talking to you.  Nothing personal, Roger.  Go call your girlfriend.  Digital art.  There he goes.  And now I'm going to add, ladies and gentlemen, Chris Perillo's chest to the...  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is it?  RentMyChest.com, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got I Love RSS, I Heart RSS, and then underneath a little orange XML logo on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I just painted a...  Well, Ponzi, my fiance, just painted a big blue E on my chest for the announcement that was made at GnomeDex this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking about that, but let me just first introduce everybody to you.  Chris, you're talking with Leo Laporte, of course, Patrick Norton, David Prager, I'm sure you remember, from Tech TV, Robert Heron, also from Tech TV, and Jessica Corbin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The names sound familiar, but I'm not sure where to place them.  It's been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So congratulations, by the way.  We were just talking about the fact that Microsoft chose your conference to announce this new RSS capability in Longhorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was pretty happy about it.  We weren't sure what was going to happen with it.  And certainly, you know, not to play favorites, I've been trying to get a hold of Apple for years to get them involved with the conference, but have yet to receive anything back from them.  And finally, Microsoft really made this particular year, fifth year, a breakthrough.  We're still at the top of Google News, Tech Narate had major press mentions, total blog coverage.  It's been an amazing, amazing weekend for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mentioned you had Dave Weiner and Adam Curry, which is...  Yeah.  Now, when you booked them, you knew that they were kind of at each other's throats, right?  Oh, certainly.  But you did book them at opposite ends of the conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I had asked Adam Curry, and he did it hands down.  It wasn't even a question for him as he had tuned into the last Gnome Dex when we streamed it online and really enjoyed it from a hotel, I believe, in London at the time.  So I basically lined him up first, and then when I had heard a podcast done between Dave Weiner, Steve Rubel, and I believe the guy from HackingNetflix.com,  and they had asked Dave if he was going to come to Gnome Dex, and I was like, you know what?  It would be tremendous if we had Dave as our second keynote.  Very cool.  And it worked out very, very well.  But he's the second keynote, but he goes first.  Yeah, I like putting my – as you remember, Leo – I like putting my keynotes – since we had two this year, I was able to kind of bookend them.  I think it's a good idea.  So that we get a good start and we get a good finish, and it worked out very, very well for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they kissed and made up at Locker Nook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was kind of – it was very eerie. I think people were disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jessica called it hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop it.  Well, there was a little tongue action going on, but I don't think anybody caught that on film, so.  That's okay. Someone caught Matt Mullenweg from WordPress, the open source CMS, wearing a movable-type hat.  Someone threw it on as a joke, and someone happened to snap a picture before he was able to yank it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there isn't this big rivalry going on. I mean, we're all kind of in it together, right?  I mean, this is small enough that it's not like we're at each other's throats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny.  You use Vi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can you guys kick me real quick through what the rivalry is about?  Which one?  With Adam Curry. What is this rivalry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the story, Chris?  Well, I only know it as an outsider, as most people do, except if you were Adam or Dave.  And I think it just has to do with two very, very strong technologists with slightly different ideas.  And they're definitely going in the same direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They both really can both take credit for podcasting.  Oh, certainly.  Without either one of them, it wouldn't be what it is today.  Exactly.  But they seem to have some disagreements over who should get more credit for it.  I think that's kind of where the bottom line is, isn't it?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment.  I think Dave has been, well, I thought it was extremely rude when he was written out of the Wikipedia entry for podcasting.  I think that it just shows, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who would do that? I mean, some kid did that. Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know what? I wouldn't put it past.  You think it was part of the Curry Nation?  No, I wouldn't say necessarily Curry supporters.  But there are just some people who don't quite understand Dave.  And I don't think anyone understands Dave, myself included.  He can get on people's nerves.  He's got strong opinions and he's very direct.  Not ashamed or afraid to say a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So one of the things that people noted was that Microsoft said support for RSS, not for Atom.  Do you think that that's significant or is that just, does Microsoft mean RSS and everything else around it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. They're using RSS as the umbrella term.  And largely because when it boils down to it, there have been very few examples on how Atom is significantly better than RSS.  Certainly you could do things similar to what you can do with RSS with Atom.  But we've yet to see any practical applications of the Atom format over RSS.  And you might remember, I've been championing this for years.  I was still at Tech TV when I kind of caught the bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a huge fan of RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll never forget you coming running in and saying, look what you've got! Look at the gator! Look at the gator!  Look at all the fees! Look at all the fees!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were showing me gator, I think. Who's gator?  Look at all the fees!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was before Scoba.  Yeah, it was a while ago.  Calm down. Cut down on the coffee.  Exactly. That was before I quit coffee. I'm completely off the juice now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? I have to say, Chris, in all seriousness, you sound really much more relaxed.  Maybe you're just tired after a long walk.  Yeah.  That could be it, too.  When did Lock It Home end? Yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it wrapped up yesterday.  We started Thursday night with a party, as we usually do, to get people kind of warmed up.  And then this Friday happened.  And when I told the conference center that we had over 300 people coming,  because I had sold out the conference at 300, and we added another 100 who wanted to come,  just because they wanted to be there and we didn't want to shut the door on them.  And we totally tapped out their network. I mean, they just were not expecting what they got.  So they added a second T1 by the second day.  And it was slow, but it was manageable on Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the fun things about it, Lock It Home, is every single person in the auditorium is blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. Leo, this is every... I kid you not, there were, I believe, more laptops than people there this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess now it's not blogging. That was when I was there a few years ago.  Now it's probably audio blogging, right? They're all podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. We had, I mean, people were recording the ambience, you know, noise in the room and reactions.  And no, we had video bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a bad DVD where you could see Lock It Home from 47 different angles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God. Don't they do that just in pornos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's porno. Yeah, it's geek porn you're doing right here.  Not that I would know.  No, of course not. Yeah.  So, hey, you're doing some... Let's finish up Lock It Home, and then I want to talk about the new podcast.  But any other big announcements in Lock It Home?  I know the RSS took all the attention, but surely there were other things people were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, by the way, it's GnomeDex, but it's good that you know Lock It Home as well.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. GnomeDex.  It's okay. You're not the only one. It's great. It's actually great branding.  And I may have to explain that at another time. But there were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Chris is the Locker Gnome. The convention is GnomeDex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're kind of one and the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was calling CES Comdex the entire tweet number eight, so people are used to that. That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  No, we had a couple of other minor things kind of announced.  We had Steve Rubel, who is the big PR blogger, had actually convinced Weatherbug to do a few things,  including opening up their APIs and adding RSS feeds and doing a couple other neat things.  But the audience really didn't react too kindly to it.  I give, when I invite someone to speak, and as I say, you know this well, I really don't give anybody a topic.  I just say, this is your time slot. You can pretty much do with it what you wish.  So the only responsibility I claim for anything that may go awry is having, you know, had GnomeDex, but that's it.  Steve's, the audience kind of reacted negatively because they felt it was more of a marketing pitch than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not the same Steve Rubel that started Studio 54 and went to jail for cocaine possession, is it?  No, no, no, no. This is a micro persuasion.  I'm sorry. I'm going to get sued for libel. I forget I even said that.  It's okay. You can edit this out.  Yeah, well, I hope I can edit it out. We're trying to do this thing live to tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, good luck.  We had a couple other minor things. People who announced new updates and new websites around the conference, but not necessarily at the conference.  Since we're kind of the unconference, most sponsors pay for speaking slots, but we don't take that approach to things.  Yes, we take sponsors, but that just because you pay doesn't mean you're guaranteed X, Y, and Z.  We really make it for the attendees, and that really makes it.  I think an emotionally charged event, and that seems to be what I walked away with from it this year, including a few revelations that have already trickled into my personal blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you get engaged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was engaged, although I should be getting married at some point. I don't know the date yet.  I know that.  No, I decided to remove about 95% of the ads that were running on my personal blog.  I'm going to try to structure what I do there just a little differently than I had in the past.  This is not direct feedback from anybody else, but it was just kind of an epiphany that I had when I had dinner with my parents, my fiance, Ponzi, and business partners.  She's pretty much 50-50 with me. Adam Curry, Steve Gilmore, Dave Weiner, we're all sitting around at the table with a few of my people who write for Locker Nom.  Just the discussion really made me think very hard about...  They said, lose the ads, man. Lose the ads.  They didn't say that. They didn't say that. Steve Gilmore, of course, blogs over at ZD, and of course, there are ads there.  It's something that Dave had said that really gave me pause.  They were really happy that Gnome Dex was something that no one else could seem to pull off, but that personal touch really made all the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really true.  Tell us about your podcast. You have the Chris Perillo show, and you're doing something that really isn't...  Nobody in podcasting is doing it. You're doing it live with live phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  How do you do that?  Well, it's the real deal.  I had announced it at the last Gnome Dex when podcasting was starting to get talked about, and hadn't really put all the details together.  But I pretty much said I wanted to do this anyway, and then the podcasting thing hit, and I'm like, oh, this is great.  Even though I still don't like the word as much as I think people who own iPods do, I basically have a live radio show without a radio station.  We take that, we carve it up, MP3, WMA, and let people download it.  It's going like gangbusters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with streaming, and this is why podcasting or even just downloading internet audio is more popular,  the problem with streaming is it's hard to have a lot of people listening at the same time, and it takes a lot of bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got a partner with Limelight Networks, and they streamed the Gnome Dex conference for us as well.  The highest number...  How many streams are you sending out?  I think, well, with the Chris Perillo show, it depends on the topic.  The first show we did with Robert Scoble ended up going 8,000 streams at once.  And then Gnome Dex, in the morning, this is the only real number I had, in the morning we had 3,000 people tuning in before there was anything streaming.  So I think it went up from there. I can only imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's amazing. That's awesome. But that's the problem, because it's a huge hit on a server.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the reason. We actually started to go with an asterisk server for calls and whatnot,  but ultimately for clarity and equality, we decided to just invest in the equipment.  Now we've got an actual six lines coming in, an actual toll-free line that people can call.  We're going to be connecting a modem to one of the machines so that people can leave voicemails in MP3 format and all that.  And you're streaming as Windows Media?  Yeah, it's a Windows Media stream. It will work in every operating system,  whether you're an M player in Linux or the Windows Media player in OS X should work just fine.  32 kilobit or?  It depends, but I think Jake usually streams out. Jake Luddington is my engineer for it.  He usually streams out between 32, 48. We try to keep it pretty good quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really neat. Well, congratulations and congratulations on the success of Gnome Dex this year.  I think this is really going to be a watershed for you. It's going to be a transformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a strange feeling. It's kind of scary. I've got these butterflies in my stomach now.  You're known, baby. You're known now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, good luck. It's great to talk to you, Chris. Please don't be a stranger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. If I can help, tweet anytime. Just let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it. Thank you very much, Chris.  See you guys.  Take care. Chris Pirella, ladies and gentlemen, the Locker in Gnome.  See you, Chris.  The Gnome of the Locker. Steve Rubell did not get arrested for selling Coke. He did run Studio 54.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He had arrested for tax evasion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it was tax evasion. He's dead now, so I guess he won't be suing me.  So moving right along, ladies and gentlemen, shall we continue with the news?  And then I have another special guest I'd like to introduce in a little bit.  Another special guest.  Yes, it's starting to be like one of those shows where people show up and just say hi and schmooze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, this is a story that you brought up, Leo. It's kind of funny.  Samsung's pushing that 16... is it 16 gigabyte flash drives together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. They're going to do 16 gigabyte and they say within a year or two, 100 gigabyte flash drives.  Now, these new flash drives are as fast as, you know, kind of normal speed hard drive.  But there's no moving parts. They're low power.  Your next... I mean, it may very well be your next laptop has instead of a hard drive, a flash drive in it.  I think that's exciting.  That would be so cool. Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. I read a bunch of people writing...  This is going to do amazing things for battery life in portable computers.  They've got to do something.  Well, it's going to do a little bit. The screen takes up 40 or 50 percent of the battery life.  The processor, I've heard estimates ranging anywhere from like 5 to about 15, 20 percent.  The hard drive, about 8 percent of the battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No kidding. You would have thought that was more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they do incredible things to manage the hard drive.  They do a lot of caching and system memory.  So it's spinning down a lot.  They spin down a lot and they manage it pretty well.  I mean, if you basically... I mean, if you want to completely destroy the battery life in your notebook,  turn the screen brightness all the way up and start downloading BitTorrents over a wireless connection.  Optical drives too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's why I always...  I put DVDs on the hard drive thinking in trying to save some battery life,  but I don't know if it makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It probably helps a bit.  Does it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the hard drive is going to be running anyway because of the operating system.  I guess it has to, so it's not... Yeah.  Not spinning up the lasers and the pickups and all the electronics in the drive itself.  One less drive running basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I want to know is what the prices on these are going to be.  Because traditionally flash-based drives have been incredibly expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but look at the drop in prices in these USB drives.  You can get a gig under 100 bucks.  Well under 100 bucks.  So I think that with demand and it ramped up production, you're seeing pretty low prices.  I mean, look, a hard drive is less than a buck a gig.  They've got a long way to go, but I think you could see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nice to get an OLED screen and get the power,  but if they can get the screen life down, or just big fat honking batteries that last all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something's got to give.  We haven't seen a huge improvement in battery tech.  I guess the lithium ion and the lithium ion cell gels are big improvements,  but something's got to give.  You know, they're making tritium batteries.  This is something you don't want.  The new batteries are basically little nuclear reactors in your computer.  They're made out of tritium, and you just better hope they don't leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some hope tritium batteries may one day be more appropriate than chemical batteries  for applications where relatively small amounts of power are needed.  I love Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think fuel cells offer a lot of hope.  Definitely.  Then you'll have, instead of plugging in when you run down,  you'll have a little butane lighter fluid thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't carry on the plane with you.  But the other thing people have played around with is they're saying that  by using nano-level structures, basically using nanoscale surfaces on the,  I don't know what you want to call the layers inside of the battery,  it allows them to become much more efficient in the idea that you'll be able  to have these orders of magnitude improvement in battery performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hoping, because clearly that's really the limiting factor in your cell phone  right now, in the cape.  It's not so much time, it's just the capabilities.  You have to keep it low power so that you have at least a day's worth of charge.  That would be nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Without having the barrier of two pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting, like APC actually recently came out with a notebook battery  that I'm hoping to get a chance to test.  Because instead of being a $600, like the Electrovia cells, which are like $600,  this is like $200, $250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one of these little pads over here.  I don't know if you can see it.  I can't really reach it because I'm on the microphone.  It's the same, it's just a flat battery pack.  I don't think it's anything special, but it's just a flat battery pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very similar to the Powerplug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like this, yeah, but that's not very expensive.  Well, it depends on what you consider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can buy a notebook for $800 spending $600 on a battery.  It looks kind of brutal.  Leo and I are...  Leo's very excited.  He's just grabbed his battery.  He's now examining the 5% on the front of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A long flight to Copenhagen.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry, you're going to Copenhagen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to Copenhagen on Tuesday.  I'm not sure I had that right.  Yeah, that's why you're going to be producing the Twitcast for the next two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Mac cruise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going on a geek cruise to wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.  After Copenhagen, we set sail for adventure on the love boat.  Yeah.  Ooh, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, baby.  What's the theme of the geek cruise that you're going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  It's Mac Mania 3.5.  There's a digital photography co-seminar.  And then there's also a big Star Trek seminar.  So...  Star Trek?  Well, it's not associated, but we're all on the same boat.  So that should be interesting, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I can think of things...  Wow.  What would make anyone on this podcast happier than being trapped in the ocean with a boat  full of Trekkies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I can...  I can make it even better if you want.  I can tell you who's going to be on the cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, look, some of my best friends are Trekkies.  I'm a huge fan of Wil Wheaton.  I know the Trekkies have actually given him a lot of hate along with the love over the  years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just look up because there's some really fabulous...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you've got Mark Swain, Wozniak, Burt Monroe.  Actually, Wozniak bowed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very sad to say he had to do some depositions so he can't go.  Silly, you know?  Mad Libs are much more exciting.  Chris Breen.  Chris Breen will be there.  Jason Snell.  That's going to be fun.  But I was going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are all awesome people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's going to be great.  Woz is fun to cruise with, actually.  I really enjoy Woz.  I think the wing woman can make it killing on this event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I think you guys need my services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Send them in.  Don't tempt me.  That's all I can say.  I'm just looking to see if I can find a Star Trek...  Oh, well.  There are a number of well-known actors from episodes of the Star Trek.  And I think a guy who wrote three episodes is going to be on there, too.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so that's pretty exciting.  Don't jump up and down or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're all doing our rock presentations of excitement at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I can't find...  I'm just going to try to find the names of these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it called Cruise Trek?  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  Well, when you're in Copeland, you can go to Tivoli Gardens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you been there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear it's beautiful.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's awesome.  I'm dying to do that.  And we're going to go to Legoland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  The original Legoland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that'll be really fun.  It will be.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cruise Trek 05, the Baltic Blast.  That's it.  30th of July, 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's going to be on that?  Give me a second.  That's the Baltic Blast.  The Baltic Blast.  Yeah.  Actually, this is pretty amazing.  You're going to Copenhagen, Tallinn, Estonia, St. Petersburg, Helsinki, Finland, Stockholm.  Yeah, it's part of my world tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be great.  Do you have a t-shirt for that, Leo?  I do.  Oh, yes.  As a matter of fact, I'm glad you asked.  There is, in fact, and I'll put a link on the show notes.  Is there going to be a book?  There's no book.  But there is a, there's a, Wayne and Akron.  Well, I have to be honest with you.  Wayne and Akron put together a cafe press store with the Leo World Tour t-shirts, mugs,  thongs, the works.  We've sold 36 items.  I will wear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I will wear it.  Will you?  We've sold 36 items in two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  36 items.  It is not exactly a huge success.  And I don't know why.  You want the thong, you got the thong.  I'll make sure that one's shipped to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Prager, you too, baby.  You too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think we need a new cover photo for the podcast.  Maybe the two of you in a thong really would really, something for the guys?  I think Prager.  Something for the gals.  I think it's just Prager.  Just Prager?  Yeah.  Just Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Prager's the best mascot in the world.  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know what I found, Prager?  I found pictures of you when you were growing your hair out into the giant blonde afro.  Oh, yeah.  I cried when you cut that hair off.  You looked amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you find that on, there was a before and after shot way back in Leo's old mo-blogger's  current mo-blog, but it was back in the history of the mo-blog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The good old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's all this information about the cruise track, but I can't find any information  on about who's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't want to say, because you know, these guys, what happens is they agree to  do it and then they don't show up.  So they don't really want to say, you know.  But sometimes, you know, like Brent Spiner sometimes says he'll come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So here's something that kind of merges...  Oh, he's cool.  Traveling and technology.  I was just looking on Travelocity and they say there was something about two out of five  people have to sneak away, quote unquote, to check their email or their voice mail.  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  And so, but you can just be totally out.  You can be out of the closet on that ship.  Everybody is fully out.  Nobody needs to sneak away to do anything.  No, I'm here.  Everything is perfectly acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Checking my email.  How is the satellite access?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never had that problem.  It's actually pretty bad.  They use a big satellite dish.  It's not in Marsap, but it's something like that.  For the internet access.  It's funny, I took it, you know, we were able to talk our way into a tour of the bridge.  I think because Woz was with us.  But anyway, last time, they don't, you know, it's post 9-11.  You can't go see the bridge.  There is nobody driving the ship.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever seen the big freighters?  There's nobody there.  The container ships?  There's one guy.  Big container ships are really...  It's still automated, isn't it?  Yeah, right.  No, it's totally automated.  And you've got a ship that's like two foot-poles.  There's nobody driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's empty.  You'd expect like a couple of guys with pipes and people measuring things on the ch...  No.  And I said, well, how do you get your weather?  I said, what, the fax machines?  People measuring things on the ch...  Yeah, sure.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  And they said, no, no, we don't get faxes for the weather anymore.  They just email it to us.  And then, so the emergency May Day.  I said, where's your radio officer?  Where's Sparks, right?  Somebody's got a May Day.  Do they have any flares?  Do they have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't have radio men anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pick up the phone if the ship is sinking.  They call 911.  Well, that's the whole point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wish you could talk to one of the guys that still works at G4 who is in charge of IT in  the studio.  And he used to...  He helped wire the Queen Mary 2.  God, it's amazing.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the fire control there is just incredible.  They can monitor you through the little spigot in your sprinkler at what temperature your  room is in every single room.  And then if it gets very hot, of course, they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's what's happening with...  You're either having a good time or...  With large-scale buildings now, like the Zigbee control systems and stuff.  Oh, it's amazing.  You're creating a mesh network.  Basically, creating a wireless network.  They're talking about putting in tens of thousands of these for the light switches.  There's sensors everywhere.  Yeah, and for the heating and cooling for the AC switches.  So the idea is you can basically figure out which part of the building is using the heat,  which part of the building isn't using the heat, whose temperature up.  You can automatically shut the lights off.  You know, if a light bulb goes out, it automatically tells you it's amazing the level of control

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're starting to get.  They steer these ships with joysticks.  You would like this, Robert.  They have...  Talk about Nintendo thumb.  They have bow thrusters.  They basically can micro position the ship any way you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's still a tremendous amount of skill and education.  Those are neat.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's no brakes.  I said, where's the brakes?  Oh, I'm sorry.  We don't have brakes.  Well, you know.  You know, for all of the technology for fire suppression, navigation, all of that, until  they get the whole being able to keep a stomach flu from racing through a ship and taking  them back into port.  That just sounds like a nightmare situation to me.  Well, they have...  I'd much rather lay on the beach.  They do pay attention to that.  They have little alcohol...  You know, the things that they have in hospitals, little alcohol hand scrubbing units everywhere.  And they encourage you to watch them.  Yeah, that's good.  They have those in the slot machines now before you get to cash your chips in.  Those are disgusting.  Get you the whole wife.  Can you imagine who's been on that slot machine?  Jeez.  Nickel slots are the worst.  Yeah.  Nickels are disgusting.  No, don't do nickel slots.  You don't know who's been there.  People on the dollar slots are like so much more hygienic.  Classy.  It's classy.  It's a classy crowd on the dollar slots.  Don't you find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently, I've been hanging out in the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of Martin Sargent, anybody been to Slots of Fun lately?  That was his place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I only go to Slots of Fun with Martin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the most lodesome casino I've ever been to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because you've never been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forget it.  It was...  He liked it because it had two dollar tables, right?  But the carpet hadn't been washed in years.  I mean, that thing was...  That was carpet?  There was something growing on the linoleum.  There was fungus on the ground.  Oh, God.  Shall we invite our special guest in?  Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to my friend from Canada.  Yes, it's the boy with the toque.  It's Andy Walker, the co-host on Call for Help.  Andy, now, you may not know these people, but I'm going to introduce you around.  David Prager, former producer at the Screen Savers, now working with Kevin Rose on System.  Hi, Andy.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Robert Herron, who is a former lab guy with Tech TV, who is now at PC Magazine,  in charge of their HDTV lab.  Jessica Corbin, the beautiful Jessica Corbin from Tech TV,  longtime host of the Screen Savers, and now the queen of her own FEMPIRE.  And also Patrick Norton.  So Andy's never done a twitcast before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have not. No, I'm very honored to be a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this was a big day for Twits because earlier Chris Perla was here without a shirt on,  and that was attractive.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course.  Is this all in person, or did you just somehow see this on video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a, well, no, actually, I'm all alone in my attic.  No, actually, I'm here with Patrick. He's wearing a kilt.  Believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is why Leo's blocking me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you cross your legs?  I hear Jessica's fan, don't I?  Is that your fan?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Whose fan is that?  It's mine. It's mine. It's my laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like somebody's got a weed whacker going here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, it's just the fan. It's hot. My poor baby's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can come out of the closet now. We put her in the closet for sound reasons.  You want to come out of the closet? You can. It's okay.  Come on, Jessica. It's a very special take.  No, no, you can leave your, wherever you went. I don't know, you went somewhere, yes?  To be quiet?  Yes.  And you can go out into the great world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, no matter where I go, the weed whacker sound will go with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Give her a pillow to bury your notebook when you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to because it would overheat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Andy wanted to tell us about spit storms. You ever have a spit storm?  Spit?  Do you know what a spit storm is? Tell us what a spit storm is, Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's sort of one of these new internet threats that everybody's talking about and nobody's actually experienced yet.  The idea being that if you have one of these VoIP phones from Vonage or someplace like that,  some bad guy could potentially fire up his computer and push out all kinds of audio spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are actually hacking the IP phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the idea. So your VoIP phone would ring and all of a sudden there would be somebody there trying to sell you penis enlargement pills or something awful like that.  But I mean, that's the theory.  Don't knock on me though. I'm sorry.  Has it worked for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not all bad.  Edit number five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But nobody's sort of proved that this can actually happen yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, see, that's the thing. Remember there was Bluetooth snarfing that people talked about?  And then there was the Bluetooth pickup thing.  And a lot of this stuff and semantics saying watch out because your cell phone is going to get viruses.  I think there's a lot of stuff that people talk about. Theoretical.  It just doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's like Microsoft and Windows.  People announce all these terrible viruses and worms and it's really theoretical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. Those exploits, many of them never happen.  The question is, is it because we patch or is it because they never really were a threat in the first place?  You don't know. You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems to me there's lots of little sort of new buzzwords kicking around the security community though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the name Spitstorm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is this kind of thing.  It's got a certain genus aqueasy. Is there anywhere we can read about Spitstorm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can read it. Go ahead.  Oh no, I was just looking over at VoIP-News.com and they've got an article about Spit. It says VoIP's dark side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dark side. Well, we have Jessica's fan is spitting on our VoIP phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what? I should get off. It's just spitting like crazy.  It is. It won't stop. Because it's hot now and it's going to keep doing this until I leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I have abandonment issues. If you don't stay on the show, I will feel like you've left us. You can.  But I will return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're a wing-walker.  The wing-woman, the penpress, will return next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, let's say so long to the lovely Jessica Torben.  I do. I do.  Thank her for adding some estrogen to this, sadly, Testeroni program.  Thank you, Jessica. See you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love me the testosterone.  Bye, Jessica.  Bye, bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andy, you might be interested. Andy does speed dating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got a new TV show where she's the wing-woman.  So instead of having a wing-guy, you know how when you go dating you have a wing-guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's saying, of course, to help you, sort of to help you prop you up and bring you alliances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Andy, they were talking for a while about the Canadian parliament passing a law, basically making your copyright law like our DMCA in the States, disallow copy protection reverse engineering.  Did that go through or is that just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was tabled. It was tabled last week.  Hallelujah.  Bill C60, which basically will, you know, it makes things very similar to the digital millennium copyright act.  Right, right.  The exception doesn't attack the technologies, it attacks the user.  Oh, that's even worse.  So it makes it illegal to upload songs onto, you know, shared directories like Kazaa, BitTorrent, and it stops you from tampering with copyright protections on CDs and stuff like that.  So kind of a win for the music industry and everybody else.  Well, if it was tabled, it's not though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tabled means it's done.  Or no?  Tabled means it's introduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.  So then they go away for the summer recess and they come back and then, you know, they move on.  So they could vote on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, wow.  That is very bad news for users, good news for the music industry, but bad news for users.  Yeah, that's too bad.  Canada was one of the last places you could steal music legally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but it's one of the higher profile nations.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The closest one on our northern border.  Border.  I go to Canada to steal my music.  See, that's the advantage of doing this show.  You should come up.  You go up there, you steal music and you go back down.  That's what I do.  Sound like TV too.  You sound like TV and I buy my prescription drugs and then I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how I end up getting strip searched at border.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's not how it's because you're wearing a kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Actually, the kilt, they usually stay away from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get in without a passport with a kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did change the laws now.  They're going to require passports for US citizens to go into these various countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless you wear a kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, not go into, but get back into the states.  You can leave, but you can't come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's always like, I go into Mexico pretty regularly for Baja, to go to Baja.  It's always that sketchy little feeling when you're coming back into the states.  Yeah, well, they let you back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the good thing is, or will they take your car apart because they think you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they saw Cheech and Chong up in smoke.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you figure they show that as a training film for customs inspectors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's just really odd because you come up to the border, right?  And invariably, if you're coming through Tijuana, there's always 42,000 cars in line.  So you basically have people offering you plaster of Paris, Last Supper,  it's covered in gold glitter, and Aztec Mayan blankets, and gum, and chiclets, and foodstuffs, and tortillas.  And you have an hour of this, and there's been a lot of people begging for change.  And you get there, and I got one guy who's apparently just been having a bad night.  He looks at me, and he leans forward.  He gets this really serious school vice principal look on his face, the disciplinary principal.  And he's just like, where have you been?  I've been doing a pit for racing Baja about 200 miles south of the border.  He's like, you aren't bringing any steroids in that you brought from one of the pharmacies.  And I'm looking at myself, and I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're buff, that's why.  I'm not buff.  You look like a power lifter.  I'm chunky.  That's being generous.  Well, all I can say is, it ain't steroids they ask me about.  50 cases of chiclets.  That's good gum.  I'm bringing in the Mexican gum.  That's it.  I'm a gum smuggler.  Oh, gum smuggling.  Okay, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, actually, recently, the last place we came through, somebody...  We were drinking Diet Cokes, and we gave a couple to a couple of the race officials from SCORE who were in line behind us.  And they actually pulled us out of the line.  A couple of local cops pulled us out of the line because they thought we were drinking beer.  And I'm trying to explain in my very bad Spanish that I've been sober for 15 years, I'm not drinking ticades in the line.  Actually, I was basically like...  Did that work?  I used the AA line in Spanish, which I can't remember what I did, but I remember the language for it.  And it worked?  I think he just got so perplexed at that point.  Because I'm holding up a crushed flat dripping Diet Coke can from the floor of Jason's truck.  And he's like, hey, you want to look in the cooler?  He's like, no, no, no, no, get back in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mi amigo, Bill W.  This has been a really strange show, hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been weird.  I was waiting for Patrick to start talking about Ultra Wideband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Ultra Wideband.  And by the way, Dvorak really wants to be part of the show, but he's still having technical difficulties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, here's the thing. If Dvorak will give us the address of his secret Dvorak lair...  I know where he lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you may know, but he has to.  Should I go over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should go over there and we should just Skype on a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we'll just set it up.  The reason I bring that up is because he had a whole screed about Ultra Wideband and how it was bogus and stuff.  And I said, well, come on the show. He said, I can't. I can't figure it out.  But let's talk about Ultra Wideband and we will channel once again John C. Dvorak.  Do you want me to play the part of John C. Dvorak?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll never work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually have his sound effects. We could just play those in the middle of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is there a John C. Dvorak soundboard?  We really need one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? That's a great idea. I have John C. Dvorak sound effects because he would sometimes miss the radio show.  But nobody ever noticed because I just play the sound effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll never work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty much the stuff. Let me see if I can find them.  Here it is. I don't know if you guys will hear it. That's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hear it.  Can you hear it?  Well, I don't remember all the details.  I'm writing books all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the guy I learned by the way on how to plug books.  I'm writing books all the time.  And if the show got a little slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's go to Pablo in Walnut Creek.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my god. I don't know how you get this stuff onto your computer, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just start talking about Ultra Wideband and every once in a while I'll do that.

Transcript:  Freescale made an announcement that they're coming up with what they're calling the first Ultra Wideband product which is basically...  What is it?  What they're doing, Freescale is basically working on some wireless technology that will do a wireless connection to a monitor primarily for like home theater applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about Extreme USB? It was an announcement about Extreme USB this week.  Well that's part of what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's actually... Mark Hockman will really get our article up on extremetech.com.  Ultra Wideband goes back a long time.  The idea was it's basically a form of radio modulation.  It goes back to the early 60s. People have been working on it.  There's actually I think Radar Vision and Multispectral are two companies that basically use Ultra Wideband.  They use Ultra Wideband frequency or Ultra Wideband technology to see through walls.  What? This is to see through walls?  No, no, no. That's two of the existing applications for it.  Now there's Freescale and the UWB forum and then there's basically Intel and the Multiband OFDM alliance.  And they have two competing specs for the IEEE standard for Ultra Wideband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it for? Is it sending data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's... basically imagine a wireless PC.  So imagine 1394 in USB wirelessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything wireless.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now with Freescale, the Freescale stuff, and I'm probably going to get a call from the Freescale PR person,  but Freescale is essentially doing... they're concentrating on like a wireless home theater connection to go to your monitor.  Like a high bandwidth connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's certainly... so that was the example you set of... or maybe it was Robert.  It would be nice to have a high-def TV that didn't have 18 wires hanging out.  Absolutely.  And they never show that in the ads, you know, with the Pioneer plasma, with a couple putting it on the ceiling.  They never... where's the wires?  Right.  How do you plug it in?  Yeah, they don't show the 40-foot run of DV cable running through the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the $3,000 installation fee in your home for snaking the wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are one pathetic loser.  I'm sorry.  That's not John.  That's not John.  I pushed the wrong button.  I apologize.  Okay, thank you.  So John...  But they were demonstrating with wireless A technology at CES.  Was it this year or last year?  They actually had a wireless 720p feed going to a plasma.  Sharp was thinking of Samsung was showing it off.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been a lot of demo.  I mean basically, because neither one of these two can manage to get the swing votes to push their version of Ultrawideband through,  both versions of Ultrawideband are going to ship.  There's going to be two competing consumer versions of Ultrawideband hitting stores somewhere Christmas,  you know, Q4, Q1, and in a lot of different applications.  I think it's going to be a little messy and a little confusing for consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And John, what was your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John, you didn't like this.  Well, I don't remember all the details.  So I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to get me for this.  But he said, we've seen this before, big deal, it's bogus.  Well, it's not that bogus.  He'll believe it when he sees it, I guess.  And that's what we're all saying, yeah.  I think he had a good point in that, look, any wireless technology that can sustain, say, 30 megabit could be used for HD or any video streaming.  So it really doesn't matter what technology it is, but is it just going to be a one-off or a proprietary technology that's not compatible with anything?  Or are the people that are looking at this for wireless HD transmission waiting for maybe the industry standard to finally emerge and say,  okay, look, now we're going to have cheap parts, everyone can adopt it, my Ultrawideband or whatever band product will work with another product,  or are we going to get stuck in this quasi-wireless network situation we're kind of seeing right now with the pre-end equipment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think this is as bad as the pre-end equipment because basically there's two separate specs right now, and everybody on either side of those specs,  if you're on the UWB Forum Camp, your stuff's going to work together, and if you're on the Multiband OFDM Camp,  which is huge because it's got every major company in the industry and Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The promise of this ultimately though is that we have computers that have no wires coming out of them.  Correct.  The monitor is wireless, the keyboard's wireless, everything.  Wireless 1394.  It's just all wireless.  Wireless, yeah.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think, nobody dislikes the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is it going to fry our liver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know.  What's the frequency?  We're sitting in a room with how many computers right now.  There's at least three cell phones I can see.  I can see radio towers down the street.  I mean, I don't know if it's going to fry any more than Wi-Fi is going to fry.  We're all going to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rub yourself in peanut oil.  Everybody's going to die of cancer when they're 35 in the future anyway, so it's okay.  That's a really depressing thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Pablo in Walnut Creek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what, it's supposed to be like very low power, right?  And basically it makes the interference, interference is about the same as background noise, which is one of the cool features of it.  Yes, definitely.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's also true as the further you get out in distance, especially with the ultra wide band or the carrierless technologies like that, is that you lose speed with distance more rapidly than other forms, but the low power.  That's key though for protecting interference, protecting your biology and so forth.  And portable devices too.  Is it possible to send power wirelessly so that I don't have to plug in?  That's what Tesla wanted to do.  I like that idea.  It's unique to Tesla.  Well, yeah, but it's so in-house here.  You thinking of Einstein?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  D'ai, donde esta mi tequila?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you told them, right?  Exactly.  That helped get you right across the board.  Not saying that is why I'm not in prison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to stop playing these.  I think we got to go.  We didn't have time.  I have a whole bunch of questions queued up, but we'll just save them for the next two guests.  You're going to be doing this all by yourself, Patrick.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's why we have this sloppy mess as the last show so that you will look so good next week.  I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And for everyone who's listening, he really didn't mean to insult everyone involved in the Twitch.  No, I think this is a good Twitch.  I'm insulting myself because I'm not editing this one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got good banter this time.  The whole show was banter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  It didn't get to half of anything.  This was a content-free program.  No, actually, we had a lot of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had lots of visitors this week.  Well, that was what happened to me.  I got giddy because there was a girl in here.  That made me giddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cletus, I'm telling you.  Why is it when I put in my Billy Bob teeth, I start talking like this?  It's true, isn't it?  It's comfortable.  You can't help it.  There's something about it that makes you want to talk like this.  Well, that pushes your upper lip to your nose.  I wish he could see that.  There's a good look to it.  There's a good look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that what you were wearing in the cover of the 2003 Almanac?  Yeah.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In your American degrees, it's like 90 degrees, 100 degrees.  Wow.  Are we the last country doing Fahrenheit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the last country doing Fahrenheit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This country needs to switch over to the metric system.  Even the Brits aren't doing Fahrenheit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last I checked.  We're the last country doing Fahrenheit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of pathetic.  What the hell is that all about?  Weren't we supposed to go metric like 20 years ago?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I spent a lot of time learning the metric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were of that generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was in kindergarten, first grade, second grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, Andy has the other experience because he was started...  2.2 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You started Imperial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many kilograms and a pound?  Yeah, we started Imperial and then like grade six we were told to switch to metric.  So I'm multilingual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why I ask him what does that mean in real degrees?  He knows American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean Canada had the follow through to actually change everything.  Well, you know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was one of those things where they thought we were doing it.  We said, follow me or I'm right behind you.  And Canada charges over the hill and we go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we wait 18 months now before you get to the hill.  I'm right behind you Canada.  We're with you.  Metric.  That digital millennium copyright thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this time you were waiting behind us and we're smart.  Let them go over that hill.  Yeah.  Thank you Andy.  It's really great having you on and I will see you in a couple of weeks in Toronto.  I'll be up there.  Thank you Leo.  All right.
