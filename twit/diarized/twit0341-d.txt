Start time: 210.08
End time: 289.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  experts here I  Suppose we should start in that case. I don't know which to start with  We could talk talk about the the tech journalism sucks kerfuffle  Or it's a pure kerfuffle or we could talk about I think I want to talk about Google the Wall Street Journal  Apple and  Privacy it all started with an article actually started even before then with a blog post  That then the Wall Street Journal picked up  About a kind of a tricksy little technique that Google and other sites were using to get around  settings in the iPhone  The Wall Street Journal's headline  Google's iPhone  Tracking web giant others bypassed Apple browser settings  regarding  privacy and  As is now I know all things D is a is a Wall Street Journal effort no no no  We're related property Dow Jones related like cousins cousins distant cousins, but you used to write for the journal  I did for many years for journal has of by the way this this was discovered by a Stanford researcher named Jonathan Mayer  But the journal confirmed this the journal has of late been doing a lot of privacy stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  D Julia Angwin especially yeah

Start time: 292.84
End time: 315.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some have complained and I'd love to hear what you think about this care some have complained that the journal is  Being a little disingenuous than in fact. They're using many of these techniques themselves. They have ads they have cookies  they have lots of bugs on their page and so forth and  And so there may be perhaps  Not  They're not as clean as they might imply now. They're not using this technique

Start time: 316.49
End time: 367.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, I mean  I think that's that's sort of you have to separate the two things every publisher uses these things and on our site because Walt  Is so particular about it we give warnings after warning after you know we people have to click a thing and then we also allow  People we give them instructions on how to get rid of cookies which is unusual and I can tell you they didn't love it  When we did that at Dow Jones  But we thought Walt was very particular about informing people about their rights and what was happening to them  And so we have a big yellow thing that pops up. We just did it again just recently  Where we remind people of what this stuff is  So every publisher we have them but we tell the people how to get rid of them  We explain to them we put it in plain English the journal just like everybody else has them  And I think that you have to separate the two by saying, you know, they have them too  It's not exactly the same as as what was going on with Google and I don't think the journal particularly respects my privacy

Start time: 367.68
End time: 368.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you say that?

Start time: 370.32
End time: 405.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think they have normal practices of most publishers  I don't think they go as far as our site does in terms of disclosure ethical disclosures and cookie discl- we disclose everything  We're very promiscuous and we dispose everything  But you know, I think most publishers should be doing that so should be sort of following the way we're doing it  We'd like to have even more we just had some social changes  We put up a big blue thing that you couldn't go further unless you looked at it at least and then X'd it and opted  You know understood it kind of thing. So I mean it's separating two different stories  So that to attack the journal for that and not discuss the story is kind of gets away

Start time: 405.46
End time: 419.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I won't get I will discuss the story. Absolutely. But I do have  This sense that the journal  In many of these privacy stories are not particularly in this one  But in general has really been making a lot of hay about privacy when in fact not walking the walk

Start time: 423.19
End time: 463.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the practices they're discussing they are walking the walk the ones they're writing about they don't do like a couple  They do tracking cookies. They were bitching about tracking cookies. They do tracking cookies  It was a little more complicated that it was a lot of it was it was an explainer lots of newspapers do  Tracking cookies this was an explainer of the more aggressive manners of doing so so that that series was a little different than what you're describing  Yes, of course, they look like they look like miss Crabtree and then are doing the same thing themselves. Yes  There is some element of that, but they're not going as far  They were describing very aggressive means including this one from Google, which was highly aggressive. I think the headline was a little  A little much. I think a lot of people they in fact are not tracking iPhones for yes exactly

Start time: 464.28
End time: 470.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that would be in fact a lie  Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna go with lie because they are what they're doing is they're

Start time: 471.56
End time: 490.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From what I understood from the story is that Google's doing a workaround from Apple's practices  Apple has a very strict practices, which is not unlike other browsers  They're much more strict and you can discuss why they do that and the various reasons  But they're touting as a privacy element and Google did a workaround a technical workaround  Is Google responsible? I mean actually

Start time: 492.42
End time: 510.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Google responsible?  I mean Apple is in the government although sometimes you wonder is Google responsible for having to abide by  Safari's rules  I mean if they can do a technical workaround and they claim they're only doing it for people who are logged into Google and they're  Giving all these lofty explanations. Is that necessarily such a horrible thing?

Start time: 511.42
End time: 557.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's the government of Apple. Sure. If you want to use Apple products  I don't know. I feel like if Apple wants to do those things they should whether they be for  You know lofty reasons or competitive reasons, that's their rules  I mean sort of everyone when all the bloggers let me just say bloggers are on the side when  That interesting thing with palm. Do you remember everybody was doing workarounds?  Around mimicking iTunes and stuff like that. That's their world  And so I don't know if whether whatever reasons I think they should one disclose it and two work with apple on it  That's it's just their rules. It's sort of like you have a fence around your house. This is the way I want it  You don't just walk in. It's just it's an interesting question, of course  But I think that it's not they apple does not have to abide by other people's rules and they never do anyway  And this is their rules for safari. That's their rules for safari. Let me throw something out first of all

Start time: 557.74
End time: 739.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me explain what happens so people understand what we're talking about  Cookies, I think everybody who watches this show it knows what a cookie is  It's persistent client-side state information in order  It was created many moons ago by netscape because it makes sense  That the browser your computer should save some information  About your visit to that site for instance what page you left it on what your password was whenever a site kind of remembers you  Google plus or facebook it's doing that by setting a cookie a persistent  Piece of information is setting a preference on your computer cookies have been around since practically since the beginning of time  They they're part of how browsing  works  There are first party cookies that is cookies that are set by the site you're visiting  Uh, if you go to facebook you log into facebook and facebook remembers you that's a first party cookie  But there's another kind of cookie that uh apple and others call third party cookies actually apple doesn't call them third party cookies, but firefox  Uh does this is a cookie. Let's say I go to the wall street journal website and an ad from double click is on the site  Double click will also set a cookie and and and it is permitted in the way the browser's set up that any  Site you're visiting can set a cookie  Well that frame where the double click ad is is considered a site you're visiting by the browser  So that's a third party cookie. You didn't enter in double click.com. You entered in in fact wall street journal.com, but it is setting a cookie  So that's a first party cookie from the journal a third party cookie from double click  Some privacy advocates say that these third party cookies allow leakage of information and actually if you think about it  There is some leakage of information if for instance  Double click has ads on many many sites. They can aggregate information about your visit to all these sites  They can know every newspaper you visited for instance  If some of these sites know more about you than others and shared it with double click  They could aggregate even more information about you. That's third party cookies. Some see this as a privacy issue  Almost all browsers all the browsers I know of have a setting  That says block third party cookies. It's true on the macintosh. It's true on chrome. It's true on firefox  in ios  apple  For the and this is to my knowledge the only time has ever been done and this is on the ipad and the iphone apple by default  Blocks cookies from sites. You didn't visit from third party cookies. It's just turned on by default  They offer this in safari. It's actually I think it's a good thing to offer as a preference  But the default is to leave it on if you want to you can block cookies from third parties and advertisers  This is the setting here on safari on the macintosh. This is the setting that was the default setting on ios  When that is turned on on ios  Companies like google can't put plus one buttons on other sites including ads  Because that would involve setting a cookie a third party cookie. So it breaks that mechanism  Google found a way using I think was using an iframe and hidden cookies what it was is

Start time: 741.52
End time: 772.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're filling out a forum on a web page  Safari will let the third party cookie work. So they pretended to be a form you never even saw was there  And they were only doing it they said in order to let the the plus one button work  But by doing that they also let the advertising cookies work  Which they said they did by accident google stances that they did mean to do the work around  But they only intended it to do it for the plus one button for people who were logged in who presumably wanted it to be there  And by accident the advertising

End time: 776.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also worked the smart i'm sorry, but the smartest people in the world by accident

Start time: 777.12
End time: 841.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does and I have to say google's been using an excuse an awful lot. They downloaded street view data by accident  They've been apologizing for a lot of stuff lately. Yeah, however, john bittell makes a really now admittedly john  Bittell is an advertising guy. He owns federated media one of the biggest blog advertising agencies in in the world  He makes the point that in fact apple  in this policy  Is breaking the free web remember a lot of what we get we get for free google's free facebook's free  We get it for free because we allow them to advertise to us and we right and that's kind of the unspoken tit for tat on free  websites  He says apple is really not doing this to protect people's privacy  They're doing it to protect their own ad platform that they don't want third party ads to work because they want you to buy iads  They want to be the only people who know who's using ios  Now I admit john bittell has absolutely has an axe to grind in this  Because he's one of those ad people but I have to say it does make the story sound more complicated than than it is

Start time: 843.22
End time: 857.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I guess but so so what so what if they're doing that? I mean, I don't they're breaking the web  They don't want to participate. They've never been like but they're not telling their users that we're going to break the web  I mean, they're saying we want this is our rules and this is our rule. They're not saying

Start time: 858.00
End time: 871.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing it without telling I don't remember. I I you know, I have safari on my iphone  I don't remember every signing an agreement or acknowledging that these are the rules  This is the default browser on all of the ios devices defaults defaults are set on facebook defaults are set on

Start time: 872.08
End time: 877.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone's everyone so you didn't agree to any of any of the people but it's a piece of software. It's not it's not a service

Start time: 877.72
End time: 879.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no terms of service. I didn't sign a tos

Start time: 880.54
End time: 884.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I when I know of the thing and you can't change it. That's very that's absolutely right

Start time: 884.78
End time: 899.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a setting and change it and you can change it facebook gave me defaults when I signed in I didn't do a lot of  picking i'm just saying it's just like  These are all side arguments to the point which is is is it should how much of this stuff should be completely?

Start time: 899.70
End time: 924.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Selectable right at the beginning and every time but the other argument is is what harm is being done and  What choice do users have I am a big supporter of giving users the choice to opt out of of third-party cookies  but  I just think yeah, maybe google screwed up maybe google, but I don't think it was this nefarious  Uh, you know hidden plot to steal personal information from larry maggan and karis kushner

Start time: 924.50
End time: 927.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would agree with you on that. I don't know your larry they can just sort of tell

Start time: 928.22
End time: 934.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your browser has been but they're not tying it back to your identity. They don't get that 15 seconds of fame  They don't know who I am. Sorry larry. Okay

Start time: 935.40
End time: 966.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think the bigger point is all these people are making tons of money off of you  And you and you're not you don't have as much say as you can  That's I mean these people all of them. None of them are clean not john batale not apple not google  Right facebook by any means and so they're all making money off of these users  I would love frankly to be paid for all this, you know access to my cookies or whatever or what they have putting cookies  But it's just it's none of them are clean  But all this trickery between them is just exhausting to the I feel I feel though a little bit like people are acting like louis

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In cassablanca my god, there's gambling occurring  Um, we're on we're on the internet. We're using free services like google and facebook  They're showing us ads the way they monetize pit, you know, there's all this going on about oh my god  Pinterest is making money with links with that with affiliate links. Oh my god. Well, what did you think?  You don't get stuff something for nothing and you know, we show ads we're up front. We show you an ad  We don't collect information on you, but we show you an ad  um, uh, I just think that that's kind of yeah  Um, that's how this stuff works. It doesn't isn't doesn't everybody know that maybe i'm wrong

Start time: 1004.68
End time: 1035.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact in broadcasting which i'm also part of we interrupt the program to show you an ad  We're much worse so at least with with these sites you can get to continue to do what you're doing  Sometimes they interrupt as well, but I think it's really important  I mean, there are some people that have suggested that if you want to turn on turn off your third-party cookies  That's great. But now you have to pay for the content. So you have a choice. Do you allow them?  to  Monetize their sites by targeting ads directly to you or do you pay for the content?  And maybe that's a choice that we should all be able to make I think the big problem for google is not this

Start time: 1035.52
End time: 1068.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's that this is like about the 10th example in the last 10 years of google having to apologize  Remember their vans that are that were driving around taking pictures for street view. It turned out they were accidentally collecting  information from open wi-fi networks and they apologize for that and uh  Somebody at google was also stealing information from a kenyan competitor  Um, so there have been a lot of things they've had to apologize for and once upon a time google had this reputation of being above  Commercialism and that's kind of that was never true. Yeah, that was never

Start time: 1069.86
End time: 1095.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not for a minute was that true I was there when they got funded and they were always like this  They wanted to suck up every bit of information and use it. I'm that is such a myth of google  I mean they always they believe now this is the issue with facebook with mark zuckerberg and everybody else  They have a conception of privacy that is possibly different from other people's and they believe because they can do it and it's possible  And it will somehow benefit people it's the right thing and so that's just the issue but the reality

Start time: 1095.86
End time: 1109.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're untold power on these things if google wants to invade your privacy my gosh  They they read your mail anyway, if you're on gmail we have to you know  If you don't trust google you're in trouble. Yeah, they know more about me than my bank does. I mean, it's incredible

Start time: 1110.24
End time: 1181.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope not. I hope they're not reading mine. Well, they're scanning it but so but so is so is microsoft with hotmail  So is yahoo if you're doing anti if you have an anti-spam  Protection of any kind of your mail is being scanned at least for spam keywords gmail has these ads that pop up context  You I don't they don't bother me by the way. This is the wall street journal page  This is a little plug-in called ghostery that's running on firefox that shows you  What tracking programs are used on any given page? It's fun to fun to look at in this case  There are 11 tracking programs. Let me close that window. There are 11 tracking programs including audience science  Bezo blue chi chart b double click double click spotlight both of those are google companies  Facebook connect gravity insights microsoft atlas msn ads and targus info  All of these are just from going to the front page of the journal, which by the way charges money for access to the content  so  Um, I just feel like this is normal as you said cara. This is normal process  Um, I do think that apple is being a little  Well, they didn't say anything in this but I think it's a little  Disingenuous to imply that apple is somehow protecting our privacy when in fact they may well be protecting their own commercial interests

Start time: 1183.64
End time: 1201.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they did by the way in defense of the journal there are two issues that we need first of all  I believe julie and her co-author did disclose in the article that the journal does this and second of all  There's a long-standing tradition of separation between editorial and what the the the commercial people are doing  I mean we do that all the time and in broadcast media

Start time: 1201.90
End time: 1210.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what it does bring up also this other thing which is very much current now  Well, you could do anything you want as long as you disclose  Is that what we're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some things one need not disclose  No, but does it make it and this is the same thing in journalism is hey  I can I can own stock in anything I want as long as I tell you  Actually, there are some that anybody would do that  Uh, we'll get to I don't know if we even want to cover that. So what is what is the bottom line then on?  uh  On this did google do wrong cara?  Bye-bye  She not only disclosed she's not wearing any pants. She hung up on us. No, we'll get that fixed. That's a skype issue  We'll call it right back. Did you did google do wrong larry?

Start time: 1256.78

Start time: 1264.60
End time: 1269.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1276.14
End time: 1291.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's not the worst thing they've done  But again, it's kind of this critical mass of things they have to apologize for which is dangerous if google goes from  People thinking that they're kind of plain to not being sure to people assuming the worst about google that that's kind of one of the few  Things they really could

Start time: 1292.70
End time: 1301.61

Once again, it calls into question  It's it's it's things. I think it definitely hurt itself because it just it has a different conception  If you spend time with these people they have a very different conception of what could be done  Just because they can do it they do do it and they they think if they really do  I don't believe they're being they sit in a room and larry page has a layer somewhere like dr  evil, but uh, you know, there's an element to they they can do it and why not and you know, I even  Uh, I i'm married to a google executive and I was reading this piece  I said, I can't believe this again and you know, she went right into the technical well technically  And I literally it was a total disconnect on why it would bother someone to be tracked  And so it's just a conceptual leap for uh, these kind of geeks or technical people who think it's fine

I mean when they didn't have the right when  It's there is some there is responsibility on the part of these internet companies  Just the way car companies got ding for seatbelts and all kinds of things  These are they're selling a service they're selling or providing a service and they have certain  Responsibilities to keep them safe.

I mean or have certainly one of the reasons they've been you know, there's all these regulations in place  And you know are these companies doing what they're saying they're doing is their privacy policy what it says it is  And is it written clearly and I don't think we're there yet.

I like saying that harry mccracken  Our show is brought to you by ford motor company if you go to ford.com  Technology you can see all the amazing stuff ford is doing to improve  Your experience driving and and we've talked a lot about electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles  But you know  There are many people in the country who still drive and need to drive gas engines because it's the only way  You can get you know 300 miles from point a to point b  Uh, and one of the things ford has done that I think is fantastic is work very hard to improve modern engine technology to give you  power torque  And and and fuel efficiency and the eco boost engine is really the flagship in all of this  I drove the sho when I shopped for my mustang and I was just really impressed that a car like the  The torus sho could have such a pickup and that was it's a v6  But it performs like a v8 and that's all that eco boost engine there right now  They have two liter eco boost engines in the 2012 explorer and edge  And it's amazing to have a car like an explorer that gives you the gas economy of a small car with the performance of a big car  Or the new 2013 escape coming in the spring that'll offer the 1.6 liter as well as the two liter eco boost engines  Um read up here on on how eco boost works. It's actually kind of interesting if you're into a car technology dual injection  Uh producing a cooler denser charge or i'm sorry direct injection dual injection direct injection. It's actually on every cylinder  So that would be like four six or eight injection  Produces more power per a drop of fuel and then they use it's interesting  They're turbocharged but instead of one big turbocharger which takes a while to spool up. They got two smaller ones  What they do is they take energy from the gas exhaust which would otherwise be wasted to rotate these turbine wheels  That compresses the air  the incoming air again increasing  uh power and  You know performance and gas mileage  Very impressive stuff find out more if you go to ford.com  technology  Um, if you're interested in this stuff, it's actually quite fascinating what these engineers are doing  Uh epa estimated 28 highway miles per gallon in the 2.0 liter eco boost  28 in for a large utility vehicle.

Transcript:  You know, I don't know in the case of path  I had issues with the crunch fund as I was very well quoted calling it a silicon giant silicon valley pig pile greed pig pile  But you know, that's another issue. I don't know in this case. I have no idea  I didn't do the reporting so I can't say um, whether there was linkage  I think these guys like to pop off no matter what

Start time: 2578.30

Transcript:  The only thing is the only thing is they haven't been popping off of late. Maybe they've been sleeping or something like that  I have no idea. I have no idea why they picked this one over others and I have no idea why um  Mg ziegler went into a big diatribe about the state of journalism  Uh, I have no idea why he did it now and slammed his friend now

Transcript:  By the way, I know all these guys and I like them all and i'm friends with them all nick builton  We tried to get nick builton on the show. He wouldn't come but nick was the guy who wrote the new york times article  And mg slamming it just was like it was like I felt like we were in a mexican

Start time: 2618.76
End time: 2641.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would describe as surprised would be probably pretty accurate now admittedly and and I think that there is there's influence with dan lians as well  Uh, there's you know mg says well dan and i don't you know, we got a history tech crunch and dan have a history  But then you look at somebody like sarah lacy a tech crunch author who left tech crunch to found a fund  I'm, not sure what it is. She got investment from how many different

Start time: 2641.92
End time: 2664.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, she got it. That's a little different. She didn't form a fund  She has a website that whose funders a tech news website whose funders are  Uh are a lot of vcs a lot of well-known people see that to me seems problematic dan had some it can be  You know, I think i'm gonna take sarah at her word that she's not influenced by them and it's so far  I haven't seen  Uh a gigantic amount of like uh cheerleading for them

Start time: 2664.70
End time: 2670.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't you know, I think but is that how we judge this is like we would look at their writing and say  Oh, well, they seem objective

Start time: 2671.20
End time: 2717.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what to say about sarah. I mean everybody needs funders. I mean we I have  Because our funder, you know what I mean? Like so in that case, it's a little different than creating the crunch fund  Which is a vc fund funded by people  It's a diff, you know and also running a website. That was the issue there  That was the so that's very clear kind of thing. And in this case dan is thinks it's a problem  I I haven't seen it so far. Of course people can think it's a problem. It's definitely something to worry about  Um, but it's a question of whether she should have taken money from traditional media funders  I don't know. I just don't know in her case  But again, it pulls another issue into a different issue and then it confuses and that's their goal is to make the whole thing  Such a mess that we can't put you can't separate these things  Sarah lacy has very little to do with this this has to do with issues around the crunch fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean when I when technologizer was a standalone site I had ads from hp and samsung  Yeah, that's true without those ads the site wouldn't have existed  And I don't think but this is a step beyond that  That's always true  That's true  But I think you know ultimately the money is coming from somewhere and it's often coming from somebody who is involved in what in the industry  You're covering

Start time: 2741.86
End time: 2748.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but the question is if as long as you're covering it straight  I mean, you know, there's that old the proverbial chinese wall. I mean every publication

Start time: 2749.28
End time: 2760.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except for well the problem with blogs these days is there isn't a chinese wall because it's such a small operation  We have that problem here  I mean I I would love to have a chinese wall between advertising and editorial, but you're not a big company

Start time: 2761.18
End time: 2782.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but you know you just you just read a four dad. That's great  But you're not sitting here in the editorial portion of this show going on. I'm gonna do some tech company's ads, too  Right, but I mean the difference is there's everybody but everybody knows it's an ad we we understand the best  That's kind of my ad and and leo's personal opinion. That's kind of my point. Yeah, as long as it's clear  I don't have a big problem with that. Sometimes it gets fuzzy. I think ultimately panda daily will

Start time: 2793.12
End time: 2832.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But again, I think the issue is why bring that into this  I think dan made a mistake in bringing that in in that he was had an argument with them and I think it was a  Good argument that he was making  And then you just muck up the whole thing and it becomes a giant global fight over everything. It was pretty ugly  We could sort it out like there are issues of running a fund and running a tech news site at the same time  That's i'm sorry. That's my in my opinion. That's the that is a problem. I wrote about it very loudly  You know this in a lecture from mg ziegler on journalism is something i'd rather you know  You know, I want to like poke my eye out listening to him telling me about journalism, but that's different  You know what? I mean? Like that's different. He I don't feel he has the stance

Start time: 2833.42
End time: 2873.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a bigger problem. Maybe the term cliquor is a proper term  But it bothers me a little bit that that blogs and journalists are incentivized  Strictly in some cases to get as many hits as possible  I you know  I spent 18 years writing for the la times back in the print world and I had no idea  How many people were reading my pieces?  Obviously they they had some vague notion of how popular it was that they would have fired me probably a year or two into it  But the bottom line is that I was not pandering to how many eyeballs I could reach for each story I wrote now  There are blogs there are big. I mean i'll tell you forbes actually pays per click  So you have this incentive to get eyeballs and and that's that's scary

Start time: 2874.58
End time: 2899.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think this is I think this is accurate  But someone from two people from tech crunch told me this they're paid by how much time they get on tech meme  Which is fine. I guess we don't for example on our site. I won't give our staff the uh, the traffic numbers  They want to see them, but I do the same thing in some fashion  I just don't tell them and I know what it is  But I but we don't I don't change their coverage based on it  But it's really hard not to do that and you have to really discipline yourself not to okay

Start time: 2900.16
End time: 2912.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you not hate people based on on on traffic? Have you ever written a story that you think is very important?  Because for whatever reason and then you wrote another story that perhaps is less important  But actually got far more hits all the time. I mean it happens to me all the time

Start time: 2913.74
End time: 2948.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I I did a story just I did a story once that just said apple twitter apple twitter twitter funding  I did it as a joke. Yeah, and you know what I mean?  Lots of hits, you know what I mean?  You know, you know, I just talked to one of our writers who was like well  I didn't like a story because I thought it was by one single analyst  It wasn't kind of thing and they said well it did really well and I said I are you listening to what i'm telling you?  I don't want it. You know what I mean? So you have to really people are human and they want to be  Read and so you have to spend a lot of time saying, you know, that's great if something gets read  But at the same time the quality should be first that should be first on a quality side

Start time: 2948.84
End time: 2968.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very natural human thing now that we know you see when you're in mainstream media, you don't really know directly  I don't know how many people respond to any individual story on this show friends. I couldn't know that  But with the blog, you know exactly how many eyeballs each at every piece got and so that information having once having known that  It's hard. It's like it's pandora's box once you've opened the box you can't

Transcript:  I have to say when I worked at pc world in 1990s when the web was getting underway  Every single month for the print magazine. We did a reader survey  And the readers would say what they read magazines have done that for years  Yeah, we distributed that to all the editors. Yeah, and a small amount of their compensation was based on that  So we were essentially trying to do it before it goes way back. You could measure it  I should also say I think mg is is completely right that 90% of tech journalism is crap  But that you know, it's sturgens always been that way sturgens lies that 90% of everything is crap, right?  It was also true of print tech journalism back in the day probably  Right, uh, but ideally the stuff that's really good ultimately does rise to the top  And I think on the web some crap does rise to the top  But I think the good stuff also rises to the top and for the most part the stuff that does well on tech meme  Is stuff that that's worth reading

End time: 3389.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually a little disturbed by this trend  So I was really pleased when lion came out and I think it's true with mountain lion as well that you don't have to use the  The ipad interface if you don't want to but I actually I like you I carry around a macbook air  Which weighs not much more than the keyboard?  ipad combination that harry has  And among the many reasons why I carry this or or an ultrabook sometimes  Over an ipad is because multiple windows open  A much a vast library of productive software that I want access to a really good keyboard, etc  Etc and harry I respect you for for having figured out a way to to get your work done on the on the  The ipad but for the one thing I don't want to give up  Is the windowing interface and i'm using window with a small w here to be able to have multiple windows  I really like the the traditional menus that that that apple and and  Some window windows programs have in fact i'm disturbed that microsoft  Got rid of the menus on microsoft office. I actually like them. Maybe i'm old-fashioned and when windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting both microsoft and apple are effectively saying we're going to  We feel that the future of computing is is a tablet style computer

Start time: 3406.46
End time: 3443.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although they're taking different approaches because because microsoft is really betting everything on metro, which is very much like windows phone  And with with mountain lion most of the stuff that's new if you don't like it you can kind of ignore it  And you still get your you will be a little bit traditional apps on on windows 8  You don't have to run metro, but but the traditional apps are kind of off on the side and the  Traditional desktop is off on the side  Microsoft is trying to make a great leap forward  Apple is not really making a great leap forward so much as taking little bits and pieces of ios and bringing them in  And then i'm not sure what I think both approaches are valid and it'll be interesting to see which one's out  In the long run

Start time: 3444.16
End time: 3458.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I worry because I I like you larry like a desktop experience. I mean well it's laptop  But I like that experience the multi windows. I just like the flexibility of it  And I I do feel like apple would like to move everybody to its much more profitable ios

Start time: 3459.06
End time: 3495.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It appears that way and and I and again, I don't want them  I mean, I love my ipad and I love my iphone  But I also love my mac and I love my windows machine. I want those to not stay exactly the way they are  I'm not suggesting we shouldn't move forward, but don't break things don't don't take away  Sort of a cherished way to operate and and make it hard for for experienced users to continue to work with their products  I mean one of the things that always bug and in this window this this ribbon  On microsoft office still bothers me because what they did is they said we're going to make this easy for novices  And hard for experienced users actually harder for me to use microsoft office

Transcript:  I can bring it does it does seem like you know, they're doing this gatekeeper thing, which is interesting. This is their new security model  Which I like I think it's sensible  They're offering everybody who uses mountain lion basically three choices  You can lock mountain lion down and say i'm only going to buy from the mac app store  Those will all be vetted apps and and developers will use have there's a permission style system very much like ios or android  Where a developer has to say i'm going to do this this and this and can only do this in a sense  And the app store will let you know  This guy has access to your contact list or not and they can't access your contact list if they don't  Explicitly say this is one of the things I need to do. There's kind of a middle ground where you use  apps from other places, but they all have to be signed somehow approved by apple and then there's the  Whoa, you be careful  You can you know download apps from all sorts of scary places kind of like the way it is right now  Yeah  Um, and I do feel like apple does want to move everybody into the app store  There's a good security model argument for it  But I think it's also there's a very good revenue model argument and microsoft will be doing the same

And so it'll be double in both both aspect ratios  Um, well I could tell you I don't know but if we're if it's that high dpi it's going to be gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that app that apple was wanted wanted to see if they you know, lte would give you a decent battery life would perform properly and  They tell me that in fact, it's doing very well  So they think there probably will be an lte, but I think I think you're right. I think it's going right up to the wire

Start time: 4305.52
End time: 4337.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll see I mean the key thing also between the ipad and the competitors is that apple owns its  Practically its entire ecosystem. It owns the hardware it owns the operating system and it can do it right and there's not going to be  The fragmentation there's not going to be  Okay, google did a great job at some vendors screwed up the implementation or decided to change the user interface because they thought they could add value  Apple doesn't have that problem right and that's that's that was an advantage in the pc market  I remember bill gates talking about that years ago  That was an advantage they had and it's an advantage they have in the mobile market as well

Transcript:  Open versus closed right open versus closed now ultimately there's no question that google's going to have a bigger installed base  I think it probably already does  but but the fact that apple is going to be able to charge a premium for its products continue to charge a premium and  And and dominate the market. I mean it wasn't able to do that in the pc market  But it actually is doing that in this new market

This is microsoft  I think you said this is really taking kind of a gamble a little bit of a leap with this  Metro interface the tablets and the requirement for instance that if you're going to be on the tablet you sell in the microsoft store that you'd be a metro app and no  Even though we have desktop you can't have it right  They're being very aggressive about metro. You can't do desktop apps. There will be a desktop and you'll be able to use the file manager

Start time: 4696.10
End time: 4763.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is nice but on the arm  systems no desktop apps  And I wrote that story because I saw something on cult of mac which wondered about  This thing people have been wondering about for a while which is whether apple will ever make an arm based mac  given that apple is now designing its own arm chips and  People have been wondering maybe they'll they'll dump into the max  And the cult of mac story really made a compelling case that they won't do that because  Well arm does have some advantages right now for mobile devices in terms of really great battery life  You know intel is growing back and in theory within a few years  Until we'll have all the advantages as right now in terms of great performance  And it will it will get back in the race with um with battery efficiency  And so this cult of mac article argued that apple won't do arm max because it doesn't really need to  Because within a few years intel will give them everything they want  And so that made me wonder  If there's no essentially no need for an arm based mac  Does that mean there's also not going to be any need for an arm based mac?  Does that mean there's also not going to be any need for an arm based windows machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is for the most part now. I think ultimately microsoft can't say well in 2015 will be fine  We don't know apple is already in great shape because they have the ipad  Microsoft has no answer to the ipad yet and and it's it decided to make windows 8 the answer to the ipad  It can't say windows 8 will be a great competitor of the ipad in 2015, right?  It has to do they don't know how to do it now, right?  And so I think it's conceivable that it makes sense for apple for microsoft rather to do arm  But a few years from now intel will come back and and uh an arm will have turned out to be just sort of something that made sense  within a small window  to

I thought that that really was this was another  Was it in the times? I think it was um  I think this is a very interesting point to make that in fact your habits tell you you don't have to  reveal anything  Uh to people to for them to figure out what's going on target actually figured out  This is from the new york times that a teenage girl was pregnant before her parents did  Um, and I think anybody who is worried about privacy  You should really read this because the real world they're doing the same thing  It's not just the internet it talks about a statistician for target in 2002  His name was andrew pool who was approached by the marketing department  They asked him if we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant  Even if we didn't want her to know could you could you do that? He said yeah, I could do that  I got a master's degree in science  In science  It turns out that there's so much data smog left behind by your purchases at target by information they can glean about you that they can tell an awful lot now there's a reason why target wants to know this  Turns out target which sells everything from milk to stuffed animals to lawn furniture to electronics  Most people see it as like i'm going to go to target to buy this whatever it is clothes or whatever people buy lawn chairs  And they don't pick up a quart of milk  Except there's one time in your life where your whole thing changes and it's when you've got a baby because you're crazy  You haven't slept and if there's milk there you're gonna say i'm gonna get you're gonna make one trip for diapers and everything  So what they really want to do is to change these consumers the habits at this one window of opportunity when they can do it  And so it's very important to target to know when you're pregnant  Um, and if we can take says we knew  This is the status issue andrew pole if we can identify them in their second trimester  There's a good chance we could capture them for years  As soon as we get them buying diapers from us  They're going to start buying everything else too if you're rushing through a store looking for bottles and you pass orange juice  You're going to grab a carton. Oh, and there's that new dvd. I want soon  You'll be buying cereal and paper towels from us and you'll keep coming back  So they basically they apparently and target's not the only retailer that does this for years for decades  Target has assigned each shopper as you go in the store a unique code your guest id  And they keep track of everything if you use a credit card or a coupon if you fill out a survey if you mail in a refund  If you call the customer helpline if you open an email, we've sent you or visit our website  We record it and we link it to your guest id
