Start time: 676.32
End time: 713.80
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  not even do next one's due in september he made the first two that i saw but um i did a little  math on the ad numbers that they had for i think it was late 2022 and then the start of this year  compared to their historical revenue results and then kind of figured out their their debt payments  the company might be making enough money to do that but i think when you calculate it also in  like cloud expenses and personnel and so forth it's probably pretty far in the red still and i don't  think it's going to change because i don't think it's becoming a better place to be and not to open  up this particular uh kind of worms but uh twitter today was mostly elon and joe rogan bullying a

End time: 780.72
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  peter is wisely saying no yeah do you want to sit there for three hours with the guy who made people  eat bugs on television and try to talk about your life's work it's not the intellectual dark web  it's the intellectual web of dweeds like these people are pathetic and small-minded and what's  what's bad here isn't just that they apparently now just are the only personalities on twitter  that matter in terms of reach but also they're going to get people killed and i'm not in favor  of the disinformation that leads to that's my point it's fine if biology wants to bet a million

Speaker: Ashley Esqueda
Transcript:  says is gospel this is like a very even though you know he'll say like wow i didn't know that hey look  that up on google and it's like oh god like no um but yeah i mean i think i i just i think yeah  for me it can boil it down to what mark twain has said famously which is never argue with a fool  they'll simply bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience so it's just  you can't you can't argue with you know people who come you know prepared with bad faith arguments  and you know they sort of like they just there's no changing minds there and i like i think that  it's just like we just want you to come on and then and then crow to people that we owned you  like it's it's about winning it's not about actual debate shapiro method of debate which is just

Start time: 841.36
End time: 904.16
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  try to just talk over people and then claim that you won i like that mark twain quote though i'm  more familiar with the the porcine version which is don't wrestle with the pig because you'll both  get dirty and the pig will enjoy it yes which is a very similar kind of argument indeed i think  that was i think that was linda johnson actually said that oh thank you leo for the historical  reference but i want to go back to the the reddit elon point that got us here because i think that  when people are discussing in a business context the the desire to emulate elon what they mean  more than how elon has particularly run twitter's ad business per se is more that run a much smaller  company but that's much leaner and with much less i would say employee say and how things are are  done i don't think that elon musk is part of the the pro union caucus in other words and so if you  can work your employees more and get more out of them for a less kind of overall costly cost basis  well then why not and i think spez is trying to get his company public and i think he's struggling  with that let's go through the let's go through the history well desperate let's get let's go

Start time: 904.26
End time: 908.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  through the backstory so so we could talk about by the way there's a lot there's a lot happening

Start time: 908.30
End time: 912.88
Speaker: Ashley Esqueda
Transcript:  with reddit like that has led us to this point of like there's literal reddit blackouts in some of

Start time: 912.90
End time: 945.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the largest communities yeah yeah by the way not lbj gbs george bernard shaw neville wrestle with  pigs you both get dirty and the pig likes it oh that's that's see i was close but yeah even better  mark between mark twain george bernard shaw and linden baines johnson we got it covered  so it all started uh not so long ago uh twitter decided not twitter reddit decided they wanted to  go public uh i'm sure you covered this alex when it happened but what are their prospects for an ipo

Start time: 945.26
End time: 972.80
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  good what were their prospects privately okay i'm just pulling that up now i forgot so december 16  2021 so they filed probably that's a long time ago which they can do um but keep in mind what was  going on in late 2021 it was the apex it was the the peak of the last asset in venture capital boom  so they filed probably with great aspirations to go public right before everything changed and  kind of to hell frankly so i think they're probably dealing with some impatient bankers and

Start time: 973.10
End time: 1006.38
Speaker: Ashley Esqueda
Transcript:  backers they wanted to go i think you also argue that wasn't oh sorry leo um don't you also argue  that like this is sort of a very similar problem that a lot of tech companies had which was they  saw this like meta is a really good example of this where they saw a huge boom in users during  the time when everyone was staying home and locked down with nothing to do but be on the internet or  use their mediquist and and decided that that was going to be the new normal and that they  somehow convinced people oh yeah this is these are our new normal numbers there's always be this way

Start time: 1007.64
End time: 1051.72
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  i mean a great example of that was roblox yeah right i mean roblox was doing a simply insanely  amazing business at the time just in coinbase was very similar money was just raining down from the  sky incredible profits these companies looked uh you know bulletproof and you know generation making  sources of wealth but things changed and so reddit i think is dealing with yes it  changed in the valuations climate and also as you know everyone in the podcast world knows leo  a decline in overall ad spend and so it's a tougher market for them and i think where you're going  next is uh how they reacted to that well let me ask first have they ever had a profit it's hard  to say i don't i don't probably think so because they sold back in the day for not that much money  and then they got other forms of investment they were they were acquired by kandey nast

Start time: 1052.54
End time: 1081.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  kandey spun it off as a standalone although they still hold the majority of shares filed for the  private ipo a couple of years ago but didn't do anything about it and they were apparently  according to the information planning this ipo this is from a story on valentine's day so a few  months ago in the second half we are in the second half by the way or we we will soon be in the  second half um hard to be hard to be uh due to a good ip is it alex you're an expert can you do

Start time: 1081.50
End time: 1133.84
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  an ipo if you've never turned a profit so you can um it depends a little bit on how your business  is set up a lot of software companies for example will go public when they're growing pretty quickly  but still consuming cash and then people expect their growth rate to slow down over time and then  become more profitable a bit like sales wars or microsoft or whatever um the issue that reddit  has is that it's a social media company kind of and so its comps are not sales force or atlasian  they're meta or snap or pinterest and those companies tend to trade at lower multiples and  so i think there's probably less uh market willingness to allow them to go public if they're  unprofitable or more importantly if they're still consuming a lot of cash because you can be cash  a little positive and still unprofitable under gap terms and i know that's too deep but the point is  profits a little squishy um and so i don't think we know offhand how well reddit's doing on that  metric but because they haven't gone public yet leo i presume the answer is not so well well and

Start time: 1133.96
End time: 1346.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that's probably why they filed in 2021 but still never went public because they were waiting for  something something to get better market conditions the market itself or perhaps their own profitability  as far as i know they've never had a turn to profit so they have raised hundreds of millions  of dollars right um last round of funding was a 10 billion dollar valuation in 2021 that might  encourage you you know we're we're worth 10 billion seems so high uh it went i don't know  it was reportedly hoping for a 15 billion dollar valuation on the market uh they were on the  precipice according to the information of going public last year but then hit pause  meanwhile fidelity who has by the way valued twitter at 13 billion interesting number uh  fidelity valued reddit at 6.6 billion so there is some gap between what reddit thinks it's worth and  what everybody else might think it's worth in any event it was clear i think probably uh at the  highest levels of reddit we gotta figure out a way to make more money right if we're gonna and how  what a great idea leo initially their initial so here's what they i think did they look at the  balance sheet they say well we get we have this much revenue you know we have advertising it  wasn't a great advertising platform but they have advertising i pay for reddit there is a subscription  system for reddit and then they're looking at their bandwidth bills and they're saying well  you know what's interesting more than half of our bandwidth i'm guessing a number but i would guess  more than half our bandwidth isn't serving our webpage or our apps it's serving third party apps  that's costing us some large amount of money uh we should monetize that oh by the way no no third  party app has ads so we're not monetizing the third party apps at all and so steve hoffman who  started reddit with alexis o'hanian um and erin schwarz a couple months later um and it came back  as ceo after i read it had a very rocky up and down leadership problem ellen pow for instance  who uh left you know furious i'm sure with the boys club um so steve took it so i'm gonna no  it's my company i started it i know how to run it i'm gonna run it steve says well i know one way  we can make some more money is cut off these third party apps look elon just did it on twitter  uh in fact twitter has done it before third party apps suck bandwidth and and and don't show your  ads so twitter cut off the third party uh a long time ago uh they slowly came back uh elon cut it  off in a very ugly fashion uh late last year when he just turned off the api and put a lot of companies  in mortal danger so i think what happened is is hoffman said what we're not going to be evil like  like twitter we're gonna let them know unfortunately gave him one month and the api costs they proposed  i think correct me if i'm wrong were 24 cents per thousand hits per thousand calls yeah i think  that matches my calls yeah it was a lot of money that's a huge amount of money uh the number one  reddit app an app i use and love because by the way we should also mention reddit does have ios

Transcript:  it is not good yes but apollo rich written by a guy named christian celig is fantastic and there's  others reddit is fun uh riff on android i use joey on android for a long time there's narwhal  there are is a fairly rich ecosystem of third party apps christian celig uh on a phone call  talking to them they said 24 cents for a thousand calls he did some math he said that's going to  cost me 20 million dollars a year to which they said yeah and so better put some ads on there  better do something yeah uh chart well what they what spez is what spez is uh is steve hoffman's  handle on twitter what he said was well just charge your users for that you know five bucks  a user you're going to be great it's more complicated than that he's got grandfathered users  because of fees from apple for instance which takes 30 percent and the credit cards  it would not be five dollars it wouldn't be it would he would actually he said he was on  tech news weekly this week on thursday told mica and jason howell uh it would i would lose  10 cents a user if i charged five bucks a month so and he reasonably says i can't charge more  than five bucks a month so he says i'm out of business end of the month now i'm sure he's made  a good good living uh apollo was i think well funded he had a lot of users and i paid for it  a lot of people did um riff also said yeah we're gonna cut the cord in the month we can't pay this  number of third party apps said all right we're out of business  um but this bothered the users i think one of the problems one of the problems elon and huffman have  is they forget they think people go to twitter because of the software they think people go to  reddit because of the software people don't go to twitter and reddit because of your fabulous  software because of your servers because of your trust and safety they go there because of the  other people the content which is all made in fact which is made for free for free by those users  reddit's even actually more in-depth because reddit uses volunteer mods who really put in the time i  mean i might post once in a while but that's hard work the mods are upset because a lot of the tools  they use use the api and oh by the way they prefer the third party apps anyway uh so the mods are  upset so they said we're well we're we're gonna have a little uh boycott june 12th through 15th  and about half the i think was about half the mods half the subreddits the the channels on reddit  went dark right there's a lot it was a lot to which steve huffman goes on a very ill-advised  publicity tour gives interviews to the verge npr nbc and says the moderators are landed gentry  they're you know they're they're they are the problem we're going to make it possible for the  users to vote the mods out and we're going to force these communities to reopen and that really  pissed people off yeah the my favorite one is r slash picks which decided so iphone for instance  went dark forever they say move to move to discord we're gonna have a discord channel  r slash picks decided we're only going to post pictures it's a place where you'd post your  pictures we're only going to post pictures of john oliver from now on and it's all john oliver  all the time what a great protest by the way yeah you're using up the servers the bandwidth

Transcript:  no i think i think going back to leo's comment about how people don't go to twitter and reddit  for the software um is actually a bit of an understatement given that reddit and twitter  have famously crap server the two apps that still don't work somehow in 2023 in the era of  multi-public cloud environment they can get their interest rate so no i think people only come for  the community and people are going to leave and find other options slowly i mean i have to say

Transcript:  want to know what the zeitgeist is of the internet you can go there and you can quickly get a handle  on what people are talking about what people care about and so for me it's hugely that they're  both very very valuable furthermore reddit is valuable for a lot of people who instead of  searching google they will add site colon reddit.com on their google searches because  that's what i do they get much more useful information better better results better results  all the time who's gonna suffer uh from this um we should also point out and perhaps this is what got  the what got huffman and the board upset is that open ai was in all probability trained on  the entirety of reddit they know exactly how much open ai sucked from reddit  and it probably was a huge amount and they're looking at open ai's valuation  and then seeing fidelity cut their valuation by half might have pissed them off alex you don't

Transcript:  think it's gonna survive this well i i think i was actually gonna bring up the ai point so i'm glad  you did i really do think that we need to figure out some way to receive compensation for work that  is ingested into ai products that is then sold to other people like that just seems very reasonable  to me um the the reason why i i i don't worry as much about discoverability or the other issues  that are very clear when we talk about why twitter and reddit are still around is because i don't  think there's going to be a one-to-one replacement for them uh right away but i do think there's a  slow poison effect to this leo like whenever i'm on twitter now um i feel like i'm helping elon make  his interest payments and now when i'm on reddit i feel like i'm helping somebody who tried to union  bust unpaid mods and so it just takes away some of the spark and joy for me and that means i'm  probably going to use it less and less over time slow poison so i i think i think it's  our reddit's best days ahead of it i think it'd be hard for us to find someone who said yeah this is  the right direction to go in and i think it's going to take a couple years to play out but  i i wouldn't be surprised if we're past peak reddit now there's also uh yeah poison is a good word

Transcript:  will leave if they haven't already left yeah i mean well there's a lot of moderators who  or you know bots people who build bots that's another aspect of reddit that i think a lot of  people really appreciate like regardless of whether it's a super useful bot or a sillier bot  um you know there are people who put in that work even on reddit and so it's just it's a real  it's a real house of cards because once you start removing people who are conduits for the zeitgeist  then all of a sudden there is no zeitgeist you can't you you can't get that temperature check  and then that's when those people who get the temperature checks on reddit start using it even  less you know it's just it's it's a real cascading effect and and you know you have to appreciate  that your users are utilizing your service in order to connect with each other and also create  content that other people like and so to to kind of fly in the face of that and ignore it is really  it's like shocking to me as as someone who co-founded reddit like you said leo like  it's shocking to me that spez is so defiant in this um but i think this speaks to that like  overall problem and sorry my dog's barking at a squirrel outside if anyone can hear it  he's just going absolutely bananas right now the sun came out for a day and he's like i've had it  with any living creature in this yard um but i think it's really speaks to this kind of growth  at all costs forever that's just unsustainable it's just an unsustainable business model this  like oh we must have your over year growth every year in perpetuity like it's just not a thing  that's realistic and you know to to be able to sit there and call your moderators who work for  free you're calling them landed gentry i mean it's just absolutely so i mean it's just so dramatic  first of all like stop it like stop sit down yeah i want to say in the verge interview that's

Transcript:  bez dead he discussed how you know if google had had third-party apps when it went public  and people could kind of get google's results in their app but didn't charge for it and use  google's api to kind of suck their search results out would google have allowed that so why should  reddit initially i kind of sat back and was like oh okay that's an interesting argument but then i  realized that the the work that makes reddit great the company doesn't do whereas the search results  that made google special when it did go public were actually the company's work and so to me  there's just a misunderstanding of where the value comes from this company and i think that that's  leading to some poor choices and this may end up driving enough nourishing revenue to go public  and spez will get fedded for that and patted on the shoulder and given his block of money  and fine capitalism but you know as someone who's been on reddit now for 14 years according to my  profile i just pulled up and as a charter member of what was then called reddit gold  i'm disappointed that the site that i spent so much time on is apparently forgetting who it is  and who made it worth what it may be worth to the market sometime it's just it's just it's a bummer  but also you know red's been around for a long time maybe this it had to go the way of facebook  at some point right all ad-based properties eventually decay into the point in which they  commit suicide google search is a good example it's the uh as curry doctor called it the  enchatification of the internet it's what happens korey's been doing a lot of great writing lately  we should give him five points for that because he's been really just just been crushing it  blood shotgun to the to the zeitgeist i think he's been doing and i've really appreciated it  he's the right person for the right time the right time i mean like him casey newton like i'm really

Speaker: Ashley Esqueda
Transcript:  much less about users and it's more about investors right it's just shareholders and that's it like  that's really the only thing you know it's like there a lot of a lot of companies feel like right  now that you know and over time like last few years especially it just feels like there is such  a devaluation of the user experience in favor of like just whatever boost shareholder income  i mean even and this is not even like exclusive to tech this is like happening in hollywood as  well with the writer strike and everything that's going on there and um you know these really big  corporations buying up uh studios and stuff and deciding that you know oh well we're we're gonna  issue creatives uh in favor of our shareholders and it's like oh we're just going to take a big  tax write-off on you know space ghost was was fully pulled off of max this this last week  oh like space coast to coast fully pulled off max and it's like because they don't want to pay  royalties on it and they just want to take a big write-off on it and so it's like i assume that  they say okay well this is a show that like you know probably not a ton of people re-watch but  also it's enough that you know just the cost of them keeping it online is is enough that you know  and it's an older show so probably the residuals are a little bit better and so it's like to keep  that you know in place it's like it didn't make sense for shareholders but not for people who  are using this service so it that is a real bummer and it's just really prevalent right now it does

Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  feel like it's everywhere here's i think part of the reason why that's happening is because  we're pretty far after the last technology generation shift yeah that's right whenever  there's a new platform or a new major method of building stuff new stuff comes out it really  changes the game makes a lot of money and it hasn't been so finely optimized for net income  that there's a lot of consumer surplus left and then you know this far into the last cycle

Start time: 3077.58
End time: 3215.29
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  perfect life cycle image he says i call this enshitification and it is a seemingly inevitable  consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value  combined with the nature of a two-sided market where a platform sits between buyers and sellers  in the case of reddit the readers in the posters holding each hostage to the other raking off an  ever larger share of the value that passes between them happened at tiktok happened at twitter it's  happening at reddit he uses amazon amazon is a great example great example when a platform starts  it needs users so it makes itself valuable to users often selling below cost right think of amazon for  many years it operated at a loss using its access to the capital markets to subsidize everything you  bought they kept they kept going back to raise more money and when when vc said no more money  they started borrowing it sold goods below cost and shipped them below cost it operated a clean  and useful search if you search for a product amazon tried its damnedest to put it at the top  of the search results that was a hell of a good deal for amazon customers corey writes lots of  us piled in and lots of brick and mortar retailers withered and died making it hard to go elsewhere  but then that tempted in lots of business customers marketplace sellers who turned amazon  into the everything store it promised from the beginning as these sellers piled in amazon shifted  to subsidizing suppliers kindle and audible creators got generous packages marketplace sellers  reached huge audiences amazon took low commissions for them made it harder for shoppers to find  anything anywhere except amazon but but it also meant more sellers had to be on amazon  that's when amazon started to harvest the surplus from its business customers  and send it to amazon shareholders today marketplace sellers are handling or handing 45% of the sale  price to amazon in fees 45% the company's 31 billion dollar advertising program and put that  in scare quotes is really a payola scheme that pits sellers against each other  first directed to users then once they're locked in surpluses go to suppliers then once they're  locked in the surplus is handed to shareholders and the platform becomes a useless pile of poop

Transcript:  break when we come back more with our fabulous panel and we are gonna talk gaming we had a very  very good discussion before the show and i kind of want to ask you about diablo 4 we're all three  of us playing it and other games and i'm sure alex you have some sort of quirky world building game  that you can't stop playing and you got me you got me into what was it faithless frontiers endless  farthest frontiers frontiers frontiers actually it's very good i liked age of empires so it fits in  with what you know i like that style of gaming anyway we'll talk about that in a bit but first  speaking of streaming let's talk about express vpn it is not uncommon these days to spend over  a hundred dollars a month on streaming services just look at your bill i bet you you do netflix  disney plus and prime and you can save a little bit by using express vpn see it turns out netflix  has as an example many more shows than you've seen on the u.s netflix you don't see them because it  depends on what country you're in so what you see on netflix here for instance completely different  to netflix italy or netflix south korea netflix is all over the place japan england well this is  one of many reasons you should use express vpn it's easy to change your online location  express vpn has over 90 countries to choose from so if you've got some interesting tastes in tv  you just switch to another country you want to see south korea netflix believe me it's got some  great stuff there you are you like anime netflix japan it's heaven baby right now you can watch all  of down abbey on canadian netflix with express vpn you just tap one button change it to canada  refresh the page boom there you are you don't have to pay extra express vpn invests in the speed of  its servers hd video no problem you not only can put it on your iphone your android your mac your  pc your linux you can also put it on your on your router they sell some really good routers the  routers they sell are excellent quality or you could put it on an exit on some existing routers  protect the whole house and i guarantee you no one will complain they won't know  because express vpn doesn't slow you down they're also great for privacy because when you emerge on  the public internet you don't emerge as yourself you emerge with an express vpn ip address so  people don't they you just don't have to worry about being tracked you're not going to be  and of course for security express vpn is the best you can even get discounts on express vpn  if you buy netflix in argentina it's a less express vpn less than seven bucks a month  for the best vpn service out there yes your privacy is absolutely guaranteed express vpn  there was a great article uh i'm believing computer about how they run their servers it was quite  impressive they go the extra mile yes of course they don't do any logging they say that in their  privacy policy they're independently audited so we know that's true but listen to what they do  to make sure that nothing will be preserved from your visit they run a special custom debian  distro on all their servers that wipes the drive every time they reboot every day wipes the drive  nothing's left plus when you spin up your express vpn server it's it's a technology they wrote called  trusted server runs in ram sandboxed can't write to the hard drive the minute you close it it  disappears and so does every trace of your visit it's the little things like that that makes such  a difference to me it's why i use express vpn it's no-brainer if you want to get way more shows  save money go to express vpn.com slash twit and please use our special link so you get three extra  months free with a one-year package and something you saw it here express vpn.com slash twit  e x p r e s s vpn.com slash twit it's the only vpn i recommend and use express vpn.com slash twit  Google i don't know if this is trouble for google or not the eu is getting more and more aggressive  with american big tech companies now the eu says google's online advertising practices violate  anti-trust laws they filed new charges against google and remember the eu can charge huge  fines i think it's up to four percent of global revenues the case was brought by the european  commission it's the fourth time google's been charged with violating anti-trust it has in the  past cost them significant amounts of money they were accused of abusing a monopoly over their  online technology back in january britain's anti-trust by the u.s department of justice britain's  anti-trust authority has also been investigating the use of anti-trust laws and the new laws  their advertising practices most of google's revenue almost all of it surprisingly does not  come from google domains it comes from wow i'm shocked shocking what comes it comes from advertising  margaret vestiger the executive vice president of the european commission said  google is present at almost all levels of the so-called ad tech supply chain our preliminary  concern is that google may have used its market position to favor its own  intermediation services they both buy and sell they have both sides of the of the transaction  which is yeah i think that's probably kind of not okay but it's how they do business  alex what's the remedy is it is does will google have to sell off double

End time: 4389.68
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  so i pulled up the european union statement on this and i just found it to be really funny it's  about remedies so hear me out the commission preliminarily finds that in this case a behavioral  remedy is likely to be ineffective to prevent the risk that google continues such self-preferencing  conducts or engages in new ones so that limits what they can do it to some pretty harsh things  if they do find google to actually be infringing article 102 of the treaty on the

Transcript:  functioning of the european union typically when this kind of thing happens with the doj the ftc  the eu a company will say all right let's make a deal i will do this or that i'll sell off  instagram or i will give a discount they try to find a way out of it microsoft famously said  we'll make a deal with the playstation that for 10 years we won't do an exclusive on call of duty  that kind of thing those are the behavioral remedies they're saying they won't accept that

Start time: 4421.84
End time: 4467.36
Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  they're saying it probably won't work because google won't actually stop being bad well that's  probably true i gotta say um yeah i mean it's funny to see it so bluntly put in kind of like  diplomatic speak if you will um but i i reread their complaints and it seems a little bit cut  and dry it's kind of i i know google has a different opinion about this and a lot of people  that i i don't work there so i hope they're okay um but the eu is an enormous economic block and  can throw around its weight and google cannot afford to not operate there because that would  put an enormous chunk of the global gdp outside of its reach so i don't know where this is going to  go obviously google will fight this with an entire army of lawyers and lobbyists um so it's it's far  from like guaranteed but leo could we be working towards an environment which google gets forced

Start time: 4467.48
End time: 4505.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to break up i think that's is that what they're talking about so i mean i don't see another way  around it it takes a while so google has been fined billions of dollars by the eu all of which  currently being appealed uh so they haven't paid a penny yet including android um uh antitrust  remember the shopping service antitrust um they you know there's been a number of fines levied  all of which are held up by appeal um golly um it's it's it's shocking to me because it took this

Speaker: Alex Wilhelm
Transcript:  long almost to get here it isn't like these technology companies are doing stuff that's  brand new to their business model in fact the eu statement says you know since at least 2014 google  has been doing these things we don't agree with i'm like cool you know that is a decade ago yeah um  and you know part of the coinbase sec progress right now is because coinbase is is occupying a  greater um number of places in the kind of trading stack if you will and coinbase is like well we've  always done that and the sec is saying well that doesn't mean it was okay it just means we're now

Transcript:  pay taxes on things it doesn't mean that the it's not a seal of approval yeah yes yeah it's interesting  to see regulation catch up with certain business models that i've worked in the technology space  um that have been incredibly lucrative over a long period of time and then tech people are acting all  surprised with both hands in the cookie jar that they control both of uh in this case i think we  all kind of agree that google might be slightly more powerful in the online advertising world than

Transcript:  be fine uh on the antitrust thing though i i i do think there will come a time in the next half to  full decade in which we have to take a pretty hard look at some of these major tech companies  and say enough i was pretty opposed to the activision blizzard microsoft deal because  yes why because of course it's anti-competitive they're not spending that amount of money to not  generate some sort of edge right they're not buying it altruistically they're not buying it  for fun they're not buying just because are you saying it's a profit deal i'm trying to say leo  that a company that has lived as long as microsoft has and has created trillions of dollars in value  knows how to make money yeah and i don't think we should allow them to purchase major assets that  could give it increased market um leverage well it looks like it's down to you in the uk we'll see  we'll see it's down to me lena con in the uk actually the ftc is is moving ahead aren't they  yeah yeah that was the last news item in that particular saga yeah but google is enormously  powerful and getting larger microsoft is the same apple to a similar degree meta is kind of  taking care of itself if you will which is interesting well that's one of the arguments

Transcript:  in on itself esports is really hard i think i think a lot of people saw what was happening  in south korea and really got excited in in you know starcraft and uh you know legal legends and  a lot of that in south korea is just you know there's a very different there's a very different  culture around esports and you know for me like kind of non-exclusive to what's activision or  blizzard just esports in general i think one of the hardest things is is that you know we don't  really have um i've always wondered why we don't have home teams that have like arenas like that  we don't have a place for fans to go to it's always like oh they're gonna play like in la it's like oh  they'll play at you know microsoft theater or they'll they'll play here or whatever but it's  like there there should be like a location that is the team's stadium as it were it doesn't have  to be huge and that's the place where fans can come for signings and they can come for you know  press press events and they can sell merch there and they can meet the players and like learn about  them more and one of the things we have in other sports that we you know that are very niche in  esports i think to a degree is superstars that are known outside of the sport itself so it's like  a lot of people know a lot of uh football nfl players even though they never have watched a  football game like oh i've seen michael strangham on uh live with kelly and michael it's like they're  celebrities and the thing is is i think that there's a real difficulty in one a lot of these  kids are kids they're 18 and they are you know they're not great at talking on camera they're  not good at reading a teleprompter they're not good at being a spokesperson they're just used to  being at their desk and streaming and they're really good at it like they're really good at it  but that doesn't necessarily translate to a successful career as a as a as a celebrity  or a personality a bigger personality and i think really they there's a there's kind of a  a disconnect there between like you have to kind of create a superstar in some ways but also it's  that lightning in a bottle where you have to find the right person so i don't know that they've  really found that formula yet and um and also you have to really the most successful esports teams  have super dedicated fan bases locally if you look at like houston outlaws for overwatch like  they have a massively dedicated fan base they love them they love that team and they will like their  fans are crazy about the team they follow them it's it's all the same things you see in other  professional sports leagues but the thing is is like it doesn't happen with every team what is

Transcript:  yeah i think that's true in a lot of a lot of say cases when we're talking about physical  infrastructure like there was a canal building boom in in britain back in the day right um the  difference with esports though is it's pretty digital and so there's less of an asset there's  no infrastructure at all yeah yeah well i mean i mean unless you're talking about arenas doing  physical things but it's not quite the same same substance i think also it's just it's too  advertising driven a product right now even though they did manage to bring in blue chip  um sponsors like if you watch league of legends pro scene you'll see visa logos and other big names  and that's great and shout out to them um but it's not going to be growing as much as people  thought it might a couple years ago and so people are dealing with the the pain of over investment  but at the same time compared to what there was when i was 15 14 like the modern esports scene is  so incredible so sure it's not going to take over the nfl the nhl the next couple of years but  still so much going on that me someone who never thought this would happen because no one else cared  when i was a kiddo um modern people that are fans have so much more i'm just excited about that so  to me i'm measuring from the bottom up not from the top down on this think about dungeons and

Transcript:  a second take available to you i think right and so but but i think apple really just in and of  themselves like they are very they're a company that is very much all about control well they're  about control they they have a very controlled image brand uh you know the message like they're  very tight on their messaging like and and for all of the fun and jokes we make we can make about  things like you know the reality distortion field like that is uh you know that is a that's a real  thing that apple has done a very good job of curating like they're very good curators both of  both externally and also like internally with their message they they are laser focused on that  stuff and so it didn't surprise me that they moved to that and i think the pandemic gave them a very  good excuse to move to that um format but it also is um it's hard because you're you know you do get  a lot of takes but the thing is is you know if you don't know how to read teleprompter the right  way like it's still going to look like you're reading and there are executives that i can still  see like apple and at other companies that are very clearly like reading off a teleprompter  because they're not good at it and they're also i mean we've all seen we see like the oscars where  an actor this you know getting paid 20 million dollars a movie just cannot read a teleprompter
