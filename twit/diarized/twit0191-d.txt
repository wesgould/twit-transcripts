Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Queen's Day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I said.  Amsterdam has a queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Queen Beatrice?  I don't know.  I can never keep track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, something like that.  But they have this big party on the last day of April, which is called Queen's Day.  And I have to go to Amsterdam to visit with the software company anyway.  So why not go on Queen's Day?  So I said let's go on Queen's Day.  And all the Dutch said, yeah, yeah, that's when you should come.  Can I give you some chocolate to give Beatrix?  Because she loves chocolate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I'm going to meet her.  You're not.  It's her day.  Well, you know.  Does she have a date?  Well, you know.  Doesn't she like ride amongst the populace on a horse?  She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I thought she was supposed to.  We'll find out.  But all I know is that apparently it's like one 24 hours of just people drinking in the  streets.  And what's interesting is that everybody puts everything up that they have for sale out  on the street and everything.  Oh, what fun.  And everybody sells all their household stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's kind of like spring cleaning.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, spring day.  Also here from Vancouver, British Columbia, we're really thrilled to have her back.  Lisa Bettany, mostlylisa.com.  Hello, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, Lisa.  It's hot in the studio today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is really a little toasty.  And I apologize.  We've had some really hot days in the studio last summer and I have air conditioning, but,  you know, it gets stuffy.  So you can you can aim the fan at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have aimed the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it kind of looks you have the model.  She has the model look going.  The hair is blowing.  Did you plan that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe.  Smile for the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love the camera, baby.  Also here, we're really pleased for the first time.  Shira Lazar.  I'm so happy to be here.  Shira Lazar.com.  Shira, how would I describe what you do?  I describe it.  I'm a hybrid journalist crossover personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I you know, some people call me a social media maven.  I literally everyone.  You're an interesting customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about this a couple of tweets ago where people are going to J school all of  a sudden.  You study broadcasting and you got out of school and broadcasting is completely different  from everything it was.  Yeah.  Even a few years ago, I was in the U.S.  And I was in the U.S.  And I was in the U.S.  And I was in the U.S.  And I was in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Even a few years ago, when I was like, do I want to either work at local news stations  to pursue what I love?  And I'm like, no, I don't want to be in the middle of nowhere reporting about murders.  So what you have to do, you have to work your way up?  That was the old model.  But then I was in Los Angeles and it happened that a lot of websites at the time were starting  up and I was like, let me host your video content.  Let me translate your content into video.  And also sites that already had video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a new class of person.  And Justine is just is one.  Lisa is another of your web personalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I also have in the midst of continuing online, have been in traditional media and  hosted shows on TV with NBC and DirecTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you've done real stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've done.  Well, that's the thing.  I feel like, oh boy, did I say that?  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, ding ding ding ding ding.  I'm sorry, Leo.  You're going to bad bad Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As much as people say TV is dead and everything, there's still credibility when people say  on NBC.  And it's like, oh, but you're saying that's all online.  You think I'd know better than that.  But then you bring back the buzzwords of the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say the same thing about the newspapers and everybody will admit this.  Even though the newspapers are dying, you could have a blog with two million readers  on a daily basis and something gets printed in the newspaper and it has more impact.  It's genuine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  City government.  So what do you say to people?  It's like it's everyone's such like it's such hypocrisy in terms of saying that old  or traditional media is dead, but then there's credibility in it.  I think we all need to in the end work together.  Like for me, I say I'm in the audience business.  So well, the oh, well, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me let me get my head around that.  I'm in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's I spoke about that at food camp with someone and I go, I don't it's not about  like being against TV or being against online.  Like although online is my love and that's where I want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying I don't care where the audience what distribution means I create.  See I always said I'm in the car.  I say I'm in the content business.  You say you're in the audience business.  That's a very interesting distinction.  And you not think content is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think content is important.  But which comes first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you say audience comes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  But I think that in terms of engagement, it's about engaging people.  Right.  No, I'm actually used to make it work not only just online, like I'm not about excluding  the TV world and alienating them.  I'm about if I have an online web series, I'm going to find a way for to engage the  TV world as well.  Like maybe that's my marketing side side coming in.  So if I have a web show, I'll find a way to be a feature contributor on a TV network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually caution a lot of convergence young people say who say, oh, I'm in this so that  I can get into mainstream media to say, don't worry so much about mainstream media.  I probably said that to you, Lisa.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I think it's about finding your niche on the Internet.  And I mean, like I've I've tried for years to make it in mainstream as an actor, as a  model and just being beaten down from that and and going into like Internet stuff.  But I've always kept sort of some bit of myself in mainstream, like with my the work I'm doing  for the Vancouver province, like with a newspaper.  You still write for a newspaper.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I still do a radio show.  I mean, we're all still doing some mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As we're pioneers of, I say, new media and we understand it and want to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is that because this stuff is still hanging around or because we really genuinely need  to be part of it?  Because there's more money there.  Oh, the money part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's the fact I still get paid more for being on TV than being online.  But I think there's something about the conversation is different online.  It's so much more exciting.  That's what I think.  I love the interaction.  It's like online has always been there for me.  When when you're off air, you continue your presence online.  But that's on air, too.  You know, it's it's that you're continuing the life and your brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa, do you do the newspaper stuff for to make a living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's important.  No money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The province never have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's almost like they're folding and they're sort of hiring more people like myself to  come in and do these sort of little videos to pull people on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sometimes feel sorry for people your age and Shira's age because you're coming into  the tail end of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. But it's an exciting time, too.  I mean, there's opportunities like like with my photography.  It's sort of, you know, before maybe I put my pictures up in a gallery and I'd have,  you know, 100 people see it.  But I post it on Flickr and I get, you know, 20,000 people to see my work and get, you  know, and have this sort of online portfolio of my work.  And I think that's really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's something you and I have always talked about, John, that the dirty little secret  of mainstream media is the numbers are low.  I mean, 20,000 people watching you on Flickr is a lot even compared to mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the radio scene is definitely the case, especially local radio.  Yeah. In fact, this broadcast, if you want to call it that, of yours here, this thing,  Twit, as it were, probably has 10 times the audience you would have if you were just on  a local station, KGO or something, especially on a Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The numbers on this show are the same as my national radio show, which is in 61 markets  on XM and in Canada.  So that gives you some idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like, why are people I feel like this credibility and legitimacy there, but why  is there still kind of a bit of a stuff set just hanging out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuff's just hanging. It's the old.  It just takes a while to die.  It's it's it's people haven't gotten over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's because I think it's more than that.  I think it's because it's diluted.  Web Web media, Web media.  There's just too many schmucks that are just trying to do, you know, it.  And they were, you know, a lot of amateurs and it's just it's a smoke screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably hurt podcasting in the sense that most of the time when you listen to a  podcast, it's really bad.  Yeah. So the assumption is, well, podcast is, you know, going to be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not that many slick podcasts or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what has happened is the democratization of the media.  And I think we think that's a good thing, right?  Because it means anybody can have a voice and everybody gets a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. You said a really good thing that everybody has a voice.  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're creating.  Well, I think it's going to make the people it's going to weed out.  The people that are making money are the professionals and the people around them  are the ones that will be saying it's like the commenters on blogs.  But it happens that they video and we should get Andrew Keen on because he's the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who wrote the book The Cult of the Amateur.  And that's exactly what Keen says, although he's changed his tune.  Just I mean, I'm only partial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I have I'm a little flexible in this thinking.  And I was just thinking about.  And in fact, the comment thing that you just mentioned is interesting, because  if you look at today's media, it's actually dominated by the reader.  If it's done right, there are more for every column inch that you have written  on a blog or anyplace else, you should have something like 20x as much commenting.  I mean, in other words, you write this much and then the comments down to China  and then the comments become part of the text.  That's right. Because people look at the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's new media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's and so it's actually, you know, so there's been user created,  which is the true citizen journalism in that regard.  And it skewed everything, because in the olden days,  if you had a newspaper and you ran a letter to the editor, you know,  you first you'd have to fight to get your letter printed.  And then when it did get printed, there's only like six of them printed  out of the thousands they probably get.  Well, of course, you probably don't get that many because then nobody knows  they're going to ever get printed as opposed to new media, which has all  the comments generally, except for the few that you moderate out.  And it's and it skews the way people relate to the product.  But it also makes I think it also cheapens the product in some way,  because it's not as, you know, as as as focused and slick.  But I kind of prefer it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I feel like modern day journalism or hosts or personalities,  I look at it more as becoming a moderator of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're a moderator of the community, of the audience.  So that's why you say focus on the audience, not content,  because the audience is the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's interesting.  Yeah. A lot of times I say, yeah, I'm a host.  That sounds weird, but I'm like, because a lot of things you host community.  But I host a community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting I like that way of looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think of it as definitely kind of opposite.  Like it's about the content.  You produce good content and then screw everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the world continues, the conversation continues  because there's more than just your content.  Like if you just say, oh, sorry, this is all it is.  Then you're putting yourself in a box.  But then you see the conversation continues beyond.  Then I feel like it leaves it to infinite possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you care about the conversation afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do. But it's the way I feel about my blog now is  is I spend all this time creating this this content that I believe in,  that I'm passionate about.  And then I get some jerk saying, like, you suck.  You suck. All right. Well, you have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we all do. That's  not just one of them, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's it's the sheer mass of it.  More quality followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I just got a note from Adam Curry, apparently, listening to the show as we speak.  Oh, cool. His comment. Oh, brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. He's just jealous.  How many people listen to his show? That's all.  He's just jealous. Hey, you were.  I know you were.  And it's a good thing you do.  You were at a food camp, sure, Lazar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is what is food? What is what?  And how can we? It's friends of O'Reilly's.  I'm friends of O'Reilly.  Were you invited? I did not meet him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently not his friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not his friend, but you're like within the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, now you're trying to see you do this to me, John.  And then I get in trouble. John.  See, we've worked together a long time.  John tries to play on my petty resentful side.  He tries to bring out the petty resentfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I say that, but it's not true.  I'm just wanting I'm trying to get the facts out.  You know, why does a guy he's like right down the street from you,  he's in Sebastopol, as a matter of fact, he knows you exist.  I've had him on my him inviting like he's first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, in this case, it wasn't.  But OK, let's face it, he's never invited me to food camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's never invited me. Really?  No, we need to get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who we invited this time?  Julia Allison.  Oh, now I'm hurt.  But it was Dave Morin and Dave Morin from David Gordon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  David Gordon, who used to be at Six Apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so they it was their camp.  This is this is social.  This is social web food. How many people are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social 150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was 150 people and you weren't invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? Really?  The only thing the only time that I felt a little twinge  because I can't go anywhere. I'm doing this.  But the only time I felt a little twinge was when I saw a tweet from somebody  saying, we're all discussing the future of Internet television right now.  This is exciting. That.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember that was her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you should get some more followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maker. You're trying to get me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you just put up her the URL on the now anyway.  So no social web camp.  It started out more as developers and engineers.  And I think with social media, they brought us all together.  So it wasn't just the engineers and developers.  It was journalists and content creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, as there was interesting was the director of citizen participation  for the Obama White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. She did a whole thing on like what they're trying to do with social media.  And it's amazing. What are they trying to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's got reelected.  The thing is, you know, they've been running for reelection since they got elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They created a great community during the election.  A Greek great community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the pinot speaking. Don't blame her.  This is good. Pino. I'm liking this.  Yeah, it's a pinot. It's the heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my gold. So but it's about you don't have a cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about she doesn't have a pop screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't need a pop screen.  She's a trained professional.  Needed is at least the bettany's is you and me, the old man.  Like I'm like getting. Hey, I have to keep us from drooling.  Well, that's not a pop screen.  It's a drool.  It's a drool. It's a catcher.  Tell you about the government and what they're doing.  Please do. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, guys. So during the election, we know they created a community.  They established it, but it was all really all of us that maintain that.  But now it's like now that he's elected, like, what do they do?  And it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it? But seriously, I think we raised a good question, which is,  is it all just about getting reelected?  Is it really about democracy?  Is he really are they listening?  The fact or is it just about getting people to say, yeah, yeah, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  free help and then just keep begging for more money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I do.  What's wrong with that, John?  That's the basis of this business backing him.  So he's already got the U.S. government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a second to implement the things he wants to implement.  He needs all of us backing him.  So it's about Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should say that both Lisa and Shira are Canadian nationals.  So that gives them zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're objective. They're objective.  They have the from Canada. How can that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, so the government, the problem with the government,  what's going on online right now, they hire the guy that used to be a Facebook.  I don't know if you saw the Fast Company magazine,  the last issue, which is pretty awesome.  Yeah, he's like 25 years old or in his 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turn member's name and it's a scapegoat.  I should look it up online.  I'm going to ship a wine.  Steve, Steve Chen, Steve Chen.  You. So see, John is a disturb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, you're making me like, get heated up here.  So there you go. Now we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we're getting somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like 88 degrees in the studio.  It's not your very high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have all right. They have their main government site,  but then they have all these like all these other sites for other initiatives.  And I feel like they need to have it under one banner, like one home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then saying like, well, change.gov, is that the main site?  They have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they have like supposedly like a cultural exchange site.  And the problem is when you create all these different homes,  people think it's just random people creating them.  And they're just like really bad websites.  Right. Whereas they're like, oh, it's the government site.  And we realize they're trying to do outreach and you respect it a bit more.  But instead, they they create these like independent homes  where you just feel like they're random sites being created by random people  and you don't end up engaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The government's always had that problem, though, with this kind of fragmentation.  So she's saying this is my job is to pull it all together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she's not saying that she was like, help me.  And then I was like, why don't you have one big hub for it all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have a CTO now.  There there is an official CTO.  And I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the guy from Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The he was the Virginia's chief of technology.  Something Chopra.  Yeah. And did she talk about him at all?  I mean, that was just announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they need engineers. There's no money.  They need people to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're asking the community, they're asking the social web community.  Yeah, it's like, how do we get the word out to get people involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you go to recovery.gov, I guess is one of their key sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the problem, John.  It's recovery.gov, change.gov. It's everything.  Right. There's too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nobody goes to any of them, let's face it.  Well, you know, I mean, and then the other problem is, oh, look,  I got to a website. You get the gaming of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that on change.gov, they asked what should President Obama's first  agenda item be?  And and and of course, the Internet gamed it and it was legalized marijuana,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which maybe that's a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you don't think it's you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's I think legalizing marijuana should be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I agree. But is it the first thing he should do? Yeah.  Yeah. It's great.  How do we get the whole country?  Would that be funny?  Hey, thank you for liking me.  And by the way, the pot is legal.  You go smoke everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You thought it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now let's talk about the other stuff.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not Barack. It's Cheech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is the problem.  Is that your Barack voice?  That was my Cheech.  It's not bad.  I think I think social media is kind of run amok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clearly, the show, it's run amok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of like the naysayer today.  No, you know, she's like, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She brings us all the reality.  Focus in. She's a buzzkill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I yeah, I just think that,  I mean, just in my own stuff, like fragmenting everything  has just pulled me away from what's actually important.  And I think that can be said about anything when you're  when you don't have a strong core and everything sort of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have to say, using all the Twitter and all that friend feed and stuff,  I'm starting to feel a little bit scattered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You forget.  Do we all feel that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because I don't do half of this stuff.  I focus on I use Twitter.  I do my blog and I do these podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give it time. You will become more ADD over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not going to happen.  I've already I just can't.  I don't have enough hours in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. I do. I mean, I yeah.  Recently, Twitter is not making me as happy as it as it was.  OK, and I don't celebrities came in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about the big story. Ashton Kutcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the it's the Ashton is the elephant in the room.  We might as well admit it.  What do you how do you feel about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not going to talk about Twitter.  I promise that I would I would make a statement.  OK, well, look, it's the single biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Story of the week.  Yeah, we need to Oprah's on Twitter.  Wait a minute. I want to get him on this guy.  I get who on James.  Oh, James will call in.  Did you did you send him the idea?  I'm Tim. OK, he's on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know if he got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think links lower grades to Facebook to me is a bigger story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's talk about it.  Yeah, I got it right here.  It's from K K State Collegian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, fans out there, you can thank me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're just egging them on.  You know, you just want me to get more mail from people saying,  oh, this Twitter's got to stop. It was a big story.  You can't deny it was a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I deny it. So what? All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're going on topic again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but I just want to know what you think because you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. I think it stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So that's exactly I just want because I also felt like  it was a bit narcissistic.  Well, you actually you've actually I tried.  I tried. I've been on.  I've worked with Ashton and I think  he's done a lot of fun, great stuff and and brought the kind of the  mainstream community to tech.  Do it does to tech people want that?  I don't not really sure about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what kind of cracks me up is it does look a little bit  like the tech people are going.  It's the same feeling that when remember when AOL  added Internet access and all of a sudden all these people who had been  locked locked in this walled garden at AOL were suddenly on the Internet.  And it was the summer they call it the summer of AOL.  I can't remember what year was my 95 or 96.  And it was a big deal because all of these exclusive snobby elitists  who had it to themselves, we all have Twitter to ourselves.  And all of a sudden, oh, my God, Oprah's using Twitter.  It feels a little bit like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really, pretty much your attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I for one, welcome our mainstream media overlords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you feel like they should sell now because it's like that's the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no better strategy to to get us back on time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to get to the studies.  And we're going to get to that.  But I think this is I'm sorry, this is a real topic.  It is a real topic.  A real topic in a way, shape or form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the biggest story of the week.  Here's one reason Oprah got to watch.  She just opened up an account.  She got two hundred fifty six thousand instantly.  When Oprah shows up on television, she has tens of millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. That's a story.  Then it's a fraction of her.  Yeah, I like I like to just talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really shows how many people in the world are using Twitter,  meaning Twitter is not like a micro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what it is about Twitter that generates so much conversation.  That's what I like to know.  I think it's a functional, good thing that do use and  and for whatever for a lot of different reasons.  But exactly why it creates so much of this,  you know, this gazing at your own navel kind of it is a lot of that  conversation about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what blogs are?  Well, life cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How was the last time you talked about blogs the way you talk about Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I tell people I blog.  I think the art of blogging is that is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what kills blogging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter goes again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's better than me at this.  She's always like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's always like the devil's advocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's great. Actually, we have a girl in the corner.  I'm going to go kill myself.  Dvorak's dead.  Lisa Bettany is now the new Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I yeah, I feel a bit beaten down, I guess, lately.  And because my blog was my thing.  You loved your blog.  Like like I came to change the design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what changed her.  She took the cute girl pictures off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I didn't want to be the I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, you agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody else does.  I know I was the one who told her to do it.  I feel bad. Now, you know, ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get to tell people what happened because I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I like I have a master's degree in linguistics.  Like I don't come from this background at all, but I love tech and I love  I love new media.  And I just said, I'm just going to start a blog.  And I started a blog.  And, you know, all of a sudden I got recognition and I got to a position  where I could be on these shows and meet these people.  And it was inspiring and it was great.  And and my blog was sort of thriving.  And then sort of the negative stuff came.  The trolls came and oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much, you know, this is stuff.  I think it's we take ourselves too seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do want to talk about trolls, though, because I think trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we do one or two news stories in first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's two conflicting news stories.  You picked one, which was a Kansas State study that says that.  And by the way, even the people who did the study say,  we can't say that the use of Facebook leads to lower grades and less studying.  But we did find a relationship.  They surveyed Kansas State students.  Not a huge survey. 209 students.  I'm sorry. Ohio State.  Not Kansas State, including 102 undergraduates and 117 graduate students.  85 percent of undergrads, 52 percent of grad students had a Facebook account.  Survey said undergraduates using Facebook have GPAs,  an average of one half to one point lower than non-users.  Now, that's not causality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the educators or the teachers?  Are they having anything to do with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Time dedicated to studying was also reduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the grander, bigger picture of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you're a Facebook defender, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because you're Dave Moran's friend.  I just feel like she was a friend of O'Reilly.  So she has to say whatever they told her with Dave Moran this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in an RV with the Facebook crowd.  Now, I was also well, there's a joke there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, the fact is, I feel like you always it's like cell phones.  Everything causes cancer. Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is not correlation does not prove causality.  And so you're in denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just love life. I always look for the.  I like Facebook. I'm glass half full.  I like it. No, I'm kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just think that we have to look at the bigger picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But get ready for this. OK.  Study two teenagers who don't get their daily fix of daily  networking sites are prone to becoming stressed and short tempered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The study by Yahoo.  That's her. Showed that a third of 16 to 24 year olds who did not have access.  Now, just ask yourself, kids, kids who are listening right now,  if you did not have access to Facebook, Bebo, MySpace,  how would you feel? Would you suffer from more anxiety?  Would you have more emotional strain?  Seventy one percent of participants say they felt cut off from daily life.  Seventy percent said they felt unable to manage a balanced lifestyle  without Facebook. Wow.  What do you think? Sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think these people should go seek counseling.  Well, they have to go.  They have to go cold turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I would get I would get a little stressed if I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you can. I mean, there's there's so much else to do.  And I mean, I would feel that way if I was cut off from the Internet.  OK, because that's my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you're an adult like a you engage.  You're like not a first person or adapter.  What's it called? Early adopter, early adapter, adopter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, no, no, no. You know what the thing is?  These people, the Internet for them is Facebook, MySpace.  That's a thing. So you have a broader Internet experience.  So what you're saying is nice.  Poor, by the way, is very well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not. I'm just really hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, oh, man, I'm hot, too.  Let's just down these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So I just want to say, but I there is a certain sense.  Like yesterday, I lost my phone and I'm like, I'm a bit freaking out.  But the fact is, we should be able to live without the stuff.  We should be able to take time out over a weekend and be disconnected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did that feel, though?  You were actually very connected because you were at social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt like weird being.  And I also lost my N95 on Friday, which I do all my video blogging from.  I can't find it. And yeah, there's you lost your phone and your N95.  Why? I found my Blackberry, but the N95 I can't find.  But there is a sense of feeling a need to keep up.  And I think that's the stress right now.  That things will pass you by.  Things will pass you by.  And then you're non existent if you don't update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you see, I think we got to the root of it here.  I think that's exactly right.  But we define ourselves via the Internet, via our presence online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you feel like, I mean, you have the mix of of actual sort of  mainstream stuff where you're you're creating content and doing that kind of thing.  And I mean, there's something a little bit hollow about talking about yourself  as opposed to creating something original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have something to say about that.  I think the most the people that will survive through this in terms of not just  being like an ego blogger and all that, are the people that do the PR,  do the buzz and show a bit of their life.  But you always need to balance it out with content.  And I mean, I try to step back a lot.  I agree. I agree.  I don't know what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I've worked with in TV for a long time in media, real, real media  for a long time.  And one of the things that I always told the young people that are coming to me  and starting out their careers, and this was Kevin Rose, this was, I mean,  a lot of people, the people you've mentored,  the people I've mentored and one of the first things I said to them is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the first thing you notice, they never give you any stock.  I don't care. I don't want stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want the respect and love of the people who follow in my footsteps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  IRC dot tweet dot TV or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a tweet conversations room there, too.  But what I always tell them is and I think that this is the only way to survive  that shallow deep trench that is television is do not focus on chasing the audience.  Do not focus on your hair or your good looks.  Do not focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's no problem with me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look at me and Patrick.  Obviously, we weren't focusing on that.  What I said is you focus on serving your audience, given your every moment,  serving your audience.  So think about ratings.  Don't think about anything but serving the audience.  And all the rest follows from that.  If you give them content and it's you know, it saves you.  I learned this from acting.  I'm trying to remember the wonderful acting book that I read.  She said, Oh, any good actor comes not from ego, not from  comes from something deep belief, deeply held beliefs  that that they are trying to, you know, their core values they're trying to express.  And I think it's the same in any performing art and television, radio,  media and new media.  They're all performing arts that it has to come from core values  and the desire to serve the audience.  And if you do that, then you don't get eaten alive by all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I think it's really important to you.  I mean, and that's what happened to me is, you know, I received a bit of,  you know, attention and then I started pandering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I knew I knew that it's very hard not to.  And this is I especially tell us the young ladies like Morgan Webb,  who that's very tempting because they're all listen.  You're so pretty. You're so gorgeous.  And you start to say, yeah, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't so much in that.  But I knew what topics they wanted to talk about.  I knew how to guide them to chase the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Complete rebellion here over the previous life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she chased the audience and that's what everybody wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's the balance between chasing the audience and creating engagement.  So creating like it's like when you invite.  It can't be phony engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can't be. How do I how do I how do I tune myself so that they'll like me better?  It has to be. This is what I have to say.  This is what I have to give.  And I'm going to give it to you and I'm going to give it to you the best way I can.  And if you know, if you don't like it, OK, I may not be famous and successful,  but I'm going to speak with my honest voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the difference between you and me, Leo, because I respect the audience.  I have never I don't try to get confrontational.  I do what they want. I'm the nice.  That's why I'm such bulls**t.  I know what you want to do.  You want to give the audience exactly what they want.  You don't want to be contrary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also create the need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John is John is being sarcastic because he's the most contrarian columnist out there.  But John, I have to I do have to say something about I got her.  She was you fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You fool. She was jumping in on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do have to say that in a way, though, you're paying attention to the audience  because you're pushing their buttons.  You intentionally push their buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a manipulative, broad like communicator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, not at all.  Not in fact, not in the least.  I'm probably one of the most honest and sincere people that you'll ever meet.  I think that may be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I actually would give John that I will give you that  not in the way that you mean, but but I think I would give you that.  You're honest.  You don't give a fig, as it were, what people keeping it a family.  What people say about what you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think ultimately that will actually I'm going to interrupt you  because actually what he brought up is something that Lisa brought up.  And I'm going to wrap it around, which is the thing about getting over the fact,  especially with new media, that people are going to come on and call you a jerk  and an idiot and you have to get up and they're going to do that.  And after and the only way that you then you actually will feed them  if you try to, you know, take them on.  Although there's other ways of doing it, especially if you're the moderator,  you can just change what they say and make them look like idiots,  which is what we like to do.  And but, you know, it's unfair.  But generally speaking, you have to get used because of this.  The nature of the business being now it's all it's the audience is bigger than  the whatever the publication is.  And so there we give them power.  They've got way more power than they ever used to have.  And you got to get used to the fact you're going to get a lot of abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how do you deal with that, Lisa? I could tell it hurts you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it did.  And that's why I started pandering because I, you know, I was very sarcastic  and very and my first article in the province I took on press.  Helton and just said how he was giving bloggers a bad name  because he's just producing this kind of trash.  But people love it.  And I just received so much hate mail from it.  You backed off.  And then I said, OK, I'll just be nice.  And, you know, from my previous experiences coming on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that I've I've played that no more nice, Lisa, being engaged  and creating a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what this is all about.  All these tools we've created and have been given to us  are to create a conversation and worldwide communication and a global community.  And I think it's awesome.  Like it's like you're at a dinner table.  And when it suck, if we all thought the same way, people write

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the dinner that we won't get invited to me and Leo.  Not now. We weren't going to be anyway.  You might as well burn the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at it as I love meeting people.  I love having conversation.  And this is just through what I do.  I can have a global conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sure, have you ever had trolls?  Have you ever had negative comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever been on this? I'm reading the chat.  Do you know all the crap that Lisa got for a long time?  Why did you get? I don't get you.  See, I it's hard for me because I watch people like  why haven't like like possibly you.  And then there's Julie Allison and some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Julia gets a lot of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Julie is stalked by bloggers on Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for me, I look and I'm like, how do I not go there?  Or like, I don't know.  It's like, how do you navigate that?  I'm not sure because I thankfully haven't really gotten that.  And I don't know. I don't know why you haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will. You will now.  I have to do in this show.  Maybe they maybe they think you're a nice person.  And they don't think ultimately.  Lisa is a nice person.  Nobody thought you weren't a nice person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's always haters.  No, I listen. I have people like, why did you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you're so so Lisa, you you your way of dealing with this  was to say, oh, I'm not going to I'm not going to stir that  and walk hornets nest again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I backed off a little.  And then I saw David Copperfield and the magician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The magician and I just nailed him again.  And I beat up on David Copperfield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did that in a couple of things I've seen.  Yes. Now, is this the real Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the real Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I have my opinions and I'm I'm sarcastic  and I have a dry sense of humor and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Canadians are very nice.  Canadian. I don't know about.  I don't know about.  But they have more comedians from Canada than any place.  And singers and artists.  And I mean, Canada is a but but ultimately on my little miracle  to our north on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sort of had this where I wanted to teach people photography  and wanted to talk about photography.  But then I also wanted to write these snarky posts  and they just don't. Yeah.  There were two leases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two. Really? I do every thing.  No, wait a second. I don't.  Attend that. I don't believe in that because I think your brand is you.  And I think that that means some days you might be informative  and talk about things that are relevant in what you're doing professionally.  And some days that might mean like you just want to talk about life.  And I feel like the ultimate like, oh, if you look at  brands like Oprah, I mean, she does a bit of both.  And I think those are the ultimate brands.  She has plenty of outlets.  She doesn't stick to one outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got a magazine, a TV show.  I mean, you know, she's got several TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She produces other people's reality show blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you think versus like niche versus just creating  a brand of perspective?  You have to do the branding voice, which means it's not necessarily.  I mean, doesn't mean you're talking about cats one day and technology the next.  I don't think you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But sometimes that's what blog that Twitter Twitter's allowed you to go there.  And that's what's created the engagement.  Exactly what Twitter does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here we go. Twitter alert, Twitter alert, Twitter alert.  Oh, come on, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm telling you, everybody wants me to do this.  And that's why I'm here.  Oh, we're not.  I'll bet you I won't even be on the show next week because of my attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not pandering, are we?  I'm going to get everybody wants me to do this conversation.  Lisa, please.  So your reaction after you pandered for a little while, you you changed yourself.  What changed your mind about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, that just how it felt.  I it wasn't you.  It wasn't me. And and I couldn't like when I guess the big thing was when I started  to come on these live shows and I couldn't maintain that persona.  Can you perfect because I wanted to be perfect.  Now, you know, just this and live is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Live TV is wonderful for that, because ultimately you are in radio.  I learned this in radio after 30 years.  If you can't you can't lie forever.  You have to ultimately become yourself.  And that's what people all people want is your authentic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That reminds me of Miles Davis story.  So before I just bring that up, though, how come I can't get on this thing?  Are you having trouble again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not twit TV. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it gives me it says choose a nickname, password, choose a nickname,  just connect and it says closing link registration timeout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you just do it faster.  There's too many people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're probably my webmaster said that my site's down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have in 30 minutes no personality now and you have no brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have nothing.  Nothing. I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what it is, John?  There's probably so many people in chat you can't get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody leave now immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. There were some other big stories.  In fact, a huge story.  Pirate Bay, the the court trial concluded  with one year present sentences handed down by a Swedish judge,  a fine of two point four million pounds.  That's three point six million dollars.  The defendants, Pirate Bay, co-founders, Frederick Neal,  Gottfried Svartholm, Morgue and Peter Sunde, Coleman Sopi,  so far said, quote,  that the judgment was weird and bizarre.  And they insist that they cannot pay and will not pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't pay because they have no money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got no money in a press conference held after the Stockholm  Colts Stockholm Court found the four defendants guilty.  Peter Sunde, Coleman Sopi, held up a handwritten IOU  to the camera and said that is as close as they are going to get from me.  Even if I had any money, I would rather.  I don't know what accent that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty good, though. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying not to do the part with it.  I'm trying not to do the the the typical Swedish chef thing.  OK, even if I had any money, I would rather.  Now it's worse.  I would rather burn everything I own.  I'm going to do. I'll do the little Ingrid Bergman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even if I had any money, I would rather burn everything I own  and not even give them the ashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could have the job of picking them up.  That's how much I hate the media industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what accent that is. That's Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is Ingmar Bergman.  That is the Swedish.  And that's not all.  And that was German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're completely convinced that they're going to get off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put on the front. Well, they didn't get off.  It's done. They're going to jail.  Once you convince that there's judgment proof,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  being judgment proof is what they can't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you going to get out? Yeah.  And they said, in fact, on the front page of the Pirate Bay,  we're not going anywhere. We are the Internet's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And they just move their operation offshore.  And they already had. They did it a while ago.  Their judgment proof that you can't get any money out of them.  They're just a bunch of kids. What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, once you have a focus on something or it's like,  that's what you've decided, you can't back down.  It's like you're going there. Go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this something you learned at Foo Camp?  No, I'm just saying in general, it's like you're just throwing it in our face.  You Foo Camper. You Foo Camper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's like if you created something and that was your mission and it's like,  and that's what the site does.  If you back down, your users aren't going to respect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you just. He said, this is really weird.  He compared it to the plot of the karate kid and said, he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course he did. He said, oh, yeah, we need some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. White wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. In the middle of the pirate story.  I don't care. Isn't it funny that the pirates,  the whole pirate actual news story happened during this?  The real pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting coincidence. I never thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the Somali pirates were kind of angry at the pirate bay.  They said, they're not pirates.  We are the pirates.  Why are they calling themselves pirates?  They are not pirates. They're from Barbados.  I don't care. I don't know what it sounds like when you're from Somali.  So I'm going to do I'm going to talk.  Barbados. Yeah.  No, they said they literally they said the Somali pirates said the pirate bay.  That's not pirates. We're pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, good.  They can hang like pirates from the yard arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That one says every time someone says Twitter, we have to take a drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or have a there is a Twitter drinking.  Oh, and then let's get back to the topic.  Topic at hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as part of as part of the pirate base story, they were saying that now  this is going to push  the sort of torrenting behavior onto Google  so that people can now type in Google, you know, X, Y, Z torrent.  And then find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the real the real point after all is that you can't stop this stuff.  It's going to be happening.  You cannot stop this stuff.  However, these guys can go to jail and will know.  You think they know they're standing there in Sweden.  What's this? I mean, aren't they going to go to jail?  I'm in jail. The Swedes aren't into that.  The Swedish court convicted them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. They have a fine and a year in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the sentence.  Aren't you paying attention to the year in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, they can't use their laptops or computers.  I don't know.  They might as well just take away the Internet from them. That's jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Susan Boyle. Who loves Susan Boyle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's inspirational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She is. That whole thing is an out and out scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a fake, too. What do you tell me this?  I didn't tell my wife this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because shows like that, they know audition.  There's no surprise.  And yeah, it was ridiculous.  And some of those reactions from Simon Cowell were like, like, you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they cut from one to the other.  The other and there's two boneheads in the back.  Now, the other thing. It's an edited show.  That's true. They probably I know everybody.  You're right. 1999 recording of this woman just surfaced.  Oh, it did. Yeah.  I Twitter did. So I said it. I'm sorry.  Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real Dvorak. Would that be correct?  You have to have a drink.  Twitter dot com slash the real Dvorak. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can link to it.  You can hear she sings.  I can't remember the name of the song, but she's it's absolutely better  than her voice is now.  I mean, it's so she has a career singer.  Where's this recording artist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She looks like she could have been in a music like she's in the music.  I think they put the extra makeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they beatled her eyebrows. Definitely.  They dumped her down. They dumped.  And dumped her dumped dumped made her dumpy dumpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dumped her down and had her goof around.  So she looked like like some sort of weird frump.  And there was also a recording of by her local newspaper, an interview with her.  And here her hair is nothing like that. It's not like a clown.  So they really dressed. They really went for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe she's.  And that's part of art is like dressing up in this story that I link to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's already got a record album done.  She's going on Oprah and she's going to sell a million copies.  And Simon Cowell gets a piece of the action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to Twitter it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole thing is this is Cry Me River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to do karaoke, Twit karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should so do all Twit karaoke.  I guess it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's great. Tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is her. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a charity CD she recorded in 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, she's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know why I kind of believe this, because I watched her  and not only did she sing technically well,  she had emotion.  She was like a Broadway star. She was Sarah Brightman.  She was completely trained.  There was no way this came out of nowhere.  Yeah, I know. Is that terrible for us to do?  We're just we're dashing people's hopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we're not. Who's hopes?  She's going to make a lot of money.  She sings well.  She's got some.  Oh, we obviously know her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't know her before.  So we have some level of success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. He's talking about Jennifer.  I'm talking about my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You're dashing the hopes of the of the public  that has been suckered into believing this garbage.  Well, all you have to do is Google.  Hello. It's not that hard anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, I mean, this wasn't that easy to find.  Even know what you're talking about.  Oh, you didn't see Susan Boyle. Oh, my God.  Twenty five million views on YouTube in one week.  Cable. No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. You know, the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Internet's are plugged up.  She's actually turning against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, she's not. It's beyond me.  She's actually getting it.  She's becoming a bitter ex blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have the Internet and I don't want the Internet.  No, it was a big.  It was a big.  You know, you were sick last week, so that you have an excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. It's true. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have anything when you're sick, don't you go on the Internet more?  You just had a cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but I can't my friends, I can.  I want to get a bucket of this stuff.  This stuff works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too bad the show's not brought to you by Zycam,  because I would have been a great commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.  Just get just get six people on your show.  I think you have a cold. Come on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it is because with Zycam, you won't catch the cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously, we could just like OK, so after the wine tasting,  we'll have a cold tasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a whole bunch of jokes in that one.  I don't want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she lives in Scotland.  She says, I've never been kissed.  She lived with her mother and and it was Britain's Got Talent.  And Simon Cowell is a hostess, very much like American Idol.  Twenty five million views on YouTube.  It's in one week.  I mean, I've never seen anything like this.  Everybody was passing this URL around.  So she comes out. She's very frumpy.  She's got big, thick beetle brows.  She's just kind of, you know, I mean, and everybody's going,  oh, this is going to be bad.  She says, I want to be Elaine Page.  And then she sings a song from Les Mis.  That was a squawkier voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to be Elaine Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I'm well enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my goal in life.  I could do it like Mrs.  Doubtfire. Oh, dear.  I want to be Elaine Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God. You've seen that movie way too many times.  I love that movie. It's a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, what was I saying?  So she comes out and she sings a song for all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's like, wow, it's Sarah Brightman.  I mean, it was incredible.  And now, OK, you're the TV person.  Your opinion was when they had those pictures of the judges

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like shocked. I knew I already saw it.  Totally funny.  I mean, Simon Cowell being like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  his eyebrows go up at the right moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like, do it right now.  And those shows are live to tape.  That's how it works. How it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They ISO every camera. They record everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're shooting every judge.  They probably have, what, 10 cameras.  And the two clowns backstage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually like that. We should have that on American Idol.  We should have it on our show here.  Yeah. Can you believe what the world is saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How awesome is either you're live,  which American Idol is at certain points,  you're live or us. Yeah, I don't know if this shows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but this was the audition. So it wasn't live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's live to tape, which means that you record it.  You say you count it down.  It's pretty much live to tape, but then you have an edit.  So you're doing it nonstop.  You're trying not to stop so it's easier.  And you could easily tell judges to redo something.  Let me ask. And they also know  what the reaction that the director wants.  And they audition for this.  The fact is the judges and the producers  have seen her perform probably at least three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not those judges.  Do you think those judges had seen her perform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they hear the buzz of who's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Certainly the producers knew what was coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Curry's wife is doing one of these reality shows  in Holland.  Is she in it or is she producing it?  No, she's a singer. She's pretty famous.  And he's back there all the time.  She's like, this show is hugely popular.  It's as big as any of them.  And he says that the whole thing is completely rigged.  Oh, they're all rigged.  But that Kyle is the one who probably set the whole thing up.  And now that this record's coming out,  Kyle, of course, if you do any of these shows,  and as soon as you sign on the dotted line,  they get your first born.  They own you.  So they get a piece of the action.  So this is just a huge money making scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's buzz.  It's the fact is, you know, when you go against the grain  and you put someone that you totally don't expect  has talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I got it.  My wife and I, actually, I found the link.  I played it.  I went, wow.  I said, Jennifer, quick, gotta see this.  I did the same thing.  And our tears are going down our face.  When I first saw it, I was very impressed.  I was blown away.  I'm not kidding.  I'm admitting this.  Both of us are going, oh my God, that's so beautiful.  But afterwards I thought, this was a little too bad.  It was a little too perfect.  I would never say this to Jennifer.  She would not be happy.  She wants to believe this.  And that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think it's a disappointment.  By the way, the Curry thing is Holland's got talent  and somebody just sent me a note saying  they want me to say that American Idol's a fraud.  So I don't know what I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, we're gonna get Waz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate these shows, by the way, so I can jump on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna get Waz on,  because he was in Dancing with the Stars.  They signed on disclosures.  Well, an interesting thing happened.  We loved Waz.  He was a terrible dancer, but he survived the first cut  and he got to the second round.  But he was terrible.  He got to the third round too, didn't he?  Yeah, I think he got to the third round.  He missed, but anyway, one of the judges at one point said,  this is like a Teletubby dancing.  This is not dancing.  Yeah, I was insulted.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But-  It was scripted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that was, now this was an interesting thing  that happened.  Waz said, this whole thing is scripted.  They're not telling us what the votes are.  I know that they saved us for the dance-off,  even though I know I have enough votes from the audience  to not be at risk, but they wanted me in the dance-off  in the first round.  He said that and literally two hours later,  completely recanted, because of course,  the lawyer comes knocking saying,  you remember this thing you signed, Waz?  How much are you worth?  How much would you like to be worth after we go to court?  I've got to get Waz on.  He probably still can't say anything.  He won't say much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, this started with the Survivor Showing,  because there was a lawsuit  and I talked to the lawyer that was handling it.  One of the people in the first Survivor  got deathly ill and some weird thing happened to her  and they had to sue the show  to get the money that they were guaranteed.  I remember that, yeah.  And the guy telling me, he was telling me,  he says the whole thing,  they got all these people on nondisclosures.  They won't let you know what's going on.  Burnett himself backs off of a lot of this  and he says, look, it's not a reality TV show.  It's an unscripted drama.  Yeah.  Ooh, that's great.  That's what he calls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not reality.  It's unscripted drama.  Essentially saying, we're making it up.  This is not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of the producers I know that work on these shows  that edit them, they call them Frankenbites, because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're looking for that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look for that moment, but besides that,  they can edit specific words.  You say it into a sentence and put it over B-roll.  Right.  If you look at all these-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's easier just to have you do it.  They would have two people, okay, you and Leah  are gonna be sitting at the table together.  Now do something, do something to piss her off  and I want you to throw a glass of wine in his face.  Okay, roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't even need to say that.  It could be from an hour ago, I was laughing.  They snip it together.  And five hours later, I was just sitting looking like this  and they can make it like our conversation went awry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, with the Gordon Ramsay shows  that had the Hell's Kitchen and some of these things,  or when he goes in and he fixes the place up  and whatever show that is, Kitchen Nightmares,  they would show, some of my stepson, Eric,  who's the coder, he's one of those guys  who sees the microphones and finds stuff out of sequence  and why are they wearing the button on this side  instead of this side?  And it was pointed out that at the end,  he was doing the wrap of the show,  but they had the old restaurant before they refurbished it.  So he was doing the end at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was doing the end at the beginning.  We do that all the time, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This show was taped four months ago.  And that's why your wife,  that's why your, yeah, it's just, it's just.  It's actually winter, we're pretending it's not.  It's 95 degrees.  We're only pretending we're dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're only pretending we're dying.  There's a heater in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But a lot of people get into it and they,  it's like soap operas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, you guys, just take a break a little bit here.  Have a glass of wine or something,  because I want to talk about audible.com,  then we'll get back to the non-news.  The Twitter stories, more Twitter, all the time.  No, I think we're done with the Twitter.  Audible.com slash twit.  Have you ever tried audio books?  And I want you, actually, I want to give you a new URL  for the folks who want to do two books.  It's audible.com slash twit two.  I'll tell you about that in a second.  Audio books.  To me, I care.  I'm trying to think when I got into them.  I think it was when I first started my,  and this was about 13 years ago, my long commute  from here to the San Francisco studios,  first with MSNBC and then Tech TV.  It was an hour each way on a good day,  and it could be as long as two hours each way.  And I'll tell you what, I would have gone crazy  if I hadn't had audio books.  But I just transformed the trip.  It made my commute not only tolerable,  but something I looked forward to.  It was library time.  I've read hundreds of books,  and I started off first with a little cassettes, you know,  and I've moved, in 2001, I moved to Audible,  and I have never looked back.  Audible.com slash twit two.  Audible.com slash twit the number two.  This is the plan I've been on since 2000.  It's called the platinum plan.  You get two books a month.  This is for the person who has a long commute  or does a lot of time in the gym.  It's funny, I don't commute anymore,  but I spend an hour a day in the gym.  So I still get that library time.  And it, you know, it can be boring on the treadmill  or the bicycle, but if you've got that book to listen to,  it goes by so fast.  Sometimes I'll look up and I go, wow, I'm done.  And I'll say, well, let me do another lab  because I'm in the middle of the book.  I just started a book that was recommended for me.  I'm trying to remember if it was Paul Therotte  or Andy Anato recommended this,  one of our other show hosts that I am loving.  It's a very, very long book.  Peter Mathiassen, it's called Shadow Country.  It's the history of Florida at the turn of the century.  And the dialect that the guy uses,  Shadow Country, Peter Mathiassen, yeah, there it is.  The dialect, the guy who's reading this,  it's a bravura performance.  It is amazing.  It's a new, they call it a new rendering  of the Watson legend.  It reimagines the legend of the inspired Everglades  sugar planter and notorious outlaw E.J. Watson.  I'd never heard of him.  Maybe if you're from Florida you have.  But what a cast of wild characters.  Let me just play a little bit of, oh, I can't.  I don't have the, do me a favor, do this.  Go to audible.com, you can do this yourself.  Go to audible.com slash twit two,  sign up for the Platinum account.  And then this could be your first book.  I think this might be two credits  because it's a very, it's 40 hours.  It's a little long.  But see, I like long books, 40 hours.  That, you know, that was two weeks in the car.  This will take me a month to get through on the treadmill.  But oh man, is this stuff great.  I am just digging it.  Peter Mathiason, it's one of those books that,  you know, you just, it's a time and a place it evokes.  If you go there, you can listen to it yourself.  They have previews, little samples of it.  And this could be yours free.  It's normally $48, it's free.  Shadow Country.  This is one of those books you're gonna get engrossed in.  And the reader, Anthony Heald, is absolutely brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant, I just love it.  So give it a try.  Here's the deal, audible.com  slash twit two, you get the platinum account, two books.  You get the, let's come to that, two credits a month.  You also get free subscription to the Wall Street Journal  or the New York Times Daily.  You get a, I didn't know this.  I haven't been mentioning this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is interesting, the Miramax story,  I think this is interesting how,  and this is how traditional,  an example of how traditional media is dealing,  I guess, with all this new media.  They offer two free passes to prevent piracy via Twitter.  What is that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that story's kind of interesting.  So a girl, oh, it's a Twitter story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's okay.  I'm sorry.  This one, you have to have a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Drink, drink.  You're gonna give me a pass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna give me a pass on this one, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  But this one I think's acceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an interesting story, and actually it shows how  a company can use Twitter, I think, very effectively  if they know what they're doing.  So the story starts with Twitter,  it starts with a young lady pirating, saying,  where can I find a BitTorrent of Adventureland?  I'm just dying to see it, where can I download it?  And is it Miramax Films?  I can't remember, I think it's Miramax Films.  It says Miramax here.  Twitter's her back, saying, oh, don't pirate it.  Think about the people who made the movie, don't pirate it.  They don't threaten anything, they just say,  oh, please don't.  And she says, all right, because it's you  and you asked nicely, I won't pirate it.  And they then send her two passes to a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that the new way of doing it?  I think it's very interesting.  I've been seeing that more and more on Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  where if you tweet some kind of product name,  then they will add you right away, and maybe even contact you.  Really, let me just check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this make sense, though, for a company to do this?  I mean, is this crazy?  You know, these companies.  These companies are giving all that weight to Twitter  that you denied existed.  I mean, they're acting like this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I never said that, I never denied it existed.  When was this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I thought you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm the one who said that Britney Spears  was gonna come in and take over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you did say that, and you were close.  Britney almost got to a million.  Yeah.  But no, what we were saying, oh, come on,  it's just a fraction of the total world.  It's not the real world.  Why are we giving it so much weight?  But yet these companies say, hey,  a bad stuff happens about us on Twitter.  That's something we have to deal with.  They must, is that the right attitude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's seen as the tip of an iceberg.  That's why they get so carried away  when just a few people bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it's cool because it's making people,  companies and people accessible.  And it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But accessible to who?  Twitter, the few million people on Twitter?  That's a fraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that is a fraction though.  We are saying like, Twitter's such a huge thing.  But yeah, if you look at the amount of people  involved in it, it's nothing compared  to the rest of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think real people should start to say,  well, gosh, how do we get good customer service?  You mean I have to go on Twitter to get good customer service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a problem with the companies.  We should have to ask for good customer service.  The fact is we should be supporting companies  like a Zappos that is creating that culture  around their company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's something you learned at food camp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know Tony and I respect the company.  Just asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zappos is an amazing story.  They became a billion dollar shoe company  in a commodity business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a good response when I went to Comcast Cares  and I used Twitter to do it.  Frank does a great job.  Frank's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frank, you rock.  And people are saying, oh, Zappos, I'm paid.  I'm not being paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zappos is a very good example of how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think that's the next wave of entrepreneurship  and companies and brands is in terms of creating culture  around it and the fact is you need to communicate  and not just through Twitter.  Twitter is just one tool.  And if people realize it's beyond that,  then they'll see something bigger.  It's not.  Here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is manageable.  Now, see, now we're off the track again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But go ahead, I'm sorry.  Twitter is manageable because it's a few million people.  If you have tens of millions of customers,  you cannot offer that level of customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they need to realize they can do that without Twitter.  It's an easy.  No, they can't.  But meaning Twitter was one tool.  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.  Twitter is one tool,  but the fact is they're realizing they can connect.  Wait, do you see what I'm saying?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, what I'm saying is that Twitter is one tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's having a pure allergic reaction to the word Twitter.  He's not listening to your word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to listen to you,  but your sentence structure has fallen apart  as of about 15 minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, what I'm saying is that  people are finally realizing that we can all connect  and we can all help each other.  Whose people?  Or brands and companies, like a Miramax.  Some people.  And so they're looking at Twitter  because it's like, oh, a trendy buzz thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gorg says in the chat room,  and I think this is exactly what he's saying  in the friend feed.  Yeah, these companies, if you Twitter, they'll contact you,  but try to call their telephone support lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying.  They need to realize that there's something  about connecting and it's beyond Twitter.  It happens that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's why they do it that way.  It's cheap to hire three people to monitor Twitter.  It's a lot more to have telephone support lines at work.  This, in a way, is underscoring the BS of Twitter,  the Ashton Kutcher BS of Twitter,  which is that it's somehow significant  and that we're providing real customer support  because we get pressed for our work on Twitter.  It's not real customer support.  They can't do real customer support.  Try calling Comcast and saying, my cable's down.  They don't help you.  You have to go on Twitter to do it.  Well, it's easy to manage Twitter  because that's a few million people, right?  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think one of the most important things  is how much, so Ashton Kutcher,  he has a million over a million,  but how many of these people are actual?  Engaging.  Yeah, everyone joined and they're not.  It's all phony baloney engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so wait.  Oh, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Ashton.  No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ashton Kutcher has his Facebook headquarter show,  Facebook HQ, and it has 10,000 views,  but he has a million followers, so you can have followers,  but it was a question I asked this week.  What's more important, quality or quantity of followers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, clearly it's quality, but let me read you.  Oh, well, how?  I disagree.  You don't think so?  No.  That's an interesting question.  I mean, when you're in mainstream media,  it's the raw numbers.  Like Seinfeld has 18 million people.  Nobody asks a question about how many people  are drunk asleep, fornicating.  They just say there's 18 million people.  But when we're talking about new media like this,  they very much, our advertisers very much care  about who's watching.  There is, and that's why we can compete  with larger media outlets,  because we offer a higher quality, a smaller number,  but a higher quality of audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying, now, what you've done here  with that commentary is change the subject.  And I find it very amusing the way you did it,  because all of a sudden you change from Twitter  to talking about, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to help you, John.  You're the one that doesn't want to talk about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just gonna say that the Twitter audience  is the numbers probably more important  than the quality of the people, if you have like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's true, and that's what's wrong with it  is all we're saying.  Perception is reality.  You'd rather have a million Ashton Kutcher followers?  Yeah.  You would.  You think that's more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm in the mailing list business.  That's right.  You've always said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, so would you rather be giving out CDs like AOL  or actually engaging people with a progressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He would, and you know what?  He probably is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're like that as like I throw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so you're the idealist.  You go to Foo Camp.  The next thing you know, you're like Lenin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like in the end,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like an AOL that sends out their CDs  and we throw them out, or something that's a bit more.  John or Vladimir.  I couldn't remember his first name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vladimir.  It took me a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, I'm sorry we're interrupting you.  I think your throat is parched.  Have a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't say that word yet.  I know these Montreal women, they're all like drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They like to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well I just.  You're the bitter one.  If you have a million followers,  but they're not engaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're not even on Twitter,  they're just kind of there once and they disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you tell them, okay, check out my blog post,  check out my photo, and they're not engaging,  and you only get a thousand people going to that.  What good is it?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  But if you have a massive amount of people,  like even my followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who brought down Shira Lazar's website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who brought down.  My guy said that it's going back up.  Who brought it down?  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ashton Kutcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  No, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oprah Winfrey?  No.  Who brought down Shira Lazar's website?  You, Leo.  Not because of the number,  because I don't have a million followers,  but because those 2,000 people.  Are actually listening to you.  Are actually paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So get this, okay, this is going to make John spew.  Take a drink of wine while I tell you this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cheers.  I'll tell you what, bottoms up, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bottoms up.  Jeez, John, you're bad.  Come on.  So Ashton Kutcher's on Ustream.  He's streaming, it's about 10 at night, 11 at night.  He's streaming as he's trying to get to one million people.  2.13 a.m. Eastern time.  CNN has a 998,239 followers at CNN break.  Ashton Kutcher crosses one million.  He tweets to his followers, victory is ours.  Now John, this is the part you're going to like, John.  Quote, Ashton Kutcher, your friend, Shira Lazar.  This is like putting a man on the moon.  Oh, please.  This is like changing media forever.  Yeah, right.  It's the web versus the world right now, people.  Can you believe this crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like how he takes credit for being the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't blame him.  CEO of Google, Mr. Eric Schmidt,  predicts good times ahead for Android.  He says he's expecting Android on netbooks,  other mobile internet devices.  He says we're not even pushing them to do it.  They're doing it themselves.  Asus is doing it.  Netbooks rumored to be an EPC using Android.  Android could become the first real challenger  to Windows XP on these netbooks.  Do any of you use a G1 phone?  No.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, what do you think of it?  I love it.  No, you don't.  What about the battery life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sucks. Terrible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes the thing unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I heard that.  You know what's cool?  You can watch us on the G1.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The G1 is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can watch on the iPhone, but you can watch on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use, I'm sorry, I'm old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what you got here.  She's at BlackBerry.  It looks like a curve.  Is that a bold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a world edition.  Now I've got her phone.  Oh God, no.  See if she follows any celebrities.  Give that away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What celebrities does she follow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's got somebody named Casey Klingon.  I guess he's a guy who's an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are my new Twitter friends, okay?  I should not get the alerts.  You met him at Foo Camp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, you met him at Foo Camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should take off.  For some reason since, all right, this is weird.  I don't know if this is a correlation.  All right, I'm not going back to Twitter.  But since all the Twitter stuff happened on Friday,  I've started like literally, I get alerts every minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you should turn that off.  Turn that off.  Alerts for whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the first step.  Let's go back to Android.  Wait, wait, wait.  So in terms of phones, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I'm excited about?  And you're gonna think I'm nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Change the subject.  You didn't let her finish her sentence.  Go ahead, please finish your sentence.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was saying I wanna go back to that  because we could go into other conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, never mind.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's go back to the Android  because I think that's what people wanna talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm excited, believe it or not, about the new Sidekick.  Looks really good.  The 2009 Sidekick.  And it has.  The Sidekick.  Yeah, I know, isn't that weird?  That is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, I had an ex-boyfriend  that was totally into the Sidekick.  Back in the day.  And he would be like, it's like that flip thing.  Yeah.  That flip thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was for young people.  He was probably pretty young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is so cool about the Sidekick now?  How old was he?  He was like in his early 20s at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old were you?  In my early 20s at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but what is the big thing about the Sidekick?  Why do people like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the new Sidekick has built in.  I never liked it.  It's always been a big brick.  It's kind of a clunky thing.  The new one's thinner, better looking,  has built in MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter support.  It's really focused on social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think phones, the next version.  Look at you, Lisa.  Do you think the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa's going like, ooh.  What happened to the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The iPhone has that.  I'm still an iPhone fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't text properly  or write emails properly with the iPhone.  That's the problem.  You like the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's challenging though.  Challenging, well not when I'm driving in my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna give you a few reasons  why you might wanna look at this.  3.2 megapixel camera.  Does video.  Uploads it directly to YouTube.  This might be a replacement if you're N95.  It also has built in GPS.  It does pretty much it.  My East 71 does all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I just got this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just got an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I waited for a very long time.  You mean you just got an iPhone?  Well, when Canada got them.  Oh yeah, you got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you know what?  Canada actually has some issues  because the cell phone, the cost of your plans  is different.  They're just really not advanced  with their cell phone coverage.  Oh, it's terrible.  And technology, which is really ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa, you must be paying through the nose  on the data on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's bad, especially when I'm down here.  I need to figure out.  I have the Verizon plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used to have a North American plan.  So I go to Canada and I don't need to pay for anything.  Just minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rumor has it, how do you like this?  iPhone app for Hulu.  Would that put you over the top?  Yes, yes, yes.  Would that put you over the top?  That would make you want an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that about, I came here and I.  You can't get Hulu in Canada.  Or Pandora.  What do you mean?  That's ridiculous. You can't through a proxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to lie, yeah.  And it's too slow.  Often the proxy is really making it unusable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I love that.  Whenever I come down, I'm like, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like MTV back in the day when I was growing up,  I couldn't get any American channels.  So Nickelodeon and MTV, like the two networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you have, you had much music  and now you have MTV Canada, which is god awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But phones are obviously emulating almost cable TV  that back in the day we couldn't get,  like Canadian viewers couldn't get that.  And so, but that's, it's so archaic to me  how with the technology, we can't find a way  to bring that on phones to Canada,  which is basically it's all geography.  It's just like borders that are separating us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's.  She has 23 apps.  Everyone has hundreds.  She hasn't had time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have 10 pages.  She's got the flashlight though.  You have a flashlight app?  The flashlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use that all the time.  Really?  I do for photos.  Really?  And for, you can do really cool long exposures with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your favorite iPhone app right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you have one that you use all compulsively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click is a Flickr application.  And you can view, I love looking at sort of  the explore photos and I love looking at my contacts photos.  Right now, I guess just what I've been looking at  on the internet is just photography stuff.  That's what I did after the pandering.  You said I'm gonna settle down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna focus on my photography.  I'm gonna focus on my photography.  And you know what you decided, it's kind of funny  because you decided to take pictures of models  instead of be the model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That gave you power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I took the power back.  Gave you power.  Yeah, now she's power mad.  She's power mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I think the photographer has the power  in that relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is getting weird.  This is getting too weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This show, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, I'll just get back to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I feel like, what is it I'm supposed to do?  Glad I didn't call in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on, hold on.  Before we go on, I wanna mention, go to meeting.  Go to meeting, yes, our fine sponsors, it's Citrix.  Did you know the average cost of a business trip these days  is $1,000?  That's plane fare, hotel, meals, cabs.  It really adds up.  And I have to ask you this question.  Do you think it's more effective?  Do you think you get more done?  I think that's the old way of meeting.  I think the new way of meeting is eliminate the waste,  have all the meetings you want for $49 a month.  $1,000, $49.  And the thing is, they're just as effective  because you're using go to meeting.  Everybody with go to meeting,  in fact, you can go there right now  and try it for a month free.

So you can be on the phone on your voice conference,  say, hey, I'd like to show you this PowerPoint.  I'd like to show you the drawings of the website.  And you give them the meeting ID.  You say go to meeting.com.  Go to gotomeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  They enter it.  Suddenly they're seeing your computer screen  on their desktop.  So they're seeing the stuff that you would show them  if you were in person, the PowerPoint.  It's an award-winning service.  It's completely secure.  It is so effective for sales presentations,  for product demos, for training sessions, collaboration.  We've been using it.  You know, I think I have several accounts now  because we try it.

Go to meeting.com slash twit.  Okay, let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big story that people wanna talk about  and I see this coming up in the chat  because I'm in the chat is the Time Warner story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did that.  What is she on?  Is that a PR 38 or what's the number?  No, that's PR 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How come it's shiny?  Well, hers is newer than yours.  Yours is tarnished by Spittle.  No, no, it's not Spittle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so no story, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He shined it up or something.  I'm not gonna listen to you, Chepers.  No, no, that's a good story, but we did it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are people still talking about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because people don't listen.  They think they listen to the show, but they don't.  You need to listen to every single word  of every single show.  So we talked about it last week.  Go to last week's episode.  So here's what happened with Time Warner.  They announced they were gonna do caps.  Pretty serious caps.  Yeah, remember this, 50-gigabit caps.  And then they kinda backed off and teared.  And this is John.  Go back and listen to Twit 190.  John and I talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I listened to that one two or three times so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's old news, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, how's No Agenda going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No Agenda is a great show.  It's every Thursday and it's also on Sunday.  And unfortunately, next week's gonna be kinda confused.  Cause you're gonna be interested.  We got good numbers.  We got about 250,000 listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're so full of it.  You do not have 250,000 listeners.  We do.  If Adam is telling you that, he is lying to you.  No, we have lots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  And so you can go to noagenda.mevio.com  if you wanna listen in.  Or go to No Agenda Stream, which we have a really...  Yeah, he's streaming it.  That's kinda interesting.  He's streaming everything.  It's like a radio show thing.  He loves radio.  I wanna thank Elvin Trusty for sending me  the University of Findlay 2009 NCAA National Championship  in Men's Division II Basketball.  I thank you for the hoodie.  It's a beauty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So everybody wants me to bring up the dig bar  for the third show in a row.  I have brought this stupid story up.  Every show for the last four shows.  Let's see if we get any more interest.  Dig bar, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the dig bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's keeping people in the site.  They actually backed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They backed off a little bit on the dig bar this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the whole thing is,  and I was also asking that for a while,  is that it keeps people within that world, the dig world.  And it's like, instead, the reason why everyone likes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin apologized.  He said, yeah, you're right.  We did it wrong.  Did what wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dig bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the dig bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not even listening anymore.  I'm sorry.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what do you think?  I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't like the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole appeal of dig was that people could go...  Two of them were having a conversation amongst themselves.  It helped hits to other...  It helped people get hits and views to their sites.  So if you're keeping it self-meditating...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin was on this show a few weeks ago.  He said, we're gonna do a URL shortener.  I said, that's a great idea.  Dig should do a URL shortener.  Unfortunately, when they released it, it framed sites.  The way you would do it, you type dig.com slash a website.  So you dig.com slash HTTP colon slash slash mostlylisa.com.  People would get to mostlylisa.com,  but it would be...  All of the hits would go to dig.com.  It would be framed within dig's site.  So dig was getting the site.  They were framing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  That's ridiculous.  I agree.  Everybody stopped doing that years ago.  It was very 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People quite rightly complained about this.  Kevin realized, yeah, you know what?  We shouldn't have done that.  They've backed off now.  Alwana sites did an interesting thing.  In fact, I think it was Read Write website.  Here's how you block the dig bar  with a couple of lines of JavaScript.  That's when I think dig realized, whoops.  See, we might have gone a little too far on this.  It was a blatant grab for hits.  It made perfect sense from a business point of view.  It didn't make such a good idea.  It wasn't a good idea from the internet community  point of view.  They have backed down now on it.  And I think they did back down.  Also, a follow up on our story, John, from last week.  Microsoft is going to do a company tavern after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good thing.  Wow, that's another bullet dodge.  They need drinks there at that place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they have an open bar.  They have medical insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The last open bar.  All the mountain dew you can drink.  The only place right now, the really jumping place  has got to be Google at the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, that place is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you been there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  What podcast serves the most wine?  Well, apparently this one.  Yes, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's sushi and cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Much to our detriment, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think the show was improved by the wine.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the heat, it's great.  The heat and the wine, you had to drink a lot.  You can tell it's sweaty, the wine, random food show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've got a bunch of sweaty whatever.  We need to come back here when I'm like, hot.  I think, I believe, did I not send you a note

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saying that it was going to be very warm  and here and dress accordingly?  I believe I did send you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she's dressed, she doesn't have any clothes on barely.  I'm pretty clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the part of the show.  She's not wearing it for a coat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll have you know, I tried on so many different tops.  Really?  Yes, because people, it's like,  oh, you're wearing a low cut top and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you chose the low cut top.  But I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's trying to bring it up now.  It's too late, it can't stretch it.  She's going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was wearing a high, like, high cut top.  Now we got the showdown between the two women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's got the best top on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  End of story, let's go to the end of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I decided to wear my Ralph Lauren shirt.  I'm wearing a yellow shirt.  This is something you don't see a lot of.  It's a button down collar on a Hawaiian shirt.  Ralph Lauren design.  What do you think?  I think it's.  I've worn this for many years.  I found this to be very attractive.  You know, I'm going to bring up a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  since we're talking about Hawaiian shirts.  Leo used to work at this place called Tech TV.  I remember it.  And he used to wear, and one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are doing the Ev, people are replying Ev.  All right, guys, this is how he replied Ev.  I never get the story out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the Ev being Shira Lazar, I'm a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they saying?  They're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do it.  The Ev being Shira Lazar, I'm a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not doing it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're wearing Ev, Shira Lazar, help Shira.  That's what you need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you shocked by the fact that people are doing this  after we told them to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm always shocked no matter what.  I think maybe that creates my naivete towards.  Like I'm always shocked.  You have negativity toward what?  Towards everything.  Naivete.  Oh, naivete.  No, I think it's great when you come into things like.  You can't expect anything,  but when you see people responding, that's so amazing.  Like sometimes I put out videos and I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here's one.  She's flabbergasting.  From Ehunrandananel.  Ehunrandananel.  He says, Time Warner gave up because of complaints.  There are no tears now.  You're an ass dismissing her story.  It's not old.  Thank you.  Ooh.  You are an ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm an ass.  That is horrible what you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another one from Craig Derling.  This show is a train wreck.  Well, he might have got that right.  Unsubbing from the podcast.  This just ain't what it used to be.  You haven't even heard.  People love train wrecks.  What's funny is.  That's the point.  You haven't heard the podcast.  You're just watching the live show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the podcast is gonna be.  We're gonna cut all this out.  Very few people realize how much post-production  Leo puts into these things.  He's hysterical.  Nights, nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is typical.  This is the typical BS.  Oh, I'll tell you a story we didn't do.  And last Sunday was when it was breaking  and we came very close to doing it  and my instinct said, wait a little bit.  And that's the Amazon fail story.  You probably followed this.  It was a big Twitter story.  The hashtag was Amazon fail.  Amazon all of a sudden on Sunday  started delisting books that had gay and lesbian themes.  On Easter Sunday, yeah.  On Easter Sunday.  This was last week.  And there was a lot of tweeting going on.  A lot of anger about it going on.  People felt there couldn't possibly be a mistake.  Amazon was actively discriminating  against gays and lesbians.  I saw this at the time and I thought,  something doesn't feel right about this story.  I'm not gonna do it on Twitter.  We haven't heard the whole thing.  The second sense.  And I'm glad I did because I have,  now we don't exactly know what happened.  Amazon says, you know what?  It was a database error.  This is what didn't sit right with me.  Amazon probably has many gay and lesbian people  working there.  I'd be very shocked if they had any negative feelings  toward gays and lesbians.  They certainly would never ever have a policy  where they would block those.  Zero chance.  So I knew there was something wrong  that this just didn't smell right.  However, a lot of people, in fact, people,  maybe some people who should have known better,  jumped on this story and made it a big deal.  In fact, a number of people had to back down  and say, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Twitter, everyone, it was a revolt against Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it just shows you how quickly,  and this is maybe the failing of this new media,  is that this stuff can, without any kind of,  it's a mob mentality.  Without any kind of. Mobocracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying it's about engagement,  meaning maybe the power of the web  is not as much about just fully the content,  but yeah, about the conversation.  That's what I was saying.  Well, there's certainly conversation.  Conversation is just as important as the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there is this mob sense where people can go out  and they can attack other people.  And it becomes, now I have to think Amazon  got a little pain out of this.  How many people still believe Amazon discriminated  against gays and lesbians?  Because of the bad initial.  Because of this Amazon.  The wave of fake news.  Right, fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, by the way, the way  that it's gonna be from now on out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, here's an example.  We're all doomed by this.  Well, here's a good counter example.  Domino's Pizza.  A very big viral video of two Domino's employees  just, I mean, it was awful.  Spittin' in the food.  Spittin', they were farting on the sandwiches.  I mean, it was really, it was gross.  Yeah, I couldn't.  Now, what do you think of the way Domino's handled it?  They immediately, I thought it was very interesting.  and I think he was right on.  What they did is they went back to that same medium.  They went to YouTube.  The president of Domino's made a video  that was fairly unscripted and fairly genuine  saying this is awful.  We fired those people.  We have sanitized that particular Domino's.  We actually closed it and sanitized the whole place  so that you feel comfortable eating there.  This is not how we behave.  This is a very bad thing.  And we want you to know we believe  in the cleanliness of our food  and we do not do this.  We do not endorse this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he handled that very well.  Well, you know the one thing I think  they should have done also was sue those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they're being charged with felonies.  Okay.  Which is pretty serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's cool that it did.  I mean, the fact is we don't want to be eating that pizza.  No, I agree with that.  But there's a bunch of goofballs that go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and make these videos and they're not thinking.  Remember this girl that got beat up by her friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, how stupid are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's my point.  Here's my point.  Compare and contrast these two stories.  Where Amazon got very much got a PR hit  from this Amazon fail.  Did not, I think, respond.  Take responsibility.  As proactively and as effectively as Domino's,  which could, I mean, this could have really damaged Domino's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are brands supposed to take responsibility  when this Twitter effect happens?  Should they be coming out publicly or not?  And like, what is the line of responsibility?  And like, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just interested in how you respond as a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How should you respond?  When these kind of-  When these kind of relations agencies  are having meetings 24, well, not 24-7.  But should it be the CEO or should it be a PR?  No, no, it should always be the CEO.  What do you think?  If you have a choice in a big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it means more when it comes from the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you watch the Domino's response at all?  I did, yeah.  Yeah, what'd you think?  Was it effective to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was effective.  I mean, when they sort of reach out and that level.  I think it was very effective, surprisingly so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if you had asked me after the first video,  I thought, Domino's can't recover from this.  Remember the, you know, there's always those rats  in the McDonald's food and stuff,  and that stuff lives forever, these urban legends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see the one that's floating around  about the Australian McDonald's?  The dirty place filled with paper and dirt?  The thing is-  I sent it to you because-  Dvorak Uncensored.  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It establishes what you expect from the place,  so you're like, okay, this is not a high quality place.  But it gets in your mind-  But you know what's gonna happen to your local one.  So you still go there.  I mean, did it hit-  Really? I don't know.  Did it hit McDonald's, the sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you when I first became aware of this,  my kids and I'm riding in the car with four 14 year old  boys and they're talking about this and they're saying,  well, we're not gonna, let's order pizza tonight.  Not Domino's.  Not Domino's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would not order Domino's pizza for the reason that-  No, they order it every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cardboard, I know, but they order it every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I say something?  I hope people start choosing their local places to go.  Not as much corporate, but-  Well, I agree with you.  I think it's a shame. Local spots.  I'm with you on that.  And places that create their food.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make it locally.  I agree.  They get it from miles outside their city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's, I think, the new wave of looking at it.  And there's actually, there's a sites that you can go to,  which can find the food and the restaurants  that get food in your area.  So I think that's the next place where we're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I just thought that was a very,  I mean, what Amazon did, I thought was, or not Amazon.  Oh yeah, I think Amazon did not handle it  as well as they could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, Amazon doesn't have a CEO  that's as presentable as the guy from Domino's.  I mean, I think Bezos is a genius.  Wait a minute, Bezos could come on.  Yeah, but if he laughs or something, it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just tell him, Jeff, you can't laugh.  This is serious.  I don't think that's a problem.  I think Jeff Bezos should have.  He probably should have.  He should have done a video or something.  He should have come forward.  He said, let me tell you something.  We do not discriminate against gays and lesbians.  We believe firmly in free speech at this company.  We would never do this intentionally.  This was a programming error.  We are very sorry.  We'll never do it again.  That would have been very effective.  I did not do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing is, sometimes things like that happen,  and as long as CEOs come out and are transparent,  are sincere, it's okay.  Oh, I'm with you.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think Domino's is the example of how you do it.  And I think Amazon might be an example  of how you don't do it.  These things live forever.  I don't think you're really gonna hurt Amazon at all.  Maybe not.  I mean, Amazon maybe not as vulnerable,  but Domino's would be vulnerable.  If anything, it gets their name out there more,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and so people see it on Twitter.  The latest trends, Amazon, they go do it.  I mean, in the end, it helps,  but you just need to take responsibility for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tech Illuminati, had to stop listening to Twitter.  Unlistenable, unsubbed, I seek tech news.  Twitter doesn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, this is what I've been saying, by the way,  to you listeners out there.  Michael Graham says-  I've been saying this when I was at the show  from two years ago.  Shut up.  Was all news.  You're such a liar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michael Graham says,  I think Laporte and Dvorak are intoxicated,  and it's hilarious.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know what intoxicated is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, A. Harandahl,  the guy I was talking to said,  I'm sorry I seem mean, but thanks for the mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  It really comes down to that.  That's what commenters are all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter has gone off the rails tonight,  says Ben Sanders, but I like it.
