Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  personally think that he is overtly lying that he knows this is a revolving  door and just as other commissioners and chairman by the way his predecessor  Michael Powell is now has his old job at the NC national cable television  association the NCTA he's the boss there this is a revolving door commissioners  routinely go back to industry where they make big bucks I think chairman Wheeler

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  really really well Leo and it's a complicated issue so kudos to you for  for doing that shall I go ahead and give you my take yes please all right so  first of all I would like to know exactly what it is that we're talking  about here so far we haven't seen these proposed new rules unless they were  published in full text in the Wall Street Journal I have not read the  Wall Street Journal article the journal not released this the day before saying  here they come right so but they haven't come we haven't seen them yet so there  has been this whole tornado of news coverage around something no one has yet

Start time: 732.36
End time: 765.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's also possible the FCC as it often happens a government floated floated  what we call a trial balloon they said let's see what the reaction is if we  were to propose this and obviously I hope that the reaction was strong enough  that maybe they've thought better of it Tom Wheeler in his blog post at FCC gov  says to be clear this is what the notice will propose all ISPs must  transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant  information as to the policies that govern their networks that's great they  must say yeah we're demanding YouTube pay us extra they have to tell us where

Start time: 765.46
End time: 769.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 769.50
End time: 786.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  content may be blocked right nobody said it will be and that ISPs may not act in  a commercial this is where you get in trouble in a commercially unreasonable  manner to harm the internet you don't think that second thing is a little  sketchy that no legal content may be blocked yeah why is that sketchy well

Start time: 786.70
End time: 804.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  don't you realize that the United Nations is creating these these rules  and regulations against hate speech who declares it illegal all right so that's  a that's that there is a very nasty little thing to sneak in that's I'd be  more concerned about that that's SOPA this actually he's saying civil

Start time: 804.40
End time: 838.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  illegality versus criminal legality should be taken into consideration there  again we haven't seen this thing so you know we're going by Chairman Wheeler's  statements and the Wall Street Journal summary I think you know we need to  actually see this thing to be able to talk intelligently about it even though  no one has seen it the FCC has opened up a new inbox for comments about its new  open internet proposal which no one has seen yet if people have comments they  can email the FCC at open internet at FCC gov you know and I'm sure that's

Start time: 838.22
End time: 849.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  getting in an earful but he says it should be noted that title two  regulation this is the Communications Act regulation only bans unjust and

Start time: 849.32
End time: 903.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  unreasonable discrimination so his point you realize his point there yes it has  to be reasonable well no here's here's what he's saying there he is addressing  the let's back up to 2010 when the first open internet law rules from the FCC  were enacted and those we like the original chairman Janikowski well really  nobody likes them oh because the people who were in favor of net neutrality did  not and strong prophylactic net neutrality did not think that they went  far enough and the people who are not in favor of big government regulating  business and having a lot of monkeying around in what sort of a private  arrangements businesses can make with each other didn't like them either  because they began to go down that road so they really didn't make anybody too

Start time: 903.32
End time: 909.91

Transcript:  happy which is the test of a good rule in my opinion right so we're not Tom

Start time: 916.18
End time: 964.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wheeler's rules but one of the reasons that the original open internet rules  which were taken out by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently one of  the reasons people didn't like it is what you've alluded to this going under  section 706 as opposed to regulating the internet net as a common carrier they  didn't do that so what he is saying here when he says by the way it should be  noted that even title to regulation only bans unjust and unreasonable  discrimination he's saying even if we reclassify which we still could do but  we're not doing now but if we do it we're still under the same standard only  unjust and unreasonable discrimination will be forbidden so he's saying it's  six to one half dozen the other you don't like where we are now but even if

Start time: 964.32
End time: 983.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you declare it a common carrier they right they aren't there but what the  court I think the court the district court was pretty clear that if you are  if you don't do that you're very limited in what you can do is the FCC right  you're very limited and that's why they oh they overturned these open internet

Start time: 983.32
End time: 1002.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  rules they said they're not legal right you have to go under 706 you've done you  have to go under title two instead of title one you have to call it a common  carrier instead of an inform a communication service as opposed to an  information service and then you can then you have more leeway it struck me

Start time: 1002.44
End time: 1023.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that the court was saying to them if you wish to you know if you wish to pursue  these open internet rules and we think that's a good thing there was very clear  language in the opinion that we understand why it's important to have an  open internet then you need to pursue title two you need to declare the ISP's  common carriers right that seemed like the court was pushing them that way I

Start time: 1023.90
End time: 1036.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  don't I wouldn't say the court went so far as to try and tell the FCC what to  do it gave the FCC some options right it said you're either gonna have to rework  the rules under your existing framework or you're gonna have to jump to the

Start time: 1036.28
End time: 1049.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  other frame or or what you want it to do is illegal right so they overturned the  open internet rules and the we've been waiting to hear back from the FCC well  what is your response to this what their response is okay fine we won't have an

Start time: 1049.34
End time: 1081.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  open internet well what their response is is I think here if you read Chairman  Wheeler that the open internet will under the FCC's rules he says it doesn't  commercially unreasonable steps right and require transparency but we're going  to allow private deals for preferential treatment I want to be clear that the

Start time: 1081.58
End time: 1162.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  kind of deal that Netflix made with Comcast earlier that was a peering deal  that was appearing you know that's not what we're talking about we're talking  about at the edge deals with edge networks direct deals with somebody like  twit or something like Netflix saying if you would like fast lane access to our  customers we would like to be paid for that and that would then now the reason  I have a very big stake in this and and I think you everybody in the country has  a big stake in it is twit wouldn't exist if we had if we if our live stream  stuttered and was unusable and buffered a lot because we didn't have fast lane  access I don't care that the come it's commercially reasonable for it for AT&T  and rather YouTube and and Vimeo to pay a buck a customer that might be  commercially reasonable but it's not come it's not viable for me and and as  this I think excellent article from us the Stanford Law School pointed out eBay  Yahoo Facebook even Google itself wouldn't exist in a world where they had  to pay YouTube would not exist in the early days if they had to pay now they  can afford it that's not the question is do you get the same kind of innovation  more more than that do you get the same kind of free speech and and you know

Start time: 1162.70
End time: 1218.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  don't you think that you're exaggerating this issue and I'm saying that I don't  really think that they're ought to do evil what overtly I mean it's like it's  nice to say well geez oh the whole thing is a scam to get you to cough up more  money the real basis for this whole thing is the public itself all they want  is Netflix Netflix is hogging all the bandwidth Netflix should have a peering  deal and have to pay extra to get on that on that faster lane as it were I  hate to use that analogy because they're the ones that are chewing up all the  bandwidth they're the ones who everybody wants to see at night after six o'clock  everybody goes on Netflix it's a known fact that the whole internet is clogged  by Netflix that's what it's about it's about video yeah you may be affected in  some way or form but I don't think that it's gonna deteriorate by any means these  are private networks we're not talking about the public internet we're talking  about no we are private backbones is what really this is that's the peering

Start time: 1219.06

Start time: 1222.92
End time: 1253.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that the internet is a democratizing type thing when it really isn't because  the barrier to me just making a network out of my house that competes with twit  is higher than just access to viewers we're by and large a pretty unfriendly  place to do business in the United States so I think not that I don't agree  that the internet should be net neutral but I also think that we're maybe being  a little bit what's the word I want to use you know we're romanticizing this

Start time: 1255.59

Start time: 1263.30
End time: 1283.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  word I think where is pretend that the that the web is a bit utopic and it's  not there's a great book on this topic called the myth of the digital democracy  and they talk about how it's not just as easy to start a blog or start you know  if you want to compete with Facebook it's not just a matter of access to  speed and viewers it's there's a lot more that goes into that I'm gonna put

Start time: 1283.90
End time: 1326.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the link in the chat room guys she writes finally access fees may impose  serious collateral damage on values like free speech or a more participatory  culture by making it more difficult for individuals or nonprofits to be heard or  to find an audience for their creative works today individuals and nonprofits  can put their content online at low cost and when it travels across the network  that content receives the same service from the network as commercial content  by contrast access fees would create two classes of speakers those who can pay to  receive better treatment and those who cannot afford to do so often individuals  and groups with unpopular or new viewpoints like activists or artists and

End time: 1365.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  besides just access all right that's fine no you could talk about marketing  and so forth but the but the fundamental right to be heard on the  internet at an equal is what has made the internet so powerful and I point  again to startups like eBay and Facebook that would not exist if they had to pay  for access to customers they would not be on an equal internet we're talking  about a two-tiered internet who's proposing this two-tiered example AT&T

Start time: 1365.94
End time: 1370.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that is saying to who did AT&T well let's go with Comcast Comcast has no

Start time: 1370.18
End time: 1424.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  business thing and they got the regular AT&T said we will if you pay us money we  will not count your bandwidth against our customers usage caps that's the  same thing by the way this is the equivalent of an access fee so they go  to YouTube and not an access fee if you want it is exactly an access fee if you  want our customers to watch all they want a YouTube just give us some money  we won't count it pay for in effect their internet access that's exactly an  access fee and it disadvantages any company that's not willing to pay that  fee because then as a customer I know it's counting against my bandwidth if  I go see Vimeo instead of YouTube so it totally makes a difference and that's  already happening it's if the FCC does not get involved you can absolutely bet  Comcast goes to each and every one of these internet provider internet edge  companies and says okay you want to have nice high-speed access to our customers  you're gonna give us a buck a customer how about having a little more

Transcript:  competition maybe these guys should stop all these crazy things you see for no

Start time: 1428.68
End time: 1450.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  competition by the way it's because that's a different that we have a  duopoly and that is a different argument but it's all the part of the  same argument which is that if you do not go step take steps today to protect  open internet access you will not have the same internet we have today in just  a few years then Denise go ahead I'm sorry we know it's okay I totally agree

Start time: 1450.42
End time: 1542.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  with you that it's part of the same argument because how you feel about  market forces has everything to do with how you feel about net neutrality if you  feel like the market is capable of dictating that unfair things won't  happen because if the ISPs make deals that favor certain people and don't  favor others and it winds up damaging the consumer experience if you believe  that the market's gonna cry loudly and bring pressure about that kind of thing  then you're not so concerned about the internet fast lane because the ISPs are  going to have to respond to the market right you also have in your camp if  you're one of these people that believes the market can fix things the fact that  we have antitrust laws and consumer protection laws that are already on the  books that are there to fill the gaps in this too if you're someone and and  Baron Soka who we've had on the show before who is very much I've got to say  you know if you're if there are people in different camps and out on the ends  of both sides of this issue Baron Soka is very much on the side that net  neutrality even the original open internet rules went too far he calls it  prophylactic legislation or prophylactic regulation that were as John is  suggesting we're perhaps regulating something that's not happening yet  because we're afraid and we don't want it to happen I believe in a free market

Start time: 1543.04
End time: 1555.04

Transcript:  Dan is concerned and I'm concerned too about this point and it goes to the graphic that you just showed Leo that with an internet fast lane permitted what that means is the ISPs double dip they charge their customers on the one end for and the poor customers they've been getting the raw end of the deal for so long you know you're promised up to certain speeds that you really don't get and it's you know you're you're not nobody's happy about it  with the level of internet service that they are receiving but they're paying for it anyway because of that matter right so so you know the customers are already not in a great situation but their lot is not going to improve when the ISPs are also getting paid by edge providers who want to reach those customers you know what's going to happen at the customer level you're paying for premium services  premium internet access say for example but even that is not going to get you the fastest access to you to you know anybody who's not also paying on the back end and if you're not paying for premium premium access what is your internet service going to look like not great well it's going to look like your DSL because I think in many cases that's what you're getting is sub premium service over DSL

Transcript:  I have a question that I haven't really heard it discussed in these terms before but it has to do with the way that internet services have changed over the years and the way that now there's so much video content being delivered over the internet whereas you know back in the day we were just doing our Alta Vista searches and thrilled to be online  And how that should all factor into this equation it does seem to me like the way you price internet should change in light of all that doesn't it seem that way to you Leo?

Transcript:  Well there's an interesting question how are you going to answer that without the net neutrality argument?  Because very simply  Which is I think there should be a I think it should be tiered I think people who want to watch Netflix all the time should have a different fee essentially  I agree but it should be about Netflix it's a tiering for speed  A virtually different access path because you're watching videos all the time

Start time: 2110.46
End time: 2155.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not illegal and it's not against the rules and it's a perfectly good way to run your business I do it right now I can pay for higher speed internet or slower speed internet  What I don't want is an internet where the high speed internet has access only to certain edge providers  All edge providers must be equal across all those tiers then that's not that is an open internet  It's not wrong or illegal or in any way immoral to say if you want 50 megabits per second you pay more that's not what we're saying  What we're saying is I don't want to have to pay more so that I get good Netflix I want to pay for 50 megabits a second and choose the provider I want  Does that make sense? Otherwise you're not going to get a new Netflix  Netflix is going to be the incumbent is going to own the market and Voodoo is going to say goodbye

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does remind me a little bit of what we went through with CARP way back in the early days of regulating internet radio when internet radio stations were being priced like terrestrial radio and having to pay additional fees that were driving internet radio stations out of business  Again, it may be apples and oranges, but I do think that we need to be paying attention to that issue of the little guy getting hit with fees that the little guy shouldn't be expected to bear.  And that in those kinds of situations, it's not so much a consumer issue, it's more a consumer protection issue.  And we do have consumer protection laws out there to look after the consumers. It's more a small business protection issue.

End time: 2271.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It killed it.  But at the same time, I have to say, and of course you may have accused me about this earlier being a little too much of a free market type.  If the guys who own the content in the case of internet radio decide that you just can't have it cheaply, whose business is it to tell them no?  I mean, it just seems to me that that's just the way it is.  I'm not a big content nutcase where I got my content. Sumner Redstone, I ran into him once and he says, that's mine, it's mine. He's like very adamant about this.  But in fact, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's changed everything. It's changed everything.  But no, I agree with you. I am not anti-market. I think the free market, if it's truly a free market, works quite well.  There's a few areas where you have to regulate like antitrust.  And there's a few businesses like healthcare where a free market solution, in fact, doesn't give you the proper outcome.  And we all know that.  But in most cases, a free market would solve this.  But we just don't have real competition.  So maybe the solution is to force the cable companies to allow other internet service providers to ride on their wires.  That's illegal right now.  They're not forced to do that. The telcos are.

Then he goes on to say what you were just saying, Leo, create genuine competition.  That community broadband share their lines at a fair price with competing ISPs.

We have our own Malik on from time to time.  He raves about his community broadband internet access.  I don't think that internet service provider is going to go to the edge networks and say,  would you like to be in our apartment building? You've got to give me some more money.  That's not going to happen.  So that's one competition.

Start time: 2429.88
End time: 2454.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What does John think about this one?  The best solution, says Dan, taxpayers should pay for a fiber everywhere system and then let competing ISPs use it to compete in a genuine free market.  But don't hold your breath on that one.  When I mentioned that on my show, Evan Brown said, oh, OK, so the government then is going to be in charge of a fiber everywhere system.  Now I'm not sure if taxpayers are paying that necessarily means that the government is going to pay.

Transcript:  Rural electrification, the interstate highway system? There's good precedent for this.  Actually, what Frankston says is local governments should assert the right of eminent domain and say, you know what?  Thank you for putting in all that infrastructure.  It's now the utility.  And we're going to and what we're going to do is let you ride on it.  We will maintain it.  We will charge you a reasonable fee.  And if Comcast and AT&T and Verizon and everybody else want to ride on it, that's great because more competition is good.  Frankston has a very direct roadmap for how this could all work.  It does require something that's never going to happen, which is that local governments develop.

Transcript:  I have direct experience in Petaluma.  I was on the technology committee until I quit in dismay.  Local politics is very frustrating.  But as with every town in the country, we made a deal in this case with Comcast for a monopoly in this region.  That's how you get a regional monopoly.  Comcast is a monopoly here.  Comcast promised all sorts of things.  Internet to schools, low cost.  And they never delivered.  Never delivered any of it.  And the local government not only doesn't have the clout or the lawyers or the willpower to fight it.  So they're just going, well, Comcast kind of screwed us.  But what are we going to do?  Because I'll tell you what, you're the city council member who said we're going to get Comcast out of here.  You're going to hear from every voter in town.  It says, wait a minute.

And so we had a fiber going down the street.  We actually had it strung.  And we bought directly from them.  And then the next thing you know, Verizon kind of got their foot in the door.  And they're now providing some aspect of this.  And then the next thing you know, they sell the whole thing to a local company that's been kind of hogging the money.  They sold the internet, old fashioned internet.  And now we're just, this great deal that we had is like all screwed up because of these local governments that are incompetent.

Transcript:  So the first chapter is all about this, about how people who lay the fiber then act in a nefarious way.  It's specifically about spread networks, which has they worked to kind of overtly or covertly rather lay down a fiber line between the Chicago Exchange and the servers in New Jersey to most of the bigger exchanges in New York.  And the speed at which you can get information between those trades is like 14.5 milliseconds or something crazy like that.  What do they do with that information?  Like what do they do with that cable line?  Do they sell it to someone who could use it?  Do they do something good for it?  No, they sell it to the big banks for something like $140 million a year or something like that.  And most of the banks signed on right away.  No questions asked.  And one bank, only one bank said, we just need to sort of change the contract so it doesn't look like we were, we didn't know that we couldn't use this on behalf of our customers.  It's crazy town.  So you think that people do really great things with this communication technology that they then own and put a lot of money into by and large?

Remember this story we thought was apocryphal for years?  Oh yeah, right.  Yeah, that's true.  That Atari, this E.T. game was so bad.  And it was so bad for the Atari 2600 console.  And the reason it really was bad is that they had to make it in, like, six weeks.  Because they made the deal and then the movie was coming out.  This was so bad that they ended up plowing them under in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  But everybody thought this might be, in fact, apocryphal.  So, a documentary crew got permission to dig up this landfill.  They did it yesterday.  What do you think they found?  A bunch of those things.  A bunch of these.  I don't know.  Is there a story about how many they found?  They did find them.  This is not apocryphal.  By the way, they found a lot of other crap from Atari.

Transcript:  So Mike wrote a very interesting post on Computer World.  I don't know if it's related.  I think it is.  Let me go to his Google Plus page and I can get the link from it for you.  Here's his posts.  He says social networks are falling apart.  He says this is an example of what's actually happening.  And I totally agree with him.  It's an opinion piece, but I think Mike nailed it.  He says the new business model for social, it actually was invented by Google.  And Facebook and others are now following it.  personal data anywhere you can, then sell ads anywhere you can.  So you ask why did Facebook buy WhatsApp and Instagram and then not fold them into the  product but keep them intact.  That's the strategy that's going forward.  That's what you're going to see.  Facebook, they've even, Mark Zuckerberg even said this, the website, the desktop is no  longer important.  What they really want to do is be an ad platform across a variety of apps, share data from  app to app.  And that makes them much more valuable and you get to use what you want.  If you don't like Facebook, use WhatsApp.  If you like Instagram, use Instagram.  Google really invented this.  If you think about it, Google has Gmail, Google Apps, Google Plus, YouTube.  Just a few months ago, they changed their privacy policy so that they all of these products  could share data with each other.  They're sharing advertising across it.  You use any one of these.  You're in the Google network.  They sell ads across it.  It actually makes perfect sense.  I think Mike nailed it.  And I think he's right that Facebook looked at Google and said, oh, that's what we should  be doing.

Start time: 3693.20
End time: 3720.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why integrate it?  I think people, I think the move, and I think Zuckerberg even said this, he's kind of influenced  by Unix.  The move is to have simple, straightforward tools that do one thing, make sure that there's  a pipeline of data shared across them so that we can sell ads across them.  But there's no reason to make Instagram part of Facebook.  In fact, that would obviously hurt Instagram.  Kids use Instagram because it's not Facebook.  They don't need to know that Facebook owns it.  Those kids today.

Start time: 3720.96
End time: 3737.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you hit on something there, Leo.  Kids use Instagram because it's not Facebook.  They use Snapchat because it's not permanent.

End time: 3770.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zuckerberg even said nobody wants to make lists.  It's too much work.  Actually, Facebook tried to buy Snapchat.  I think that fits perfectly into their model.  Facebook doesn't care if your post persists.  They care about getting the data about you because what persists is you and what they  know about you.  And that's what they're selling ads against.

Start time: 3771.48

Transcript:  Well, considering the size of their audience, I think their quarterlies aren't that interesting.  And this whole ad thing, I'll just bring it up again.  I always bring it up, which is if this whole model of targeted advertising works so well,  why do after I buy a product on Amazon, do I continually get ads to tell me to buy the  product?  I already bought the product.  I agree.

Transcript:  You know, and it's funny that Jeff Jarvis's book, What Would Google Do?  Is five years old now.  It's an old book.  And he said Google does a lot of things great, but what they don't do well is social.  And they need to be able to do that.  And no matter how many iterations they come across, they can't get sort of the masses.  And like your point, you said the people on Google Plus now are still very vocal.  There's a lot of activity there, but it's not the kind of people that Google  Britney Spears or it's just like a different level.  And are those people not marketable?

There's a very high level of discourse.  But then, I mean, close to two million people have me in circles on Google Plus.  And that's not the tech layer.  That's more the Orkut layer.

Transcript:  That's why I love it.  So I'm trying to get the name of the guy I was replacing.  He's a longtime Google manager.  Let me see if I can find the name.  It is a little it was a little abrupt.  And Vic is, by the way, pretty much beloved not only by Google Plus users, but by developers.  He was a developer relations guy.  David Bespris, who is currently Google's vice president of engineering.  If you put the VP of engineering in charge, it's kind of like a holding.  Kind of weird. It's like, yeah, yeah, I'm nominally in charge of these zero employees  who work on Google Plus.  I don't think Alexia would say this.  It's Alexia, by the way, Alexia, who doesn't like Google Plus, Alexia, Sotis and Matthew  Panzerino, neither of whom are very, very active at Google Plus anyway.  I think what's going to happen and this is kind of what they say,  it's not going to go away. It's still be the connector.  Just as Facebook Connect is.  What about Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's completely Google Hangouts team will be moving to the Android team.  The photos team, it's likely they will follow because this is the application, right?  Hangouts is an app.  It's a it's a separate product that shares data.  Photos is a set. They even did this.  They made photos an app.  And it's a separate app that shares data.  I think this makes sense from Google's point of view.  It is a sad thing for those of us who use Google Plus.  But I think you can continue to I think is use it.

Start time: 4137.46
End time: 4168.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's straight out of the chair.  It was a couple of years ago.  I never said it was a scam.  I just said it was it was it was born to fail.  Mainly, let's get back to something you said.  You said that they can't do social because the company itself is not a social company.  Zuckerberg and these guys are a bunch of social maniacs.  And this is where they can do that.  They can't have a second sense of it.  But if you're like the worst case scenario is Microsoft.  They're not even close to being a social company.  And everything that they try and you think is a total failure.

Start time: 4168.96
End time: 4216.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's possible that that's exactly what this is, is acknowledgement.  Because you remember last year, Larry Page said to the company,  every one of you, every person of the company,  your bonus is based on how well we do in social.  It is based on social.  They made a full concerted, full court press on this.  And it didn't work.  It probably did not work despite the numbers.  I don't think it's really a vital social network.  But that doesn't matter. You know what Google is good at? Products.  Google is brilliant at software.  And that's all they're going to do.  They said, look, we don't need Google.  Plus, that can be a connecting layer.  But we've got photos, we've got hangouts, we've got Gmail, we've got apps.  We've got plenty of stuff for people to use.  All we care is that they continue to use as much Google stuff as possible.  Social, I think the whole thing on social was people thought for a while  that was the future of search.

Start time: 4218.10
End time: 4248.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Google was scared into that because it was Facebook  that kept talking about this future search is going to be social search.  And so they freaked and did a kind of a defensive maneuver with.  Mark Zuckerberg is going,  you know, it's like it's like the time Ford announced  when they were building these bigger and bigger SUVs,  they actually showed a six door just.  And I know it was just a screw with it with GM, but they had it.  They had a prototype six door.  Can you imagine driving one of those things around?

And and and he points out in dogfight that what we think of now  as a broken patent system because of software patents has always been.  You agree, Denise has always been this broken.  And the most famous one is this is the Singer sewing machine lawsuits  because a lot of different people complained to have patented sewing machines.  And so in the 1850s, this was a massive battle between Elias Howe.  Remember him from the Cotton Jim?  Sure you do. I met him once.  Yeah. Who claimed he had invented the sewing machine.  And and Singer, who said he invented the sewing machine.  And it's just a fast.  But the problem is how sewing machine was was was vertical.  The fabric started at the top and went to the bottom. Huh?

Sounds like a sewing machine, a shuttle on a track,  then slipped the second thread through the loop, creating a lock stitch.  There you go. Yep.  But Isaac Singer comes along.  And he built the first commercially successful sewing machine.

Not when they all set off.  I'm telling you, she couldn't get them off.  See, that's...  I wish you should call them and say, no, put them back on the market.  Because that was the whole problem is inadvertent...  There was no fire.  Disabling of the smoke alarms.  Because it turns out when there's a fire, you might jump up and wave your arms and then  the smoke alarms all go...  Stop.  Panicking.  You'd be panicking.  But you already know there's a fire.

Without your say so?  The whole idea is it learns whether you're home and it knows what the temperature is  outside and it decides on its own.  This little thing on the wall decides on its own when you need heat or cool.  And it never was right.  It's like, it's turning on the heat at three in the morning.  I don't want it.

Transcript:  That thing.  They don't break it down by a model.  That's a shame.  I don't think they can make very many of them, I think is the problem.  You didn't like it.  I have one.  The first one I had was a lemon.  I was using it to store my acidic whey.  That might have been part of the problem.  So you ditched it for a new one?  I called Apple and they said, yes, it is a lemon.  We know about it.  In fact, they were capturing Mac Pros, not in my serial number range, but close to it.  So because it just would reboot spontaneously.  Apparently this was a no problem.  That's not good.  You don't want that.  It didn't do it enough so that it was like you could work with it, but every day it would  reboot once.  It would just go black and then go bong and start up again.  Once a day.  And I didn't realize how bad it was until I got the new one and it didn't.  And it was like I had PTSD.  It was like I finally could trust my computer again.  So I do like the Mac Pro a lot.  Once I got a new one, I just love it.  It hasn't rebooted in days.  Do you use it?  Yeah.  Where is it?  I use it with the web, a little bit of email, you know, that kind of thing.

It's a three-hour radio show.  Remember that, Dvorak on computers?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he'd get bored.  I was easily bored.  So I gave him a bunch of sound effects.

Transcript:  This is cheesy music.  In the same quarter a year prior, Apple increased iPad channel inventory, whereas in this quarter,  it was reduced.  Huh.  So he's...  This sounds a little bit ex post facto.  He's saying, oh yeah, well, we didn't sell as many because we didn't make as many.  Yeah.  I think it might be the other way around.  We didn't make as many because we weren't selling as many.  But okay.  Apple ended the first quarter, the holiday season, with a backlog of iPad minis, which  was subsequently shipped during the second quarter.  They couldn't make those fast enough.

Start time: 6546.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the quote...  No, this sounds like bull crap.  It sounds like he's...  Bull crap.  Like...  It's been the fastest growing product in Apple's history.  It was an instant hit in business, education, and consumer.  And just four years after we launched the first iPad, we've sold over 210 million.  More than anyone thought possible.  That's twice as much as during a comparable timeframe.  In other words, he has no reason at all why Apple didn't sell as many last quarter.

In a way, the most common thing that we as a family use the iPad for is when we're on  the road, not at home, we use Amazon Instant Video on the iPad.

Start time: 6707.74
End time: 6752.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a good thesis.  I think, you know, screen time does have an effect on your brain.  So I'm careful about that.  But I think that, you know, that's up to me to decide when that can and can't happen.  My husband was in a bagel shop and this guy, he set the kids up with some breakfast and  an episode of Curious George.  And this guy was like, this is why kids today are going to be idiots because of lazy parents  like this.  My husband was so furious that he went over and he said, excuse me, are you judging me  for keeping my kids, you know, watch, let them watch some Curious George with their  iPad?  So I know there's a lot of like high emotion judgment that goes along with that.  But anyone who has to say something like that can take it up with me.  He actually was very diplomatic about it.  I would have strangled him.  But he just said, you need to mind your own business.

So it's not like we had anything to prove or answer to this guy.  But I was really pissed that he would dare to judge my husband, who is an amazing father.  But beyond that, just using the iPad, we don't use it as a babysitter, but we both do a lot  of consumption of media.  I mean, we we have an app for that.  We yes.  Oh, let us not forget.

But like, but I do think that I do think that the Android marketplace is a completely different  economy, which we're really excited to explore.  But, you know, this was all funded in our house.  So it's just it's slow going.

Transcript:  Actually, someone in the chat room just linked me to something that said that speed reading  was bad for reading comprehension.  And we haven't seen that at all.  In fact, we've had people with dyslexia write us and say that they have found this app to  be so useful because dyslexics normally makes up the order of the words or the direction  of the word.  Show this.  This forces you to read one word at a time.  So what you do is you mark articles that you would like to read later and then you open  them up and read quick and they display them to you one word at a time.  That's actually the old version there.  But we need a new video.  And so your brain, instead of sounding out the words, processes the words as an image  so that you can read quicker without getting in the way.  It's like JPEGs.  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 6893.72
End time: 6905.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually it really works.  You do actually read faster.  And I think your comprehension goes on.  But it's a weird it's a weird feeling while you're using read quick because it's kind  of going by and at first you try to keep up and then you just relax.

Start time: 6906.46
End time: 6940.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then you read.  You set the tone.  I don't go fast.  I think there are a lot of people who write us and they're like, I'm at a hundred words  a minute now.  And I'm like, what?  How?  I mean, it's possible with the settings, but I can't imagine it or comprehend it rather.  I'm still pretty low at like 350.  And I don't feel the need to go much higher than that.  Whereas my husband, Clayton, he can go almost close to 500.  I don't do it for speed, but especially for a show like this where I have a lot to read.  I'll mark on my articles in either pocket or insta paper and then open it and read quick  and I can get through them pretty fast.

Transcript:  I completely agree.  And frankly, I think a lot of people who bought computers didn't need computers.  Once they could get an iPad, that's it.  They're done.  They're happy.  By the way, expect Apple to get much more fashionable, maybe plaid in the next iPad.  Angela Arendt, who is Dame Angela Arendt's commander of the British Empire, former Burberry  CEO, is starting work this week.  Yeah, she's going where I forgot.  She's retail.  She's going to run retail for Apple.  What's interesting, she was the CEO of Burberry and is widely credited with revitalizing what  was a kind of it's the Mentos effect.  Your grandma's fashion.  And then she made she made Burberry hot again.  She will be trying to do the same thing.  Although Apple retail is doing fine.  They don't need her.  What's the point?  Well, I think Apple is I think Apple has done what a lot of companies.  It makes sense for companies to do.  They're fixing something not broken.  No, I disagree.  What what there's this is a response to the iPad issue.  You don't need another iPad, right?  Detroit had the same problem.  You didn't need another car.

You want us to take off our clothes slowly during the show?  No, no.  I want the show to be watchable.  I want to get rid of these stupid screens and put some laughs on people instead of these  dumb mics.  You at least got rid of the cans, which was really bad.  You see all these guys doing podcasting.  They had two big cans on their head and then they got a big giant mic.  It's horrible.  We don't want to see any of this.  And then there's the screen.  It's more TV.  You don't need the big microphone, the big dick microphone.

I know a lot of teams that actually keep GoToMeeting running all day, which is nice because you  don't pay by the minute or by the call.  You pay a flat rate and you've got it.  Millions of small business professionals rely on GoToMeeting.  Why?  Because you get on the same page.  You see each other's screens.  You can see each other face to face with their built-in HD video conferencing.  You can present.  You can demonstrate.  You can meet on any Mac, any tablet, any PC, any smartphone, anywhere.  GoToMeeting is a lifesaver.  We use it all the time.  Even if it's just going to be a teleconference, we just do the GoToMeeting just in case because  you want to...  You can turn on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's fine.  I think it's...  Nothing wrong with that.  But the idea is just purely a trick.  These little antennas are bogus.  You don't need them.  You can just consolidate the signal.  You don't have to have everyone have their own little antennas because it's a technicality  that you have your own antenna.  And this guy's showing them.  I think the whole thing was set up to be a scam.  But it may turn out that they win this case when the Supreme Court decides on whether  or not it's legal what they're doing.  And then once they do that, they can get rid of these stupid little antennas and just consolidate  the signal because John Roberts said that this little part of these little antennas  is not the point, which is good for the little company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have been.  The transcript has been out there since the argument and the actual audio of the argument  was just published.  I put it in my Twitter stream.  There's a link there.  What do you think?  I disagree with John.  I think that just because somebody has figured out a way to make a technology that even if  it's not the most efficient way to do it, it complies with the law and follows the law.  A gimmick.  That there's maybe a gimmick, but it's a legal gimmick.  And I don't think...  What I'm hoping the court will do is decide, look, we didn't create the situation Congress  did.  And if Congress doesn't like people using gimmicks to comply with copyright law, then  Congress can change it.  But the laws it's written now, if we're going to follow past Supreme Court precedents and  the way that we have treated VCRs and fair use, then we have to let Aereo stand.  I'm not sure that's what the court's going to do, but that's what I hope it does.

Transcript:  Cablevision and Betamax going all the way back to...

Start time: 8407.48
End time: 8450.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Cablevision was an online DVR and the court ruled that they didn't violate copyright because  the user had to actively press a button.  It was the user doing it, whether the DVR was in your house or in the Cablevision centers,  it didn't matter.  Aereo's argument is, well, it's exactly the same.  Aereo does nothing until the user pushes a button and records a show or turns a show  on.  The user's renting an antenna.  We do not provide copyrighted material.  We merely provide an antenna.  That seems like a good argument to me.  It seems to me to be...  And I don't think it's...  Here's the thing.  I don't think it's a trick, John.  It's Barry...  And Barry Diller said this.  When we set up this company, we thought, how can we do this legally?  And we did what we believed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They found a loophole.  That's not a loophole.  They followed the law.  It's still a loophole in some funny way.  And here's what I'm...  But that's a judgment.  That's a subjective judgment.  They followed the law.  Here's what I'm going to say.  People bitch and moan and complain forever about, oh, he got off on a technicality.  These technicalities, it's like they're exploiting the law.  They're on that side of the argument 90% of the time, but when this technicality benefits  them, everybody's all in.  I just find it to be a cheap trick.  And that's all I feel about it.  I think I would love to have a subscription.  But I'm not fooling myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you go through the oral argument, the justices are kind of with John.  I always like to look at if you can discern who the court thinks is wearing the white  hat in the case, who are the good guys?  And I don't think the court thinks Areo are the good guys, unfortunately, because of this  whole perception that, oh, you just designed this to be able to do this thing that's slamming  the cable industry and the satellite industry.

Start time: 8515.76
End time: 8528.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it is after all Barry Diller, who has been on the other side for a long time.  And it does feel a little bit like a revenge play, does it not?  But the judges aren't supposed to look at that, right?  They're supposed to look at the law.

Start time: 8528.62
End time: 8543.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And we won't know.  I mean, they sort of telegraph how they're thinking about things through their questions.  And we won't know until we get their decision before the end of the term.  They clearly are concerned about not shutting down the cloud.  They're concerned about.

Start time: 8543.70
End time: 8552.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting.  Tell me why that why that's a concern.  They wanted to make sure that Dropbox, for example, wasn't adversely impacted by a judge  against Areo. Why?

Start time: 8552.80
End time: 8572.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because if you're remotely storing something on Dropbox, if what Cablevision is doing,  I'm sorry, Cablevision, if what Areo is doing is wrong, then it's a public performance,  perhaps, when you are using your Dropbox account to store something that's infringing copyright.

Start time: 8573.26
End time: 8604.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Justice Roberts referred to this.  Chief Justice Roberts referred to this.  And I got the impression that he was asking the lawyers for ABC,  how can we write a decision that won't adversely impact Dropbox, but still finds in your favor?  Right.  Although, is it not the case, and this has been my experience listening to oral arguments,  which I love to.  It's really fun.  Oye.org, O-Y-E-Z.org, and the Supreme Court now publishes them as well, is you can't always  tell what they're thinking from their questions.  Sometimes they're almost the opposite of what they're thinking.

Start time: 8605.24
End time: 8615.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes they're playing devil's advocate for some other people on the bench that they  want to convince.  So it's, you know, we can't really read a whole lot into their questions.  It's fascinating.

Transcript:  Look, I'm taking anything I can get from these guys.  Traditionally, the courts have not been the most technical.  True. But I'm surprised to the savvy, actually, in this case of the Supreme Court, they seem  to somewhat understand the issues here, whether they rule correctly.  I don't know. Do you think there's a correct ruling?

Start time: 8658.90
End time: 8689.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the correct ruling is that Aereo is not infringing  because they're and that this is not a public performance, right, because of the way they  designed their technology.  And if and if the cable industry has a real problem with this and if Congress agrees,  then they can rewrite the law so that this sort of thing is not legal.  But I think carefully examined how they could go about  pulling down over the air broadcast and that they came up with this  solution and that I think they're right.

Start time: 8690.24
End time: 8696.68

Well, one of the I think the cable companies, the  networks want retransmission fees from the cable companies.  They want them from Aereo.  Aereo said we're not if we lose, that's it.  We're we're we're closing the doors.  In fact, they did that in Denver  when they lost a case in Circuit Court.  Very interesting.  We live in interesting times. We do.
