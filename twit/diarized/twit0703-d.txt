End time: 457.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, let's see. I don't know where to begin. There's so many so many stories  This week I might start with with this  This is Scott Galloway who wrote another book that we've talked about the big four all about the four horsemen of the tech  apocalypse  He he has his predictions for 2019 for big tech and beyond he did something very brave  He went back and looked at his predictions last year on  And and degraded them. That's where that's what you do. If you're a professor is brave very brave  He thought Wayfair would crash. He was wrong  He thought Twitter snap and BuzzFeed would was it would be acquired. He was wrong  But he did a few things right. He said Amazon would surpass Apple and value  No one would have thought that and that was partly because the of a stock market bust as opposed to the growth of Amazon  But maybe Amazon his point

Start time: 457.70
End time: 490.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  His point with the Amazon was that it's got much greater growth potential and Apple does  Because Apple has to top out when there's a phone in every pocket and they don't have a successor to that whereas Amazon  Has plenty of room to grow in e-commerce like in the US  Amazon's only reaching like 5% of the total retail market and  They might have 50% of online business, but that's still only 5% of the overall retail turnover in the US  So they've got so much more room to grow. There's no way they're not going to be bigger than Apple eventually

Start time: 491.20
End time: 496.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not the reason why Amazon stock doubled last year. It's because of AWS because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Second horse completely accidentally, right? Yeah. Hey, we've got some extra servers in the closet Jeff. What should we do with those?

Start time: 507.00
End time: 510.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the second horse is gonna be way bigger than the e-commerce business

Start time: 511.58
End time: 557.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Way bigger and then also everyone's always talking about how they're getting into advertising and things like that  But like if you think about it like there's I mean, obviously I'm not saying anything  Anybody doesn't know but Amazon has their fingers in so many pies that like so, you know  Everybody's doing a streaming thing Amazon's head streaming video for forever  But you know the the insane advertising thing that they could do is if they release an ad support  I think they already do through through twitch or something  And ad supported streaming video play  Well, the ads could be tailored to things that you've already bought in your Amazon history to things that you've looked at but haven't bought yet  So like they they could potentially they they have so many potential huge things they can tap actually to that point

Start time: 558.78
End time: 594.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scott and again, this is talking about last year's predictions  He said Amazon Media Group would surpass the revenue of Twitter and oath  What he didn't predict is that oath would be renamed Verizon media group, but he was  But he was right about revenue. He says in at the beginning of the year Morgan Stanley predicted  Amazon's media group would have a revenue of four and a half billion. It probably is closer to 11 billion  So yeah, even media is doing well for Amazon. Let's look at his predictions though for 2019  Snap is the walking dead. I think that's pretty obvious or no

Start time: 595.28
End time: 630.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think snapchat will survive. I think I think snap was the walking dead  But if Facebook merges and this is another news article, which maybe we'll cover a bit  They had an article in New York Times. They got a scoop New York Times got a scoop on Facebook saying that  Facebook wants to merge Instagram  WhatsApp and the Facebook Messenger program into one if that happens  then snapchat will be very popular because  Facebook will not will screw that up and drive customers into the arms of snapchat very interesting  Yeah, cuz Facebook's notorious for screwing stuff like that up as soon as Zuckerberg gets involved in something it gets screwed up. Yeah

Start time: 631.82
End time: 636.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the theory there is by Twitter Google by Twitter and snap. I

Start time: 637.72
End time: 639.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been saying that for the last five years

Start time: 640.68
End time: 657.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think so. They've just been waiting for all they've been waiting for Twitter to get cheap enough to buy  I think I think I said once Twitter's at 12. They're not even close to 12 right now. It's gone way up  But once it gets to 12, I think then I think Google pulls the trigger Galloway predicts Twitter will be cut in half in 2019

Start time: 659.02
End time: 667.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mostly because of bots foreign agents, you know all of all of the crap on Twitter  I think that's a fair prediction, but I've been saying that for years to

Start time: 670.92

Transcript:  Doesn't do content it doesn't Google can't be a media company and Twitter Facebook snap they're all media companies

Start time: 677.32
End time: 690.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google can't buy them and won't Twitter Twitter really isn't a media company though  They are trying to be but they're really a data company  They just don't know it yet. And so I think it doesn't matter Google's getting nailed in the EU

Start time: 691.16
End time: 721.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For antitrust for screwing over the local press all that stuff, right?  And if they were to buy Twitter that European Union would be down on them so hard that it wouldn't matter Twitter for snap  Facebook their publishers they're absolutely content creators  Their platforms are all about stealing content from other people and publishing it as repackaging it as content that they produce  Google's can't do that  And if it does it will die it will instantly be subject to an antitrust action in the EU and then shortly after that in the

Start time: 721.14
End time: 728.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ultimately though they're all in the same business, which is collecting data for sales, right? I mean, that's really the business  It's just a matter of how you get that data

Start time: 729.46
End time: 742.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the business Twitter. I do think Twitter is a Twitter is a real-time data business  I do agree with you Greg though in that most people don't understand that I think Twitter barely understands it

Start time: 742.42
End time: 758.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem. Frankly Twitter's got the worst management ever  Dude well, they don't understand what to do with it, right? Or is it just did you read just hard?  Did you read the article? It is hard or see that he published this week. Yeah, Jack and he was

Start time: 759.40
End time: 797.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy is insane. The guys are nutcase. He's going on about oh, we've got to do this  And you know, I met Mark Zuckerberg and we killed a goat and then we ate it and you know  Blubber buddy go like this is not how the CEO of a major media company a major company acts like, you know  We've seen Elon Musk come on hinge now. We're watching Jack Dorsey turn into our fruit loop  Zuckerberg's clearly losing his control over at Facebook. He's just like oh, I don't know what to do  I'm gonna just say stuff and see what happens and it's all just going bananas, right?  It's really funny watching these tech company CEOs all just blow up because they don't know what it's like to have a bad day I

Transcript:  Oh, you guys are too polite. Just jump in

Start time: 809.38
End time: 865.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, you know if you're Elon Musk if you're  Mark Zuckerberg if you're Jack Dorsey the world is changing around them so quickly and their companies when they get big  It's just hard to change big companies quickly and they are struggling really really hard with it  you know everything great has been created by small teams and  usually gets eventually screwed up by big teams and  Even the iPhone, you know  I'm sure you guys have seen the stories and I've talked to people that were on the original team iPhone team  It was about 20 people that that made the iPhone  and and  You get in the position where when it's big enough you play not to lose and and that's what we're seeing now is  They're playing not to lose. It doesn't work at internet scale  It doesn't work at internet speed and these are problems that are are a little unique to the history of business and and it's not

Start time: 868.24
End time: 871.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop apologizing for them. Those people are all idiots  I

Start time: 874.00
End time: 932.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say this great I'll say this I think it's pretty clear Mark Zuckerberg was just incredibly lucky. Yeah, right. He's not smart  incredibly lucky  Jack Dorsey who knows why Jack Dorsey is running Twitter mostly because Ev and company just said I have screw it. I got enough money  Look at and then Google  Larry and Sergey incredibly lucky for a long time didn't even know what they had  some adult supervision came along  Probably Eric Schmidt, but somebody came along and said dudes  You got this mountain of data. This is really valuable stuff. They went  Yeah, and this is a data business. That's again. I think lucky and I don't know who you'd point to to be the genius  there  Actually, I have a theory but but I don't want to get too much in the weeds on that one  In most cases these guys are like Mark Cuban they just are lucky sons of guns  They got in the right place at the right time and they cashed in

Start time: 933.46
End time: 938.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark Cuban was smart enough to cash in and get out and be a billionaire professionally. Yeah, that's right

Start time: 939.10
End time: 943.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His life is a lot easier, right? Cuz he didn't have this delusion that he was a genius

Start time: 944.18
End time: 951.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've said that many times that Mark Cuban is quietly the most brilliant man ever to be in the tech industry because he got out

Start time: 951.16
End time: 963.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the thing with by the way if I'd gotten somebody bought to it for me like yahoo  But broadcast calm from and I got a billion dollars. I would have gotten out too  So just give me some I would have been just as brilliant

Start time: 964.36
End time: 989.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the thing with Jack is and that and that article cuz he Jack's on a publicity tour again  And this happened the same I was on it the last time I think it was I was on the show  There was the Zuckerberg piece that got all the controversy like, you know, I know I  Know PR people think that this is a good idea. We need to get him out there. He was on the Bill Simmons podcast. We you know  I'm a human like you fellow humans. Yeah

Start time: 990.44
End time: 994.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's usually that's that's Mark does that too. I am a human like you

Start time: 996.08
End time: 1064.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jack's flavor of that is that he I killed a goat  No, no, because actually he was trying to differentiate himself. He said he had a salad when right  That was a little weird, but that's the thing is so Jack  He he sometimes comes off as like almost the most Zen and like evolved tech CEO out there  but then other times and most times it's like well or he's just a flake and  So like, you know when he I think there was a tweet this weekend about him talking about his three-day fasts and things like that  And I can't remember because I'd give her a plot or a quote obviously  But as somebody on Twitter said well now I understand why Twitter is the way it is because the CEO is starving all the time  Talk to people that work at Twitter  The thing that they always say is when they go to other companies  They can't believe that decisions actually get made in a logical  Timely manner because at Twitter the culture is just like, you know  It takes them three years to decide to go beyond the the character limit on tweets and and it's just like you can be  You can be Zen and you can be philosophical but also you need to be decisive. I don't want to imply that these people are flawed

Start time: 1065.12
End time: 1097.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying that I'm saying they're normal and  That unfortunately they got very lucky and what happens when you become a billionaire is you think that you you suddenly your mind gets  twisted and you think you did it and you are somehow Godlike and  The problem is that the problems that these companies face are very difficult  Normal, it's not it's not an easy thing to do and we can see this is the history of technology companies from day one  The one person that I think might be a God. I'm not sure is Jeff Bezos

Start time: 1099.50
End time: 1108.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mmm, for sure. He no mostly Jeff Bezos hired people under him  So he set up a process so that the way that Amazon works is he created a management structure

Start time: 1108.68
End time: 1123.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was smart mostly him that was smart, right?  I mean the whole pizza principle of don't have that you can't have more feed with two pizzas  The whole idea of writing instead of making pitches for stuff writing the press release  I think he did some very very smart things

Start time: 1123.78
End time: 1130.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a good one  The second one was he swindled the investors into convincing them not to take a profit that only worked for a little while though

Start time: 1130.66
End time: 1138.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember he could no longer go back to the the capital markets around about  2,000 and he had to start to turn that profit knob a little bit

Start time: 1139.34
End time: 1148.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what is those? Those are the two innovation now? The challenge is I would never work for Amazon because those people are  Used like slide. That's another bright thing that you did

Start time: 1167.10
End time: 1220.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was gonna use the the pyramids analogy or whatever  But but okay so to bring it full circle though and to say that Bezos is probably the closest to genius is so that okay  Even if he doesn't come up with AWS himself, like we're saying he put up, you know  Look at what Google's been trying to do moonshots for how long now they know they're a one-trick advertising pony  They know that's not really changing the world is and they can't do it  And right and the same thing when you see Facebook trying to get into hardware and you see, you know  Even Twitter doesn't even try Apple's apples like what's next? No idea  So Amazon has in place a system that hey, you know Jeff this thing over here  You know, we've got this these spare computer cycles and things like that  Do you think there's a business here and there's a mechanism in place for them to go explore that and then when it works to then  Actually execute that's actually the key anyone can come up with great other business ideas  But then to execute on turning that into your next great business

Start time: 1225.22
End time: 1233.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Taxes he was able to use that to fund those things  So literally what he did was instead of paying a you know paying shareholders a dividend we know he would punt on all these startups

Start time: 1234.44
End time: 1246.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what did he what did he do that was genius?  He got these investors got him to give him millions of dollars plowed every penny of profit into what distribution says  Gross and that was the right move

Start time: 1248.60
End time: 1273.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gutsy move right? Well, yes and no, there's two things they do one is they as we've already pointed out as they continue to innovate and  Develop new business ideas  so they  built distribution centers because the freight companies couldn't do it for them or the handling companies couldn't do it for them and getting the  Goods closer to the customer blah blah blah and now they're buying planes and now they're they've looked at using drones to do home deliveries now and they  Doing robot cars

Start time: 1274.42
End time: 1294.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With all of those warehouse and with all that distribution  They did the genius thing of allowing third parties onto that platform since hey, we already have this here  Anyway, right there is more money made by Amazon from the third parties that are on the Amazon platform than Amazon  It's not even close this day and age but that's that Amazon sells itself exactly

Start time: 1294.58
End time: 1305.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the secret to that platform is that you the people using the platform must get more profit than you get from it yourself  That's okay. And that is where you get if you that's the whole key the

End time: 1331.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference between Amazon and everybody else is they know what business they're in, right?  We're talking about the problems with all these other companies. They don't really know what business they're in. And so this is funny  It's a bunch of poor podcasters talking about

It was not Larry  It was not Eric Schmidt  It was this guy who probably most people don't know is how variant he is today to this day the chief economist at Google  He wrote the seminal papers at the end of the last century that said here's where we have value  Here's how we can capitalize on this value  if you want to know more about why Google took that pivot because it's interesting I  Interviewed Shoshana Zuboff about her book surveillance capitalism in the book  She quotes Larry giving a speech in 1998 about Google saying we could never take advertising  Because that would taint the search product we have to stay above that  That was Larry and Sergey did not that's in their original paper the that's right. That's in the paper PhDs for ya  It was Hal Varian who came along and said look first of all  There's been a stock market crash  We better find a way to make money fast because the investors are getting itchy and here's how we do it  So maybe Hal Varian deserves a credit not well known and here that's where Greg you're right  Just keep your what is it hide your light under a bushel?

Sorry last thing on Amazon, you know knowing what business they're in  You know, they are they figured out  You know over the last especially five years that the business their business of the future is  delivering things  To people delivering goods and delivering bits, right even  Just electronic stuff and making micro  Transactions off of every single one of them, right?  And so that is why the future you know, they are already, you know owning  more and more of the future and where it's headed and  The thing that could hold them back is if you know  They're gonna run into some of these same problems that some of the other companies are  But they know what business they're in and they know, you know use that to make the decisions  I think a lot of these other companies Twitter Facebook  to an extent Google Google still sometimes is  You know reaching and trying to figure things out  Is that you know, they're still not quite sure what the future  you know could be or how big they could get or  What are the most important aspects of what they do for their customers?

This is an interesting prediction will spin off AWS to reduce any trust concerns  Is it inevitable? Yeah.

Start time: 1660.04
End time: 1694.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the simple fact is AWS is still only earning about six to eight billion a quarter  So it's still tiny but it's got massive growth potential  So for example, Cisco makes 12 to 13 billion dollars a quarter and AWS is only half the size of Cisco  HPE does eight billion dollars a quarter and AWS is tiny but  AWS has mammoth growth potential and it's actually driving change in the market  So if they float that off it could be as much as 60% of the value of Amazon today  And so you're gonna get that cash and then you can put it back into AWS and he can make AWS blow up like a nuclear  Bomb, it's like becoming critical mass

Transcript:  No, I think it's the only good business they have these other businesses are so dependent on so many different things fuel  Margin, you know, the margins are terrible, you know AWS is the only really great business they have  I think it's more likely they spin off the e-commerce business into something that you know  Low margin business that but the future of that business is delivering electronic goods and all of it is through is through AWS

Transcript:  There's there's a lot more to talk about  As you could see a fiery panel today and it's usually when Greg Farrow is here  He fires them up Greg Farrow from the packet pushers Network Jason Heiner from CBS interactive tech Republic  He's EIC there and  Brian McCullough from tech memes ride home  podcast internet historian and  Our show today brought to you by you were talking about mattresses  Casper Casper we love our Casper Casper is an online premium mattress retailer  They invented this whole idea of that. Well, you know, this is where Silicon Valley really is good  they look for  Inefficiencies in markets and and and the guys who founded Casper said look, this is crazy  A company makes a mattress then they sell it through a showroom that marks it up a hundred percent or more  To an end user. This is crazy  We could sell direct and cut out the middleman and sell great mattresses for much less money, but then  Good thinkers that they are they said well  There's one little problem with that people want to go to a showroom and lie on a mattress not that that's a good way  To test a mattress. I could tell you I've many a mattress. I've I've gone to the showroom  Lane on it lied on it  And what is it Carson you went to Harvard lay on it line lane lane on it you you laid on it  I laid on it chickens lay an egg, but people lie on mattresses  Anyway, whatever it is  I've gotten the wrong mattress more than once by doing that  So what Casper said is we're gonna give you a hundred days or maybe it's better to say a hundred nights  With this mattress at any time in the first hundred days if it's not perfect  We will come and get it. We will take it away. We'll refund you every penny that solved the problem  The original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with just the right sink  But also bounce it's I it's hard to describe  That's why you have to lie on it or lay on it or do whatever you do with it  Actually, I do both because you want it to you want it it it gives to the your knobbly parts  But it's firmly supporting your back. Is that a way to describe it?  I don't know you have to try it and and I really have to say this is true  Yes, it's breathable, which means you sleep cool and we know  From sleep experts sleeping cool is the key to a great night's sleep. You're gonna get long-lasting support  Long-lasting comfort from your mattress you buy a completely risk-free online. Here's our Casper  This is this is our second Casper  You we love it. It is an incredible mattress. They uphold the highest environmental production standards  They're made in the USA. They come in a surprisingly compact box, which is really great  We got one for my son's dorm room because he didn't like the mattress that was in the dorm  For obvious reasons so he was able to schlep it upstairs. It's great and it was so affordable after four years  We said you can leave it there. We'll give you a new one when you get your apartment Casper  Good, isn't that doesn't it make you want to just?  Get a Casper mattress today  You can save $50 towards select mattresses when you go to Casper  Casp er comm slash twit and use a promo code twit at check out Casper comm slash twit  Promo code twit to save $50 and select mattresses terms and conditions apply  Thank you Casper if I am well rested  You can thank Casper  I'm relaxed Greg will fire me up

Transcript:  So I do have one topic I want to raise reasonably early if I may this DNS thing, right? Yeah DNS flag day  So let me try and preface this this is going to get a little bit nerdy  So strap yourself in I'll try and keep it short for the people who aren't  Related to that. So this is the Internet Society. That is the body that is responsible for parts of the Internet  I'm making a fairly substantial change to the way that DNS works  So what's wrong with DNS?  There's nothing wrong with DNS over the years  We've changed the standards from DNS to a thing called enhanced DNS or eDNS. The standard was done  Seven four nine three, I think from memory  It's done like ten years ago  and what they did was the idea the original DNS had a maximum query size of 512 bytes in the packet and  That was no longer big enough when we went to unicode the data that was being jammed in the packet oversized the packet  So we created a thing called enhanced DNS or extended DNS and that allowed for a larger packet size now  That was fine  But all of the DNS servers on the Internet if you got a query from somebody who is using legacy DNS  They would tolerate your non eDNS query and respond back to you and say, okay  We'll give you some time to do the transition. Let me talk down to you because you have a server that stupid  Yeah, you know V1 kind of like V1 V2. Are there a lot of people not using eDNS now?  It's a very small number. It's like two to five percent  And they sort of got to the point saying look we can't move the DNS infrastructure on  We need to make changes to DNS like DNS over HTTPS. We need to make  Changes to the to increase the security, but we can't unless everybody's at least gotten away from the technology from 30 years ago  So they put a put a flag down and said on the 1st of February is  DNS flag day. We're gonna start the new version of bind which is what most people use  Will no longer support  DNS only if you make a query and you don't flag that I do not  So you've got to be able to support at least enough of the extensions to say I don't understand  Eds give me a DNS response if you make an invalid or a legacy query  These servers will no longer respond and it's gonna be a bit like a rot  You know like a link rot thing we used to have years ago  They used to worry about what happens when all of these shorteners used to disappear and then all these links would be dead  Some people are gonna not be able to access some things  So if you own a domain get out there start running a test go to DNS flag day comm and put your domain in and find  out if it's gonna pass the tests and  You don't have to rush it. You know, it's not an apocalyptic thing  It's just something that's gonna start having an impact as some users won't be able to work and it's mostly going to be  Companies who implement firewall appliances because a lot of the firewalls have these proxies and the DNS queries come in and then they go out  And if those haven't been kept up to date, there's a fair bit that they're where the problem is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Goes through hover. That's right. Now it's going to work because  They do to support the eDNS query and respond with legacy DNS answers. Sorry, so they're not  Broken as it says there you're going to work but high contacted hover and they said we're not gonna fix it  And if you don't like it leave why not?  Hey, I don't know that I believe that hover might be in a rent extraction mode  So the original company that it was a couple of years ago really innovative and really doing good things  Yeah, it would seem that whoever's running the business now just wants to haul all the profit they can out of it and do nothing

Transcript:  If you're using them as a registrar, but you've got your DNS somewhere else must be we have the DNS somewhere else  Yes, I have I have all of my domains registered at at or most of my domains at hover  But my DNS is most often hosted at cloud play. So I'll start migrating my domains away to cloud player in the next few weeks  Wow, just because their response was so bad. It was basically like so what we're not fixing it and if you don't like it go  Literally, that's that's the I can send you a screenshot. It's pretty amazing

Start time: 2349.24
End time: 2354.14

Again, I'm gonna make a promise to you  That they're gonna fix me see this doesn't have anything to do with DNS security, which is another issue entirely, right?

Start time: 2386.64
End time: 2420.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, DNS sec is quite different. I think DNS sec will likely never get traction  So DNS security is where we actually encrypt the client and the server X encrypt the sessions between them using a form of public  Cryptography, I suspect that we'll see DNS over HTTPS before DNS sec ever gets traction  Hmm so the idea of using DNS over  UDP and having its own protocol will probably fade away. In fact, I actually use a thing  On my iPhone. I use an app which lets me use DNS of HTTPS quad ones

End time: 2461.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DNS is effectively a little port comm I think is not does not go through hover goes through fast mail  My email provider so I think maybe fast mail needs to work on this too in their defense in both hovers defense and fast mails defense  It's not that it doesn't work. It's just not fully compliant  So that needs to be fixed is there is there going to be a flag day for full compliance

Start time: 2464.89
End time: 2506.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll just be a rot thing. So over time if the root service stop responding to  Legacy queries then eventually things just stop working and that's the only way we can move forward  they've been agonizing over it for some years and  They've basically realized that there are things we have to do with DNS  To move forward and we have to get to the point where we say right and they've been carefully met  And they've been carefully met, you know, this is all explained if you go to the blog post  There's all the data is there pointing you to source material explaining the whole thing in detail  So we just you know, check your domains you want to understand more hit the blog post go to DNS flag day dotnet  There's lots of information  And take some time to learn about it if that's the thing that you need to know how his primary business is as a registrar

Start time: 2506.38

Start time: 2525.33
End time: 2546.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and as I said fast mail which  also can do DNS and and so some of my  Some of my domains are DNS including Leo Laporte comm  for mail reasons, I think are  Hosted hover and they also show up as a problem. So I think let me try  Let me try some other ones. So that's an interesting issue

Start time: 2548.02
End time: 2557.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

So now you don't even have to have a cloudflare account to yes  Early access will be rolling out access to cloudflare register on stages based on factors like how long you've been a cloudflare customer  So it is not going to be available. This will be eventually a publicly available. It's super cheap, too

I think Greg you could explain this to me has allowed  spammers to use well-known domains  registered on go daddy  To put out  Like that is extortion spam. Did you get that one where you got an email saying?  I know your password it's and by the way, I've recorded you on a porn site  You might want to send me money or I'm gonna give this to all your friends  That's the one I got those twice in the last month. Yeah, and by the way, it scared me because it was a password  I had used many years ago. Yeah  So that's due to a flaw and go daddy and Brian Krebs discovered this one. I

Start time: 2675.20
End time: 2692.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think this I think the takeaway here is based on the evidence of the last five to ten years  You shouldn't be doing business with go daddy. They're a bunch of hopeless losers  I mean, we've just seen them do everything wrong consistently repeatedly over and over and over at this point  Why are they still in business? Are people stupid? Yeah, in fact

Start time: 2693.82
End time: 2735.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This this flaw this vulnerability was first written about in 2016 by Matthew Bryant  Mm-hmm  and  It basically allows somebody who has a go daddy account on the same domain name server as a big company  To send email out  From that big company's IP address thereby bypassing a lot of spam filters, which look at IP addresses to see  block that stuff bad stuff  so I don't know if go daddy's fixed that but that is a it first came to a light because  Somebody mailed a bomb threat from virtual firefox.com which is a Mozilla Foundation domain

Those babies were born and  He China says he he forged ethical review papers  recruited eight couples to participate in his experiment resulting in two pregnancies  One of the mothers gave birth to twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana. These are the first as far as we know  Humans born with their genes  CRISPR edited he had removed a gene  that supposedly would give these children a  better resistance to HIV  And other diseases smallpox, I think  But the problem with CRISPR gene editing is the side effects are unknown  Yeah, and while people have done this in the lab to rats and other things  It's the first time we know of that's you and this was a big storm  We talked about this it was unclear whether it really happened.

There should be a lot more  research there should be a lot more things done in labs before  You know, we put this in human beings. So that's the scary part.

Transcript:  Part of it is like some of the articles that I've read like people are suggesting that you know, this guy  Did this on his own was gonna promote himself and so not to be overly cynical  But like if China was the first to make some sort of CRISPR breakthrough  I feel like that they would have gotten behind it and like look at how Chinese technology and medicine is a so I'm  wondering if the problem here is that this guy was sort of a lone wolf that  Was trying to be a little too promotional because if he if he was a lone wolf  Was trying to be a little too promotional because if he if he wasn't and there was real legitimate breakthroughs  I don't feel like China would be throwing him under the bus like this.

Transcript:  I think there's two things here that we aren't considering one is  That the current research indicates that the use of the CRISPR technology is actually incredibly damaging to the genes themselves  So not only are you using CRISPR?  To target specific genes, but what's coming out is the evidence is that CRISPR is actually damaging entire gene structures, right?  so you may actually be causing more genetic defects than you're actually fixing and  So this is the reverse side of a breakthrough. The the reality starts to set in that there might be some downsides

Transcript:  um, the children are not being identified by the chinese government, but they said the chinese government says we are going to monitor them because  There is some concern about their long-term. Well, it's a great remember when dolly the sheep was the first cloned animal  These cloned sheep died very quickly because it turned out not only were they cloning the sheep. They were cloning their biological clock

Start time: 2972.70
End time: 3008.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  So the senescence was actually cloned at the same time  Yeah, I think I think the challenge here with the CRISPR stuff is they're actually attacking the germ line  So what that means if those children have genetic defects, they'll carry through into the children of those  Those but those babies and so they replicate down through the years and we don't  Want a situation perhaps where uh  uncontrolled use of CRISPR that is actually damaging to the germ line then gets fed into the gene pool that that is  Theoretically the end of the world type scenario. Yeah, so  Science wants to be careful about this

Transcript:  On the other hand if any country is going to do it you'd think it'd be the first would be the chinese  I guess that was your point jason, right is that you know?  There's there's also so many issues  I mean, it's not even the side effects not even let's say you could do it effectively without side effects  Then that raises a whole slew of other problems. Will it only be available to those who can afford it?  Will billionaires become yeah, will billionaires become a new species because they can afford their to have children that are smarter faster better  More more good-looking than everybody else  It's amazing how much you know science fiction of course has dealt with the

Start time: 3045.70
End time: 3082.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has been dealing with these issues for so long, right like um, I remember in deep space nine  in star trek d space nine where  Uh, they remember the doctor. Uh, it came out like about halfway through the series that he was genetically manipulated  He was kind of an under performer and he had this, you know genetic manipulation and turned him into kind of like this brainiac  And then of course, you know, jurassic park  It was like, you know the the whole you're so busy trying to figure out what's going on  The the whole you're so busy trying to figure out if you could that you didn't stop to think if you should  And which of course that was all about, you know gene manipulation and dinosaurs

We don't have any mechanism for this  It's fucking it's like figure out whether we should build a wall forget  Yeah  I mean this seems so beyond our capabilities and our understanding

Transcript:  history hat  history hat  Do you want to know the only reason that um atomic energy?  Uh was able to be regulated by the u.s. Government  Was because when they developed the bomb it was during wartime and so the president had special wartime powers, too  So the whole fact that the entire like atomic energy is an entire industry  But it's entirely regulated and controlled by the u.s  Government because it was during wartime and the president had wartime powers to make that happen had it been developed by private industry

I love uval noah harari the the philosopher from the  From israel who wrote sapiens and homo deus his newest is 21 lessons for the 21st century  And one of the things he's pointing out is as we're doing this kind of regression to nationalism  And it's happening in many countries worldwide this kind of nostalgic  Desire to close in it's happening in britain as you know, greg and it's happening in the united states  The problem with that is many of the problems that we have to deal with in the future are not national  But global you can't deal with climate change nationally. You can't deal with crisper  Nationally, it's going to take a global effort and in many cases countries are moving in the wrong direction  you know a country can't ban crisper and then expect it not to  Be used everywhere else  Right in fact nuclear nuclear weapons  Is a global issue not a national issue  Yeah, and the attempt to deal with it nationally is is fraught with peril as we well know  If they've got them and we have to have them

It's often two steps forward one step back  And you know in it's funny because one of the greatest examples of this is you know  China and u.s and their trade relations and all of that. We are so intertwined and interdependent  Um, you know on each other  commercially that it's ridiculous a lot of this thing is so much posturing and so much  You know really negotiation tactics in many ways from from both sides  Um, because it would be catastrophic to both the u.s and china to not have a really strong  Trade relationship. Oh, yeah, we've got that's just one example, right? It's just one example that promotes peace  I mean that's

Let me show you the video because it's a really cute little video  I wonder though when I look at this  If uh, this is the world we live in this is a little  little  Bot that's driving down the sidewalk  Watch out grandma  Here comes the amazon delivery bot  Uh, fortunately some of these  Sorry, go ahead. It's moving slowly, but I still makes me a little nervous. This clearly by the way is the desperate housewives neighborhood  Uh a phony neighborhood in uh in in hollywood  And then look she comes out. I don't know how she knew but the little bot was out there waiting  Its lid comes open. She gets her package. It closes the lid very slowly watch your fur pinching and then moves on is this  I understand why amazon wants to do this and is promoting this but is this at all viable?  So leo actually there's that  Okay, wait a minute one at a time. Let's start with brian. We'll go left to right brian. Go ahead

Yeah, I know  And so that if you have a thing no one go no one walks anymore  Right, there's that but then also so then think of what amazon is also doing is whole foods  And and and these sort of go stores or whatever  So what if 10 years from now amazon has you know your gas station just essentially becomes or your corner market or whatever?  Becomes this quasi way station for these tiny bots that go out and make the deliveries and not even that it doesn't even have to be  Just that you could think of what fedex and ups does  You know fedex goes to a certain like they have to go and the guy runs out and delivers the package whatever  No, the fedex truck could go to a certain location that the the algorithms are like a merv  For it would be like for 30 packages children going out.

These look like the robbies  I wonder if they're the same technology. Yeah, exactly. So so I don't know. Maybe robbie's doing it for them or something  They're little six wheels.

Transcript:  That's true that's true exactly right  I think one of the one of the questions was like what happens if just a couple of people come  You know a couple you have one of these running around at night a couple, you know thieves come they're like hey  Let's just pick this up thing up though in the back of our van  See what kind of packages are in there. I I guess there's like on the amazon one. There's some kind of alarm  Um that will go off if you try to pick it up or something  Um, so it's pretty interesting to think about but clearly this is happening already the robbie like I said, it's it's it was developed by these mit  Scientists, uh, it's been in use in the bay area for at least I I think the last at least almost two years now

I was just trying some things out  But you know and then the person the other side says look at this you broke my arm you are  I'm gonna come after you right right  So the the motto of move fast and break things actually causes damage and when people fight back  You shouldn't be surprised and go.

Thank you for trying jason  I really appreciate it, but I do have one more google story, which is the dutch the dutch surgeon  Who was formerly disciplined for medical negligence?  Has wanted illegal action to have google remove  Search results about her case  So her registration on the register of health care professionals was suspended by a disciplinary panel  After appeal it was changed to a conditional suspension. She is currently practicing as a result  But she says when you search for my name you find this  a website  Which contains an unofficial blacklist which mentions this she says it's a digital pillory  And she wants that removed the dutch data privacy watchdog agreed  Uh initially they said no  but uh  So she went to court and the court said no  She has a surge the surgeon has an interest in not indicating that every time somebody enters her name on a search engine  That she appears on this black list of doctors appears  Google's claim that most people would have difficulty finding the relevant information on the medical board's big register  Where records are publicly held?  The court didn't agree  What do you think the right to be forgotten final paragraph?

Start time: 4557.72
End time: 4578.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It basically said it's not up to google to make the decision about whether or not this happens  It's a society's decision and in particular. It's the medical board. So if you'd go to the last paragraph, you'll see the kicker. Yeah  And that's the point the point here is that google's become the judge and executioner  Um by putting this data online that's a very loaded way to put it

Start time: 4579.72

Start time: 4615.64
End time: 4633.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so the the point is is that the medical board found her to be the initial case said that she was negligent  The medical board later ruled that she wasn't but she's still listed on the site. Then can't go to the site  She can't why in outside the jurisdiction. Well, sorry lady, but this google's job is not to

That's not what they're saying  They're saying you have to modify the no you're wrong  They're saying that the algorithm has to be  uh  Responsible as opposed to merely reflecting what's on the internet  Absolutely, that's not what you want the minute you do that that every nation in the world comes to google  And says well, we want to reflect our point of view our point of view our point of view and that's exactly what should happen

Start time: 4673.56
End time: 4730.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's untenable algorithms are people. You cannot be nuts if a company can be a person nuts greg  the people that the company  Make the algorithms the algorithms of people and have to be treated as people  They have to be culpable and legally liable for anything that they do  And that's the only way we're going to move forward because that's how in medical science when they do an operation  They test it they validate it  It goes through a very long development process and then it's gradually released to make sure that it delivers the results you expect  And now we've got these jumped up young kids in silicon valley releasing algorithms that have these massive societal impacts and then  You want to go back to the middle ages?  My fault is just the I want to go back to the middle ages  What good is the internet if without a search engine that accurately reflects it if I had a car and it rolled down the street  And smashed into five vehicles causing damage and ran over a family of five. Who's who's who's reliable inept analogy?  It has nothing to do with it. It's the same. It's an algorithm just runs down the road and smashes in the car and runs over people

Start time: 4730.78
End time: 4737.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4819.16
End time: 4839.34

Transcript:  That's really interesting this are you trying to make a political statement snake about homelessness in amazon?  Wow  That was a very woke snake  Our show today brought  Brought to you by ero  My wi-fi router. I love it  I think we all know that the the old days of a single router somewhere in the  Living room talking to the whole house those days  Long gone. We're all using too many internet devices. We're all consuming too much content  You've got the kids watching youtube in the bedroom mom and dad watching netflix in the living room  You've got aunt sally in the kitchen. She's trying to download recipes. It's crazy  That's why you need an ero enterprise grade wi-fi system in your home  In just a few minutes you download the euro app on your ios or android device  It walks you through the process you set up the base station  And then you add the beacons and the and the app will help you place them the beacons just plug into the wall  What I love about the euro app is I can see how my network's doing  I can see how it's doing right now from here. I can see what devices are on it. I can pause  Individual devices or I can even say all of these devices that belong to our teenager  It's after 10 at night. Let's turn those off  I use euro plus 2 which filters all the bad stuff out catchers malware before it gets onto the computer  State of the art wpa2 protection. Eero has already announced they'll be going to wpa3  And they say they can do it in software, which is awesome  That's why it's so cool to have an euro because the euro is upgraded constantly. It gets better all the time  It's always secure. You don't have to remember to update it. It updates automatically  Not only do you have the latest features you have the latest security at all times  And I have to say when I got when I first got the euro I had some questions  And I called them up and they were great  They stayed on the line with me until I got the port forwarding work and all the stuff euros euro plus  Is actually the thing that put me over the top  So we've had the euros for a while in fact, I got the new euro system when they came out and sent my old system  I set it up for my mom  She's loving her euros  Euro plus is a simple  reliable security  Layer that defends your home devices against malware spyware phishing attacks and of course unsuitable content  That's why michael is not seeing anything adult because it's filtered off  The combination of euro and euro plus gives you complete protection for your network your devices for the people who use them  Euro plus offers the ability to block malicious and unwanted content across the entire network. I do that. I have that turned on  By checking the sites you visit against a database of millions of known threats euro plus prevents you from accidentally visiting malicious sites without slowing anything down  It automatically tags sites that contain violent illegal or adult content you choose what your kids can and cannot visit right in the euro app  I see everything. I know everything from the euro app how much bandwidth each device uses that's fascinating  I could do port forwarding. I can do reservations  I just think euro's great and man no more dead spots. No more buffering. It really works  Never think about wi-fi again. You'll get a hundred dollars. This is a great deal a hundred dollars  Off the base unit two beacons package. That's the starting point plus a year of euro plus  By visiting euro.com slash twit  Eero.com slash twit for 100 bucks off the base package plus a year of euro plus euro.com  slash twit  Eero.com slash twit and don't forget to check out with the offer code twit to get that special offer  I know you've been suffering with your wi-fi suffer no longer  with euro  This is like the rest mesh mesh with us  Yes  This is that story about the razor phone  That would explain a 1500 price tag if it had a foldable. This is not the phone  They'd be talking about this is the old razor which everybody had i'm sure all you guys had these  I think it's kind of interesting idea. So let's talk about foldable phones. There's one already available. They were at ces the royal  Yep, did you see that at ces?

Start time: 5400.56
End time: 5419.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, um and and seen it just published an article today called foldable phones are real here's every one we know about  Um, which is a a great look at everything that's that's there and coming the royal flex pay is is the first one  Um on the list and then of course, you know samsung galaxy huawei this week xiaomi this week

Start time: 5420.04
End time: 5434.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we saw the xiaomi ceo in a twitter  Now he said that was a concept phone, but that was a triptych a trifold phone that the two  Wings folded back  Boy, that's wild. There it is. There's there's the video. Yeah

Start time: 5435.76
End time: 5458.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I love the concept on this. Do you want this? Do you think this is a good thing?  No, this is partly why I wanted to talk about it. Um, not i'm not saying it's a bad thing  But i'm still trying to wrap my head around  Why i'd want it and not really why i'd want the ones that are probably going to come out in 2018 because those I don't  Think many of us really want  Um, because i'm worried that they're going to be janky that the

Start time: 5458.62
End time: 5461.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean exactly how many times can you bend that screen before it starts showing?

Start time: 5462.46
End time: 5486.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where on the hinge? Yeah, it's also really thick and you know, um, although we've liked bigger phones  It's sort of the the bigger phone thing has been a little weird. Um and encounter product a counterintuitive over the past  Few years. I think thicker is not something people want  You know that that just try to stick in your pocket something like that is not very, um practical

Start time: 5486.72
End time: 5504.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when when uh inner yeah when samsung showed its foldable phone in the kind of the sneak peek  And of course, we're gonna find out more on february 20th when they have their event  It looked pretty thick but he said oh, this is in a special case  So it's hard to say. Yeah, if thicker is not going to solve anything

Start time: 5505.92
End time: 5574.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if if I had a phone the size of my phablet today  and then somehow  It also could um kind of like the the xiaomi  Prototype piece  Um, if somehow it could you know, the screen can essentially double itself  When I was ready to sit down and read something or do some work or do some bigger typing or whatever  I mean we've there been an insatiable appetite for big screen phones, right?  Because you can they are more productive you can do more things with them once you have more screen  And so this is like the phablet run amok that this whole idea of uh,  Of the folding phone is really an extension of the phablet phenomenon and i'm just trying to wonder  And this is why i'm sort of throwing it out to you all of like  What does that give me it just assuming we get to that world where today's you know, um  Phablet, you know this one or this one can double its screen size  How compelling is that it's obviously

Start time: 5575.36
End time: 5618.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's obviously doubling the screen size when you need it or want it, right?  And it's it almost goes back to the argument of ipod versus cell phones. So why not make them both the same?  So why have a tablet and and and a smartphone?  That's the most obvious thing but you know what? Here's the reality  Forget about what we would maybe have a use for it is  The reason these are coming is because no one's been able to differentiate a phone for at least five years now, right?  They all look exactly identical. And so guess what?  I I bet people are going to have a reasonable amount of success because people are going to be like, you know what?  Look at me. I have the one phone in my friend circle that looks different than all y'all's phones

Start time: 5619.80

Start time: 5623.04
End time: 5643.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that's very important. Um, not necessarily in the u.s. Uh,  But in some cultures phones are status items and if you've got a unique  item  That actually is part of a cultural status thing where you want to be able to show off that you've got that  I believe that to be the case in certain parts of china and uh, other places in asia

Start time: 5643.24
End time: 5646.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5647.33
End time: 5660.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right  Might be something that only lasts for six to twelve months before you you move on to something else  You know fashion type item and apple's been trying to sell phones as fashionable fashion accessories for some time  It's kind of the size of my uh

Start time: 5670.58
End time: 5691.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the second part is that for some people smartphones are their computers and indeed a television  and a book  and if you want something that does all of those things then perhaps there's a trade-off there, so  This is a case of I think testing the market to see if the idea can let  Catch on and if it does they can then iterate around it. So i'm gonna make a prediction

Start time: 5692.06
End time: 5704.12

Transcript:  Go ahead brian there's there's been a lot of wagers that going on here. So I don't know  I don't know that I like that one at all. You like that. You want a foldable who here wants a foldable phone  I don't have you seen those articles though about how um in in the indian, uh cell phone market  That that the I can't remember. Uh, boy, you know, but the the amount of hours that they spend on video the point that  That greg just made about how?  Um, like so if it's your entertainment devices if this is how you are consuming all of your entertainment and your media  So that then it fits in your pocket and you you you do your daily business and then at night  I'm not saying it replaces your tv, but you maybe live in a country where you don't have a big screen tv or whatever like so  Why wouldn't you want to fold unfold this thing and have a bigger screen?

Transcript:  Right, right. All right. So if you are well in fact in japan before uh smartphones even they've had  Because that's a big issue in japan  Larger phones that did a lot more right? Am I wrong on that? That was a very popular  pre-smartphone product in uh, japan

Start time: 5775.92
End time: 5796.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um, I just think it's also to do with the the use of emojis and the the characters  Instead of using uh letters like we do they use pictograms  Yeah, so the larger screens  As I understand it and please I don't want to pretend that i'm an expert here  But from what i've researched and read is that they tend to go for the larger screens because it makes more sense

Start time: 5796.68
End time: 5810.22

Start time: 5818.92
End time: 5844.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's because we were entering data with t19 right the oqo. I remember that too  Yeah today you can do it a lot more with voice  You know some people are turning to voice as an alternative to the keyboards  And a lot of people have gotten better with the alphanumerics like that touch sensitive screens make more sense  So I think there is some transition there. There's no innovation as such just a transition  As we do make marginal improvements on them. This is 2009. This these phones were leo

Start time: 5846.36
End time: 5861.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This could be innovation is what i'm saying  Like i'm i'm with you in the sense that like it's probably unreliable right now or whatever  But like are you saying that it wouldn't be innovation to have?  Different screen sizes depending on when you needed it and your use case

Start time: 5862.34
End time: 5905.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me think about that. Uh, if it's so we there's some  Conditions, obviously it can't be thick  So if it's not much bigger if it's something like an existing phone if we can get there if we can get there  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I I grant you that so the first generation probably be wanky and this is based on amoled screens that can reliably bend and unbend  Without damage and showing, you know wear of any kind. Okay  But there's some I don't see myself opening it up to be honest with you I feel like  Uh a galaxy note 9 or the iphone 10s max  That's that's fine. That gets the job done. Maybe it maybe i'm just not  open-minded enough

Start time: 5907.48
End time: 5928.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of so so there's also ergonomic  issues with them too or not i don't know if ergonomic is the right way to say it, but you know how  With these tablets, yeah, yeah usability. Thank you. You you know those tablets where you flip them over  and  When you have to hold them and you feel the keys on the back. I hate that I hate that I have a yoga

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't either I can't stand  You know any ergonomics that you end up doing that and and I feel like that's my worry with these foldable phones  If this thing folded over and then okay, i'm always holding it where i've got the screen is on the back  But it's not on unless I flip it over  It's like i'm not gonna like that I I know because of the ways that these tablets, you know

Start time: 6099.34
End time: 6125.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's gonna start it'll be a slow gradual rollout probably  Five to fifteen years what depending on where you are in the world that long  Oh, yes, they haven't even finished the 5g standard yet. I'll be dead by then so you won't see any purchase  Yeah  Well, I mean actually I probably will be i'm just saying and really the only thing 5g is going to give you is more bandwidth

Start time: 6126.94
End time: 6133.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Yeah, it does it does can change things you didn't have until  High-speed internet was widely available in homes. You didn't have netflix. You didn't have  Any of this right this is it does change things

Start time: 6145.62
End time: 6174.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes bandwidth has  The key thing that people miss about bandwidth is it has two key scientific properties  One is volume how much you can fit down the pipe, right? And the second one is speed, right?  So yes greater bandwidth not only lets you put more down the pipe  It also lets you put the the traffic down the pipe faster, right?  So yes, you do get improved speed latency. You also get more capacity  So whenever you talk about bandwidth two vector argument, not a single vector

So a lot of what you read about this is telcos going  Oh if we could do this we could build a service that charges more money if we could do that we could do  You know or we could and and I think just like 4g we saw what actually is quibi short form. Yeah

Start time: 6254.66
End time: 6266.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if they start to communicate with each other you can't guarantee that you're going to get data from the neighboring car  So you can't rely on that  What if the neighboring car is not compatible with your standard or it's faulty in some way 5g is promising, right?

Transcript:  That and that is absolutely a load of bunk. There's not one autonomous car maker that cares about 5g  Only the 5g people care about economist cars because they think they can sell them a premium enhanced service  And none of the car makers are talking to the 5g people about using that service

Start time: 6286.52
End time: 6305.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not bunk. It's just one of those visions that the  that has a lot of steps that has to that have to be  dealt with before the reality is there but  You know the combination of edge computing a lot of people talk about the end of traffic congestion because you have

What's your intent?  We don't we have to infer what the intent of the guy ahead of us and the guy behind us is but a car could

Transcript:  Theoretically query other vehicles, right? So one of the biggest things that happened at ces and very quietly  was  Qualcomm has this technology  Called  Vehicle to everything it's c2vx  It is a standard that combines  Vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure  technology  Ford came on stage and said we're going to put this across our entire range of vehicles in 2022  Which means if ford does it the others are going to follow and do the same  So this enables literally vehicles to see around corners, right?  There are 1.3 million auto deaths  globally every year still  Which you know when we look back a long time from now, it's going to be pretty horrifying to us. Yeah  Yeah, that we that we just that we've lived with this every year  So so this technology that the vehicles can talk to the roads the vehicles can talk to buildings the vehicles can talk to other vehicles  They can talk to lights they can talk to stop signs. They can talk to all of it. So  You know literally you can see around corner you're about to go through a a light or or a stop sign  That that's green. Sorry a light that's green somebody else has a red light coming  But you can't see them because of the building and they're about to run that red light  And then they're going to t-bone you and you know, those side impact accidents are the ones that are most fatal  Well with the roads, you know communicating with you with the building communicating perhaps even the other car communicating  Um, that is what enables that car to then stop and and not get hit

Start time: 6427.64
End time: 6447.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By that vehicle and imagine I mean isn't that kind of in a way the promise of iot in general is as you as computing  Moves to the edge  Communication is going to be vital the ability for all of these smart  Entities in our life to communicate rapidly and effectively with one another. I agree with you greg  We've got to get a standard but it looks like this is yeah, there's a lot of work

End time: 6468.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not belittling what greg's saying because there's a lot of work that needs to be done before any of these things happen  but I but I do think that the um  that the possibility is not um pie in the sky or  Something that's not possible and there are as you point out very significant benefits 1.3 million deaths

Transcript:  You're not going to use 5g for that you're going to use local wi-fi or local communication systems  Local communication systems they're going to be a micro cell and it's not going to belong  It's going to belong to the local traffic company or the local traffic agency or the town or whoever operates the traffic lights  It's not going to be part of the 5g network. Why would I pay a telco to run this?  I can just do it in my traffic light with an antenna on top

Start time: 6520.28
End time: 6543.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, I mean and the future networks are likely a combination of you know  5g is going to cover a lot more places with a lot better bandwidth, you know much cheaply much more cheaply  but  you know part of the future too is going to be combinations of still things like white spaces and  You know other types of technology where we still we still have a lot of work to do on some of this last mile

Start time: 6544.34
End time: 6557.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of these things that they're talking about in 5g. We had before g they were trying to talk about small cells  They were going to talk about  Mobile base stations and blah blah blah and none of them turned up  So and there's no reason to think that anything changed this time around

Start time: 6558.14
End time: 6580.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I wouldn't say none of them changed. I think a lot. I mean the the 3g to 4g bump was, you know  3 to 5x speed bump that was meaningful that led to new businesses that nobody ever anticipated  Before you know that jump happened and you know with 4g to 5g  We're talking a 10x to 100x bump and so that's going to enable all kinds of no

Start time: 6580.50
End time: 6610.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've already agreed with you that bandwidth gives us better speed and better volume and better latency, right?  Because bandwidth is a function of speed and capacity  But the point is is that other people are trying to sell us network slicing or value added services around small cells or localized cells  Now that's going to give you greater coverage  Inside of a building and increase the bandwidth, but the only thing it all does is increases the bandwidth. It doesn't  Suddenly give the the radio waves magical powers to read your mind or something like that  It's just sure

End time: 6628.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Greg one thing I will agree with you 100% on is I cannot imagine how much we've had to suffer  Because the telecos refuse they rage rage rage against this idea that they're just dumb pipes  Yeah, they don't want to be how long do we have to suffer before they learn that lesson? Yeah. Yeah

I thought that was super interesting too. Yeah, why do they why don't they say facebook?  weird  anyway, uh  This is mike isaac who's well sourced  San francisco writer for the new york times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because remember the whole idea is this year  all of these founders left  facebook instagram whatsapp founders  And we always read that it was because there were clashes with zuck and right and and and and  They didn't want their products integrated in this way. They didn't want to join the borg and so either  That's a leak  From someone that's going  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 6772.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're in a climate now where if you're going to do it do it now  Oh, right, right the u.s. Government has other fish to fry  So to speak, what would they buy? What's worth buying anything? That's a threat?  Nothing at the point nothing at this point  Maybe they're big enough. They don't need to

Start time: 6772.82

Start time: 6779.68
End time: 6805.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it poses a threat if something's got a large user base  That's what they've done. Basically each of these services has billions of users if you combine them and by the way, this is  not confirmed by facebook, this is  Mike's reporting but if that it happens that that you have a behemoth now of users  And by the way, this is good for users  I would be thrilled if I could use whatsapp to talk to facebook messenger and use instagram to talk to whatsapp

Start time: 6806.68

Transcript:  Yeah, and fair enough by the way another good thing for end users  Zuck according to this article is going to insist on end-to-end encryption for all three  That's a good thing. Yeah, and that in face of australia and others who say you can't do it

Start time: 6826.22
End time: 6843.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's also so what you're saying there is you've got to remember too that facebook messenger has end-to-end encryption, but it's not  Um safe or or private encryption is just end-to-end encryption. Yeah, facebook still has access to the keys as does whatsapp  Right. Yeah, but whatsapp is actually end-to-end so that they're using signal into the mess

Start time: 6843.94
End time: 6845.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6847.06
End time: 6889.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, okay, can't get into the data of whatsapp  So that's why they can't monetize it and put ads against it  So the fear is it's not that facebook messenger will come up to the better level of encryption  It's more likely they're going to take the whatsapp and take it down to facebook  And that also solves a few things because the give to the governments might be  Oh mr. Government, we're merging them together. Please don't antitrust us and break us up  A better view inside the content. Yeah, we will give you legal intercept legal and lawful intercept. Sure  There you go. And if they did that then the governments are going to be like, oh  But as I went I told my daughters I was talking to my daughters about this today and they just went like  We just stopped using snapchat. Sorry. We just stopped using  Whatsapp and instagram and find something else

Start time: 6890.12
End time: 6942.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that this is a step toward them trying to bring them together  clearly  um, and and the number one reason behind it is is likely because facebook  Is just dead in the water under with people under 30  um, and whatsapp and instagram are not right, uh, but  You know facebook to all of those users. They're allergic to facebook, right? Facebook is the  The network that my parents and my uncles and aunts and grandmas on right and so  They don't they don't want to be there  I think to to you know to the point that I think if you do that the users will flee and go somewhere else  and and that's what uh  You know facebook as a brand is is essentially already a ticking time bomb because young new users and young users  which is why

We need your information for operation and security  But but but you control whether we use it for advertising people consistently tell us rights mark  That if they're going to see ads they want them to be relevant that means we need to understand their interests  and you know  We don't sell that to anybody because well, that's how we make money  We have a strong incentive to protect people's information from being accessed by anyone else  They don't do a very good job of it, but we have a strong incentive of it  Um, what do you think this is obviously aimed at?  both governmental  Regulators in the us and in europe right because now number one

Transcript:  He's not gonna he's not gonna publish this in the new york times because he hates the new york times now  But number two everyone at davos is more likely to read it in the wall street  davos  And then it's good  so then this ties into what we were just talking about is because if he sees regulation coming and he's  Working the refs and then you can do the old microsoft thing of like well a year from now  If you try to have me break off instagram or whatever like as we're saying  Um, it's it. Well, no, they're all one code base. We can't do that. They're they're completely integral  But here's the other thing and i'm gonna totally quote the person that turned me on to this  Sarah fryer said that remember zuck still likes the real identity part  Of social media, which I do too be honest with you  And well, but also if you're selling ads against someone's real life a lot easier. Yeah  So twitter doesn't know who the hell you are, right? So, okay number one this solves a lot of problems, right? So number one  Governments were we're being nice and and blah blah blah and also  by the time you actually bring the hammer down on us our code base is unified and  Also, it's easier for advertisers. They don't have to spend on several different platforms. It's one platform, but then  That's the bottom line is that he he's chopping off  As we know he bought the threats to his business, okay  But it's still not the pure business  So if facebook as was just being said  Is not where the kids are at or where the growth is at or whatever the problem that they still needed to solve was they had  Created their well-oiled business model  but these other  Arms of the business were not in that perfect business model. So boom chop that off and now you're you're going to be  integrated into the sort of you know slicing and dicing  Selling ads against every interest and thought that you ever had in your head that that facebook has done  So it doesn't matter if everyone leaves facebook because boom they're gonna fix that

Domiciles itself in singapore or indonesia just to get away from the u.s. Government and being harassed all the time  So  If if i'm going to be harassed by the u.s. Government and it's going to try and regulate me  And that hasn't even started yet though, by the way

Kara says this is what he's really saying. We're old now  We big now it came from my one really good idea aol sucked and I could do better and I did  Now the noise has reached me up on billionaire mountain so i'm gonna have to pretend I care  No rich person  No rich person is going to pay too much for this muffler  Um social media service and poor people aren't going to pay us at all because they apparently don't have any money  So everyone will have to endure the ads we shovel out and stop griping because free ain't free people  People consistently tell me if they're going to see ads they want them to be relevant  Kara says we have a lot of data a lot so much  Especially about spanish gardeners, which is by the way  For some reason mark mark brings up people who like pages about gardening and live in spain as one of the categories  Yeah  The internet also mark writes allows us far greater transparency and control over what ads you see than tv radio or print  Kara says sure we give you tools to control the ads you see but they're akin to the instructions  You got to program your vcr back in the day  Thus the modern day version of a blinking night you never fix  It's a yeah, she's got a takedown.

Transcript:  So mark wrote for us technology has always been about putting power in the hands of as many people as possible  If you believe in a world where everyone gets an opportunity to use their voice  And an equal chance to be heard where anyone can start a business from scratch  Then it's important to build technology that serves everyone. That's the world we're building for every day  And our business model makes it possible  Kara says  The real power is in the hands of one person which would be me. I am founder. I am chief executive  I control 60 of the stock that matters. I control the board. So stop complaining, especially you spanish gardeners  The end  You're right. I didn't read that.

Transcript:  Yeah, she's uh, she's doing a great job  And as she says that yes, let's not forget that for all our criticism of facebook  Let's remember that facebook has been a great a force for good and a force of a thing and just because it's failing in  Us and in europe because it's losing touch with what people really want  It's also absolutely huge in other parts of the world people need it south america and africa and people rely on it. I agree asia  Yeah, it's not an easy answer. Yeah  one of the things I want to say to people who are watching is don't get bunkered just because you're a european or  you're a u.s citizen start thinking globally instead of regionally and  Just because you don't like it in the in the in terms of the context that you live in in the u.s or in europe  Doesn't mean it's not huge somewhere else.

Oh, thank you  And greg ferro is also here from the packet pushers network a great podcast network for people who love  The network packet pushers dot net at ethereal mind on the twitter I show today brought to you by wassabi hot cloud  storage  Being able to efficiently and affordably store data  and man data is  Crazy these days. There's an estimated  163 zettabytes of data by 2025 being able to store that data efficiently and affordably is critical for businesses  Companies need to store it in the cloud. But of course there's concerns  Wasabi addresses these concerns because it has disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear  This revolutionary process lays data on disk sequentially as opposed to in blocks  That means their storage wassabi storage is 80% cheaper  And six times faster than amazon s3  It's incredibly simple. There's just one tier of service and some of the things you get things like unlimited free egress  No charge for api calls and one of my favorite features  Immutable storage. These are things  I love immutable storage means you can you can say hey that stuff I just put there that can't be changed  No malware can change it. No  fumble-fingered  Employee can delete it. That's immutable  11 nines data durability and up to six times faster than aws what?  It's just as secure and in fact in I would say in most cases more secure than your on-prem storage  HIPAA compliant finra compliant cjis compliant and if you do have a ton of data to migrate  Get the wassabi ball. You can just put it on the ball send it to wassabi  You can migrate petabytes of data simply quickly and securely  Look, I understand this is a new name and a new company. You don't know them  I just want you to put them on that list if you're shopping for cloud storage and you got the big three on there  And I I know you do  Just add one more and i'll tell you what the boss might really be thrilled when you say hey boss 80  Cheaper and six times faster. You could try it right now free for 30 days  If you go to the website, you'll see it's a terabyte of data. But if you use the offer code twit, it's unlimited  There's no limit store it all up there. See how it works. See how fast it is  Wasabi.com if you're a business and you need to put your stuff in the cloud and you do it fast affordably  You got to check them out. Wasabi.com  Six times faster than s3  one fifth the price  You're gonna love it wassabi.com just add them to the list check it out. That's all we ask use the offer code twit for  Free unlimited storage for a month at wassabi  wassabi.com  Google is going to the supreme  Court, I think this is an important case. So I wanted to highlight it. You may remember they lost  The oracle suit over java. It wasn't about using java. It was about whether  an api  Can be copyrighted whether somebody can take for instance the java api and duplicate it  Google petitioned the supreme court saying you've got to review this here's their argument unless the supreme court corrects  These twin reversals this case will end developers traditional ability to freely use  Existing software interfaces apis to build new generations of computer programs for consumers  Did I just mention wassabi uses the s3 api? Yeah amazon probably doesn't like it, but an api is public  That's the whole point of an api and that's good for everybody  Just like we all learn to use google rights computer keyboard shortcuts developers have learned to use the many standard interfaces  By the way, this is them explaining to justices that average 83 years old  What an api is  Developers have used learned to use the many standard interfaces associated with different programming languages  Letting these reversals stand would effectively lock developers into the platform of a single copyright holder in this case oracle  Akinda saying that keyboard shortcuts can only work with one type of computer. Is that an apt description greg farrow?  And are they right?

Transcript:  I think so  I think in this case oracle's lawyers got one over google's lawyers and managed to get away with it  Oracle, of course was defending its java and the control of the java ecosystem at the time  Android was written in java and oracle wanted to extract some money from google  Um  And oracle knows how to play these games. They're incredibly smart about this and have really good lawyers  um, and in this case, I think that they got  Um got one over google and google has to do this  I think not just for itself but for the internet at large because if they lose this  Then they can't actually read my website and scan for search data, right?

Transcript:  I remember we interviewed jonathan schwarz the last ceo of sun  Uh on triangulation you can go back and look at it and he was talking about  the day  Sun was sold to oracle and at that time oracle acquired, of course, not only sun's assets, but java  And he said I remember sitting in the room and the lawyers the oracle lawyers the oracle negotiators  They were rubbing their hands  With glee because they knew they were acquiring  Technologies that they could make a lot of money on in court  Yeah, that was that was what they were excited about they weren't excited about what sun's technologies were they were excited about the licenses  They were excited about  the lawsuits

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the trick here is that uh, every website is fundamentally an api when you request a htdp request  And you can make a case that  Pulling htdp request from a website is an api call and the original idea behind htp was heading in that direction  And if you can patent that and take control of the whole idea that an api is controllable then  In theory large parts of the web suddenly stopped working and it would be very bad  For change. I wouldn't call it innovation copying someone else's api is not an innovation  That's just copying somebody else's api and then putting your own technology underneath that api  We need that competitively. We don't want to have a monopoly. So we know for example, uh, facebook is a monopoly  Of that particular space. It's very difficult for anybody to compete with facebook because of the network effect  If we have api is dominated then competitors will find it very difficult to enter the space and capitalism and competition which is  A part of a modern society then gets stifled and that's why I think it's important

Transcript:  I think I overestimated the average age of the supreme court. I think it's actually thanks to  Brett cavanaugh replacing, um justice roberts  Uh somewhere around 64 now, so it's a little better than it was but imagine the difficulty  It's bad enough to explaining a lower court what an api is and why this is an issue  But imagine the difficulty explaining to the supreme court
